        "file_text": "I would like to begin by \nextending my warmest congratulations to the President \non his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its current session. I also take this \nopportunity to place on record our sincere appreciation \nof Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for his efforts \nand leadership during the sixty-third session. I wish as \nwell to commend the Secretary-General for his \ncomprehensive report on the work of the Organization \nand for his tireless efforts and dedication in the cause \nof international peace and security. \n The current financial and economic crisis \naffecting many countries around the globe, particularly \nin the West, has reached the shores of Africa. \nOriginating in the West, the uncontrolled banking and \nmortgage crisis, arising from over-leveraged subprime \nlending schemes, burst into the open, destroying the \nliquidity and survivability of many institutions in the \ndeveloped countries. \n It was thought that, since Africa was not a player \nin this sector, its financial institutions and its \neconomies would escape more or less unscathed. Such \nwas not to be; African difficulties have been \ncompounded. This crisis follows on the heels of the \nfood and energy crises and the challenges posed by the \nimpacts of climate change. The severity of the crisis on \npoor countries cannot be underestimated. Poor \ncountries have no choice but to work hard to restore \nstrong growth and recover lost ground in order to move \ntowards internationally agreed development goals. In \nthis respect, it must be emphasized that the global \n \n \n15 09-53165 \n \ncrisis cannot be an excuse to avoid fulfilling existing \ninternational aid commitments. In addition to timely \ndelivery, flexibility of resources and predictability, it is \ncritical that the aid be effective. Developing countries \nneed access to new funding, including credit and \nliquidity facilities, infrastructure investment and \nsupport for domestic financial systems. \n Members of the General Assembly are by now \naware of the tense standoff that prevails in the northern \npart of my country, following the unwarranted and \ndeliberately provocative incursion and occupation by \nEritrean forces of Djibouti\u2019s sovereign territory at the \nbeginning of last year, 2008. This wholly reckless \naction by Eritrea, a neighbour, provoked a mutual \nmilitary build-up, leading to serious clashes between \nthe two forces. In particular, the clashes of 10 to \n12 June 2008 resulted in many deaths, countless \nwounded and prisoners taken on both sides, and this \nmerits a special note. \n My country embarked upon a calm and prudent \npolicy that deliberately allowed sufficient time for the \npossibility of comprehensive bilateral contacts at every \nlevel in order to resolve hostilities amicably and \npeacefully. Our efforts fell consistently on deaf ears, \naccompanied by rebuffs, blatant denials, and \ndismissive and condescending utterances. Regional \norganizations, heads of State and Government, and the \nUnited Nations have all attempted to initiate dialogue; \nthese efforts have gone for naught with Eritrea, which, \nin its usual brazen manner, has gone so far as to deny \neven the existence of any tension in the area, despite \nthe clear, far-reaching and unmistakable conclusions of \nthe United Nations fact-finding mission. Indeed, the \nmission\u2019s report represents a damning indictment of the \nregime\u2019s deceptive and erratic behaviour. \n The Security Council has consistently condemned \nEritrea\u2019s forceful occupation of my country\u2019s territory, \nnamely, Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island, and in \nresolution 1862 (2009) of 14 January 2009, demanded, \ninter alia, that Eritrea withdraw its forces and all their \nmilitary hardware to the status quo ante; acknowledge \nits border dispute with Djibouti; engage actively in \ndialogue to defuse the tension and in diplomatic efforts \nleading to a mutually acceptable settlement; and to \nabide by its obligations as a Member of the United \nNations. \n The resolution required Eritrea to comply \nimmediately, and, in any case no later than five weeks \nafter the resolution\u2019s adoption date of 14 January. \nEritrea, however, rejected the resolution the next day. \nThere the matter has essentially remained, in the light \nof the series of requests made by the Secretariat for \nmore time to pursue contacts, particularly with the \nEritrean authorities. As everyone now realizes, it is a \nfutile exercise to seek a credible response from Eritrea, \nwhose intentions have always been to procrastinate on \nvarious pretexts while firmly entrenching itself in the \noccupied territory. \n As Djibouti has repeatedly stated, the occupied \nareas of Ras Doumeira hill, which overlooks the \nBab-El-Mandeb strait, and Doumeira Island, which is \nin the same Red Sea area, are situated in one of the \nbusiest shipping lanes in the world. The militarization \nof this key strategic maritime route does not augur well \nfor peace in the region or for international shipping and \ninvestment. \n The dispute between Eritrea and Djibouti must \nnot be allowed to fester any longer. It must be resolved \nalong the lines of Security Council resolution 1862 \n(2009) without further equivocation, confusion or \ndeliberate procrastination. Inaction sets a dangerous \nprecedent that others will surely follow in the future: \ndeny and refuse to cooperate. The Council must not \nappear to be appeasing Eritrea indefinitely. It is a \ndangerous and an unpredictable regime that so far has \nnot shown any respect for international norms and \nbehaviour. The Council must act now, using all means \nat its disposal. \n Once again, the situation in Somalia is tense, \ntenuous and unpredictable. Somalia\u2019s plight is \nsickening, hopeless and disgusting, to say the least. \nHere we have a transitional Government that enjoys the \nfull backing of the international community. Yet \nparadoxically, that same entity is woefully lacking the \nmoney and manpower that would enable it to confront \nthe deadly insurrection that has paralysed the whole \ncountry. Mogadishu, the capital, is essentially a war \nzone. Most of its civilian population has been \ndisplaced, having fled the never-ending anarchy, \nabuses, impunity and other egregious crimes against \nhumanity. The collateral damage to the civilian \npopulation is horrendous \u2014 in short, unquantifiable. \nCoupled with that, the Somali people are facing an \nextreme drought that threatens a widespread food \nshortage and starvation, which would necessitate major \ninternational emergency food aid. \n \n \n09-53165 16 \n \n The presence of African Union peacekeepers has \nbeen a major factor in keeping the transitional \nGovernment in power, but they are continuously under \nattack, and the need for more troops, as well as for the \ntraining and equipping of sufficient Somali forces, \ncannot be overemphasized. Indeed, there is tremendous \ngoodwill towards the current Transitional Federal \nGovernment, in particular towards Sheikh Sharif \nSheikh Ahmed, the current President, who enjoys both \ntrust and international credibility. Unfortunately, that \nhas not been matched by a commensurate support in \nterms of resource flows consistent with the promises \nand pledges made to the Government. Resources make \nthe difference in the outcome of hostilities.  \n All the same, life in Somalia goes on, and with \nresources that country would be able to start addressing \nthe critical urgent problems and issues of security, \ngovernance and job creation. Addressing the terrible \ndrought now battering the country and crippling its \nalready low food stock is a top priority. We must all \nfulfil our obligations to enable the Government to \nfunction. No doubt that is a tall order, but that is what \nit takes and that is the challenge that we all have to \nconfront.  \n We are well aware of the flow of arms, resources \nand foreign fighters into Somalia and of the threat that \nAl-Qaida might establish a beachhead there. One can \nsay that the time has come for all well-meaning \nSomalis, as well as peoples and Governments of \ngoodwill everywhere, to step forward in order to create \na lasting and stable environment for the people of \nSomalia. We owe that to the people of Somalia. \n The stage appears set for dramatic developments \nin the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, \nwhich is by far the longest occupation in modern times. \nAs we all know, the United Nations Fact-Finding \nMission investigating last winter\u2019s three-week war in \nGaza has issued its report. While both the Israelis and \nthe Palestinians were strongly criticized, the \ncondemnation of Israel by a United Nations body was \nunprecedented, stating that the result was \n \u201ca deliberately disproportionate attack designed \nto punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian \npopulation, radically diminish its local economic \ncapacity both to work and provide for itself, and \nto force upon it an ever increasing sense of \ndependency and vulnerability\u201d. (A/HRC/12/48, \npara. 1893) \n The peace process is frozen and there is no hope \nin sight of jump-starting it soon, as the new Israeli \nGovernment is intent on pursuing its business-as-usual \npolicy of more settlements and refusal to engage in a \nprocess that addresses the final status issues. \n My country is keen to have peace and security \nsoon restored in the northern part of the sisterly nation \nof Yemen, within the framework of its territorial \nintegrity, sovereignty and unity. \n One cannot fail to notice the number of countries \nthat have raised the issue of the representation on and \ncomposition of the Security Council. It is undeniable \nthat we are in a different world from that which existed \nin the aftermath of the Second World War. Given the \ncritical need to have a global body capable of \naddressing, in some manner, the challenges of an \nevolving international landscape, the issue is of \nconcern to many countries. For the United Nations to \nretain its credibility and authority, it must continue to \nbe relevant. New norms have risen, while whole \ncontinents lack permanent representation, let alone the \npower of the veto. \n Once again, it must be said that Africa, the \ncontinent with the largest number of countries, needs to \nhave a permanent voice in the conduct of world affairs. \nWe see no reason to change our position, which we \nnoted in 2007, that Africa seeks no fewer than two \npermanent seats, with all the prerogatives and \nprivileges of a permanent member, including the right \nof the veto, in addition to five non-permanent seats. Of \nlate, things have been changing for the better in much \nof Africa, but the current disastrous international \neconomic crisis was not of our making, as is true for \nthe fallout from global warming. They and other crises \nunderscore the urgency of our meaningful involvement \nin the United Nations and in world affairs. Permanent \nseats and increased membership on the Security \nCouncil would be in keeping with those growing \ninternational demands. \n Time and space do not allow us to consider in any \ndepth a number of other critical issues confronting \ndeveloping countries. There should be some mention, \nhowever, of the harm to countries\u2019 trade and \ndevelopment stemming from the protective tariffs of \nthe industrialized West. The effort to provide subsidies \nfor a few large farming operations, blocking \ncompetition from farmers of the developing world, \nonly hurts the latter. Perhaps cotton is a good example. \n \n \n17 09-53165 \n \n There is also the stalemate in the Doha Round \ntrade talks. Those discussions must reopen in earnest, \nwith the commitment to reach a satisfactory \nconclusion. Lastly, we need to highlight the concern \nregarding the Millennium Development Goals and the \nlikelihood that they will not be achieved by 2015 in \nmost countries. In sum, that is tragic for so many lives. \nEfforts must therefore increase towards mitigating that \ntrend. \n In conclusion, I wish, on behalf of my \nGovernment and the people of Djibouti, to express our \nheartfelt sorrow and profound condolences to the \nbereaved families and to the Government and the \npeople of the Philippines for the torrential rains and \nheavy flooding that caused havoc and unprecedented \ndisruption of lives and destroyed infrastructure.

        "file_text": "Today, \nspeaking from this high rostrum, I would like to \nhighlight five topics that are, in my view, important to \nall of us and our common approaches to the \ninternational agenda. \n The first is the timing of this meeting and the \nmoment that humankind is currently experiencing. This \nsession of the General Assembly is taking place at a \nvery critical and complex time. It can be said without \nexaggeration that we are living through one of the \nwatershed moments of modern history. Besides the \neconomic crisis \u2014 the first large-scale crisis of the era \nof globalization \u2014 global development as a whole \ncontinues to be threatened by regional and local \nconflicts, terrorism, cross-border crime, food shortages \nand climate change. The impact of the crisis continues \nto be felt by most countries of the world. Although so \nfar we have been able, it seems, to avoid the very worst \nscenarios, the question remains: how to overcome the \nhuge imbalances and deficits \u2014 amounting to trillions \nof dollars \u2014 accumulated in the global and national \neconomies. \n Our collective agenda for unification has been \ndictated by life itself, which also dictates the growing \nneed for the United Nations as a time-tested \nmechanism for harmonizing the interests of different \nStates and peoples. As never before, we are feeling the \nneed for informal collective leadership and for an \nincreased role for such platforms as the G-8 and the \nmore recent G-20, as well as other negotiation and \nmediation forums, and all the more because these \noperate not on a model of opposition, but rather to \nadvance the converging interests of their participants. \n At this morning\u2019s meeting, the President of the \nUnited States addressed this Assembly, and I would \nlike to endorse one of the thoughts he voiced. He stated \nthat no single country can or should attempt to \ndominate others, and that is absolutely true. However, \nthese agreed approaches need to be implemented in \nsome way, including through the United Nations \nsystem. \n Another distinctive feature of modern times is the \nincreasing role of regional entities, which are growing \nmore active on every continent. This trend is entirely \nconsistent with the principles of the United Nations. \nRussia, for its part \u2014 together with its partners in the \nCommonwealth of Independent States, in the \nframework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, \nand with its fellow BRIC countries Brazil, India and \nChina \u2014 will continue to bolster the mechanisms of \nregional interaction. These mechanisms facilitate a \ncollective response to common threats, while \nmitigating the consequences of the crisis for our \ncitizens and increasing the sustainability of our \nnational economies. \n Secondly, I want to touch on the issue of existing \nproblems. Allow me to dwell on those that cannot be \neffectively addressed without the participation or \noutside the framework of the United Nations. The first \ntask in this regard is to address the imbalance of \nexisting mechanisms of global economic governance, \nthe inadequacy of their rules of the game, and the \nchasm between the financial markets and the real \neconomy. We need to make joint efforts to establish \nfinancial and economic models that will protect all of \nus from such turmoil in the future. \n Virtually all countries have seen a drop in output \nand in the standards of living of millions of their \n \n \n17 09-52228 \n \ncitizens. The crisis has exacerbated social problems, \npainfully tested young people at the very start of their \nlives, and caused significant growth in unemployment \nin all countries. Russia is no exception in this. \n A painful blow has been delivered to our plans to \nalleviate poverty. A real threat of disruption of the \nMillennium Development Goals has emerged. We must \ndo our utmost to prevent such a development. Donor \nassistance to countries in need cannot be postponed \nuntil some other time. The tasks set out as a priority by \nthe international community must absolutely be \naddressed. The arrangements adopted at the G-20 \nsummits and the United Nations Conference on the \nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \nDevelopment must be implemented \u2014 and they must \nbe implemented within the deadlines that we ourselves \nset. \n The second major task in this context is to \naddress the issues of global energy security. Three \nyears ago at the Saint Petersburg G-8 summit in \nRussia, the principles for a new legal framework for \nsuch cooperation were formulated. The goal is to \nharmonize the interests of all participants in the energy \nchain: suppliers, consumers and intermediaries or \ntransiters. It was not so long ago that we solidified \nthese principles, and we invite all States to engage in \ndiscussion on them. We believe that such discussions \nshould be conducted with the active involvement of \nspecialized multilateral institutions, including, of \ncourse, the agencies of the United Nations family. \n The third task that Russia deems to be potentially \ncritical is the comprehensive strengthening of the \nUnited Nations itself. The United Nations must adapt \nitself in a rational way to the new global realities. It \nshould strengthen its influence while preserving its \nmultinational nature and the integrity of the Charter\u2019s \nkey provisions. The most important component of the \nrevitalization of the United Nations is reform of the \nSecurity Council. The time has come to speed up the \nsearch for a compromise formula for the Security \nCouncil\u2019s expansion, and of course to increase its \nefficiency. \n The third issue I want to touch on is \ndisarmament. The process of multilateral disarmament \nunder United Nations auspices is an extremely \nimportant task. There are grounds for hope since, as \nmembers are aware, a number of positive trends have \nemerged in overcoming the protracted crisis. The \nConference on Disarmament in Geneva has adopted its \nprogramme of work. I should also like to mention the \nRussian-Chinese initiative to develop a treaty to \nprevent the deployment of weapons in outer space, as \nwell as our current proposal to universalize the \nRussian-American Treaty on the Elimination of \nIntermediate-range and Shorter-range Missiles. \n Russia will unswervingly follow the path of \nverifiable and irreversible reductions in nuclear \nweapons as an essential element of a new start in our \nrelations with the United States. In Moscow in July this \nyear, President Obama and I not only signed a relevant \ndocument, but also agreed on a mandate for further \nnegotiations to elaborate a new, legally binding treaty. \nThis treaty should replace the Treaty on the Reduction \nand Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, which \nexpires in December. \n Of special importance here is the relationship \nbetween strategic offensive and defensive arms. In my \nmeeting with President Obama this morning, we \ndiscussed the recently announced adjustments to the \nUnited States\u2019 planned development of a missile \ndefence system. I should like to state in this highest of \nforums that we view this decision as a constructive step \nin the right direction, which has deservedly received \nnumerous expressions of support from the international \ncommunity. Russia is ready to engage in detailed \ndiscussions with the American side and to undertake \nrelevant initiatives in this field in order to reach \nmutually acceptable agreement. \n Without resolving such problems as missile \ndefence and non-nuclear strategic offensive arms, it \nwill be simply impossible to achieve real progress in \nthe field of nuclear disarmament. I believe that the \nwork on this new treaty will be fully consistent with \nrelevant provisions of the joint document endorsed by \nthe President of the United States and myself at our \nmeeting in Moscow. \n We believe that other nuclear States should join \nthe disarmament efforts of Russia and the United \nStates. There is no need to wait for further progress in \nthe Russian-American disarmament process. We can \nbegin forthwith to elaborate acceptable and practical \narrangements that take into account the differences in \nthe size of potentials. In that respect, we could draw on \ninternational experience in the twentieth century, for \nexample the 1921-1922 Washington Conference on \nnaval armaments, where participants agreed on the \n  \n \n09-52228 18 \n \nmaximum size of their fleets without insisting on parity \nin absolute terms. If we take the same approach today, \nbased on the current status of nuclear arsenals, we \ncould send the rest of the world a sure signal that the \nunaccounted numbers will be added to the equation of \nstrategic stability. \n Pursuing nuclear disarmament, strengthening the \nnuclear non-proliferation regime and promoting the \npeaceful use of nuclear energy will be at the very heart \nof the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \n(NPT). We cherish the hope that it will be successful. \n The global nuclear security summit scheduled for \nApril 2010 will provide a good opportunity for a more \ndetailed discussion of these issues. We support that \ninitiative. We have also agreed with the United States \nAdministration on joint steps for further progress on \nsuch aspects of nuclear security as the prevention of \nnuclear terrorism, expanding access to the benefits of \npeaceful nuclear energy to all signatories implementing \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons in good faith, and other decisions. We call for \ncollective cooperation on these matters. \n In order to reach a common understanding on \nsuch important issues, we must engage all nations  \nand influential international organizations in the \naforementioned negotiation processes. The international \ncommunity, it must be said, has at its disposal such \ntried and tested measures for enhancing regional and \ninternational security as nuclear-weapon-free zones. In \nparticular, there is a very pressing need to establish a \nzone in the Middle East free of all types of weapons of \nmass destruction and their means of delivery. This is a \nlong-standing issue, with respect to which a resolution \nwas adopted at the 1995 NPT Review Conference. \n Russia, as a member of the Quartet of \ninternational mediators on the Middle East settlement, \nhas consistently supported efforts to strengthen the \nnuclear non-proliferation regime in the Middle East. \nRussia has made specific proposals within the \nframework of the NPT review process to seek mutually \nacceptable ways of implementing earlier decisions on \nthis matter. All countries of the region need to take an \nactive stance on this issue and demonstrate their \nwillingness to achieve that end. \n We also need to accelerate work towards a \nmechanism to ensure peace and security in North-East \nAsia. Russia has made proposals in this regard to the \nparticipants in the Six-Party Talks. In the present \ncircumstances, this task is more urgent than ever. \n The fourth topic I wish to address is that of \nregional conflicts and regional security. We intend to \ncontinue to participate in the search for effective \noptions for settling regional conflicts. We are \nconvinced that the use of force can only exacerbate \nsuch situations. That was demonstrated by the reckless \nattempt by the Georgian authorities last year to resolve \nthe problems in their relations with South Ossetia by \nmilitary means. \n At that time, in August 2008, we came very close \nto a situation in which a local armed conflict had the \npotential to grow into a full-scale war. I am certain that \nthis is clearly understood by everyone in this Hall \ntoday. In order to ensure that this should never recur, \nwe need clear and effective mechanisms to implement \nthe principle of the indivisibility of security. Without \nsuch a mechanism, we will not be able to move beyond \nthe legacy of the past or overcome existing prejudices. \nI wish to stress that irresponsible regimes should not \nhave any opportunity whatsoever to foment disputes \namong other countries. \n The role and place of the modern nation in \nensuring global security is a topic of the greatest \nrelevance today. We have witnessed situations time and \nagain in which problems emerging within the confines \nof an individual State have acquired a regional or even \nglobal character. The incompetence and, very often, \nineffectiveness of national Government institutions can \nhave consequences that are fraught with risks for \nseveral countries. The prevention of such an outcome \nis of course a very complex and sensitive issue, but one \nupon which we must deliberate together. \n These issues were the focus of discussions at a \nrecent conference held in Russia. The outcome was \nquite clear. What we require in the future is a smart \nforeign policy. The current global crisis is not limited \nto economics; it is also a crisis of ideas. It is the \naccumulation of a critical mass of outdated policies \nand development models. \n Having developed the initiative to sign a new \nEuropean security treaty, Russia has proposed taking a \nfresh approach to this problem and, above all, \nabandoning outdated policies. We all hope that the cold \nwar has been left behind, but the world has not become \nmore secure. What we need today are modern solutions \nand clear legal frameworks for implementing existing \n \n \n19 09-52228 \n \npolitical commitments. We do not need declarations, \nappeals or demagogues; what we need are clear legal \nframeworks, including to enshrine the principle under \ninternational law that one must not seek to ensure one\u2019s \nown security at the expense of the security of others. \n Our initiative concerns the Euro-Atlantic space. \nHowever, its key provision on the indivisibility of \nsecurity is a universal principle that is applicable to all \nregions of the world and is fully consistent with the \nletter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. The \nprinciple of the indivisibility of security should be an \nintegral part of current international law. \n Values are the last issue that I wish to mention \nfrom this rostrum. The protection of human rights and \ninterests and the universal application of commonly \nrecognized norms and principles in that area should be \nthe basis for strengthening trust and stability in \ninternational relations. We are all united by values that \nare rooted in morality, religion, customs and traditions. \nI am talking about such fundamental concepts as the \nright to life, tolerance of dissent, responsibility towards \none\u2019s family, charity and compassion, which are the \nfoundation both of daily life and of relations among \nStates. \n However, unfortunately, it is the reality that the \nworld is witnessing growing nationalism and numerous \nmanifestations of religious intolerance and hatred. That \nis why we believe that establishing a high-level group \non interfaith dialogue under the Director-General of \nUNESCO is extremely valuable. It is particularly \nrelevant on the eve of 2010, which the United Nations \nhas declared International Year for the Rapprochement \nof Cultures. \n To conclude, I cannot fail to mention, as I stand \nhere, another topic that is very close to the heart of all \ncitizens of our country and all peoples of the world. \nNext year, we are going to celebrate the sixty-fifth \nanniversary of the end of the Second World War. \nRussia put forward a proposal to adopt a relevant \nGeneral Assembly resolution and to hold a special \nsession to commemorate all victims of that war in May \nnext year. We cannot allow its horrible lessons to be \nforgotten. \n However, from time to time we see neo-fascist \norganizations raise their heads. Racial, national and \nethnic crimes are being committed. Attempts are being \nmade to whitewash Nazism, to deny the Holocaust and \nto review the decisions of the Nuremberg Tribunal. I \nam convinced that strong and joint resistance to \nmanifestations of neo-Nazism and to attempts to revise \nthe results of the Second World War enshrined in the \nUnited Nations Charter should remain a priority task of \nthe Organization. \n The creation of the United Nations was one of the \nprincipal achievements of the international community \nin the twentieth century. This Organization and its \nfruitful activities have become a symbol of the \ntwentieth century, and there is simply no alternative to \nthese activities. We have no right to forget that the \nUnited Nations possesses unique international \nlegitimacy, and we all must preserve and strengthen \nthis shared wealth of the peoples of the world. \n"

        "file_text": "\nOnce again, we meet at the United Nations to share \nconcerns, problems and experiences and to discuss the \nvarious ways in which we can serve our peoples \nworldwide. \n Since this morning I have listened closely to \nstatements, starting with that of the Secretary-\nGeneral \u2014 to whom I offer a special, revolutionary \ngreeting \u2014 until this moment, when we just heard the \nPresident of Iran. In all of these statements, there has \nbeen great convergence on problems such as the \nfinancial crisis, problems arising from the \nenvironmental crisis and problems concerning stability \nand institutionalization of democracies in a number of \ncountries. There have also been ideas and proposals \nsuch as those offered by the Secretary-General, who \ncalled for unity among Presidents and unity within the \nUnited Nations. I fully agree that it is important that \nwe Presidents and Governments unite to meet the \ndemands of our peoples, in order to resolve these \ncrises.  \n I would say that in my country the crises have \nbeen imposed from above and from outside. We need \nunity within the United Nations for the sake of the \nequality of our peoples; we need unity for dignity; we \nneed unity above all to tackle the deep economic \ndivergences, the deep asymmetries between continents, \nbetween families and between countries. But it must be \nunity in a context of complementarity, in order to meet \nour peoples\u2019 demands.  \n There is an ongoing debate on the financial crisis \nand on climate change, as well as on the problems of \ndemocracy and the energy and food crises. I welcome a \nnumber of the statements that addressed and focused \non the origins of this crisis. But the majority of \nPresidents and the majority of the statements referred \nonly to the effects, not to the causes.  \n I would like to speak frankly to the Assembly \u2014 \nmy listeners here, and to all others who are following \nthe debates taking place in this global forum. I would \nlike to say that the origin of these crises was the \nunbridled accumulation of capital in a few hands, the \nirretrievable looting of natural resources and the \ncommercialization of Mother Earth. And above all, I \nbelieve their origin lies in an economic model, an \neconomic system, namely, capitalism.  \n If we do not tell our peoples the truth about the \norigin of this crisis, then we will be misleading \nourselves and the international community too. We will \nbe misleading our peoples, who have great \nexpectations of their Presidents and Governments and \nof forums such as this one.  \n Although we are promoting and seeking peace, in \nthe light of our experience, we know that we will not \nfind social peace while there is economic inequality, \nand all the less when there are military bases in some \ncountries. These may be located on many continents, \nincluding Latin America and South America. How can \nwe hold discussions when United States military bases \nprovoke distrust among peoples?  \n I would like to briefly tell the Assembly that I \nwas a victim of the military bases operating in my \ncountry before assuming the presidency, before the \nsocial movements were not merely opposed to policies \nbut also actors in a new country of equality and social \njustice. All of us were victims of the United States \nmilitary presence in Bolivia, and as victims we know \nwhat uniformed armed United States personnel can do \nin South American countries. For that reason, I would \nlike to say that when there is a United States military \nbase, particularly in Latin America \u2014 I do not know \nabout their conduct in Europe or on other continents, \nbut in Latin America, the presence of military bases is \nno guarantee of social peace or of democracy. \nCertainly, it cannot guarantee the integration of our \ncountries, much less of the peoples who are seeking to \nbring about deep-wrought changes in our social, \neconomic and cultural structures.  \n  \n \n09-52228 38 \n \n Now we have Honduras. If there is a United \nStates military base in Honduras, why can this military \nbase not guarantee democracy? It cannot because there \nare Presidents who change these countries, which are \nconstantly threatened by military bases. \n I hail the courage of our colleague, President \nZelaya of Honduras, who is democratically and \npacifically resisting with the aim of restoring \ndemocracy. My respect and admiration go to him as he \nstrives together with his defiant people to uphold \ndemocracy. How good it would be if the United \nNations, this great international organization, were to \nadopt a resolution issuing an ultimatum to the military \ndictatorship in Honduras to withdraw and restore the \nonly internationally recognized President. \n I am convinced that the United States Southern \nCommand does not accept Latin American countries or \ntheir Presidents that are seeking liberation. I have even \nheard from some friends, comrades and brothers that \nthey supported the dictatorships in Bolivia and \nelsewhere in Latin America. They say that the only \nreason there has been no coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the United \nStates is that there is no United States Embassy in the \nUnited States. There are coups d\u2019\u00e9tat occurring \neverywhere, but let me say that in September last year \nthere was an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Bolivia, and \nthanks to the union forces and the involvement of the \ninternational community, particularly from the southern \ncone, we were able to halt that civilian \u2014 not \nmilitary \u2014 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.  \n For these reasons, we are convinced that military \nbases cannot guarantee democracy, integration or \nsocial peace.  \n We have also been discussing the subject of \nclimate change, and I would like to take this \nopportunity to propose a number of issues to the \nAssembly which are of the utmost importance for all of \nus who inhabit Mother Earth. For the indigenous \nmovement, this is Mother Earth \u2014 or, for many others, \nplanet Earth or the environment. For those of us who \nlive in harmony with Mother Earth, not just in harmony \nwith human beings, Mother Earth is something sacred. \nIt is Mother Earth which gives life, which provides \nwater, natural resources, oxygen. We all promote the \nwell-being of our peoples. We are struggling and \nfighting and working for the well-being of our peoples, \nbut first of all, we must ensure the well-being of \nMother Earth. \n If we cannot guarantee the well-being of Mother \nEarth, then it will be impossible to guarantee the well-\nbeing of our countrymen or of all the peoples on planet \nEarth. I have reached the conclusion that Mother \nEarth \u2014 or planet Earth \u2014 can and will exist forever \nwith or without human life. But human life cannot \nexist without planet Earth \u2014 Mother Earth. \n After having listened to many statements and \nafter having listened to my brothers, I have reached the \nconclusion that at this point in time, in this new \ntwenty-first century, it will be more important than \never before to defend the rights of Mother Earth than to \ndefend human rights. \n If we do not protect the rights of Mother Earth, \nthere will be no point in defending human rights. I am \nprepared to discuss this concept, and sooner or later \neveryone will understand why it is so important to \ndefend the rights of Mother Earth. \n As we are currently discussing climate change, I \npropose to Presidents, representatives and all our other \nbrothers and sisters who are listening throughout the \nworld our very simple, three-point proposal.  \n First, the developed countries must acknowledge \nand pay the climate debt that they and all humankind \nowe Planet Earth. \n Secondly, a court for climate justice must be \nestablished to try and to punish those who fail to meet \ntheir commitments and those who continue to damage \nPlanet Earth. We need a structure that can quantify the \ndamage caused by some countries and transnational \ncompanies, and therefore it is important that such a \ncourt for climate justice be established. \n The third proposal is one of those that have been \ndeveloped above all by rural and indigenous \nmovements: the United Nations must draw up a \ndeclaration of the rights of Mother Earth, in order to \ndefend the right to life, the right to the regeneration of \nbio-capacity, the right to a clean life and the right to \nharmony and the coexistence of us all. \n I hope that these proposals will be taken into \naccount during the discussions in Copenhagen. We also \nhope that Copenhagen will provide a grand solution to \nresolve the serious problems that affect us all, in all the \ncountries of the world. \n I also take this opportunity to take up some of the \nproposals made by a number of Presidents. If we want \n \n \n39 09-52228 \n \nto change the world, we must first change the United \nNations. If we want to effect change in our countries, \nseeking equality and dignity for our compatriots, why \nnot first change the structures of the United Nations? \n Listening to what many other Presidents said \nabout the Security Council, I felt that there were many \npoints of agreement. We need a real democratization of \nthe United Nations, for which I make the following \nsuggestions. \n The status of permanent membership of the \nSecurity Council and the right to veto must be \nabolished. It is not possible in the twenty-first century \nto maintain outdated totalitarian practices going back \nto the time of monarchies. All countries must have the \nsame rights within the United Nations. Those who \nproclaim themselves to be the leaders of democracy \nshould give up their privileges and accept true \ndemocratization of the Security Council. We must be \nresponsible with democracy and begin to democratize \nthe United Nations. \n I shall soon end my short intervention, as I do not \nwish to exceed my time limit, in keeping with the \ndiscipline that our peoples teach us. But first I am sorry \nto have state a truth that may upset the Government of \nthe United States. I had great hopes of President \nObama. I welcome his closure of Guantanamo, which \nrepresents progress. But in addition the economic \nblockade of Cuba should be ended. That is my \nrespectful request to the Government and people of the \nUnited States. \n Bolivia, like Latin America as a whole, used to \nenjoy certain tariff preferences, but under ex-President \nBush they were removed, because we were accused of \nnot combating drug-trafficking and poverty. We know \nthat that was a political decision, but ex-President Bush \nnever took into account Bolivian norms or our \nConstitution.  \n Now, under President Obama\u2019s Government, we \nsee documents which include references to our new \nConstitution, which, for the first time in the 183 years\u2019 \nexistence of the Republic, was approved by a vote of \nthe Bolivian people. There is a reference to article 56 \nand respect for private property. That strikes me as \ndirect interference by the United States Government in \nthe Constitution and other norms and standards, and I \nroundly reject it. What we want is diplomatic relations \nnot of interference, but of cooperation and investment. \nWhile the new Constitution for the first time \nguarantees private property and State property, \nfundamentally it guarantees collective property \u2014 \nproperty held by associations and cooperatives, and \ncommunal lands belonging to the indigenous, native \nmovement. \n In addition, an accusation is made against me in a \nUnited States report stating that current challenges \ninclude the explicit acceptance and encouragement of \ncoca production at the highest levels of the Bolivian \nGovernment. That is to say that I encourage the \ncultivation of coca. It should be understood that \ngrowing the coca leaf is one thing and that cocaine is \nquite another. We do not defend cocaine; we shall fight \nit. Indeed, our proposal is zero cocaine. What I have \njust said does not mean having free cultivation of the \ncoca leaf, though in its natural state it is beneficial and \nhealthy for human life. \n We have launched a campaign on decriminalizing \nthe traditional consumption of the coca leaf. I \nguarantee that there will never be free cultivation of \ncoca, but neither will there a zero coca leaf policy. But \nthere is a zero cocaine policy. It cannot be said that I \nencourage coca cultivation in Bolivia. That is not true. \n The Assembly will know that I come from the \ntrade union and social movements, and that I was a \nunion leader. Now President, fortuitously and for the \ntime being, I am extremely concerned that it is said \nthat the Government will dismantle the union \nmovement by decree. How could I eliminate the \nunions, when they and the social movements are the \nbackbone of the Evo Morales Government? I have built \nunion headquarters and encouraged unions, workers \nand indigenous peoples, and yet I am accused of \ndismantling the unions. \n President Obama may not be aware of the \ndocuments to which I have referred, which perhaps \ncome from the State Department. I perfectly \nunderstand that sometimes when change is desired it is \ndifficult to change State structures. But after reading \nthe documents very carefully I wonder how it is \npossible for someone who has suffered discrimination \nto discriminate against another. At least in Latin \nAmerica, the so-called Afro-Americans and \nAfro-Bolivians are the sectors most discriminated \nagainst in society, together with the so-called Indians \nor indigenous people. We are called \u201cnegroes\u201d and \n\u201cIndians\u201d. I do not understand how a black person who \nhas been discriminated against and excluded can \n  \n \n09-52228 40 \n \ndiscriminate against and exclude an Indian. It is a \nmatter of grave concern.  \n It is to be hoped that those historic errors can be \nrectified, not for the good of the President, and not just \nfor the good of Bolivians, but for the image of peoples, \nsuch as the people of the United States. I well \nunderstand that sometimes it is not easy to change \nstructures which may work against our peoples. \n Finally, I refer  to some historical demands, such \nas the return of our access to the sea. Our two peoples, \nour brother republics, Chile and Bolivia, feel sufficient \ntrust in each other to seek to resolve the issue of  \nmaritime access. I hope that it can be settled bilaterally. \nIf not, intervention by the international community will \nbe needed. Progress has been made. I feel that there is \ntrust, which is needed in order to resolve any problem. \nOtherwise, important steps must be taken. \n I thank my brothers and sisters for listening to \nme. I would like to continue to share their experience,  \nproposals and concerns for the good of mankind as a \nwhole."

        "file_text": "The United Nations is the only \nuniversal institution that unites us all as a global \ncommunity of independent States. At the very heart of \nthis indispensable Organization stands the General \nAssembly, the only place in the world where the \nsovereign voices of all countries are given an equal, \nlegitimate say in the future course of mankind. \n Safeguarding the principles of the United Nations \nCharter remains much more important than the policies \nof any single nation, especially during transformative \nperiods such as this. The international system seems to \nbe undergoing a paradigm shift that, in many ways, is \ncomparable in scope to those that occurred in 1945 and \n1989. \n No one is yet able to reliably predict how deep \nthe change will turn out to be. What is becoming \nevident is that interrelated factors \u2014 the most recent of \nwhich is the global economic crisis \u2014 have caused the \narrival of a new set of circumstances on the world \nstage. A broad repositioning appears to be taking place. \nThe global balance of power is shifting as new \nfinancial models compete for primacy. All in all, \ninternational relations are becoming less predictable.  \n Achieving consensus on fundamental issues that \naffect us all has never been more important. As United \nNations Member States, it is incumbent upon us to \nwork more closely together to reaffirm the rules that \ngovern the international system, to reinforce the \nterritorial integrity of Member States, to entrench \ninterdependence and to complete the transition from \nthe old order, based on political and economic \ndomination, to one established on equitable \ncooperation among all nations. \n That is the only way to build a future of global \npeace, stability and prosperity. It is the only way to \nenhance the dialogue among civilizations, to make \nmultilateralism more effective and to provide for \nsustainable development and eradicate poverty \nthroughout the world. And it is the only way to \neffectively fight terrorism and cross-border organized \ncrime and to promote nuclear disarmament. \n We must also work more in concert with one \nanother to combat the effects of climate change. That \n  \n \n09-52470 2 \n \nwill continue to be strongly emphasized over the \ncourse of Serbia\u2019s two-year presidency of the \nGoverning Council of the United Nations \nEnvironmental Programme. As part of our efforts, we \nhave proposed the establishment of a regional climate \nchange centre in Belgrade, Serbia. \n As a responsible global citizen, we have \nunderlined the necessity of agreeing on a fair and \nbalanced emissions reduction scheme and, in \nparticular, on a new comprehensive climate \nagreement \u2014 one that will secure eco-friendly \ninvestments, stimulate innovation and facilitate the \nglobal spread of technologies, knowledge and \nexperience.  \n In short, working towards a \u201cgreen economy\u201d \nwill decisively contribute to placing the whole world \nfirmly on the path towards a cleaner, more sustainable \npath. \n How we conduct ourselves at this time of great \ntransformation will constitute a precedent with far-\nreaching consequences for generations to come. Simply \nput, we are at a point of decision: will we choose a \nworld in which there are no rules as exceptions become \nthe new norms, devoid of any meaning except \u201cmight \nmakes right\u201d? Or will we opt to solidify the great gains \nachieved when the principles of an equitable \ninternational order were embodied in the United \nNations Charter? \n I believe that only the latter alternative provides a \nfuture that all United Nations Member States can work \nin concert to bring about. The starting point remains \nuniversal respect for international law. No one should \nbe above it, no one should stand beyond its reach and \nno one should feel at liberty to declare an exception to \nits jurisdiction and scope. And yet that is precisely \nwhat was recently attempted. \n I come before the Assembly as the President of a \ncountry that is trapped at the centre of one of the most \ndangerous challenges to the universality of the \ninternational system since the founding of the United \nNations. I speak of UDI \u2014 the unilateral declaration of \nindependence by the ethnic Albanian authorities of \nSerbia\u2019s southern province of Kosovo and Metohija. \nThis attempt at secession stands in direct violation of \nSerbia\u2019s democratic Constitution, as well as the basic \nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki \nFinal Act and Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). \n Some say Kosovo\u2019s unilateral declaration of \nindependence is a unique case. But in truth it is an \nattempt to forcibly partition a Member State of the \nUnited Nations against its will and without regard for \nthe firm opposition of the Security Council. It is an \nattempt to impose a nineteenth-century outcome on a \ntwenty-first century challenge. Serbia will never, under \nany circumstances, implicitly or explicitly, recognize \nthe unilateral declaration of independence of the ethnic \nAlbanian authorities of our southern province. \n We will continue to vigorously defend our \nintegrity in a non-confrontational manner, using all \npeaceful means at our disposal. That is why, at the very \noutset of this grave crisis, Serbia ruled out the use of \nforce. We chose to respond to Kosovo with the utmost \nresponsibility and restraint. Serbia opted for a \ndiplomatic approach, the result of which is that a vast \nmajority of United Nations Member States have \nrefrained from recognizing the unilateral declaration of \nindependence in Kosovo and have continued to abide \nby their Charter obligation to respect the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of my country. On behalf of the \nRepublic of Serbia, allow me once again to sincerely \nthank these countries for their adherence to the \nprinciples of international law. \n While categorically rejecting violence and \nunilateralism, Serbia has been equally emphatic in \ndemanding that justice be delivered through the proper \nlegal means at the disposal of any United Nations \nMember State. As part of our constructive approach, \nwe decided to contest the issue of Kosovo\u2019s unilateral \ndeclaration of independence before the principal \njudicial organ of the United Nations, the International \nCourt of Justice, which was tasked by General \nAssembly resolution 63/3 with issuing an advisory \nopinion on whether that declaration is in accordance \nwith international law. I would like to take this \nopportunity to inform the Member States that the Court \nhas concluded the preliminary, written phase of its \nproceedings in the case. Public hearings are scheduled \nto begin on 1 December, with a decision by the Court \nexpected sometime next year. \n Let me express my sincere gratitude to all those \ncountries that have chosen to actively support Serbia\u2019s \nstrategic choice to transfer the Kosovo issue to the \njudicial arena. The case marks the first time in the \nhistory of the Court that it has been asked to consider \nthe legality of an attempt at secession by an ethnic \ngroup from a United Nations Member State. There is \n \n \n3 09-52470 \n \nno doubt that the Court\u2019s conclusions will constitute a \npowerful legal precedent, with overarching \nconsequences for the United Nations system. The \noutcome will either strongly deter other separatist \nmovements from attempting to secede, or produce a \nresult that could encourage them to act in a similar \nfashion. Plainly stated, should Kosovo\u2019s unilateral \ndeclaration of independence be allowed to stand, a \ndoor would open for challenging the territorial \nintegrity of any United Nations Member State. \n The uniquely important nature of this case has \nbeen acknowledged by the international community. As \nwe know, all five permanent members of the Security \nCouncil have confirmed their participation in the \npublic hearings before the International Court of \nJustice. It is in this context that I appeal to all Member \nStates to respect the fact that the Court continues to be \nactively engaged on the issue. Its deliberations should \nnot be prejudged and its work should not be obstructed. \nThe Court\u2019s proceedings have to be allowed to run \ntheir course without political pressure, such as any \nfurther recognition of Kosovo\u2019s unilateral declaration \nof independence. On behalf of the Republic of Serbia, I \nencourage all non-recognizing Member States to stay \nthe course. By maintaining respect for my country\u2019s \nsovereignty and territorial integrity, together we will \nhelp ensure that international law continues to close in \non the issue of unilateral declarations of independence. \n Serbia\u2019s decision to turn to the International \nCourt of Justice to contest the Kosovo issue has been \ncomplemented by a policy of constructive engagement \nwith all legitimate actors on the ground in Kosovo. We \nmaintain support for a reconfigured United Nations \nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) \nand its continuing indispensability. We have also \nwelcomed a status-neutral European Union Rule of \nLaw Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), working in our \nsouthern province on the basis of Security Council \nresolution 1244 (1999), which continues to operate \nunder the overall authority of the United Nations. I call \non all responsible stakeholders invested in the future of \nKosovo to work more closely with the Government of \nSerbia on implementing in full the Secretary-General\u2019s \nsix-point plan (S/2008/354, annex I), which was \nwelcomed by the Security Council in November 2008. \n This is a time for leadership and working \ntogether, not for increasing the divide. We all have our \nconstraints, and they should be respected. Let us create \nnew opportunities for achieving practical results, by \nengaging with one another on a host of concrete \nquestions for the benefit of all residents of Kosovo \nprovince, including the Serbs \u2014 the community most \nat risk in all of Europe. \n(spoke in French) \n Democracy in Serbia is sound; our society rests \non a solid foundation and our values have been \nstrongly confirmed by law. The basis of our strategic \napproach to national development is the call for all \nEuropean nations to share their common destiny. On \nmany occasions our actions, in very difficult \ncircumstances, have proved our determination to \nbecome a member of the European Union (EU). \nDespite setbacks, our core strategic priority remains \nthat of attaining EU membership, not merely on \ngrounds of geography, heritage or economic prosperity, \nbut also because of the essential values that we share. \nThese are values that proclaim soft power in foreign \npolicy and the primacy of law in domestic affairs; \nachieving consensus in Brussels and standards of \nhuman rights throughout the EU. These are values that \nproclaim freedom of movement for all citizens of \nSerbia in the Schengen area, the tangible result of our \nprocess of entry into the EU, which we hope to see \nimplemented on 1 January 2010. This will bring us \ncloser to Europe, for the right to travel without a visa is \nto the citizens of Serbia the expression of what the EU \nmeans on a daily basis. \n But these are also values that have led us to \nmodernize our administration, to adopt exemplary \nlegislation in areas such as anti-discrimination and the \nprotection of minorities, and to redouble our efforts \ntowards regional reconciliation. That is an important \nreason why Serbia will shortly complete its full \ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal \nfor the Former Yugoslavia: it is a legal and moral \nobligation towards victims, towards ourselves and, \nabove all, towards future generations.  \n As the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the \nBerlin wall approaches, we must not forget that the \nobjective of uniting all the nations of Europe under the \nsame roof has not yet been attained. Much remains to \nbe done. Expansion fatigue must not emerge as a new \nreality in Europe. Solidarity must remain a high \npriority. It will never be time to consider an exit \nstrategy with regard to the Western Balkans. \n Permit me to stress that the facts are clear. All \nbenefit from expansion: old and new members, as well \n  \n \n09-52470 4 \n \nas potential members of the EU. This goes beyond our \nwildest dreams, even at a time of economic challenges \nand political demoralization. That is because the values \nthat unite us are strong and just. \n(spoke in English) \n In that context, let me underline the necessity of \nstrengthening regional cooperation. In June, Serbia \nhosted 15 heads of State during the Central European \nSummit, whose main topic was the interdependence of \nthe economy, EU integration and energy. That \ndemonstrated our commitment to acting constructively \nand working closely together with neighbouring \ncountries to ensure that regional peace is consolidated. \n With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia is \na guarantor of the Dayton Agreement. Let there be no \ndoubt that we will remain committed to the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of that neighbouring country, as \nwe will to those of all other United Nations Member \nStates in the region and across the world. \n In short, as the strategic anchor of stability in the \nWestern Balkans, Serbia will invest even greater efforts \nin completing the democratic transformation of our \npart of Europe. \n Serbia\u2019s robust European vision is complemented \nby our strong determination to pursue a carefully \nbalanced, artfully executed and active foreign policy \naimed at engagement with nations throughout the \nworld, near and far. That is in our long-term interest \nand will not change. Therefore, our engagement with \nBrussels, Moscow, Washington and Beijing \u2014 the four \nenduring pillars of Serbia\u2019s foreign policy \u2014 will \ncontinue to be strengthened in the time ahead. \n In conclusion, I want to emphasize another \nimportant dimension of our foreign policy. Serbia will \ncontinue to deepen ties with proud nations across the \nglobe, many of which are members of the Non-Aligned \nMovement (NAM). My country is the largest successor \nto a founding member of the Movement. Serbia\u2019s \ncapital, Belgrade, was the site of the first NAM \nsummit, held in 1961. That is why I have proposed that \nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Non-Aligned Movement \nbe celebrated in Belgrade with an extraordinary \nsummit under the auspices of the Egyptian \nchairmanship. \n Let me emphasize that Serbia will continue to \nengage with NAM countries, not only to honour a \nlegacy from the past and to renew traditional \nfriendships, but also because we believe that \ninternational stability and prosperity cannot be \nconsolidated without taking into account the views of \nthe majority in the global family of nations. \n I close by saying that the time for anyone to \nprocrastinate, to try half-measures or to delay and \ndiscourage is coming to a close. In its place, we are \nentering a period in which only results matter \u2014 a \nperiod of consequence and momentous choice. Now \ncomes our time of testing. \n Our vision is simple: the universal application of \nthe principles contained in the United Nations Charter, \nthe strengthening of international law and human rights \nin an increasingly interdependent world, the equitable \ndevelopment of the global economy and the sustainable \nmanagement of the environment throughout the world. \nLet us all have the courage to see that vision through to \nits rapid and noble completion."

I wish you success in your endeavours, \nand succeed you will, given your vast experience and \ncompetence.  \n I also extend our deep appreciation to your \npredecessor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for \nsuccessfully steering the work of the sixty-third \nsession; I recognize his positive stand vis-\u00e0-vis the \nfundamental issues with which the international \ncommunity is seized. I also wish the Secretary-General \nevery success in his undertakings as he seeks to fulfil \nthe purposes and principles of our international \nOrganization. \n We come here every year and stress from this \nvery rostrum, as do many others, that the Middle East \nis one of the most tense regions of the world and that \nthe situation is extremely ominous. From this very \nrostrum, most speakers stress that a just and \ncomprehensive peace is an urgent requirement for the \nrealization of the interests of all parties in the region \nand the world at large. However, paying lip service to \nthe need for peace is obviously different from working \nfor peace. Actions inside and outside the region have \nspoken louder than words, and peace has remained \nelusive for years.  \n During that time, Israel waged two devastating \nwars against Lebanon and Gaza. It had no qualms \nabout committing internationally prohibited acts or \nbreaching international law, encouraged and protected \nby the Administration of former United States \nPresident Bush. To date, Israel continues to impose a \nstifling siege on Gaza, in contravention of the most \nbasic humanitarian principles and tenets of \ninternational humanitarian law. These facts have been \nconfirmed by many investigations, and were most \nrecently published in the report of the United Nations \nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict. The head \nof the Mission concluded that Israel had committed \ngrave violations of human rights law, and international \nhumanitarian law, including war crimes and possibly \ncrimes against humanity. \n The international approach to the Middle East \nquestion has changed in previous years. Addressing \nthis issue has become a priority, and has been followed \nby immediate action on the ground. This is certainly \nreassuring. It is our sincere hope that these efforts will \nbear fruit. But the engagement by the new United \nStates Administration, the members of the Security \nCouncil, the European Union, the Organization for the \nIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement \nhas been continuously confronted with Israeli measures \nand positions that ignore the most basic underpinnings \nof the peace process. Israel defies the policies of its \nfriends and allies and undermines their will. Israel also \nchallenges the will of the overwhelming majority \u2014 if \nnot the entirety \u2014 of the international community. \nPerhaps more than ever before, Israel has now revealed \nits true colours: an entity that has enshrined racism, \naggression and tension-building while balking at peace \nand repudiating the advocates of peace. \n Israel refuses to freeze illegitimate settlement \nbuilding and is thus in breach of its obligations under \ninternational law. Israel continues to confiscate \nPalestinian land, build the apartheid wall, Judaize \nJerusalem, expel inhabitants from their homes and \nbring in settlers to replace them. This list is in no way \nexhaustive. These facts are substantiated by figures \nbut, in the interest of time, we shall not dwell on them \nin detail. Suffice it to say that the two-State solution \nadvocated by the international community has been \nrejected by the Israeli Government. The Israeli Prime \nMinister\u2019s comments on the subject are sheer tactical \nmanoeuvres that are contradicted entirely by the \npolicies pursued by his Government on the ground. \n President Bashar Al-Assad has said that peace is \nantithetical to occupation. Peace and occupation cannot \ncoexist. He stressed that we in Syria seek a just and \ncomprehensive peace and that peace is our strategic \nchoice. It is a choice based on the implementation of \nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 \n(1973), the Madrid terms of reference, the principle of \nland for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative. We have \nsupported every effort aimed at achieving this goal. To \nthat end, we entered into indirect talks with Israel \nthrough Turkish mediation and sought to arrive at \ncommon ground that would ultimately enable us to \nlaunch direct negotiations. But the absence of genuine \npolitical will to make peace and the war of aggression \nthat the Israeli Government waged against Gaza \nbrought this pursuit to a halt. \n \n \n25 09-52598 \n \n In full view of the world and in defiance of its \nunanimous will, Israel has chosen to be a rejectionist \nState. It has chosen to challenge the international \ncommunity. This is a dangerous position and a stance \nthat threatens peace and security in the region. The \ncontinued occupation, the Judaization of Jerusalem, the \nintensification of settlement activities and the racist \nslogans presage serious consequences for the world. \nThe world must not succumb to the dictates of Israeli \nextremists. It must not allow Israel to persist in its \nviolation of international law and its defiance of \ninternational will and decisions. \n Brotherly Iraq continues to bleed. The situation in \nIraq is a cause for serious concern to us as a \nneighbouring Arab country. We have continuously \nstressed the urgency of preserving the unity of Iraq\u2019s \nterritory and people while guaranteeing its sovereignty \nand safeguarding its independence and its Arab-Islamic \nidentity. To that end, it is urgent to build Iraqi national \nunity on the basis of national reconciliation, which \nmust include Iraqis of all stripes. Iraqi national unity is \nthe cornerstone of the reconciliation process, but it will \nremain elusive unless the necessary conditions for \nnational reconciliation are achieved. \n We have continuously condemned all aggressive \nacts that claim the lives of innocent victims in Iraq. We \nhave also repeatedly called for the withdrawal of all \nforeign troops from Iraq and for the restoration of full \nIraqi independence and sovereignty. We have stressed \nour readiness to facilitate that withdrawal by extending \nour cooperation in maintaining security in Iraq. It is \nour hope that Iraqis will soon be able to arrive, through \nconstructive dialogue, at solutions that firmly support \nIraq\u2019s unity, strength and prosperity while remaining \nfully dedicated and loyal to the unity of the land of Iraq \nand its people. \n Syria has been dedicated to strengthening \nbilateral Syrian-Iraqi relations in all their aspects. We \nestablished a bilateral council for strategic cooperation \nin various fields. We were distressed by the recent \n\u201cBloody Wednesday\u201d terrorist bombings in Baghdad, \nwhich we strongly condemn. But we were surprised to \nhear, days later, accusations levelled at us \u2014 \naccusations devoid of any truth \u2014 implying that we \nharboured those suspected of masterminding those \nbombings. These claims and the ensuing developments \nare extremely unfortunate and cannot serve the \ninterests of Iraq or Syria. \n We are open to suggestions on how to solve the \ncurrent crisis by demanding that real evidence be made \navailable to substantiate those claims. This has not yet \nbeen done. We stress that protecting the Iraqi people \nand safeguarding their interests is one of our priorities. \nWe are also keen to safeguard the fraternal relations \nbetween the Iraqi and Syrian peoples and express our \nsatisfaction at the current efforts of Turkey and the \nSecretary-General of the League of Arab States. \n We have followed with grave concern the recent \ndevelopments in Yemen. We hope that security will \nultimately prevail. We support Yemen\u2019s unity, stability \nand the prosperity of its people. \n Attempts to undermine the Sudan\u2019s unity and to \ncompromise its security and sovereignty are also a \ncause of concern for us. We fully support the Sudan \nand its leadership and stress the need to create \nfavourable conditions conducive to a settlement of all \npending issues. In that regard, we appreciate the efforts \nmade by the State of Qatar in cooperation with the \nLeague of Arab States and the African Union. \n Another cause for concern is the events unfolding \nin Somalia, a country already afflicted by war and \ninternal strife. We call on our brothers there to work for \nnational reconciliation and to use dialogue as a means \nof settling their differences. We urge them to work \ntowards the unity of Somalia, which as the supreme \nnational interest should take precedence over any other \nconsideration, and to lay the foundations for security \nand stability in their country. \n We support the efforts of the African Union to \nsettle the existing conflicts that continue to plague \nsome parts of the African continent, to achieve \ndevelopment in the countries of Africa and to promote \nthe African role in the international system. \n We also renew our call for the lifting of the \nblockade imposed on Cuba for more than half a \ncentury. \n For years, Syria has been calling for the \nestablishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass \ndestruction in the Middle East region. To this end, \nSyria tabled a draft resolution before the Security \nCouncil in 2003 calling for the establishment of such a \nzone. Today Syria stresses the need for Israel to \ncommit to complying with the resolution of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted \non 18 September of this year regarding Israeli nuclear \n  \n \n09-52598 26 \n \ncapabilities (GC(53)/RES/17), in which the Agency \ncalled upon Israel to place its nuclear facilities under \ncomprehensive IAEA safeguards and to accede to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \n(NPT). We recall once again the right of all States to \nacquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, as \nguaranteed by the NPT. We fully support constructive \ndialogue as a means to settle all differences. \n The world is still reeling from a crippling \neconomic and financial crisis that has adversely \naffected the economic and social conditions of most \ncountries of the world. Very few countries, if any, have \nbeen spared its devastating effects. This crisis led many \nto question its root causes, shedding light on the \ndeficiencies in the financial system and its practices \nand thus highlighting the sound practices that could \nhave prevented the crisis. The world cannot deal with \nthe crisis as a fait accompli. We must seek answers and \noutcomes that endorse sound practices and remedy \nsystemic imbalances that are bound to affect us all in \nthe globalized world in which we live. Our common \ngoal is to establish a more secure economic and \nfinancial world order. \n It goes without saying that the countries of the \nSouth have disparate economies and are comparatively \nmore disadvantaged and adversely affected by the \ncurrent crisis than those of the North. The world\u2019s poor \nend up paying a higher price for a breakdown that is \nnot of their making. Rich States are therefore duty \nbound to provide all forms of support to poorer \ncountries to help them overcome this crisis. Poor \ncountries have earned this support, and any positive \nresults that it generates will serve the interests of poor \nand rich countries alike. We also call for the increased \nparticipation of developing countries in the work of the \nGroup of 20, which would enable them to put forward \nproposals and advance appropriate responses to \novercome the crisis. \n We and many others have often called for an \nenhanced and reinvigorated role for the United Nations \nin order to build a better, more just and more secure \nworld. We believe that the present moment is \nauspicious. We therefore call on all Member States to \nwork seriously to ensure compliance with the Charter \nof our international Organization and to introduce the \nnecessary reforms in order to promote it, learning from \nthe lessons of past decades and from our achievements \nand failures. We sincerely look forward to a world \ngoverned by respect for international law in which \nsecurity, stability and prosperity reign supreme. \n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to congratulate \nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, Minister of African Union \nAffairs of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, on his \nunanimous election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are convinced \nthat, guided by his Government\u2019s adherence to the \nprinciples of national independence and sovereignty, \nthe primacy of the values of the human individual, the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, and \nthe economic development of all countries, and with \nhis well-known diplomatic skills, he will contribute to \nthe good management of the Assembly and to ensuring \nthat the United Nations achieves the universal \nobjectives of peace, stability and global development. \n We also express our thanks to Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \nthe Republic of Nicaragua, for his outstanding work at \n  \n \n09-52228 28 \n \nthe sixty-third session, at a time when the world was \nshaken by an acute financial and economic crisis the \nconsequences of which have fomented instability and \nthreatened peace in various regions of the world. \n Mr. Singh Puri (India), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n Amid this climate of insecurity, the food and \nglobal energy crises, natural disasters and climate \nchange that threaten the sustainability of the global \necology, the work of the Secretary-General, as the \ncoordinator of the activities of our Organization, has \nbeen far from easy. We therefore commend Mr. Ban \nKi-moon for his efforts to address those issues and \noffer him our full support and cooperation so that his \nactions can be implemented without delay. \n In taking the floor to address this international \nforum, I wish first and foremost to express our \ngratitude for this renewed opportunity to share our \nthoughts, experience and common concerns for the \nmodern world. It is timely indeed that the Secretary-\nGeneral has dedicated the sixty-fourth session of the \nGeneral Assembly to the topic of effective responses to \nthe current global economic and financial crisis in \norder to analyse its causes and adopt policies and \nstrategies that will enable States to mitigate the \nnegative consequences of the crisis, which are having \nan increasingly debilitating impact on economically \nweak countries in particular. \n Following the end of the cold war and the \ndisappearance of the bipolar and antagonistic world \nthat emerged from the Second World War, it became \nclear that a more globalized, united and integrated era \nhad dawned among nations that would result in greater \njustice, solidarity and integration in international \nexchanges and relations. Mutual respect for cultural \nspecificities remains the fundamental basis for \ninternational cooperation, an association of shared \nresponsibilities, mutual respect and equitable mutual \nbenefit. That has been the guiding ideal of the United \nNations since its inception. Its efforts to create a world \nof peace, development and well-being for humankind \nhave followed this aim for the sixty-plus years of its \nhistory. \n Yet the gap between developed and developing \ncountries has only widened, in spite of the numerous \nresolutions, decisions and recommendations that have \nbeen adopted to promote the equality of political, \neconomic, social and cultural rights; the global \ndevelopment of humanity; the replacement of the old \neconomic order with a new, more just and equitable \nsystem; the provision of financial assistance to the \nmost vulnerable countries; the liberalization of global \ntrade; and in spite of the many other measures  adopted \nat special summits. \n Yet, despite all this, global achievement of the \nUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals has \nfallen short by  20 per cent. We can see that, \nunfortunately, egoism and the desire to dominate \nremain the driving force in international relations. \nInevitably, without a multilateralism that respects the \ncriterion of partnership based on mutual respect for \nshared responsibilities and reciprocal and equitable \ninterests, the global political, economic and social \nbalance is undermined. Inevitably, unless this \npartnership is based on respect for the cultural values \nof every nation, a new cold or hot war is bound to \nbreak out between poor countries and rich countries. \n The Republic of Equatorial Guinea welcomes the \ntimeliness of this debate, since in the middle of this \nunprecedented global crisis we can all redefine our \npositions on the subject of global development. Here, \nin New York in 2009, we must resolve these problems \nso that the current causes of a misery and \nconflictiveness driven by the wealthy countries to the \ndetriment of the poor or economically fragile countries \nno longer justify this new and absurd bipolarization \u2014 \nwhen, despite everything, humankind has assimilated \nthe supremacy of the values that make up the human \nindividual. \n What kind of morality is it when some States \nenjoy economic abundance, while others suffer in \nmisery, marginalization and desolation? \n Accordingly, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \ncalls for new global approaches that will enhance the \ncapacity of developing countries to contribute \npolitically and economically and will allow a \ncoexistence that safeguards the political and economic \ninterests of all countries.  \n We can no longer continue on the path that we are \non. We can no longer continue on this irrational and \nirresponsible path. We must consider matters calmly in \norder to adopt positive attitudes that effectively support \nthe original philosophy of the United Nations, a \nphilosophy that conceived of a united world where \nhuman beings, regardless of race, culture or level of \n \n \n29 09-52228 \n \ncivilization, are recognized as human beings, in both \nthe North and the South.  \n Thus, there can be no justification for theories of \nglobalization of policies unless they respect the \ncultural plurality that characterizes the peoples of the \nworld. There can be no discrimination or exclusion. \nIntercultural dialogue must strengthen this community \nof nations with a view to achieving a coexistence that \nis conducive to learning from one another for the \nmutual benefit of us all. \n Equatorial Guinea conceives of its development \nas the outcome of coordinated action between national \neffort and international cooperation. We rule out \ndiscrimination of any kind for reasons of political, \neconomic or cultural system in the case of any country \nor international organization, provided that the latter \nrespects our country\u2019s independence, national \nsovereignty and territorial integrity, the peace and free \nexercise of the sovereignty of the people, the right to \nthe free utilization of our natural resources, the \nmaintenance of friendly relations and cooperation for \nreciprocal benefit, and respect for the cultural values of \nthe people. \n Through its application of these principles, \nEquatorial Guinea enjoys excellent ties of friendship, \ncooperation and good neighbourliness with all \ncountries in Central Africa. We accept economic \ncooperation with countries of all ideological beliefs, \nfrom the East to the West and from the North to the \nSouth. This is part of our contribution to global peace \nand balance. \n As a result, our oil and other resources contribute \nnot only to the development of our European partners, \nbut also to that of Africa, America and Asia. This being \nsaid, we are constantly amazed by the conflictiveness, \nsuspicion and envy that these oil resources arouse in a \nnumber of countries, these same resources that we have \nmade freely available to the international community. \nWe witnessed this first-hand when Equatorial Guinea \nwas the victim of mercenary-led invasions, terrorist \nattacks and plans for political destabilization, whose \nclear aim was to gain illegal access to resources which \nbelong solely to the people of Equatorial Guinea. \n We wish to emphasize that Equatorial Guinea is a \npeaceful country without ambitions to acquire territory \nor engage in political hegemony and without policies \ndesigned to jeopardize peace or stability in other States \nand nations. We reaffirm our commitment to the \nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the \nCharter of the African Union with regard to the \nmaintenance of peaceful relations, the rejection of \nviolence and the peaceful resolution of disputes \nthrough dialogue, mediation and, where necessary, \nrecourse to international tribunals. \n Global peace is the universal right of all and an \nindispensable prerequisite for the survival of \nhumankind. It is non-negotiable, not to be traded with \nany public or private interest, and is so fragile that it \ncan be shattered when injustices affecting a State or a \ncommunity of States are committed. Therefore, we are \naddressing the situation caused by the global economic \ncrisis, which, without a doubt, has had repercussions in \nindividual States of the international community, each \nat different levels and each with the potential to affect \nglobal peace. We have witnessed examples of such \nconsequences in the recent conflicts that have engulfed \nvarious States in the world today. Yet, this noble world \nOrganization was created for peace.  \n It is for the sake of maintaining peace and world \nstability that we all meet here every year. It is also for \nthe sake of peace and stability that we must be careful \nnot to the let the attitudes of some countries or groups \nof countries foster, out of whatever ambitions or \nselfishness they have, continuing injustices that have \ncreated the crisis in international relations. \n With best wishes for a world abundant in peace \nand happiness, I wish every success to this sixty-fourth \nsession of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "We meet today while \nthe world is in the grip of intertwined crises from \nwhich we must break free if we are to ensure our long-\nterm survival. The most urgent of these is the economic \nand financial crisis. It has put scores of millions out of \njobs, shut down tens of thousands of factories, and \npushed more than 100 million people below the \npoverty line. \n A few days ago, at the Group of Twenty (G-20) \nsummit in Pittsburgh, the 20 largest economies of the \nworld, both developed and developing, addressed this \ncrisis by agreeing to reform the global financial \narchitecture to meet the needs of the twenty-first \ncentury. No longer will we depend on just a few \nindustrialized nations to solve the world\u2019s economic \nproblems. The developing world is now part of the \nsolution to those problems. Through the G-20, the \nvoice of the developing world will be heard in \ninternational economic and financial decision-making. \n Thus, we are building today a new and \nconstructive power equation, increasing the sharing of \nresponsibilities and contributions and widening \nparticipation in decision-making. This redistribution of \npower constitutes fundamental reform that should be \nreplicated in other bodies, such as the Security \nCouncil. And no more will our economies be left to the \nmercy of the market. Financial institutions and \ninstruments will have to be regulated and closely \nsupervised. There will be close consultations and \nmutual assessments of national economic strategies in \norder to ensure coordination at the global level and to \nidentify potential risks to financial stability. \n For our part in Indonesia we are working hard in \nthe G-20 to reform the mandate, mission and \ngovernance of the International Monetary Fund and our \nmultilateral development banks. These banks must \ndeliver accelerated and concessional financing without \nconditionalities to the low-income countries so as to \ncushion the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable \nand the poorest. \n All of this has set refreshing precedents in terms \nof access to financial resources for developing \ncountries and in terms of transparency, and most \nimportantly, it reflects current global realities rather \nthan the world of 60 years ago. As such, it represents a \ndemocratization of the global economy and the \ninternational financial architecture. It has also given us \na remarkable insight: that it is not an array of disparate \ncrises that is confronting us. We are actually in the grip \nof one systemic crisis. The economic and financial \ncrisis, the challenge of climate change, the food \nsecurity crisis and the energy security crisis are \nproblems that fed on one another and thus grew to \ncritical proportions. That reality materialized because \nthe international community failed to form an effective \nglobal partnership to address the large bundle of \nchallenges that have ultimately affected all humankind. \n In that sense, the root cause of this overarching \ncrisis is the failure to achieve multilateralism and forge \na system of democratic governance at the global level. \nBut we can rectify that failure through an all-\nencompassing reform of the relationships between \nnations in the world today. \n In December in Copenhagen we can strive to \nreach a new consensus on climate change that is more \neffective in averting climate disaster by forging an \nequitable and transparent partnership between \n \n \n13 09-53165 \n \ndeveloped and developing nations. As the host country \nto the United Nations Climate Change Conference in \nBali, which adopted the Bali Road Map by consensus, \nIndonesia fervently desires that the Copenhagen \nmeeting will yield a new commitment to a framework \nto strengthen the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. This \nframework must stipulate deep cuts in greenhouse gas \nemissions and sufficient financing for adaptation to and \nmitigation of climate change. \n We would like to see the role of forests given the \ntop priority that it deserves. We look forward to ocean \nissues being mainstreamed into the new climate \nregime. And we cannot allow the negotiation process to \nbe derailed; the stakes are too high. We need not even \nwait for a consensus. We are ready to forge \npartnerships to carry out concrete projects like the \nIndonesia Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, which by \nitself is already a contribution to climate stability. In \nthe same spirit, Indonesia is hosting the Forest-2011 \nministerial meeting in Jakarta next month.  \n By the same token, we can launch a more \nsuccessful and durable Green Revolution that is based \non the same kind of partnership and gives developing \ncountries sorely needed access to resources and \ntechnology. That partnership can and must provide for \nthe massive investments required for agricultural \nproduction and building agricultural infrastructures. \nWhen sufficient investment is channelled to \nagriculture, the result is the productivity that Indonesia \nhas enjoyed in the past several years. We have a \nsurplus production of rice and part of that surplus will \nbecome a buffer stock for our national food security. \nPart of it will be allotted as our contribution to global \nfood security. \n Through similar reform we can involve more \nnations in a coordinated quest for new sources of \nrenewable and clean energy, without compromising \nfood security. A global partnership for energy security \nrather than a scattering of individual efforts will have a \nmuch better chance of achieving a technological \nbreakthrough that will enormously increase the \nefficiency of current fuel-burning mechanisms. \n With this new spirit of reform and \nmultilateralism, we will be able in 2010 to break the \nimpasse in the Doha Round negotiations, which will \nlead to an outcome that is pro-development. In that \nsame spirit we can tear down the barriers of \nprotectionism that are rising again out of fear of the \neconomic crisis. With trade revitalized, world gross \ndomestic product (GDP) could be bolstered by \n$700 billion a year. \n A global partnership that reforms the \ninternational financial architecture, works for climate \nstability, food security and energy security and brings a \nsuccessful conclusion to the Doha Development Round \nshould also bring about the fulfilment of the Monterrey \nConsensus. This will ensure the attainment of the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n If this new spirit of multilateralism and reform can \npervade international socio-economic affairs, there is no \nreason why it should not also find its way into the \npolitico-security field. It can resuscitate the \ndisarmament agenda \u2014 especially nuclear disarmament, \nwhich has been lying moribund for decades. In a truly \ndemocratic world order, the nuclear Powers would fulfil \ntheir commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty by \nslashing their nuclear arsenals and abiding by the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In turn, we \nnon-nuclear countries will continue to refrain from \ndeveloping nuclear weapons.  \n This is no longer an impossible dream. A window \nof opportunity has been opened with the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1887 (2009) on the \nmaintenance of international peace and security leading \nto a nuclear-weapon-free world, and with the current \nprocess between the United States and the Russian \nFederation towards deeper cuts in their respective \nnuclear arsenals. Thus, the disarmament agenda is \nbeing revived. \n Even the persistent Middle East conflict, with the \nquestion of Palestine at its core, could be more \nexpeditiously resolved, if the task of promoting the \npeace process involved a wider base of stakeholders. \nThe main problem in reviving the peace process at the \nmoment is the intransigence of Israel on the issue of \nillegal settlements. But the early engagement of the \nObama Administration in the peace effort and its even-\nhanded multilateral approach to the problem brings \nhope for an eventual two-State solution. \n Let us therefore respond to President Obama\u2019s \ncall for partnering for peace. Likewise, the challenge of \nterrorism demands the broadest possible coalition of \nnations to put an end to it \u2014 not only through sheer \nforce of arms but also and mainly through a dialogue \nof faiths, cultures and civilizations that will put the \nmerchants of hate out of business. \n \n \n09-53165 14 \n \n Every major problem in the world today calls for \nthe concerted efforts of many nations to work out its \nsolution. This includes transnational challenges like \npiracy, irregular migration, money-laundering, human \nrights violations, the threat of a pandemic and natural \ndisasters. All these problems demand reform and \nstrengthening of international cooperation. A clamour \nfor reform that must be heeded now is the call for the \noverhaul of the composition and workings of the \nSecurity Council. For by no means does the Council \nreflect the realities of our time \u2014 it is a throwback to \nthe world at the end of the Second World War. \n In the same way that the Group of Eight can no \nlonger solve the economic problems of the world, a \nSecurity Council paralysed by its undemocratic \ncomposition and the veto system can no longer \nguarantee our collective security. It needs to be more \ndemocratic, transparent and accountable. It needs new \nsources of strength that the developing world and their \nancient civilizations can help provide in the same \nmanner as the inclusivity of the G-20. \n We in Indonesia are great believers in democratic \nreform, because that is what saved us from being \ntotally crushed by the Asian financial crisis of 1997. \nOver the years until then, we had focused too much on \nthe market and on our GDP growth and thus neglected \nour political development. The only way out of the \ncrisis was reform \u2014 reform of every aspect of our \nnational life. And so we made the transition from a \nhighly centralized authoritarian regime to a \ndecentralized, more fully democratic system. We \nreformed our military, our bureaucracy and our justice \nsystem. We modernized our economic infrastructure. \n And since October 2004, the administration of \nPresident Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has been \nconsolidating and fine-tuning earlier reforms. Now, \nhaving won re-election in only the second direct \npresidential election in our history, he is ready to \nlaunch a second wave of reform, which will lay the \nfoundations for Indonesia\u2019s becoming a developed \ncountry by 2025. Meanwhile, we have come to be \nknown as the world\u2019s third largest democracy, the land \nwhere democracy, Islam and modernization not only go \nhand in hand but thrive together. We intend to keep on \nearning and deserving that recognition \u2014 by, among \nother ways, learning from others and sharing with them \nour experiences in political development. \n That is why, last December, we organized the \nBali Democracy Forum, Asia\u2019s first intergovernmental \nforum on democracy. We are making this an annual \naffair. And it is our hope that the world, as it reforms \nits economic governance, will learn a truth that we \ncame upon during our crisis some 12 years ago: that \nprosperity without democracy is but a bubble. And \ndemocracy that does not deliver development will not \nendure. Economic and political development must \nmarch hand in hand. As it is with a country such as \nIndonesia, so it is with the world. It is not enough for \nthe world to get its economics right. It must also get its \npolitics right. For man does not live by bread alone. He \nmust also have his freedom."

        "file_text": "At this moment in time, \nmajor economic and environmental challenges are \ngiving rise to increasing global concerns and impacting \npeople all over this planet. To meet those challenges \neffectively, we need, more than ever, a dynamic and \nproactive multilateral system. We need the United \nNations to provide global answers to global challenges. \n In less than three months, we will meet again in \nCopenhagen to seal the deal on climate change. The \neffects of climate change are increasingly felt all over \nthe world, not least in developing countries, and the \nwhole world is looking to us for answers. And answers \nwe must provide \u2014 new directions for the future, \ntransformational changes in the way we do business \nand a new paradigm for growth and development. In \nthis respect, I do welcome the leadership of the \nSecretary-General as demonstrated by his call for a \nSummit on Climate Change a few days ago and by his \nconcluding remarks on that occasion. \n The message is clear: we must act now to avoid \npotentially disastrous changes in the global climate. \nThe focus in Copenhagen three months from now will \nbe on three deliverables. First, we must agree on a \ncommon goal for a significant reduction in global \ncarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and we must set clear \ntargets for both medium and longer term. Secondly, we \nmust agree on a pathway towards achieving these \ntargets. And, thirdly, we must set in motion the policies \nand measures to sustain our efforts on that pathway. \n Reducing CO2 emissions is a challenge for \nindustrialized countries, emerging economies and \ndeveloping countries alike. There is no contradiction \nbetween economic growth and ambitious policies to \naddress climate change. Pursuing a green economy is \npossible, as shown by the example of, among others, \nmy own country. And, in this context, it is also \nimportant to keep in mind the security risks emanating \nfrom climate change in all parts of the world. I \nwelcome the Secretary-General\u2019s recent report on this \nissue entitled \u201cClimate change and its possible security \nimplications\u201d (A/64/350), and look forward to further \ndeliberations on this topic. \n The ongoing financial and economic crisis is \nreversing hard-won progress in developing countries \nstriving to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). The international community must assist the \npoorest of those countries in mitigating the immediate \neffects of the crisis, while at the same time ensuring \nthat we do not lose sight of the longer-term challenges \nin relation to the MDGs and the climate change \nagenda. There is an imminent risk that the economic \ncrisis will lead to the overall stagnation \u2014 or even the \nreduction \u2014 of official development assistance. That is \na challenge we must counter and overcome, and it is \nmore crucial than ever that all donors speed up delivery \non their aid commitments. \n \n \n31 09-53165 \n \n African countries, in particular, are facing \nsignificant obstacles in their efforts to achieve the \nMDGs. As recommended by the Africa Commission \nand the MDG3 Global Call to Action, both initiated by \nthe Government of Denmark, there is a need to focus \nstrongly on employment for young people, economic \nempowerment of women and private sector-led \neconomic growth. Renewed focus on those policy areas \nwill also be essential in coping with the economic \ncrisis and its impact on the continent. \n As we embark on the final stage towards 2015, \nthe upcoming 2010 MDG Summit gives us an \nimportant opportunity to identify means to speed up \nachievement of the MDGs. Denmark looks forward to \nthis occasion and is ready to engage actively in the \nprocess. \n In an increasingly globalized and dynamic world, \nwhere the problems we face tend to become ever more \ncomplex and intertwined, it is important to treasure and \nuphold the principles and the objectives enshrined in \nthe Charter of the United Nations: to promote and \nencourage respect for human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms for all; to establish conditions under which \njustice and respect for international obligations can be \nmaintained; and to promote social progress and better \nstandards of living. \n States must protect their own populations, and \nStates must be accountable to the global community. In \nthat context, I welcome the recent debate held in this \nHall on the responsibility to protect, which showed \noverwhelming support for the concept on the part of \nMember States. It bodes well for our continued \ndeliberations on that issue. \n I should also like to use this opportunity to \nencourage all United Nations Members that have not \nyet done so to become States parties to the \nInternational Criminal Court. There should be no \nimpunity for the perpetrators of the most serious \ninternational crimes. \n Among the most serious present dangers to peace \nand security is the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their means of delivery. The upcoming \nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is of utmost \nimportance. The meeting of the Security Council on \n24 September, headed by President Obama (see \nS/PV.6191), provided ample evidence. We welcome the \nnegotiations between the United States and Russia on \nreductions to follow up on the Treaty on Strategic \nOffensive Arms, and we welcome President Obama\u2019s \ncommitment to the ratification of the Comprehensive \nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, both of which will have a \npositive impact on the NPT Review Conference. \n I should like to take the opportunity to call on \nIran and the Democratic People\u2019 s Republic of Korea to \ncomply with their obligations to suspend enrichment \nactivities and to start negotiations on transparent \ncivilian nuclear programmes, as set forth in Security \nCouncil resolutions. \n The election in Afghanistan was far from perfect. \nWe need to engage with the new Government to create \nthe crucial legitimacy between the Afghan Government \nand the Afghan people. The new Afghan compact to be \nbuilt is that between the Government and the people, \nand our role should be to strengthen that compact and \nhold the Government accountable. In terms of the role \nof the international community, we need to be better \ncoordinated and more effective in our support for \nbuilding the capacity of the Afghan Government. In \nthis the United Nations and the United Nations \nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan play a crucial role. \n In neighbouring Pakistan, the international \ncommunity and the Friends of Democratic Pakistan \nmust seize the opportunity to support the democratic \nGovernment in fighting poverty and extremism. We \nmust help Pakistan build a stable, democratic and \nprosperous State. This would be a significant \ncontribution to peace and development in South Asia. I \nwarmly welcome the efforts of the Government to fight \nterrorism, while, at the same time, it tries to alleviate \nthe hardship experienced by Pakistan\u2019s internally \ndisplaced persons (IDPs). It is a positive development \nthat so many IDPs have returned. Now, a full and fast \nimplementation of the Malakand development strategy \nis important. \n The deadlock in the Middle East peace process \nand the high level of regional tensions demand new \ninternational efforts to promote stability and peace in \nthe region. We are encouraged to see the enhanced \nAmerican engagement in the Middle East, and we urge \nall in the region and all parties to the Middle East \nconflict to honour the Road Map commitments, move \nspeedily ahead and, once and for all, settle their \ndifferences in accordance with the international \nagreements and the Arab Peace Initiative. Furthermore, \nDenmark is in favour of expanding the mandate of the \n \n \n09-53165 32 \n \nQuartet to include a regional dimension. Also, the \nSyrian and Lebanese peace tracks should feature \npermanently on the agenda of the Quartet. \n Pirates operating in the Indian Ocean and the \nGulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia are a security \nchallenge that poses new legal challenges. Denmark \nhas taken the lead in the international community\u2019s \nwork to identify practical and legal solutions so as to \nensure the prosecution of suspected pirates. We \nwelcome the increasingly active involvement of the \nUnited Nations in that issue. \n In that respect, we have to remember that what is \ntaking place on the open sea is closely linked to the \nsituation on the ground in Somalia. Bringing security \nand stability to the Somalis is of the highest priority, \nand Denmark supports the efforts of the United Nations \nand the African Union, and the Djibouti process. \n The United Nations itself must be able to change \nin order to effectively meet and deliver on all those \nnew challenges. It is important to keep up momentum \nin the intergovernmental negotiations on reform of the \nSecurity Council in order to adapt that key body to the \nworld of today. The United Nations peacekeeping \ncommitments continue to play a decisive role in global \npeace and security, with now more than 100,000 \npeacekeepers deployed in nearly 20 missions globally. \nHowever, the immense growth and the demand for \nstrengthening the capacity to manage and to sustain \nthose peacekeeping operations have revealed shortfalls \npertaining to the decision-making processes and the \nengagements themselves. Denmark, therefore, warmly \nsupports recent initiatives that would enable us to meet \nthe growing demands with a system in place that is \nmore effective, more transparent and more \naccountable. \n Security is a precondition to programme delivery. \nSome degree of risk cannot be avoided, but the \nchallenge is to mitigate it. Denmark, therefore, \nsupports the continuing overhaul of security \nassessments and procedures. However, the situation in \na country after the end of a conflict is also often \nextremely volatile. There is a need to ensure quick, \neffective and efficient support in post-conflict \nsituations and to strengthen peacebuilding efforts. The \nUnited Nations is uniquely suited to lead those efforts, \nand we welcome the strong emphasis on that issue and \nlook forward to the review of the peacebuilding \narchitecture next year. \n The work of the United Nations in the area of \ngender, women\u2019 s rights and development has for too \nlong been fragmented and underfunded. In that light, \nthe recent decision by the General Assembly in \nresolution 63/311 to create a new gender entity within \nthe United Nations is of great significance. We will \nsupport the Secretary-General in every possible way in \nhis efforts to ensure the swift establishment of such an \nentity. The rapid creation of a new gender entity will \nrepresent a milestone in the important work of \nreforming the United Nations system. \n All United Nations entities, funds and \nprogrammes and the Secretariat need to act more \ncoherently. On the operational side, we strongly \nsupport the \u201cdelivering as one\u201d initiative which seeks \nto base the various parts of the system on a common \nunderstanding of needs and priorities and with full \ncountry ownership of the joint programme. It is a \ncollective responsibility and an opportunity to \ncomprehensively pursue that agenda. More effective \nand efficient ways of working system-wide are \nimportant; therefore, harmonization of the \nOrganization\u2019 s business practices must be accelerated \nacross the system. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n Multilateral cooperation is the best means of \nmaintaining international peace and security and of \nresponding to the challenges, risks and opportunities in \nan interdependent and globalized world. This \nOrganization holds great legitimacy and moral force, \nand we encourage the United Nations \u2014 Member \nStates, the entire organizational system and the \nSecretariat \u2014 to seize the moment and take the lead in \naddressing the new global challenges. An ambitious \nand successful outcome to the upcoming fifteenth \nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \nCopenhagen in December would be a significant step \nin that direction."

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, on behalf of the Guinean delegation, which I \nhave the honour of leading, I would like to pass on to \nthe President, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, Secretary of \nAfrican Union Affairs of the Great Socialist People\u2019s \nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, the congratulations of the \nGuinean people and Government on his brilliant \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-fourth session. I would also like to convey the \n  \n \n09-52604 20 \n \ncongratulations of Captain Moussa Dadis Camara, \nPresident of the Republic, Head of State, President of \nthe National Council for Democracy and Development \nand Commander-in-Chief of the Guinean armed forces. \n My delegation is convinced that because \nMr. Treki is a seasoned diplomat, our work will be \ncrowned with success. We assure him of our full \ncooperation. I would also like to tell his predecessor, \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, how much my \ndelegation appreciates his wisdom and the devotion \nwith which he led the work of the Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. The Republic of Guinea salutes the \nremarkable work that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nhas accomplished at the helm of our Organization in \nfavour of peace, development and prosperity in the \nworld. \n Mrs. Gallardo Hern\u00e1ndez (El Salvador), \nVice-President, took the Chair. \n On 23 December 2008, all the people of Guinea \nenthusiastically welcomed the arrival of the National \nCouncil for Democracy and Development, the CNDD. \nGuinean armed forces decided to take the destiny of \nthe country into their hands after the death of President \nLansana Cont\u00e9 on 22 December 2008 in order to avoid \nthe social implosion that would have damaged peace, \nsecurity, stability, unity and harmonious development \nin the country. \n Poor political and economic governance and its \nrelated effects of corruption, impunity, the \nconsumption of and trafficking in drugs, the \nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, \norganized crime and the abdication of republican \ninstitutions had considerably weakened the authority of \nthe State. The National Council for Democracy and \nDevelopment, faithful to its commitments, has \nundertaken specific actions, the results of which are \nencouraging. \n Such actions include, inter alia, the preparation of \na timetable for transition, designed and accepted by all \nparties involved on the basis of a participatory and \ninclusive dialogue, which should lead to democratic, \nfree and transparent elections with a view to returning \nto constitutional order. There is also the fight against \ndrugs and narcotics, against the embezzlement of \npublic funds, organized crime and other social ills. \nAdditionally, there will be a special programme to \nmeet the basic needs of the population, including water \nand electricity, as well as the beginning of reform of \nthe security and defence sectors. \n In this context, the National Council for \nDemocracy and Development enjoys a close working \nrelationship with national stakeholders. This synergy of \nactivities has allowed for the establishment of an ad \nhoc committee that has evaluated and revised the \ntransition timetable. Following the new timetable, the \npresidential elections will be held in January 2010 and \nthe legislative elections in March of that year. In \nparallel, a relationship of trust and cooperation has \nbeen established with the International Contact Group \non Guinea, whose mission is to accompany this process \nof transition. \n The CNDD and the Government attach particular \nimportance to the fight against drugs and narcotics in \nour country, which, unfortunately, in recent years has \nbecome one of the hubs of this trade in West Africa. \nThe recent discovery of toxic substances and \nunderground laboratories in certain towns of our \ncountry illustrates the seriousness of the situation. The \nbold operations undertaken by the new authorities have \nled to arrests within the highest echelons of the \nsecurity and defence forces and the civil service. \n The Republic of Guinea is seeking the support of \nthe international community in this stabilization effort. \nWe call for the application of the Political Declaration \nand Plan of Action on International Cooperation \ntowards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to \nCounter the World Drug Problem adopted by the \nCommission on Narcotic Drugs at its fifty-second \nsession, held in Vienna in March 2009. \n The Guinean Government has also carried out \nactivities to bring ethical management to the handling \nof public finances. In this area, audits have revealed \nmany cases of financial misappropriation at high levels \nwithin the State. The funds recovered so far have been \nused to partially finance the programme to provide \nwater and electricity for all, launched by the CNDD to \nimprove the living conditions of the population. My \ndelegation renews its call to development partners for \nincreased material, financial and technical support \nduring the period of transition in Guinea. \n On behalf of the CNDD and the President of the \nRepublic, His Excellency Captain Moussa Dadis \nCamara, the Guinean Government expresses its \nprofound gratitude to all those who support its efforts \nin the framework of a peaceful, consensual and \n \n \n21 09-52604 \n \nsuccessful transition. The Guinean authorities wish to \nthank all those who have shown their goodwill, in \nparticular the leader of the Libyan Revolution and His \nMajesty the King of Morocco, as well as Their \nExcellencies the Presidents of Senegal, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, \nBurkina Faso, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Mali, for \neverything they have done in favour of unity, \nreconciliation and stability in Guinea. The Guinean \nauthorities also express their thanks to all leaders from \nAfrica and elsewhere who have been prepared to \nprovide various kinds of help to ensure the historic and \nexemplary success of the transition process in our \ncountry. \n The agenda of the Assembly\u2019s present session \nincludes several recurrent questions, real challenges to \nthe construction of a new world order founded on \njustice, solidarity and sustainable development. \nRealizing these aspirations remains dependent on the \ninternational community fulfilling its commitments to \ndeveloping countries, which are bearing the brunt of \nthe global economic and financial crisis. This is yet \nmore necessary because, despite the progress that has \nbeen made in the fight against pandemics, illiteracy \nand extreme poverty, immense efforts are still needed \nfor the full and harmonious achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n Therefore, the establishment of a partnership that \nprioritizes the development of Africa through \nsubstantial increases in aid and investment flows is \nclearly indispensable. The question of foreign debt, \nwhich seriously compromises our efforts to eradicate \npoverty, merits particular attention. Furthermore, the \nlow prices we receive for basic commodities, together \nwith the unpredictability of nature, the harmful effects \nof human activity on the environment and climate \nchange, all contribute to rendering African economies \nfragile and lead to precarious agricultural and food \nproduction. \n With regard to peace and security, significant \nprogress has been made in the prevention and \nresolution of conflicts. However, areas of tension still \nexist here and there, with the associated loss of human \nlife, unspeakable suffering, destruction of property and \nflows of refugees and displaced persons. \n In Africa, the peace and reconciliation process at \nthe national level is making progress, thanks to \nconcerted actions on the part of the African Union and \nsubregional organizations, supported by the international \ncommunity, despite human rights violations and bad \neconomic and political governance. In the Mano River \nbasin, the success of the vigorous peacebuilding \nmeasures in Sierra Leone and Liberia gives us cause for \ncomfort and hope. Through the implementation of the \nOuagadougou Political Agreement, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is \nconsolidating its reunification and is in the process of \norganizing free elections. The Republic of Guinea \nsupports this process. \n Elsewhere on the continent, the successful \nholding of presidential elections in Guinea-Bissau and \nMauritania augurs well for a new era, conducive to \nnational reconciliation, peace, stability and progress. In \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United \nNations, the African Union and neighbouring countries \nare engaged in a dialogue that will without a doubt lead \nto the re-establishment of peace in the east of the \ncountry, which is a yardstick for stability, security and \ndevelopment in the Great Lakes region.  \n With regard to Somalia and the situation in \nDarfur, the international community must step up its \nefforts alongside the African Union in order to bring \nabout a rapid and durable political solution. \n Regarding the Western Sahara, while we welcome \nthe efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special \nEnvoy, my country welcomes the Moroccan initiative \nfor the negotiation of an autonomous status for the \nSahara region. We urge the parties concerned to find a \nmutually acceptable political outcome to this dispute. \n With regard to the Middle East, Guinea remains \nconvinced that solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \nnecessarily requires a comprehensive solution, leading \nto the creation of an independent, sovereign and viable \nPalestinian State living side by side and in peace with \nIsrael within secure and internationally recognized \nborders, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of \nthe Security Council and the road map of the Quartet. \nThe international community has a duty to ensure that \nthis comes about. \n In Asia, Guinea reaffirms its commitment to the \nprinciple of one China and to the peaceful reunification \nof the Korean peninsula. \n Terrorist acts are proliferating throughout the \nworld, indiscriminately affecting innocent victims, \nincluding women, children and the elderly. Those \nforms of barbarism and intolerance must be condemned \nin no uncertain terms. My delegation welcomes the \n  \n \n09-52604 22 \n \nadoption by the United Nations of the United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We remain in \nfavour of developing a comprehensive international \nconvention against terrorism and hope that \nconsultations on this issue will continue in a spirit of \nfull cooperation.  \n My country continues to pay great attention to \ninternational efforts in the area of disarmament and \nweapons control. We express our support for the \nbanning and total destruction of nuclear, biological and \nchemical weapons, as well as the eradication of the \ntrade in fissile materials. In Africa, the illicit and \nuncontrolled circulation of small arms and light \nweapons is a source of instability for States and of \ninsecurity for the population. The Economic \nCommunity of West African States has adopted a \nconvention on this issue with the objective of \nestablishing a climate of peace through a framework \nfor cooperation between member States for the \nsystematic control and elimination of these weapons, \nwhich fuel civil wars. The success of this programme \nrequires the commitment of all member States and the \nsupport of bilateral and multilateral partners. \n The world finds itself facing a grave and \nunprecedented financial and economic crisis. Africa \nhas not been spared the contagious effects of this crisis. \nThe report of the Secretary-General details how our \ncontinent has seen setbacks in such crucial areas as \neconomic growth, agricultural development, the \neradication of poverty and the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n The time has come to rethink the international \nfinancial architecture in order to adapt it to the realities \nof the twenty-first century in terms of its representation \nof Member States and its working methods, as well as \nthe equitable distribution of resources. \n Innovative initiatives are essential in the areas of \ntrade, official development assistance, debt alleviation, \ntechnology transfer and financing for developing \ncountries in general and least developed countries in \nparticular to enable them to benefit as much as possible \nfrom globalization. In that context, the commitments \nmade at Monterrey, Johannesburg, Doha, London and \nPittsburgh within the framework of the Group of 20 are \ngrounds for hope. It is important that the Doha Round \nnegotiations swiftly lead to an agreement on measures \nto promote development and put an end to abject \npoverty. \n My country attaches the greatest importance to \nincreasing and improving official development \nassistance and making it more predictable and more \naligned with national priorities, in accordance with the \nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.  \n Guinea welcomes the progress made in \nimplementing the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt \nInitiative. Given the debt burden, we urge donors to \nwork to strengthen resources and national and \ninternational capacities to support the strategies put in \nplace to make the requirements for reaching its \ncompletion point more flexible. \n The international community must fully support \nthe implementation of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment, which commits the continent to \ndeveloping infrastructure and promoting human rights, \nthe rule of law, democracy and the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n The problems related to climate change have \ndrawn the attention of all States because of the threat \nthat phenomenon poses to humanity. Guinea, which \noccupies a central place in the implementation of \npolicies and strategies for sustainable development and \nthe restoration of ecological balances in West Africa, is \naware of the seriousness of the situation and the urgent \nneed for action. My delegation strongly calls for \nconcerted and courageous international action to put an \nend to the paradox wherein countries and populations \nthat have contributed least to global warming are \nsuffering its most serious consequences. We hope that \nthe forthcoming Copenhagen summit will meet the \ngreat expectations of humanity.  \n In addition, particular attention must be accorded \nthe problems related to migratory flows and the many \nissues underlying them. It is only by promoting \neffective solidarity that we will be able to manage \nmigratory flows. \n Today\u2019s world is beset by swift, complex and \nprofound changes. Peace, development and the \ninterdependence of nations remain undeniable realities \nand factors essential for a prosperous world of \nsolidarity. Therefore, multilateralism is the only viable \nalternative for addressing the global challenges facing \nhumanity. My delegation remains convinced that the \npresent session will further strengthen the role and the \nactivities of our universal Organization in the defence \nof just causes."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nGovernment and people of the Commonwealth of the \nBahamas, I convey my sincere congratulations on \nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki\u2019s election to preside over the \n \n \n47 09-52470 \n \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. My \ndelegation wishes to assure him of its full cooperation \nand support throughout this session. I would also like \nto take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor, \nFather Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, on his \nstewardship of the sixty-third session. \n The current global financial and economic crisis, \npossibly the worst since the Great Depression, \nthreatens to negate all that we have achieved thus far \non our development agenda, at both the national and \nthe international levels. This threat was acknowledged \nat the High-Level Event on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in September 2008. The \nscenario is no better today. \n The fallout for the Bahamas has been \nconsiderable. Ours is a very small, open economy that \nis closely linked to the performance of most developed \neconomies. Tourism matters in the Bahamas; it is our \nprimary industry and it affects all aspects of economic \nlife in our country. We are in the midst of arguably one \nof the most difficult tourism seasons on record. Visitor \narrivals are down, hotel occupancies are down and \nrevenues earned from tourism are down. \nUnemployment has sharply increased. The continued \neconomic uncertainty means that unemployment will \npose a problem until the global economy is stabilized \nand returns to growth. In this regard, we are heartened \nby some of the signs of global economic recovery. \n The Government of the Bahamas acted quickly to \nsoften the impact of the international economic \ndownturn on our population. We took appropriate steps \nto ensure the continued integrity of our domestic fiscal \nand financial system; we accelerated planned capital \nworks to generate employment and economic activity; \nand we increased targeted social relief for those most \ndisadvantaged by the crisis. In implementing these \npolicies and programmes, the Government exercised \nappropriate fiscal restraint, so as to ensure \nsustainability in the long term as well as the medium \nterm and to encourage and ensure that the economy \nwould be well placed to respond swiftly to any upturn \nin the global economy. The Bahamas believes that it is \ncritically important to global financial health that \nactions taken at the national level be complemented by \nappropriate international responses. \n This year the General Assembly will consider the \nscale of assessments for the apportionment of the \nexpenses of the United Nations for the period 2010-\n2012, as well as the scale of assessments for the \napportionment of the expenses of United Nations \npeacekeeping operations. The Bahamas takes this \nopportunity to reiterate its long-standing position that \nper capita gross national income (GNI) should not be \ngiven undue weight in determining capacity to pay, as \nit often leads to distortions. Nowhere is this distortion \nmore visible than in the case of the scale of \nassessments for peacekeeping operations. The current \nscales place the Bahamas, a small developing island \nnation, in the same category as the most developed \neconomies in the world, with the exception of the \npermanent members of the Security Council. This \nunjust formula creates an onerous burden, and we call \nupon this body to address the inequity, which seriously \nundermines the development objectives of the \nBahamas, as well as other developing countries. \n Clearly the GNI criterion does not properly \nreflect either the vulnerability of our economy or the \nextraordinary costs associated with the duplication of \ninfrastructure required by our archipelagic \nconfiguration. Yet, despite our vulnerabilities, we have \nnever wavered in our responsibilities as a fully fledged \nmember of the international community and will \ncontinue to meet our obligations to the United Nations \nin the manner prescribed and agreed. While my \nGovernment is committed to paying its assessed \ncontributions in a full and timely manner, we believe \nthat the proposed scale of assessments is unfair and \nunduly burdensome to countries such as the Bahamas, \nand should therefore be reconsidered and adjusted, \ntaking into account those considerations that reflect our \nvulnerabilities. \n Climate change presents acute challenges for \nsmall island developing States such as the Bahamas, \nand we are certainly vulnerable to its impact. One of \nthe major consequences of climate change for the \nBahamas has been the increase in the number, \nfrequency and ferocity of the hurricanes affecting our \ncountry and region over the last two decades. \nRestoration and recovery efforts required as a result of \nthese extreme events have taken a toll amounting to \nhundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade \nalone, diverting scarce resources from other critically \nimportant national development programmes and \ncompromising our efforts at sustainable development. \n Hence, we have a special interest not only in \nactions taken to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate \nchange but also in measures designed to slow \u2014 \n  \n \n09-52470 48 \n \nindeed, to reverse \u2014 actions that negatively affect \nclimate. As a founding member of the Alliance of \nSmall Island States, the Bahamas has joined with many \nlike-minded States in our region and around the world \nin calling for a global agreement in Copenhagen, with \nlegally binding targets, that will permit us to achieve \nthe ultimate objectives of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \n The Bahamas is cognizant that the responsibility \nfor climate change does not rest with developed \ncountries alone. Within our limited capabilities, we \nhave undertaken a number of appropriate actions, \nhighlighted during the High-Level Event, in order to \nincrease our resistance to the adverse impacts of \nclimate change. But it is also important that initiatives \nundertaken in the quest for environmental protection \ndo not cause greater harm than good. For example, the \nintroduction of an air-passenger levy will damage our \nalready weakened tourism industry, the industry that is \nour economic lifeline. The proposed marine bunkering \nlevies or taxes are likely to have a similar negative \nimpact on our maritime registry\u2019s cost competitiveness. \nSuch supposedly well-intentioned environmental \ninitiatives come at a time when resources available for \nadaptation are not readily available to small island \ndeveloping States like the Bahamas. \n As an archipelagic nation, the Bahamas faces \nparticular challenges in the area of maritime safety and \nsecurity. My Government has committed tremendous \nfinancial and technical resources to combat illicit \ntrafficking of drugs and weapons; illegal, unreported \nand unregulated fishing and human smuggling, and \nunderscores the need for effective cooperation and \ncoordination among States, as well as the development \nof innovative approaches to resolve those issues and \ncomplement national efforts. The Bahamas welcomes \nthe constructive engagement of the United Nations and \nthe International Maritime Organization in addressing \nthe issue of piracy. As the country with the world\u2019s \nthird largest ship registry, the Bahamas will continue to \nengage with its partners in the international community \nto ensure the safety and security of international \nshipping. \n Haiti is a near neighbour and a member of our \nCaribbean Community (CARICOM). The Bahamas and \nthe Caribbean Community States are committed to \nHaiti\u2019s stabilization and to its political and economic \ndevelopment in the short and long terms. This cannot \nbe achieved without sustained support from the \ninternational community. The Bahamas is therefore \nheartened by the United Nations active and sustained \nengagement in Haiti over the past four and a half years, \nthrough the work of the United Nations Stabilization \nMission in Haiti. We share the hope of the Secretary-\nGeneral that Haiti is moving away from a history of \nconflict towards a future of peaceful and sustainable \ndevelopment. \n We call on the Security Council to further extend \nthe mandate of the United Nations Stabilization \nMission in Haiti beyond 15 October 2009, as \nrecommended by the Secretary-General. We are also \nhopeful that the recent appointment of former United \nStates President Bill Clinton as the Secretary-General\u2019s \nSpecial Envoy for Haiti will help to keep the issues \naffecting Haiti at the forefront of the agenda of the \nnational and international community. The Security \nCouncil meeting on Haiti earlier this month was \ncertainly most welcome in this regard. \n An increased level of criminal activity is creating \nnew challenges for the Bahamas \u2014 a phenomenon \nshared with other countries in our region. We continue \nto implement national and regional anti-crime \ninitiatives to combat this scourge, which undermines \nour economies and, indeed, affects our social stability. \n Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and small arms \nand light weapons are major contributing factors to this \nphenomenon. The Bahamas \u2014 as many are aware \u2014 is \nnot a producer of illicit drugs; neither the Bahamas nor \nthe other States members of CARICOM are \nmanufacturers or suppliers of small arms and light \nweapons. Yet, illicit drugs and light weapons account \noverwhelmingly for the amount of crime in our \nsocieties. A disproportionate amount of our scarce \nbudgetary resources are dedicated to fighting illicit \ndrug and light arms trafficking through our territory \nand in dealing with the terrible fallout in our \ncommunities. \n The Bahamas is fully committed to enhancing \nregional and international cooperation in the area of \npeace and security. We are pleased that the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime has agreed to \nre-engage with the Caribbean region to support the \nfight against the crime and violence that today mar our \nsocieties. \n In closing, my delegation wishes to state that the \ncurrent economic crisis dramatically demonstrates the \ninterdependence of the economies of the world. This in \n \n \n49 09-52470 \n \nturn shows the critically important role which \norganizations like the United Nations can play in \nfacilitating dialogue and crafting creative solutions to \nglobal problems. As we continue to face these \nunprecedented global challenges, the Bahamas \nreaffirms its commitment to engaging fully and \nconstructively with its partners in the international \ncommunity to find collective solutions to the \nchallenges which confront all of us."

        "file_text": "First of \nall, I would like very warmly to congratulate you, Sir, \non your election to preside over the General Assembly \nat its sixty-fourth session. I am certain that, thanks to \nyour recognized experience and wisdom, you will be \nable to enrich our discussions and provide an \nappropriate framework for our deliberations. That will \nensure that, through our joint efforts, this session is a \nproductive and special one that strengthens the role and \nimproves the work of the Organization as the principal \ninternational body for multilateral action and the \nfulcrum of our joint efforts. I should also like to \ncommend your predecessor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, for his efforts during the previous session, \nwhich we appreciate. I also thank and commend His \nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \n We are pleased to see concrete trends towards \nenhancing multilateralism in the United Nations. We \nare convinced that such a course of action is the best \nand most effective way to reach agreement and take up \nthe complex international challenges we face. These \nchallenges cannot be confronted by one country on its \nown, because they are transnational and complex in \nnature and require concerted international action under \nthe auspices of a single international organization in \nwhich all participate. Although some have doubted the \neffectiveness of the United Nations and its ability to \naddress the challenges and problems of the twenty-first \ncentury, there is no doubt that, because of the \nuniversality of its membership, it remains the ideal \nforum to address the current challenges facing peoples \nand Governments, of which we are all aware. As we \nare all aware, the current tendency to marginalize \nmultilateral efforts \u2014 particularly those of the United \nNations \u2014 has negative effects that only make \nproblems more complex, instead of helping to \novercome or resolve them. \n The United Nations and its subsidiary organs \nrequire reform, including financial and administrative \nreform, so that the Organization can be fully effective \nin addressing present and future international \nchallenges. Such challenges have arisen as a result of \nstructural and systemic changes since the establishment \nof the Organization, as well as technological \nadvancements, such as the information and \ncommunications revolution, and the well-known \neffects of globalization. All of this has made the world \na global village in which everybody feels the negative \neffects of problems and challenges such as \ndesertification, climate change, terrorism, poverty, \npandemics and the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.  \n Among the major achievements of the United \nNations is its pioneering role in seeking to eliminate \ncolonization and occupation in order to ensure the right \nof all peoples to self-determination. Although the \nOrganization has assumed ongoing responsibility for \nthe question of Palestine, Israel has, unfortunately, \nbeen occupying Palestinian and Arab territories since \n1967 to prevent the Palestinian people from exercising \ntheir right to self-determination by creating an \nindependent State on their national soil in the West \nBank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on \nthe basis of the line of 4 June 1967. Israel continues \nalso to occupy the Syrian Golan and some Lebanese \nterritory. For their part, the Arabs adopted the Arab \nPeace Initiative at the 2002 Beirut Summit and have \nreaffirmed its principles at all subsequent Arab \nsummits, including that held in Doha last spring. \n Discussions continue on the two-State solution \nand on a comprehensive peace, which would permit the \nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State and \nenable Syria and Lebanon to recover their occupied \nterritories. That would provide a just and agreed \nsolution to the question of Palestinian refugees in \naccordance with the provisions of resolution 194 (III), \n \n \n45 09-52586 \n \nwhich would ensure peace and security, with \nrecognition of Israel by all Arab States. Israel \ncontinues to reject the Arab and international option of \na just and comprehensive peace and a two-State \nsolution under the international terms of reference and \nthe Arab Peace Initiative. Therefore, a good-faith \nresponse reflecting genuine and positive political will \nmust be forthcoming. \n There has been unprecedented support in the \ninternational community \u2014 including in the Arab \nworld and among the Palestinians \u2014 for the \nconsiderable and sincere efforts being made by United \nStates President Barack Obama and his Administration \nwith a view to the holding of serious negotiations \nleading to the two-State solution and the establishment \nof a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, which \nwould be in the interest of the United States, Palestine, \nthe Arabs, the Israelis and the entire world. We in \nJordan, under the auspices of His Majesty \nKing Abdullah Bin Al Hussein, son of His late Majesty \nKing Hussein, continue to strive tirelessly to attain that \nnoble objective, which our people deserve. \n The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan fully supports \nthe statement made by United States President Barack \nObama on 23 September (see ). It provided a \nclear vision of a definitive solution and of terms of \nreference that would end the 1967 Israeli occupation in \norder to permit the establishment of a viable, \nindependent Palestinian State with contiguous territory, \nliving side by side in peace and security with Israel, \nand achieve peace among Syria, Lebanon and Israel. \nWith regard to the political terms of reference for \nnegotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, \nPresident Obama stated that the final-status issues of \nsecurity for Israelis and Palestinians, borders, refugees \nand Jerusalem were key to successful negotiations. We \nappreciate the importance of his comments regarding \nthe illegality of the settlements.  \n Thus, President Obama has demonstrated his firm \ncommitment to a two-State solution and a \ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. Since his first \nday in office, he has continued to seek to create a \nconstructive atmosphere conducive to the swift \nresumption of serious negotiations, on all issues and on \nall tracks. \n The international community as a whole must \nalso shoulder its responsibility to ensure the swift \nresumption of negotiations and their success. In that \nconnection, I wish to express our appreciation and full \nsupport to His Excellency President Mahmoud Abbas \nfor his commitment to peace based on genuine \npartnership, fundamental Palestinian and Arab \nprinciples and the international framework, as well as \nhis sincere engagement on behalf of the Palestinian \nAuthority in all efforts to achieve a two-State solution, \nwhich was demonstrated once again at the tripartite \nmeeting organized by President Obama in New York at \nthe beginning of this week. \n This constructive and appropriate atmosphere has \nbeen marred by the actions of Israel, which refuses to \nhalt its settlement activities, including in occupied East \nJerusalem, where it continues to take unilateral action. \nIts excavations continue under and around the Al-Aqsa \nmosque and other areas that are part of the Islamic and \nChristian cultural heritage. It continues to demolish the \nhomes of Arabs and to expel them. Israel is doing this \nin order to alter the demographic character of East \nJerusalem, which has an Arab religious and historical \nidentity. It is at the heart of the occupied territories and \nis inextricable from them. The Security Council and \nthe General Assembly have declared those Israeli \nactions null and void.  \n From this rostrum today, we ask Israel to return \nto the peace process that everyone supports and to put \nan end to its illegal measures, including its settlement \nactivities, in order to create an atmosphere conducive \nto the resumption of serious and productive peace \nnegotiations on all tracks, in particular on such issues \nas monitoring mechanisms that include clear timetables \nand benchmarks for assessing the status of mutual \nimplementation once negotiations have ended.  \n There can be no doubt that the United Nations \nhas a direct role and an obligation in this regard, given \nits permanent responsibility for the question of \nPalestine, alongside the role of the Quartet, which we \nfully support. The Organization could also play a \nbigger part in the negotiations and verification \nmechanisms, as well as on other crucial issues.  \n We reaffirm the importance of the role of the \nmembers of the Quartet \u2014 the European Union, the \nRussian Federation, the United States and the United \nNations. The blockade on Gaza must be lifted. Every \nday, our people there are suffering tragically, and they \nlack basic commodities. It is unacceptable and \nunreasonable that the siege should continue and the \n  \n \n09-52586 46 \n \nsituation persist. The inhumane blockade must be \nended and Gaza must be rehabilitated.  \n We hope that Palestinian reconciliation efforts are \nsuccessful, and we fully support Egypt\u2019s efforts in that \nregard. We should pay particular attention to the report \nof the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the \nGaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), and we hope that it will \npromote the necessary follow-up.  \n The United Nations has played a central role in \nestablishing an international human rights protection \nsystem and international mechanisms for promoting \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. The \nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan is honoured to have \nbeen a member of the Human Rights Council twice \nsince its establishment. We appreciate the international \nrecognition of our policies on the protection of human \nrights and fundamental freedoms, adopted by my \ncountry under King Abdullah II.  \n In addition, the United Nations provided the \nimpetus for international efforts to establish the \nInternational Criminal Court as a permanent \ninternational judicial body to try cases of war crimes, \ncrimes against humanity and flagrant violations of \nhuman rights. Jordan actively participated in the Rome \nDiplomatic Conference that brought about the adoption \nof the Court\u2019s Statute. We had the privilege of chairing \nthe first meeting of States members of the Court.  \n The United Nations has also played a significant \nrole in codifying international humanitarian law: its \nCharter prohibits recourse to the use or the threat of \nuse of force in international relations. The \nOrganization subsequently supported the adoption of \nthe major international conventions on that issue, in \nparticular the four Geneva Conventions, of which we \nare marking the sixtieth anniversary, as well as the \n1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural \nProperty in the Event of Armed Conflict.  \n The United Nations has made great progress on \nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nin particular nuclear weapons, through the unlimited \nextension in 1995 of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Here, \nwe call for compliance with the other decisions \naccompanying the decision to extend the NPT from \n1995 and for recognition of the Middle East region as a \nzone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of \nmass destruction. \n We affirm our country\u2019s commitment to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \nwhile also reaffirming our legitimate right to the \npeaceful use of nuclear energy and to strengthening \ncontrol mechanisms that would prevent peaceful \nprogrammes from being used as a cover for military \nones. We are resolved to make peaceful use of nuclear \nenergy, and we have adopted all the agreements, \ndocuments and verification mechanisms of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. \n The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan supports all \ninternational efforts to bring into force the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We encourage \ncountries to adopt and ratify the Treaty so that it may \nenter into force as soon as possible, which would be a \nstep forward towards nuclear disarmament. We call for \nadherence to Security Council resolution 1887 (2009), \nadopted on 24 September.  \n My country has always been and will remain at \nthe forefront in the fight against terrorism and \nextremism and in working to bring religions and \ncivilizations closer together, as well as in transmitting \nthe true and admirable essence of Islam and its noble \nhuman values. We have therefore adopted important \ninitiatives, including the Amman Message issued by \nHis Majesty the King, and its accompanying document, \nthe Good Word.  \n Jordan supports comprehensive national \nreconciliation in Iraq among all segments of the \npopulation, with no exception. It supports efforts to \nconsolidate peace and security in Iraq in all spheres so \nas to ensure civil peace, territorial integrity, political \nindependence and sovereignty and to stop all external \ninterference in its internal affairs so that that brother \ncountry can fully recover its place in the region and in \nthe world at large.  \n Finally, Jordan is committed to international \npeace and security. We participate actively in \npeacekeeping operations. The number of personnel that \nwe contribute to the various peacekeeping operations \nin which we are taking part is growing and becoming \ngeographically broader. This demonstrates that we are \ntruly playing an active role in the United Nations, \nbecause we are backing up our words with action. It \nalso shows our clear political resolve to contribute to \nserious multilateral action within the United Nations \nsystem. \n \n \n47 09-52586 \n \n I would like to reiterate that we will do what is \nnecessary, and more, to strengthen multilateral \ninternational action for efforts to implement a two-\nState solution and to achieve comprehensive peace in \nthe Middle East, and for anything that contributes to \ninternational cooperation and to bringing together \ndiverse civilizations, which would enrich the lives of \nour societies in the world that we share."

        "file_text": "In the beginning, there \nwere 51 nations committed to international peace and \nsecurity, sharing the common goal of developing \nfriendly relations among nations, and promoting social \nprogress, better living standards and human rights. \nToday, the 51 nations of the first session of the General \nAssembly have become 192. Today, the General \nAssembly really is the town hall meeting of the world. \n On behalf of the 27 States members of the \nEuropean Union (EU), I bring a message of \ncooperation and partnership \u2014 a message that our \nUnion is open to the outside world.  \n Globalization is good. Through globalization, \nhundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of \npoverty; information, ideas and inventions shared; \ngoods and services provided. It all moves quickly from \none country to another. We prosper from this. It \nenlightens us. It helps us to understand the ways of \nother parts of the world. \n At the same time, globalization means that one \nnation\u2019s problems will also come knocking at the doors \nof other nations. Pandemics, food crises, organized \ncrime, trafficking in drugs and humans, terrorism and \nviolent ideologies are no longer limited by borders and \nno longer only one nation\u2019s problem. And so, we have \nto manage the risks and threats that follow. \n In this work, we need the United Nations broad-\nbased legitimacy for international actions and norms to \ncoordinate our efforts. And the United Nations, for its \npart, has to adapt in order to stay relevant and to be \nable to address the issues before us. The European \nUnion wishes to contribute to these efforts. \n We welcome the declared wish of the United \nStates to work together with others in multilateral \ninstitutions. This opens the door to a promising new \nera in international cooperation. \n We are facing one of the biggest challenges of \nour generation. Our world has a fever, and the fever is \nrising. In the most vulnerable of the world\u2019s nations, \nthe consequences of climate change will be alarming. \nStarvation, severe flooding and climate migration will \nbe a reality even if we keep to the two-degree target set \nby the United Nations. \n No doubt, developed countries will have to lead \nthe fight against climate change. By 2020, we will have \nto reduce emissions by 25 to 40 per cent from 1990 \nlevels. But if emissions are to peak by no later than \n2020, to be reduced by at least 50 per cent by 2050 and \nto continue to decline thereafter, our efforts alone will \nnot be enough. The developing countries need our help. \nThey need our help to pay the bill that we, through our \nemissions, have contributed to. \n That is why the European Union last week agreed \nto start discussions on how much climate financing is \nneeded in developing countries. That is why we are \ntaking concrete steps. That is why we are putting one \nmore brick into the negotiations, and urge other \ndeveloped countries to do the same. \n At the meeting of the leaders of the G-8 and the \nMajor Economies Forum in Italy this summer, there \nwas agreement on the two-degree target. Now, we need \nto see increased commitment and concrete mid-term \ntargets from developed as well as developing countries. \nIf we want our children and their children to \nexperience nature as we know it, we must act now. And \nevery nation or group of nations has to do its part. \n The EU is willing to do its part. We will reduce \nour emissions. We will promote low carbon growth, \ncontribute our fair share of financing and support \nadaptation worldwide. And we will remain committed \nto playing a lead role in bringing about a global and \ncomprehensive climate agreement in Copenhagen in \nDecember. \n What started out as the pursuit of easy money, \nunhealthy risk-taking and, in some cases, pure greed \n  \n \n09-52179 48 \n \nescalated this past year into a financial roller coaster. \nThe effects on both human security and development \nhave been severe. The European Union will continue to \npromote global financial stability and sustainable \nworld recovery, firmly committed to taking \ncomprehensive, targeted and coordinated action to \nsupport developing countries, especially the poorest \nand the most vulnerable; determined to reach a \ncomprehensive agreement at the Doha Round, making \nsure it contains elements of real value for developing \ncountries, particularly the poorest; and continuing its \nefforts to lift more people out of poverty in reaching \nthe Millennium Development Goals and to achieve our \nrespective official development assistance targets. \n Human rights are universal. Human rights are \nindivisible. The European Union is a voice for human \nrights. We believe in democracy. We believe in the rule \nof law. The European Union will continue to call for \nthe worldwide abolition of the death penalty in all \ncases and under all circumstances. We will continue to \nstand up for the empowerment of women and gender \nequality. Without that, it will be impossible to draw on \nall those talents that are needed for a nation to move \nfrom poverty to development and prosperity. \n To uphold those fundamental values, we need \nsecurity. We cannot let war crimes, genocide or crimes \nagainst humanity go unpunished. Therefore, the work \nof the International Criminal Court is fully supported \nby the European Union. We cannot allow anyone, by \nthreat or use of force, to act against the territorial \nintegrity or political independence of any State. The \nrules of international law apply equally to all States, \nlarge and small. \n The European Union stands ready to continue \nworking with the United Nations in peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding. We also conduct our own peacekeeping \nefforts, often in close cooperation with the United \nNations. The transfers of responsibilities in Chad and \nin Kosovo are examples of that. \n Twenty years after the end of the cold war, peace \nand security are still threatened by the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and by the fact that those \nweapons risk falling into the wrong hands. We strongly \nurge the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to \nrenounce nuclear weapons, and we stand ready to \nengage in that matter. We also welcome the global \nnuclear security summit that will take place next year. \n Europe and Africa are close in geography, but \nalso through globalization and strong partnership. The \nEuropean Union provides support to Africa when \nneeded. Our naval operation Atalanta, off the coast of \nSomalia, protects vessels delivering humanitarian aid \nand provides support to the African Union Mission in \nSomalia. We have for many years cooperated with the \nUnited Nations in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo. \n We speak out on injustice on the African \ncontinent. The use of sexual violence as a weapon of \nintimidation and terror is appalling. The attacks on \nwomen and girls in eastern Congo and other places are \nunacceptable. To protect we must empower; and so, to \nempower women in conflict situations, Security \nCouncil resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) have \nto be implemented. \n We wish to see a free, democratic and prosperous \nAfrica. That is especially true in the case of Zimbabwe. \nThe Global Political Agreement and the formation of \nthe Government of National Unity were important \nsteps forward. However, implementing the Agreement \nrequires commitment. It requires a spirit of \ncooperation. In that regard, much remains to be done. \n Europe is a union of many cultures. Our openness \nto the world around us is evident in the fact that \nChristians, Jews and Muslims, those who believe in \nGod and those who do not, can live side by side in \nmutual respect. The European Union wishes to enhance \nits interaction with the Muslim world through the \nAlliance of Civilizations and through cooperation in \neducation and development by providing opportunities \nfor the young. In that way, we can create an \nenvironment that will allow us to focus on what we \nhave in common rather than on our perceived \ndifferences. \n Afghan children show the same curiosity as \nchildren all over the world, including my own, longing \nfor knowledge, wanting to take part and full of \nexcitement over what life has to offer. In order to \ninvest in the future of Afghanistan and in human \ndevelopment, we cannot let their light be shut out. As a \nfriend of the people of Afghanistan, the European \nUnion is committed to assisting them in stabilizing, \ndemocratizing and developing their country. Education, \nalso for young girls and women, is indispensable. In \nthe years ahead, we need to do more to ensure that this \nis the way forward for Afghanistan. \n \n \n49 09-52179 \n \n As a partner of Pakistan, we know that what \nhappens in Pakistan influences not only the Pakistanis, \nbut the development of the region as a whole. \nTherefore, it is crucial to continue to assist Pakistan in \nits efforts to develop the rule of law and to build a \nmore stable and more democratic society. \n As a friend of the people of Israel, we tell the \nIsraeli Government to reach out for peace, to end \noccupation, to respect international law, to work for a \ntwo-State solution, to immediately end all settlement \nactivities on occupied land, including East Jerusalem, \nand to end the isolation of Gaza. \n As a friend of the Palestinians, we expect them to \nstop all violent acts against Israel, to continue to build \nviable State institutions and to develop democracy and \nthe rule of law. We will continue both to provide \nfinancial support to the Palestinian Authority and to \nassist in capacity-building on the ground. In that \nregard, the European Union fully supports the United \nStates efforts to resume peace negotiations and to stand \nready to actively contribute to their success. The future \nof both Israel and Palestine lies in that cooperation. \n As a friend of the people of Iran, we are \nconcerned about the deteriorating human rights \nsituation and the violent crackdown on popular \nprotests. The Iranian nuclear issue represents a major \nchallenge to international peace and security, to \nregional stability and to the non-proliferation regime. \nIran must regain the trust of the international \ncommunity, comply with relevant Security Council \nresolutions and contribute to peace in the Middle East. \n As a friend of the people of Burma/Myanmar, we \nwill tell the military leaders that only democracy and \nhuman rights can bring peace and stability to the \npeople that they say they represent. \n The Swedish statesman and former United \nNations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld once \nsaid that the pursuit of peace and progress, with its \ntrials and its errors, its successes and its setbacks, can \nnever be relaxed and never abandoned. That was true \nthen and it is true today. The people of the world need \nto know that uniting nations is a work not of the past, \nbut of the future, carried forward by shared values and \nby mutual respect and ever more relevant with \nincreased globalization.  \n In that common endeavour, the European Union \nwill remain a reliable partner on security, development \nand human rights, always contributing actively to \nimproving and strengthening the United Nations, \nalways continuing to refine the instruments needed to \ndeal with opportunities and threats alike, and always \nwilling to do its part in helping to create a better world \nto live in for future generations, everywhere."

        "file_text": "I offer my congratulations \nto Mr. Treki on his assumption of the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. My \ndelegation assures him of our fullest cooperation \nduring his stewardship of this Assembly, which \nembodies the hopes, aspirations and shared vision of \npeace and development of all the peoples of our planet. \n When this session of the General Assembly ends \nnext year, the United Nations will have completed \n65 years of existence. These past decades have seen the \nworld change in fundamental ways. Connectivity \ndefines our global condition, and the challenges that \nwe collectively face are truly global. The resolution of \nthese challenges, as we are aware, requires global \napproaches and solutions. What may happen in one \npart of the world has an impact on other regions. In the \ncontext of these rapidly emerging changes and their \ndeep and diverse effects, we must consider more \ndeeply whether the United Nations and other global \ngovernance structures are geared to effectively meeting \nthe challenges that confront us all. \n It is of concern that, even after more than six \ndecades of existence, our international governance \nstructures are neither inclusive nor participatory. \nConsequently, these structures and institutions have not \nkept pace or evolved with the changed nature, intensity \nand depth of contemporary global issues. The question \nis therefore: Are these institutions able to address these \nchallenges adequately or satisfactorily? The reform and \nrestructuring of the global governance architecture are \nthe critical needs of our times, and the voices of the \ndeveloping world, including those of the small island \nnations and Africa, are of principal and core relevance \nif we are to have truly participatory and global \nresponses to global challenges. \n  \n \n09-52592 28 \n \n One need not look very far to identify these \nchallenges. The current economic and financial \nturmoil, which did not begin in the developing world, \nhas affected developing countries the most. Growth has \nslowed, with recession overtaking many countries. The \ninternational response to this challenge must consist \nnot only of the measures that have been taken to \nstimulate economies, but also, more importantly, of \nfinding ways to restructure the current international \ngovernance system, which has failed to respond to the \nvirulence of the financial and economic crisis. \n To gloss over this structural deficit of the current \nglobal financial and economic architecture would \nimperil the future of a vast majority of the peoples of \nthis world and presage greater difficulties in the future. \nIn the face of the current economic and financial crisis, \nhard-won gains in alleviating poverty, hunger, illiteracy \nand disease are being reversed. The achievements of \nthe Millennium Development Goals are seriously \nthreatened. Policies of protectionism under such \nalready adverse circumstances will exacerbate the \nserious situation that many countries face. \n It is imperative that the United Nations act in \nconcert to coherently overcome these challenges. India, \nwhich is actively engaged in the Group of 20 and other \nprocesses, has always stressed that developing \ncountries must receive priority in any global response \nto the crisis. The United Nations Conference on the \nFinancial and Economic Crisis held in June was \nopportune and provided a useful platform for \ncollectively seeking ways and means to respond to the \ncrisis. We now look forward to early implementation \nduring the course of this General Assembly of the \nfollow-up measures agreed on at the Conference. \n At the centre stage of multilateralism and \ninternational cooperation is the United Nations. This \nOrganization is a platform on which the world meets to \nexpress views and undertake commitments on global \nissues of mutual concern on an equal footing. It is no \nwonder, then, that the Charter of the United Nations \nbegins with the inspiring words \u201cWe the peoples of the \nUnited Nations\u201d. Inclusiveness and collective action in \nall aspects of the work of the Organization are at the \nheart of its Charter. This vision must be our lodestar, \nthe guiding principle of all we undertake. India is \ncommitted to working with Member States to make the \nUnited Nations more relevant and attuned to \ncontemporary realities.  \n Reforming the United Nations is a matter of the \nhighest priority. Four years after the 2005 World \nSummit, there has not been much progress even as \nnewer and more global crises and problems have \nemerged. We should not let slowness of action weaken \nthe Organization in the face of such challenges. Rather, \nwe must work in concert to make it more robust and \ncapable of effective response. \n Reform in the three essentials of the Charter \u2014 \npeace and security, development and human rights \u2014 \nrequires our collective attention. The General \nAssembly must be revitalized in full measure, and its \nrole as the anvil of global deliberation must be \nstrengthened. The Economic and Social Council must \nbecome the fulcrum of development. It must be \naccepted that the Security Council must be \nstrengthened and made more representative by \nexpanding its permanent and non-permanent \nmembership. Ongoing intergovernmental negotiations \nduring the past six months have unambiguously \nestablished that an overwhelming majority of Member \nStates share the perspective that an expansion in both \ncategories of Security Council membership is needed. \n Climate change is one of the most important \nglobal challenges that we face today. Developing \ncountries bear a disproportionate share of its adverse \neffects, even though they are not responsible for it. \nCognizant of the serious threat that climate change \nposes, India is engaged in the ongoing negotiations \nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (UNFCCC), including at the upcoming \nCopenhagen Conference. India will work for an \noutcome that recognizes the development imperatives \nof developing countries and is rooted in the principle \nof common but differentiated responsibilities and \nrespective capabilities. \n We also must move away from concentrating on \nmitigation only and ensure that there is a focus on \nadaptation, which is critical for developing countries. \nWe are hosting a high-level global conference on \n\u201cClimate Change: Technology Development and \nTransfer\u201d on 22 and 23 October 2009, in cooperation \nwith the United Nations. The objective of the \nconference is to help formulate a road map for \ntechnology in the context of climate change mitigation \nand adaptation to support the UNFCCC process. \n Developing countries must be supported \nfinancially, technologically and with capacity-building \n \n \n29 09-52592 \n \nresources so that they can cope with the immense \nchallenges of adaptation. Special efforts are required to \ndevelop programmes that address the critical needs of \nsmall island States and of the most vulnerable \ncountries. \n Poverty alleviation and livelihood security are \ncentral imperatives for India. To that end, accelerated \neconomic growth and energy security are critical \ndrivers. In pursuing our development goals, India has \nbeen successful in significantly reducing its energy \nintensity. India will continue to pursue that path. \n India is aware that the continuing volatility in the \nfossil-fuel markets, together with the threat of climate \nchange, makes the development of all renewable and \nclean energy sources \u2014 including nuclear energy \u2014 \ncrucial. In that context, international civil-nuclear \ncooperation is important. \n India has also taken several independent \ninitiatives to address the issue of climate change. We \nhave put in place a comprehensive policy and \nlegislative framework, as well as a national action plan \non climate change with eight separate national \nmissions. An unprecedented afforestation campaign has \nbeen launched with a doubling of the forestry budget \nthis year to $1.3 billion, and this increase is going to be \nsustained every year. The Prime Minister\u2019s Council has \napproved national missions for enhanced energy \nefficiency and solar energy, setting ambitious goals. \nWe are supporting and facilitating major research to \nassess various aspects related to climate change. \n India attaches the highest priority to the goal of \nnuclear disarmament and has an impeccable \nnon-proliferation record. We welcome the renewed \nglobal debate on achieving a world free of nuclear \nweapons. That corresponds with India\u2019s long-standing \nand consistent advocacy of nuclear disarmament as one \nof the highest priorities of the international community. \nWe have put forward a number of proposals on nuclear \ndisarmament at the United Nations, including a \nworking paper in 2006 proposing elements to fashion a \nnew consensus on disarmament and non-proliferation. \n Last year, at the sixty-third session of the General \nAssembly, consistent with India\u2019s long-standing \ncommitment as articulated in the Rajiv Gandhi Action \nPlan in 1988, India reiterated its proposal that a nuclear \nweapons convention be convened to ban the \nproduction, development, stockpiling and use of \nnuclear weapons and to provide for their complete \nelimination within a time frame. The international \nnuclear order cannot be discriminatory. Further, States \nmust fulfil the obligations that they have undertaken. \nOnce more, with feeling and with commitment, India \nreiterates that proposal. \n We will continue to engage with key countries to \nintensify this debate in the hope that greater \ninternational understanding will lend itself to a firm \ncommitment to action on nuclear disarmament. It was \nin that spirit that we supported the adoption of a \nprogramme of work, including on a fissile material cut-\noff treaty (FMCT), at the Conference on Disarmament \nin May this year. It is consistent with India\u2019s position \nto work with others at the Conference on Disarmament \ntowards the conclusion of a non-discriminatory, \nmultilaterally negotiated and internationally verifiable \nFMCT, provided it corresponds with India\u2019s national \nsecurity interests. We remain committed to a voluntary, \nunilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.  \n India stands committed to the safeguarding of \ninternational peace and security. Over the past five \ndecades, we have contributed more than \n100,000 peacekeepers and have suffered a high number \nof casualties during this time. Strengthening the \nnormative basis for peacekeeping operations and \ngiving major troop-contributing countries a greater say \nwill serve to make peacekeeping more effective. \n Peace, security, stability and the welfare of our \nneighbourhood are vital for India. There is a new \nbeginning in Sri Lanka; in Nepal, strengthening the \npeace process is in our collective interest; and in \nAfghanistan, the international community must remain \nintensively engaged and support its development \nefforts and the maintenance of peace and stability. \nIndia is committed to establishing good-neighbourly \nrelations and resolving all outstanding issues with \nPakistan through peaceful dialogue. \n The barbaric terrorist attack on the innocent \npeople of Mumbai on 26 November 2008 reminded us \nof the daily and malignant menace that terrorism poses \nto all countries. There can be no justification \nwhatsoever for such mindless terrorist acts. It is our \ncollective responsibility and duty to work together to \nensure that terrorists and the organizers, perpetrators \nand supporters of such crimes are brought to justice. \n In order to strengthen the international legal \nframework of the fight against terrorism, India has \nproposed a comprehensive convention on international \n  \n \n09-52592 30 \n \nterrorism. Discussions on the draft have gone on for far \ntoo long. It is time that the convention be finally \nadopted. India earnestly calls upon all countries to \nmake serious efforts in the next few weeks to arrive at \na consensus on the text. \n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate India\u2019s steadfast \ncommitment to the work of the United Nations. \nSpeaking to this Assembly 41 years ago, Prime \nMinister Indira Gandhi said:  \n  \u201cThe United Nations is the trustee of the \nworld\u2019s peace and represents the hopes of \nmankind. Its very existence gives a feeling of \nassurance that the justice of true causes can be \nbrought fearlessly before the world. This \nAssembly and the agencies of the United Nations \nshould, in all that they do, sustain those hopes \nand promote the causes of peace.\u201d (A/PV.1693, \npara. 150)  \nThe truth and conviction of these words are more \nmeaningful today than ever before."

        "file_text": "I must confess that, when I arrived in this \ncity to participate in this session of the General \nAssembly, I had intended to begin my statement with a \nstrong appeal on the need to rebuild multilateralism \nand cooperation as the two basic instruments to \novercome what today is undoubtedly the central issue \nin our global discussion, namely, overcoming the social \nand economic crisis. \nHowever, certain events on Monday and Tuesday \noblige me to begin my statement by reporting that the \nEmbassy of the Argentine Republic in Tegucigalpa, \nRepublic of Honduras, had its electricity cut off some \ntwo days ago. That, of course, was not because we had \nnot paid the bill, but was for far more serious reasons.  \n Next to the Argentine Embassy is a television \nstudio which broadcast the news of President Zelaya\u2019s \narrival in Honduras, the repression and the \ndemonstrations in favour of the return of democracy. \nThat was one of the reasons. In any event, we have had \nbetter luck than the Embassy of the sister Republic of \nBrazil, where, at an early stage they cut off not only \nthe electricity but the water as well \u2014 for having given \nshelter to the constitutional President, Manuel Zelaya. \n As a Latin American, I must recall that not even \nin Chile during the dictatorship of General Pinochet, or \nin Argentina during the dictatorship of General Jorge \nRafael Videla \u2014 perhaps the two cruelest dictatorships \nin Latin America \u2014 was there similar behaviour \nagainst embassies that were actively working to give \nshelter to refugees. \n I say this because it is crucial that we realize that \nwe must design and forge a multilateral strategy which \nis strong and specific to return democracy to Honduras. \nWe need a strategy which would actually allow for true \nrespect for human rights and ensure free and \ndemocratic elections \u2014 which can take place only with \nfull respect for the constitution. If we do not do this, \nwe would be setting a harsh precedent in a region \nwhere, for decades during the national security \ndoctrine, suspensions of democracy claimed the lives \nof thousands and thousands of Latin Americans, led to \nthe exile of many other and created the region\u2019s most \nserious economic and social tragedy in memory. \n  \n \n09-52228 2 \n \n I make this appeal because I played an active role \nfrom the platform of the Organization of American \nStates, and also accompanied the former President of \nthe General Assembly, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, to El Salvador in order to carry out a task \nwhich would safeguard two basic values which, in my \nopinion, our region has managed to develop: \ndemocracy and respect for human rights. \n Therefore, I believe that multilateralism would \nalso mean understanding that we have to set common \nand general rules in this globalized world that must be \naccepted by all countries. In this case, we are faced \nwith a cynical media coup which was carefully hidden \nor minimized because, in fact, it was slanted against \nthe advent of populist progressive Governments in the \nregion. I believe that, for all of us, defining \nmultilateralism is going to require specific actions and \nrules so that absolutely all of us will have the same \nparameters when it comes time to judge conduct, \nattitudes and institutional situations. \n Yesterday I took part in the climate change event \nconvened by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in order \nto bring positions closer together with a view to the \nCopenhagen Conference, which will take place in a \nlittle more than 10 weeks\u2019 time. A decade and a half \nago we agreed on the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, dealing with \nenvironmental protection, and we later adopted the \nKyoto Protocol in order to begin ensuring respect for \nthose obligations undertaken by nations. A decade and \na half later, it is clear that neither agreement is being \nsatisfactorily implemented. \n Essentially, this is sometimes because the nations \nmost responsible for pollution and gas emissions, \nwhich should bear greater responsibility for reducing \nthose emissions, in terms of investments both in their \nown countries and in developing countries, cannot \ncome to an agreement either. As I was saying yesterday \nin our meeting, I think we need to understand that the \nonly possibility of successfully approaching \nglobalization lies precisely in the setting of common \nrules which would be respected by all nations, \ndeveloped and developing. \n In this framework, we should mention the \nsituation of the Argentine Republic, where we still \nhave a colonial enclave, our Malvinas Islands, which \npersists without the possibility of addressing the \nquestion of sovereignty together with the United \nKingdom, as proclaimed in many General Assembly \nresolutions. We were recently able to agree, following \na humanitarian request, that family members with \nloved ones buried on the islands should be able to \ntravel there by air to inaugurate a cenotaph to pay \ntribute to those who fought for their homeland. \n All of this points to the very clear need to look at \nmultilateralism not only as a type of rhetorical \nstatement repeated every year in this or other \nmultilateral forums, but rather in terms of concrete \nresults. Otherwise, it will become increasingly \ncomplicated, with ever more unresolved problems. For, \nin the final analysis, the multilateralism we have been \npersistently proclaiming since 2003 has not been put \ninto practice. \n My country and the United States are the only \ntwo countries to have experienced attacks of \ninternational terrorism. For Argentina, the first was in \n1992, at the Embassy of Israel, and the second was at \nthe Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA). \nHundreds of people died in those attacks. Today, in this \nAssembly, I am joined by the head of AMIA, the entity \nthat was bombed, as well as by family members who \nhave accompanied him. \n In 2007, then-President N\u00e9stor Kirchner came \nhere to the Assembly (see A/62/PV.5) to call on the \nIslamic Republic of Iran to agree to extradite officials \nof its country wanted by the Argentine justice system \nin order to carry out a proper investigation and assign \nresponsibility for that serious attack. Last year, I \nmyself came here (see A/63/PV.5) to call once again on \nthe authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to \naccede to our request. I said that there were \nconstitutional guarantees in my country; that the \nprinciple that no one is guilty until proven guilty \nbeyond a shadow of a doubt prevails from one end of \nmy country to the other; and that we have guarantees \nfor freedom and the administration of justice. \nNevertheless, that did not happen. Instead, this year, \none of the officials whose extradition was sought by \nthe prosecutor on the case was promoted to minister.  \n I know that some 4, 5 or 15 speakers from now \nthe President of the Islamic Republic of Iran will take \nthe floor. Surely, he will once again deny tragedies that \noccurred in the course of western history in the \ntwentieth century. He will surely invoke the threat of \nother imperialisms. And he will also surely invoke \nGod. I would like to say to him that my country, the \n \n \n3 09-52228 \n \nArgentine Republic, is not an imperialist country \u2014 \nneither by way of belief nor as a reflection of our \nhistory. To the contrary, ours is a country that suffered \nfrom colonial oppression at its founding. During the \nworld\u2019s bipolar era, we also suffered from the doctrine \nof national security. I would like to tell him that, like \nhim, I believe in God. We may do so in different faiths \nbut, in the end, I believe that neither of us believes that \nGod could command us to prefer threats or to avoid \njustice from being done. \n As President of the Argentine Republic, therefore, \nI humbly reiterate once again our appeal for the \nextradition of the officials whom Argentina\u2019s justice \nsystem believes are responsible \u2014 not to be found \nguilty, but to be judged and to be allowed to take \nadvantage of all the rights and guarantees that every \nArgentine citizen and foreigner has in our country: \nguarantees under democracy, whose unconditional \ndefence Argentina has made part of its institutional and \nhistorical core. \n I would not wish to conclude without referring to \nthree events that I believe are very positive, which I \nwould like to share with the members of the Assembly \ntoday. The first took place quite recently, on \n9 September, when the Argentine Republic received a \nvisit from the Inter-American Commission on Human \nRights, including its Chair and the President of the \nInter-American Court of Human Rights. That visit \noccurred 30 years after the Court\u2019s first visit, during \nthe dictatorship, when it came to investigate the crimes \nthat were being committed and to take complaints from \nArgentine citizens \u2014 including our Minister for \nForeign Affairs, who is with me today and who, like \nhis father, was imprisoned at that time \u2014 and to hear \ntestimony about the serious violations that were taking \nplace. \n Thirty years later, the men who comprised the \nCommission and the men and women who are its \nmembers today visited an Argentina where criminals \nresponsible for genocide under the dictatorship are \nbeing tried by judges in accordance with the \nConstitution. We have also reached an agreement with \nthe Inter-American Court to send a bill to our \nlegislature \u2014 which I have already done \u2014 to \neliminate the crime of libel and defamation against \njournalists. That is homage to the freedom of \nexpression and of the press. But I also firmly believe \nthat it should apply to all citizens. It is offensive that, \nin the twenty-first century, someone could be sentenced \nto prison for having said something and said it freely. \n We have also reached an agreement to send up \ntwo bills \u2014 which we have also already done \u2014 to \ncontribute to the recovery of children born in captivity \nduring the dictatorship. Those will include provisions \nto ensure respect for the victims, as well as on society\u2019s \ncollective right to learn their identities. \n The second thing that I would like to share has to \ndo with the fact that I listened today to the President of \nthe United States speak about an issue that is crucial to \nworld peace and security, as well as to the rights of the \nPalestinian people. It is also a key component of a \nstrategy against international terrorism, which, as ever, \nwe continue to condemn. It is genuinely satisfying, and \na salve to the soul, to hear from the mouth of the \nPresident of the United States of America that there is a \nneed for the Palestinian people to be able to live on \ntheir land free of settlements of any kind, as well as, \nclearly, a right for Israel\u2019s citizens to live in peace \nwithin their borders. The words of the President and \nthe timely message he delivered at Cairo University, \nwhich many here likely followed with interest, place us \nin a position that we have not occupied for many years, \nnamely, the possibility of beginning negotiations \u2014 \nsuccessful ones, I hope \u2014 between the Palestinian \nAuthority and the Government of Israel to at last \nresolve a key issue for international peace and security, \nnamely, the Palestinian question. \n Lastly, I would like to tell the Assembly that, as a \nmember of the Group of 20 (G-20), which will meet \ntomorrow in Pittsburgh, we would like to call for the \npresence of another multilateral body to be heard from \nat those meetings: the International Labour \nOrganization. In the two previous G-20 meetings, there \nwas a great deal of discussion about the financial \ncrisis. However, as we did then, we continue to believe \nthat a key issue is to once again discuss the real \neconomy. That is why we believed it timely that \nworkers and business owners, as genuine actors in the \nreal economy and as catalysts to re-energizing it, \nshould be heard from as well in those forums, \nalongside officials from multilateral credit institutions \nand the World Bank. \n We are genuinely convinced that there is a need \nto build a new multilateralism in which all of us are \ngenuinely on an equal footing; where rights and \nobligations and the road map for the course to be taken \n  \n \n09-52228 4 \n \nare the same for rich and poor countries alike; and \nwhere the rights and responsibilities of developing \ncountries are the same as those of developed States. We \ntherefore agreed that equal rules of the game for the \nentire world was one of the basic elements of ensuring \nsuccess in building multilateralism. If we do not \nachieve this, we will continue with these rhetorical \nexercises year after year, but we will never achieve the \nresults that are not a right but an obligation for all of us \nwho make up this body. \n In conclusion, democracy, the defence of human \nrights, and equal rules for all countries in the world are \nthe three key elements to building a new \nmultilateralism. These three requirements must be \nequal and the same for all countries, but above all for \nthose that, through their own actions and because of \ntheir level of social and economic development, lead \nthe major developed countries of the world.  \n It is clear that those who have the greatest \nresponsibility and hold the greatest leadership roles \u2014 \nwon through military, technological, economic and \neven cultural power \u2014 also have an obligation to \nexercise that leadership in a responsible manner. This \nis what we, the developing and emerging countries, \nfeel, and what we ask of the major nations of the \nworld. They have the responsibility to build this world. \nThis will no doubt be echoed in all our speeches, but \nthis building must be done every day through our \ndecisions and concrete actions. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of my \ndelegation, I am pleased to join the speakers who have \npreceded me in congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki on his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. He may rest \nassured of the full support and cooperation of Barbados \nas he carries out his important duties. I wish also to \ntake this opportunity to express appreciation to his \npredecessor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for his \nleadership of the sixty-third session. \n We meet at a pivotal moment in the history of the \nUnited Nations. Never since the founding of this \nOrganization has our community of nations been tested \nby a confluence of so many devastating crises as we \nhave witnessed in the recent past. It is therefore with a \nsense of honour, fully recognizing the responsibility \nentrusted to me and to all of us here, that I address this \nGeneral Assembly for the first time in my capacity as \nMinister responsible for Foreign Affairs and Foreign \nTrade of Barbados. \n Barbados commends Mr. Treki for his choice of \ntheme for this year\u2019s general debate, given the myriad \ncrises that we face and the need for effective global \nresponses. Indeed, the world is facing major economic, \npolitical and social upheaval. The threat of food and \nfuel scarcity, the worst economic and financial crisis in \ndecades, the challenge of climate change and the \ninfluenza pandemics have all assumed an international \nand multidimensional character. Together, these have \nundermined the very foundations of our multilateral \nsystem, exacerbating already existing disparities. \n The approach of the developed economies to this \ncrisis has been to create national stimulus packages and \nto bail out their failing industries \u2014 in short, to turn to \npolicies which address their domestic interests almost \nexclusively. Developing countries are suffering the \nbrunt of the effects of the financial crisis created by \ngreed and poor regulation in developed countries. \nFaced with stagnating or falling economic growth due \nto factors beyond our control, we are now left to deal \nwith declining economic activity and a resulting rise in \nunemployment along with its resulting problems at a \n \n \n15 09-52604 \n \ntime when we are forced to battle increasing debt and \ndecreasing external trade and foreign investment \nrevenues. \n While we welcome the initiatives to create rescue \npackages for the least developed countries, there is a \nclearly demonstrated need to expand these initiatives to \ninclude a wider group of developing countries. \nBarbados is one of a small group classified as small, \nhighly indebted middle-income countries, which has \nbeen overlooked, but which is deserving of \ninternational attention and assistance from bilateral \npartners and the multilateral institutions alike. As we \ndiscuss the effects of the global crisis and propose \nassistance for affected countries, there is a need to \nensure that countries like Barbados are recognized \nwithin the broad category of small vulnerable \neconomies. \n Multilateral agencies such as the World Bank \nhave established through empirical research and their \nongoing interventions that these countries are unique in \nthe openness of their economies and in their \nsusceptibility to external shocks. However, this group \ncontinues to be excluded from concessionary financing \nand debt relief. Focus continues to be placed on per \ncapita income data, which is a poor indicator of \neconomic sustainability and national vulnerability. Our \ncountries are in need of adequate support mechanisms \nwith revised eligibility criteria in order to prevent the \nderailment of our development processes. \n This crisis presents an opportunity for the \ndeveloped economies and the international financial \ninstitutions to address the existing failures and \nshortcomings of the current financial system. The time \nis right for the crafting of a new, more transparent \narchitecture that is supportive of development \nobjectives. \n Barbados, for its part, is extremely proud that \ndespite its handicaps it has managed \u2014 through good \ngovernance and the observance of democratic \nprinciples, human rights and the rule of law \u2014 to \nprovide an adequate standard of living for its people. \nHowever, this does not negate our inherent \nvulnerabilities, our limited resources or our restricted \ncapacity to respond to the vagaries of the economic \nenvironment. \n One of the major positive consequences of the \ncurrent crisis is the increase in South-South \ncooperation, which has played a quiet but important \nrole over the years in promoting trade and investment \namong developing countries. This has served to \nenhance the value of such cooperation and presents \ngreat potential for future growth and development. \n At the national level, an important lesson learned \nis that development requires the active involvement of \ncommunities, the public and private sectors and civil \nsociety. This has been clearly demonstrated in the \nimplementation of our social partnership agreements, a \nstrategy that has been very successful in the Barbadian \ncontext since the early 1990s and has been used as a \nmodel in other developing countries. \n Recent world events have highlighted the \nimportance of taking a multilateral approach to solving \nglobal problems. The United Nations is perhaps the \ninstitution best suited to the task of mobilizing global \nresponses. Regrettably, over the past year the United \nNations has been relegated to a subordinate role in the \nsearch for solutions to the ongoing economic and \nfinancial crisis. \n Barbados will not be complicit in any effort to \nmarginalize the United Nations, which has a unique \nand legitimate role in global economic decision-\nmaking and rule-setting. We will not join the sceptics \nin questioning the relevance or legitimacy of this vital \nmultilateral organization. However, we will continue to \nbe at the forefront of calls for its reform to ensure that \nit is fully equipped and empowered to assist Member \nStates in confronting global challenges. \n To date, efforts to reform the United Nations have \nbeen piecemeal in nature, largely uncoordinated and at \ntimes even conflicting. The extraordinary challenges \nwe face demand comprehensive reform. This will \nrequire a level of transformation that equips the United \nNations for the twenty-first century. At this session, \npriority needs to be given to securing commitment at \nthe highest level to finalizing the reform agenda. \n Security Council reform must be prioritized if \neffective change within the United Nations system is to \nbe achieved. It is evident that the structure, \ncomposition and working methods of the Security \nCouncil fail to reflect current global realities. Barbados \nbelieves that membership in the Security Council \nshould be expanded in both the permanent and the \nnon-permanent categories. Our goal must be to ensure \nthat the Council is more representative, democratic and \naccountable to the full membership of the United \nNations without placing its effectiveness in jeopardy. \n  \n \n09-52604 16 \n \n The reality of global interdependence is that our \ndestinies are inextricably linked. We cannot retreat to \nisolationism or radicalism. We must, with a sense of \nurgency and purpose, create the multilateral \ninfrastructure necessary to manage a complex and \ninterdependent world. This new quest for a better and \nmore effective multilateralism must be shared by all. \nOur collective effort must also seek to restore the role \nof the United Nations envisaged by its founders: \u201cto be \na centre for harmonizing the actions of nations\u201d. \n In his address to the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session, the Prime Minister of Barbados \n(see A/63/PV.12), The Honourable David Thompson, \nreaffirmed his belief in the positive role that small \nStates can play in advancing the cause of international \npeace and equitable social and economic development \nand emphasized the importance of building an \ninternational system that operates on the principle of \nmultilateralism and that respects the sovereign equality \nof States and the tenets of genuine non-alignment. \n Barbados is concerned by the growing tendency \nof limited-membership groups to assume decision-\nmaking powers on issues affecting the entire \ninternational community without the consent or \ninvolvement of that community. We stand to squander \nthe opportunities to create a fair and more equitable \nsystem of global governance if responsibility for rule- \nand decision-making remains vested in limited-\nmembership groupings which are accountable only to \nthemselves. No exclusive group of countries, no matter \nhow big, powerful or rich, has a monopoly on \nsolutions. \n The United Nations Convention on the Law of \nthe Sea, the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change and the International Criminal Court \nwere all championed by some of the smallest members \nof the United Nations and represent just a few \nexamples of the invaluable contribution that small \nStates have made to strengthening multilateralism and \nproviding solutions to complex global problems. Small \nStates can be effective partners in the search for global \nsolutions to the ongoing crises, and those countries \nmust have a seat at the table when decisions are being \nmade on issues of global concern. \n In this regard, the targeting of small offshore \njurisdictions in the wake of the global financial crisis \non the pretext that these jurisdictions in some way \ncontributed to the crisis represents an injustice worthy \nof the strongest possible condemnation. For those who \nwould wish to rewrite history, we must recall that the \nfinancial crisis had its origins in the developed world \nand resulted from excessive risk-taking, corruption, \nfraud and ineffective regulatory controls and oversight \nin those countries. \n Barbados fully supports the proposal of the States \nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to \nbuild upon the existing programme already in place \nwithin the United Nations to address issues related to \ninternational financial services. Specifically, we call \nfor the Committee of Experts on International \nCooperation on Tax Matters to be transformed into an \nintergovernmental subsidiary body of the Economic \nand Social Council. The central goal of the proposed \nintergovernmental committee would be to give \ndeveloping countries an effective voice when issues of \ncooperation on tax matters are being decided by the \ninternational community. \n Small democratic States like my own are \nconvinced of the need to ensure adherence to the rule \nof law and respect for constitutional norms. We are \ntherefore compelled to register our deep concern at any \ninterruption of the constitutional order of any \nsovereign State and the dangerous precedent this could \ncreate if left unchallenged by the international \ncommunity. Barbados fully supports the position of \nCARICOM and the Organization of American States, \nwhich calls for the immediate reinstatement to office of \nthe legally elected President of Honduras. \n Barbados is equally concerned to ensure that, in \nour hemisphere, the relics of a past cold war era give \nway to a new spirit of regional partnership, in which \ndiverse political systems can coexist in harmony. We \nare therefore heartened by the positive developments \nwith respect to the reintegration of our sister Republic \nof Cuba into the mainstream of hemispheric affairs. We \nare hopeful that the renewed dialogue between the \nUnited States and Cuba will lead in the near future to \nthe complete removal of the embargo and the \nnormalization of relations between those two countries. \n Barbados welcomes the support provided by the \nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \n(MINUSTAH), which has been a vital tool for \ncapacity-building in Haiti in the key areas of \ngovernance, the strengthening of the rule of law, and \nhuman rights. We therefore call upon the Security \nCouncil to extend the mandate of MINUSTAH so that \n \n \n17 09-52604 \n \nthe international community can continue to provide \nsupport to the people of Haiti in their quest for \nsustainable peace and development. \n As a small island, Barbados is aware of the grave \ndangers posed by climate change. The damage done to \nour coastline and coral reefs illustrates the potential \nthreats that flow from the phenomenon of global \nwarming. Such threats are not peculiar to Barbados, \nbut are posed in myriad ways to nations across the \nglobe, both developed and developing. \n In three months we will meet in Copenhagen to \ndecide on a course of action to address this global \nthreat of unprecedented proportions. We know the \ncatastrophic consequences of failing to reduce global \ngreenhouse gas emissions. What is required is a \nmassive transformation of the way energy is generated \nand used to propel economic growth and development. \n In Barbados we have committed to reducing our \ndependence on imported oil and have significantly \nincreased our use of renewable energy. Furthermore, \nwe have identified transitioning to a green economy as \na national priority. We have established a number of \nkey milestones and indicators to assess progress \ntowards the achievement of that goal. We have \nundertaken those activities with minimal support from \nthe international community, utilizing our own \nresources. We have been forced to divert an increased \nshare of our national budget to finance adaptation \nmeasures. According to World Bank estimates, the total \nannual impact of potential climate change on all \nCARICOM countries is estimated at $9.9 billion a \nyear, or around 11.3 per cent of the total annual gross \ndomestic product of all CARICOM member States and \nassociate members. \n The international community has a moral and \nethical responsibility to support urgent and ambitious \nglobal action to provide adaptation funding for small \nisland developing States. In the Caribbean, our ability \nto address climate change has been severely hampered \nby the effects of the global financial and economic \ncrisis. An essential measure of success at Copenhagen, \ntherefore, will be the extent to which the decisions that \nwe take serve to ensure the survival and continued \nviability of small island developing States. \n Before closing, permit me to seek the support of \nthe General Assembly on an issue that has emerged as a \ncrucial health challenge for many countries, including \nthose of the Caribbean. Chronic non-communicable \ndiseases have become one of the major causes of \nmorbidity. We believe that that issue must be included \nin the global discussions on development. We therefore \nsupport the call made by the Prime Minister of Trinidad \nand Tobago for a special session of the General \nAssembly on that issue (see ). \n Finally, in these difficult times we have a number \nof challenging issues before us for consideration. \nDespite our various agendas and differing priorities, \nwe share an ultimate common goal: to achieve peace, \nsecurity and development for all the peoples of the \nworld. Until that becomes a reality, no country is truly \nsecure. I reaffirm Barbados\u2019 commitment to working \nwith other Member States to attain that goal."

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure for me to \naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. Our coming here as leaders gives us the \nopportunity to debate global challenges as per our \nobjectives and goals as enshrined in the United Nations \nCharter. \n The United Nations is a forum where we all come \ntogether to share ideas, review progress and come up \nwith strategies to deal with world issues that need our \nattention and input. The founders of this Organization \nhad a noble idea of addressing world issues amicably \nwith a view to avoiding confrontation. Therefore, we \nare supposed to meet as equal partners to debate issues \nthat affect us as the world community, in a forum \nwhere we are guided by the principles of trust, respect \nand natural justice. The aim of the United Nations is to \nbring joy and peace to the nations of the world. Let us \nmake sure that people develop confidence in the United \nNations so that they can approach the Organization \nwhen they have problems. \n We note that Africa has multiple problems that \nseriously hinder its progress in the areas of health, the \neconomy, poverty and social welfare, which all come \nunder the Millennium Development Goals. It is our aim \nas the African continent to evolve from being third \nworld countries to a first world status. That calls on \nus \u2014 Africa in general and Swaziland in particular \u2014 \nto work harder and smarter in order to realize that goal \nand generate a strong economy for the betterment of \nthe lives of all our peoples. \n However, we realize that we cannot effectively \ndeal with the challenges confronting us alone, mainly \nbecause our resources are limited. It is through the \nUnited Nations that we continue to forge partnerships \nwith different countries so that we work together to \ngrow our economies. We appeal to the developed \nnations to recognize our hard work and to increase our \naccess to soft loans and grants to support development \nprogrammes and poverty-reduction strategies. We call \non the United Nations to continue supporting national \ninitiatives aimed at eventually transforming our \neconomies to first world economies. \n However, the global financial and economic crisis \nhas made the situation difficult, especially for \ndeveloping countries. It restrains us from achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n The secondary effects of the crisis are now hitting \nhard on developing economies, like that of the \n  \n \n09-52470 10 \n \nKingdom of Swaziland, whose export trade is largely \ndependent on performance in developed global \nmarkets. In our case, several Government interventions \nhave been undertaken to rescue sectors such as the pulp \nand textile industries. Added to this is the need to \nmobilize resources and promote financial inclusion in \norder to stimulate economic growth at the grassroots \nlevel. In that regard, financial inclusion remains an \nimportant stimulus for poverty alleviation programmes \nin developing countries like the Kingdom of \nSwaziland.  \n We are encouraged by signs of recovery from the \ncrisis, and we are confident that the United Nations \nwill continue to play its leading role in the efforts to \nfind a speedy resolution to the situation so that we may \nall focus on development issues for the benefit of all \nour peoples. \n It is most unfortunate that while we do our level \nbest to improve our economies, we continue to be \nconfronted by disturbances and conflicts that include \nwars and coups. We condemn those acts, as they lead to \nuntold suffering for millions of our peoples. As nations \nof the world, let us come together and make sure that \nsuch acts are not supported or encouraged. We call \nupon all nations of the world to isolate and discourage \nthe sympathizers and sponsors. Where there are \nproblems, the peoples of the world must know that they \ncan address the challenges that they encounter through \npeaceful engagement and dialogue.  \n If we want to achieve peace in the world, it is \nimportant that we reduce and eventually eradicate \nnuclear arms, which pose a threat to our planet. We \nneed to encourage nations that are at the stage of \ndeveloping, and those that already possess, nuclear \ncapability to utilize it for power generation that \nsupports and stimulates economic growth. Therefore, \nwe encourage the International Atomic Energy Agency \nto continue to monitor countries that are developing \nnuclear arms so that they may be stopped. It must also \nensure that countries that already have nuclear \ncapability reduce and eventually eradicate their nuclear \narms so that they become a thing of the past. In order \nto accelerate the eradication of nuclear arms, the \nUnited Nations must set targets and timelines for \ncompliance. \n Another issue of concern is the continuing delay \nof the reform of the Security Council. Many nations \nhave come to the conclusion that the Council \nmembership needs to be expanded so that it is more \nrepresentative, so that its decisions may be owned by \nall Member States. \n Africa has adopted firm and clear resolutions on \nthe Council composition they would like to see. Those \ndecisions were further affirmed at the recent summit of \nthe Non-Aligned Movement. Regrettably, we still have \nnot seen meaningful progress on that matter. We \ntherefore would like to call on all members of the \nSecurity Council to address that issue with the urgency \nthat it deserves. \n We are encouraged by the call made by fellow \nleaders for us to open a new page in the work of the \nUnited Nations by approaching global matters \ncollectively. It is imperative that the United Nations \ntake the lead in all issues that affect mankind. The \nreform of the Security Council is one such area that \ncould clearly demonstrate the new approach to issues. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland reiterates its support \nfor the efforts deployed by the international community \nunder the auspices of the United Nations towards a \npolitical solution to the issue of Western Sahara. We \nreaffirm that the initiative by the Kingdom of Morocco \nfor considerable autonomy for Western Sahara is the \nbeginning of a realistic and credible move. The \nKingdom of Swaziland calls upon all parties to join the \nprocess in order to implement Security Council \nresolutions 1813 (2008) and 1871 (2009).  \n The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to support \nefforts to bring lasting peace to the situation in the \nDarfur region, Somalia, Madagascar and other parts of \nour continent.  \n I take this opportunity to express my appreciation \nfor the support and assistance being extended to the \nInclusive Government and the people of the Republic \nof Zimbabwe by the nations of the world and by \ninternational organizations. I also wish to echo the call \nand appeal of the Southern African Development \nCommunity for the immediate removal of all sanctions \nagainst Zimbabwe, in order to ensure the speedy \nrecovery of the economy of that country for the benefit \nof its long-suffering people. \n As we gather here, we also wait with anticipation \nfor the outcome of the Israeli and Palestinian peace \nefforts. We have seen the two parties enter into \npromising peace agreements in the past that, \nregrettably, faltered along the way. We call upon the \n \n \n11 09-52470 \n \ntwo parties to continue to pursue peace to avoid loss of \nlife and to live in harmony. \n We are happy to acknowledge the improvements \nin the relations between the Republic of China on \nTaiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China. That new \ndevelopment has resulted in the international \ncommunity responding positively to the request of \nTaiwan to be involved in United Nations agencies, as \nevidenced by the granting of observer status in the \nWorld Health Assembly. We look forward to seeing \nTaiwan being allowed to fully contribute to humanity \nby being given adequate participation in other United \nNations specialized agencies. \n It is encouraging that this year\u2019s General \nAssembly was preceded by the Summit on Climate \nChange, where issues of environmental protection were \ngiven priority, as they are critical to all our \ndevelopment strategies. The Summit noted that some \ndeveloped countries pollute the environment, mainly \nthrough gas emissions, despite all the protocols in \nplace to protect it. \n I am confident that the Summit was able to \nmobilize adequate political support to guide the \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \nin Copenhagen in December, where developed \ncountries will be able to share their experiences and the \nchallenges that they faced. This will inform the agenda \nthat will lead to the transfer of skills and technology so \nthat, as developing countries pursue their growth, they \ncan avoid the mistakes of the past.  \n We cannot overemphasize the need to protect the \nenvironment, as it is a precious gift from God to \nhumanity and must be preserved for generations to \ncome. We support the call for the establishment of a \nmajor fund to cater to all projects related to climate \nchange. We are hopeful that Copenhagen will come up \nwith solutions for funding climate-change projects that \nwill be predictable, accessible and incremental. The \nKingdom of Swaziland is determined to work harder to \nmeet the targets set by the United Nations. \n In conclusion let me say that the Kingdom of \nSwaziland appreciates the good work of the United \nNations and its related agencies, which remain the only \nhope for overcoming the many complex challenges \nfacing the world today. We therefore take pride in \nreaffirming our commitment to the principles and \nideals contained in the United Nations Charter."

        "file_text": "I have the special \npleasure today to extend to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \nPresident of the General Assembly, my congratulations \non his excellent work in presiding over the sixty-fourth \nsession of this Assembly. I would also like to thank his \npredecessor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for his \nwork in successfully leading the Assembly at its sixty-\nthird session. \n I avail myself of this opportunity to extend my \ngreetings to all those present in this Hall today. I also \nexpress my deep gratitude to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his high competence and professionalism \nin leading the United Nations, and acknowledge his \nimportant personal contribution to the success of this \nsession. \n We are gathered here today after a year in which \nthe world has faced one of the worst financial and \neconomic crises in history. We are gathered here once \nagain at a time when hundreds of millions of people \nare being oppressed by tyrannical regimes or are facing \nextreme poverty, disease and major health or social \ncalamities. We are gathered here at a time when brutal \nconflicts continue to take the lives of innocent people \nin various regions of our world, and when nuclear \ncrises in Iran and North Korea represent a genuine \nthreat to world peace. \n Albania and the Albanian people continue to \nengage in international cooperation and are determined \nto offer their modest contribution to advancing peace, \nfreedom and security and respect for human rights, \nfighting poverty, promoting sustainable development \nand prosperity and, last but not least, protecting the \nenvironment. \n(spoke in French) \n As a European country, Albania remains fully \ncommitted and determined to carry out every reform \nand to take every decision and every other measure \nrequired of it on the road to membership of the \nEuropean Union (EU). More than 94 per cent of \nAlbanians support Albania\u2019s application process for \njoining the EU. This is not only highly encouraging, \n  \n \n09-52592 2 \n \nbut also a major obligation for my Government to \nproceed swiftly along this path. This autumn, we \nexpect a positive response from the Council of \nMinisters of the European Union to our application for \ncandidate status, while we also hope to obtain visa \nliberalization as soon as possible. \n Albania is a new but functioning democracy. \nAbout two months ago, we held general parliamentary \nelections. The international watchdog Office for \nDemocratic Institutions and Human Rights reported \nthat the elections met the principal standards of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \nand deserve a generally positive assessment. The newly \nelected Government has proclaimed the following core \npillars of its programmes: building new and modern \ninfrastructure throughout the country; bringing Albania \ninto the digital age; reforming the health-care and \neducation systems; fighting poverty, and creating new \njobs for Albanian citizens. \n Next year here at the United Nations, we will \nassess the progress we have made towards fulfilling the \nMillennium Goals. Albania has put intense effort into \nachieving significant progress in this area. Over the \npast three years, some 400,000 Albanians have moved \nup from below the poverty line, while extreme poverty \nhas been reduced by 70 per cent; tens of thousands of \nnew jobs have been created; the number of university \nstudents has doubled and infant mortality has been \ndrastically reduced. \n(spoke in English) \n The years 2008 and 2009 have seen the worst \nfinancial and economic crisis the world has known \nsince the Great Depression. The Albanian economy has \nfelt the consequences of the crisis. Its exports fell by \n10 per cent and the levels of financial credit were \ndrastically reduced. Despite these consequences, \nhowever, Albanian gross domestic product (GDP) grew \nby more than 5 per cent in the first six months of 2009, \nour revenues saw an 8 per cent increase compared with \nthose of last year, and foreign direct investment was \n59 per cent higher than last year. \n I believe that the main factors protecting the \nAlbanian economy in this crisis were, first, the very \nfact that Albania has the lowest fiscal burden in Europe \nand that its economy is largely based on liberal \nstandards; secondly, the fact that my Government has \ninvested 10 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP in \ninfrastructure projects in 2009, or, taking into account \ninvestment for 2008, 20 per cent of GDP over the past \ntwo years; thirdly, our thorough reforms aimed at \nachieving smaller Government, as a result of which \nAlbania now has one of the smallest public \nadministrations per capita in Europe and, indeed, in the \nentire world; and, last but not least, the very favourable \nclimate for business and investment created by my \nGovernment over the past four years. I take this \nopportunity to invite investors from all countries to \nconsider my country for their projects, which will \ndefinitely turn out to be success stories for them, and \nfor Albania. \n Albania has maintained excellent cooperation \nwith the United Nations and its agencies. Albania is \none of the pilot countries of the Delivering as One \ninitiative, and through its experience and positive \nresults is making a real contribution to this United \nNations reform. Delivering as One provides for \nexcellent savings of time and money, as well as much \nmore efficient coordination of the work of United \nNations agencies in their cooperation with Member \nStates. This project has had an excellent track record in \nmy country due to the coherence and better \ncoordination of the activities of United Nations bodies \nwith those of our national authorities, particularly with \nregard to aligning international projects with the \ncountry\u2019s priorities. \n We have been pleased to see that our reform \npriorities and national strategy on European integration \nare in full harmony with the Millennium Development \nGoals and those of the Delivering as One initiative. \nThe outcome has demonstrated that this project, the \nphilosophy of which depends on the concept of \nnational ownership, has produced more efficient \nimplementation of United Nations development \nprogrammes. \n Albania is a multireligious society with religious \nharmony par excellence. In the framework of the \nAlliance of Civilizations and in accordance with our \nnational strategy on intercultural dialogue, we offer our \nexample of religious harmony and coexistence, one of \nthe most invaluable spiritual heritages of our nation, as \na contribution to the aims of this United Nations \ninitiative. \n This general debate was preceded by the Summit \non Climate Change. It gives me great pleasure to \ninform the Assembly that more than 90 per cent of the \nelectricity my country consumes comes from \n \n \n3 09-52592 \n \nrenewable hydroelectric power. Although we are open \nto other energy sources, including nuclear, we are \nworking hard and have so far secured about \u20ac5 billion \nin new investment for new hydroelectric, wind and \nbiomass energy plants. Albania intends to become a \nsmall super-Power of green energy in the region. \n The last decade of brutal conflict in the Balkans \nseems to have been consigned to the annals of history. \nThe countries of that region are now engaged in a \nprocess of cooperation in all fields and in European \nand Euro-Atlantic integration. This year, Albania and \nCroatia became full members of NATO. Other \ncountries of the region have made significant progress \ntowards EU and NATO membership. \n I must stress at this point that, although only a \nshort time has passed since Kosovo\u2019s declaration of \nindependence, the establishment of the independent \nstate of Kosovo has become an important factor for \npeace and stability in South-East Europe. In that \ncountry, which declared independence 20 months ago, \ninter-ethnic relations have improved and inter-ethnic \ntensions have been significantly reduced. Serbs are no \nlonger leaving Kosovo. The opposite is happening \u2014 \nmany Serbian families are coming back to Kosovo to \nbuild their future in their country. My Government is \ndetermined to help and assist the Government of \nKosovo in its projects to facilitate the return of the \ndisplaced people of that country. \n The European Union has deployed its Rule of \nLaw Mission, which is doing an excellent job and \nproviding extremely valuable help to the Government \nof Kosovo and its authorities in consolidating the rule \nof law and functional democracy in Kosovo, as well as \nin developing the highest European standards for the \ncoexistence of the various ethnic communities. The \nInternational Security Force in Kosovo has also played \na very positive role, and the very fact that its strength \nhas been reduced is clear evidence of the stability in \nthat country. \n Meanwhile, 63 States Members of the United \nNations have recognized independent Kosovo, and the \nRepublic of Kosovo has become a member of the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. \nNevertheless, Kosovo has not yet assumed the place \nthat it deserves in the family of sovereign countries of \nthis prestigious Organization.  \n On this occasion, I would like to point out that all \nthe countries that recognize the Republic of Kosovo \nand the international institutions that have accepted it \nin their forums as an independent member State have \ndone so because, above all else, they are convinced that \nthe independence of Kosovo and its international \nrecognition make a major contribution to peace and \nstability in South-East Europe. That is why I take this \nopportunity to express my deepest gratitude to all \nGovernments and States Members of the United \nNations that are considering a review and assessment \nof the existing reality in South-East Europe and the \npossibility of recognizing the independence of Kosovo. \nIn my judgment, that would be a great contribution to \npeace, stability, security and cooperation in our region. \n Fourteen years ago, after condemning the \ncoercive oppression, violence and barbarism of the \nMilosevic regime against Albanians in Kosovo, 137 \nStates Members of the United Nations voted in \nresolution 49/204 of 23 December 1994 to recognize \nand respect the will of the inhabitants of Kosovo. \nToday, that will has become the reality of an \nindependent Kosovo and has been recognized by 63 \ncountries that took that historic vote. I hope and firmly \nbelieve that the rest of the countries that voted for that \nhistoric resolution will reaffirm the will that they \nexpressed 14 years ago \u2014 this time through their \nrecognition of Europe\u2019s newest State, the Republic of \nKosovo. \n With its foreign policy of peace and good \nrelations with all countries, its modest but important \ncontribution to international missions of peace and \nhuman rights protection through its policy of good \nneighbourliness, and a moderate and constructive role \nin the region, Albania has become a producer of and a \ndirect contributor to stability and security in the region \nand at the global level. \n Today, Albania participates in peacekeeping \nmissions in several international operations in the \nframework of the United Nations and other regional \nsecurity organizations, such as in Afghanistan, Bosnia, \nIraq, Chad and other countries. Only about two months \nago, Albania doubled its number of troops in the \nInternational Security Assistance Force mission. My \ncountry acknowledges and supports every effort for \nglobal peace and security, and will continue to support \nall efforts of the United Nations, NATO and other \nactors that promote peace, stability and security in the \nworld and that keep in check those two countries that \nthreaten it \u2014 Iran and North Korea \u2014 with their very \ndangerous nuclear programmes. \n  \n \n09-52592 4 \n \n All States Members of the United Nations share \nthe responsibility for the efficient functioning of this \nOrganization. No one can ignore the track record of the \nUnited Nations activities in many fields. Whenever \nthere is a crisis, poverty, famine, disease or disaster, \nthe United Nations is there to provide relief and \nsupport.  \n However, it has long been evident that the world, \ncountries and the complexity of international relations \ndevelop much faster than the United Nations is able to \nadjust and adapt itself to the new realities. That is why \nAlbania strongly supports the continuation of the \nreform process of this Organization and the further \nimprovement of the United Nations system. A more \nefficient decision-making mechanism is pivotal in that \nrespect. We support the efforts to reform the Security \nCouncil. We believe that in order to meet the \nchallenges of the twenty-first century, we need a \nSecurity Council that is efficient, transparent and \nlegitimate in its decision-making process and in which \nregions and individual Member States are adequately \nrepresented."

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate \nthe President on his election to preside over the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are \nconfident that under his able leadership and guidance, \nour deliberations will be successful. I assure him of my \ndelegation\u2019s fullest support and cooperation. I would \nalso like to convey our deep appreciation to his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, for his leadership at the sixty-third session. \n It has been only 18 months since my country \nsuccessfully made the transition to a democratic \nconstitutional monarchy. Within this period, the elected \nGovernment has made every effort to establish a strong \nfoundation for a sustainable and vibrant democracy, as \nit is these initial years that will determine the direction \nof democracy in Bhutan. Concrete steps are being \ntaken to empower the people and to ensure that \ndemocracy truly benefits every citizen. \n The people of Bhutan, although hesitant at first, \nwere guided and encouraged by our enlightened and \nvisionary monarchs and have fully embraced \ndemocracy. From our experience so far, we are \nconfident that a strong foundation for democracy has \nbeen established; it is now time to nurture and continue \nto strengthen this foundation. \n The world is grappling with multiple, interlinked \nglobal crises. The impact of these crises has been \nparticularly severe on the least developed countries, \nwhere levels of poverty and insecurity are already high. \nThe food and energy crises have driven millions of the \nmost vulnerable people deeper into poverty and further \ndesperation. Meeting their needs and freeing them from \nthe cycle of poverty continues to be the major \nchallenge to development and to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is \ninconceivable that, in an era of unprecedented \nprosperity, the vast majority of the world\u2019s population \nremains in poverty and destitution. The alleviation of \npoverty, therefore, must be at the forefront of the \ninternational community\u2019s development efforts. \n Since the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus in \n2002, developing countries have made significant \nprogress in many areas of domestic resource \nmobilization. However, challenges remain, especially \nduring the current economic slowdown, for developing \ncountries to mobilize adequate domestic resources to \nmeet their development needs. For many such \ncountries, official development assistance (ODA) \nremains the most important source of external \nfinancing for achieving their development objectives \nand attaining the MDGs. We therefore encourage donor \ncountries to take concrete steps towards fulfilling their \nODA commitments. \n In Bhutan, we have achieved relative \nsocio-economic progress over the past five years. The \nannual gross domestic product growth rate has \naveraged around 8 per cent, the national literacy rate \nhas reached 60 per cent and health coverage has been \nsustained at 90 per cent. The royal Government \ncontinues to accord high priority to the social sector. \nBhutan launched its tenth five-year plan in July 2008 \nwith the overarching goal of poverty reduction and \nimplementing MDG-based initiatives. As this is the \nfirst plan to be implemented under our first elected \nGovernment, its successful implementation is of \nparamount importance to reaffirming the people\u2019s faith \nin parliamentary democracy and ensuring a successful \npolitical transition. \n These successes in the political, social and \neconomic fields would not have been possible without \nthe support of our development partners, bilateral and \nmultilateral. To them I offer our deep gratitude and \nappreciation, and we look forward to their continued \nassistance and support during this critical transitional \nphase. \n It is becoming increasingly evident that the \nimpact of continuing climate change cannot be ignored. \nWhile its adverse effects will spare none, small \n  \n \n09-52598 46 \n \ndeveloping countries will bear a heavier burden, even \nthough they contribute the least to the causes. Despite \nBhutan\u2019s negligible emission of greenhouse gases, our \nfragile mountain ecology faces potential threats, \nprimarily the adverse impact on agriculture, which is \nthe mainstay of our people. Erratic and severe weather \npatterns and the threat of glacial lake outburst floods \nare of particular concern to Bhutan. Other hazards, \nsuch as flash floods, landslides, forest fires and \ndroughts, are also likely to increase. When Cyclone \nAila hit the Bay of Bengal in May, it also had \ndisastrous and widespread effects in Bhutan, touching \nevery corner of the country. Precious lives were lost; \npower and water supplies affected; roads, bridges and \nvital infrastructure damaged. Farms, the most \nvulnerable sector, were the worst affected. \n Our capacity to carry out adaptation and \nmitigation measures is severely constrained by our lack \nof scientific, technical and financial resources. Bhutan \nhas always maintained that climate change must be \naddressed within the framework of sustainable \ndevelopment. The issues are inextricably linked to \ndevelopment, and any debate on the subject must take \ninto consideration equity and the right of developing \ncountries to be able to provide their people with better \nlivelihoods. \n My delegation appreciates the initiative of the \nSecretary-General in convening the high-level Summit \non Climate Change. It provided the necessary political \nimpetus for negotiations to be concluded in \nCopenhagen this December. We must now advance the \nprogress of the multilateral negotiations in every \npossible way to ensure that tangible results are \nachieved in Copenhagen for the well-being of present \nand future generations. In this regard, I am pleased to \ninform this gathering that Bhutan will assume the chair \nof and host the sixteenth summit of the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in \nApril 2010. Given the importance of the subject, \nclimate change and environment will be the Summit\u2019s \ntheme, and the issue will receive our leaders\u2019 highest \nattention when they meet in Thimphu. \n Terrorism in all forms and manifestations is a \nserious threat to domestic as well as global peace and \nsecurity. It endangers and undermines our common \nvalues of respect for human rights and the rule of law, \nand our basic desire to live in peace and harmony. \nPreventing terrorism preserves these fundamental \nvalues, through which we can achieve lasting peace \nand security. \n Even my country, which has always enjoyed \npeace and stability, has not been spared this evil \nmenace. Bhutan therefore fully supports the \ninternational consensus on taking firm action against \nterrorism. The General Assembly\u2019s adoption of the \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) \nwas an important political achievement that represents \nour common approach to combating the scourge of \nglobal terrorism. We must show similar commitment in \nconcluding a comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism. Within our region, the leaders \nof SAARC have concluded an agreement on mutual \nlegal assistance in criminal matters, reaffirming our \nregion\u2019s commitment to collectively addressing the \nevils of terrorism. \n Bhutan accords high importance to reform of the \nUnited Nations, particularly the revitalization of the \nGeneral Assembly and reform of the Security Council. \nWe fully support the expansion of the Security Council \nin both its permanent and non-permanent membership. \nFor their active role in global affairs and their capacity \nand resources to shoulder greater responsibilities, \nreflect present global realities and make the United \nNations more representative, we fully support electing \nIndia, Japan, Brazil and Germany, plus two African \ncountries, to be permanent Security Council members.  \n My delegation is greatly encouraged by the \nmomentum gained in the intergovernmental \nnegotiations on the reform process. We hope that the \nsixty-fourth session will build on the progress achieved \nso far and bring this long-drawn-out process to a \nsuccessful conclusion under Mr. Treki\u2019s leadership. \n Natural calamities are occurring regularly every \nyear, and smaller developing countries are increasingly \nfaced with the challenge of coping with such problems. \nJust last week, my country was severely affected by an \nearthquake that measured 6.3 on the Richter scale. It is \none of the biggest disasters we have experienced in \nrecent times. Its devastating effects were felt in six \ndistricts of eastern Bhutan, where 13 people lost their \nlives and many were left injured and homeless. About \n1,900 homes, numerous schools, Government offices \nand historical monuments were destroyed or damaged. \nThe full impact is still being ascertained. During this \ndifficult period, we have been comforted by the \noutpouring of support from friendly countries such as \n \n \n47 09-52598 \n \nIndia and others, which have rendered much-needed \ntechnical and financial assistance for the massive relief \nwork. \n Given the increasing frequency of such severe \nnatural calamities and their negative effects on many \nparts of the world, there is a need for institutionalized \ndisaster preparedness and response mechanisms at the \nnational, regional and global levels. In this context, the \nestablishment of the United Nations Central Emergency \nFund is an important step towards providing the \ndisaster relief that is urgently required for life-saving \noperations. Bearing this in mind and as an expression \nof our continued support for the commendable \nhumanitarian work of the United Nations, Bhutan has \nmade a modest contribution to the Fund, which we \nhope to increase in the coming years. \n These are indeed difficult times with multiple \ncrises hitting us simultaneously. The threat of climate \nchange is real and its effects are occurring even as I \nspeak. Global governance needs to be made more \neffective to help us address the global challenges more \nefficiently. In this interdependent world, it will be \nimpossible for any country to act alone in resolving \nthese crises. Therefore, as we gather here once again to \ndeliberate and find solutions to the many difficult \nproblems confronting us, I conclude by reiterating my \ndelegation\u2019s full support and cooperation in working \ntowards addressing our common challenges."

        "file_text": "In recent weeks, we have \nwitnessed a resurrection of the authority of this \nAssembly and a new commitment to multilateral \ncooperation and a belief that it can and must be made \nto work. The new tone of voice we have heard from the \nUnited States here in New York is setting forceful \npersuasion above persuasive force and extending a \nhand to those who are willing to unclench a fist.  \n We must all seize this moment. Every country \u2014 \nincluding the smallest and weakest \u2014 can make a \ndifference. Building bridges means that we must all \nreach out from where we stand today as we struggle \ntogether with the crises in finance, food, energy, \nclimate and health. New efforts must be undertaken to \nbreak cycles of impasse, including moving decisively \ntowards peace in the Middle East and a peace \nagreement that can deliver a Palestinian State living in \npeace side by side with Israel.  \n \n \n11 09-53165 \n \n Last month, the Secretary-General visited \nNorway\u2019s Arctic to study the effects of global \nwarming. As we approach the Climate Change \nConference in Copenhagen, the pace of negotiations \nmust accelerate. Economy-wide reduction targets must \nbe set for all developed countries. Large and more \nadvanced developing countries should commit \nthemselves to measurable, reportable and verifiable \nactions. Cuts in emissions from rainforest preservation \nmust be institutionalized \u2014 as stipulated under the \nUnited Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing \nEmissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation \nin Developing Countries \u2014 funded and included in the \nnew treaty. \n Financing is key to success in Copenhagen. Our \nNorwegian contributions and proposals may generate \nsubstantial new and additional financing for measures \nin developing countries, based on public finance and \ndedicated income from the carbon market. \n The financial crisis has pushed millions of people \nback into the trenches of poverty and made us stumble \nin our pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals. \nLoss of income is placing public policies at perilous \nrisk, potentially undermining services on which the \npoorest and weakest depend the most, such as health \nand education services. Norway supports all the \nMillennium Development Goals. We will, for the \nsecond year in a row, surpass the 1-per cent mark in \nofficial development assistance (ODA). After the \nfinancial crisis hit us, we increased our ODA in \nabsolute terms to show solidarity with those who are \nless fortunate than we are. \n We focus our action on particular areas where \nNorway can make a difference. We will continue to \ntake on a special obligation with regard to the health-\nrelated Millennium Development Goals. We have \ntripled our contributions to health care since the year \n2000. Millions of lives have been saved through the \nefforts of a broad alliance of partners, private and \npublic alike. We will continue to play a leading role \nuntil we have achieved those Millennium Development \nGoals. \n The most disgraceful underachievement of the \neffort towards the Millennium Development Goals is \nthe lack of progress to improve maternal health. While \nwe can vaccinate children and give mothers a bed net \nunder a tree at a particular time, what women need are \nround-the-clock services in clinics to ensure safe \ndeliveries, as well as preparedness for transfer to a \nhospital in the event of complications. Strengthening \nhealth services is key to reducing maternal and child \nmortality and is also a vital element in guaranteeing the \nrights of women and children. New and dedicated \nefforts to combat maternal mortality will now be \nmobilized. \n The appalling rise of rape and other forms of \nsexual violence reveals an ugly story of men around \nthe world still regarding women and children as \nsecondary citizens. We must never rest as long as \nwomen are denied the services and rights that we men \ntake for granted. Nothing less than our claim to \ncivilization is at stake. \n Today, as we speak, the Security Council is \ndebating the situation in Afghanistan after the \nelections, as well as the need for a new Afghan \nGovernment to connect more strongly with its people, \nfight corruption and narcotics, empower State \ninstitutions and protect human rights, and in particular \nwomen\u2019s rights, so that the day may soon come when \nAfghans can take care of Afghanistan\u2019s security and \nwhen Afghan men and women can run a democratic \nAfghanistan. \n We must continue to support the United Nations \nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), which \nhas a mandate to coordinate international assistance \nwith the Afghan Government. UNAMA requires \nadditional resources, as well as a strong commitment \non the part of all United Nations Member States to the \ncoordination of efforts under Afghan leadership. \n We stand on the threshold of a new era of nuclear \ndisarmament. The Review Conference of the Parties to \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons next year must set a clear and specific agenda \nfor the elimination of existing nuclear arsenals and for \nensuring that nuclear technologies are only applied \npeacefully, to the benefit of mankind. Recent \ninformation casts new doubt about Iran\u2019s nuclear \nambitions. Iran itself has the opportunity and \nresponsibility to remove this doubt, and it is imperative \nthat it do so. \n Furthermore, while nuclear weapons pose a threat \nof mass destruction, actual destruction of mass \nproportions is caused every day by small arms, cluster \nmunitions and landmines. Motivated by the \nunacceptable harm that these weapons cause to \ncivilians, Norway is committed to humanitarian \n \n \n09-53165 12 \n \ndisarmament. We urge all States to accede to the \nConvention on Cluster Munitions and to join \nintensifying efforts to control small arms and the arms \ntrade. \n Norway is honoured to have been elected a \nmember of the Human Rights Council and will work \nwith others to raise the credibility, effectiveness and \nvisibility of that important body. Last week, Norway \nsubmitted to the Council its first report on the human \nrights situation in my country, taking a critical look at \nour own record and inviting constructive criticism. We \nencourage all States to submit to similar constructive \ncriticism of their own records so that the review \nprocess becomes substantial and meaningful. \n Here in New York, we welcome the decision to \nestablish a new and enhanced gender entity and hope to \nsee it operational as soon as possible. We will pursue \nthe United Nations reform agenda and system-wide \ncoherence, as well as the Delivering as One agenda. \nThe United Nations should take pride in being subject \nto more public scrutiny; reform must be an ongoing \neffort. Only such an approach will allow us to keep \nlending the United Nations all the support this noble \nbody deserves."

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, I would like to extend to you, Sir, and through \nyou to the brotherly Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab \nJamahiriya our sincere congratulations upon your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session. We are confident that your broad \nexperience and many skills will help enrich our work at \nthis session and achieve the objectives to which we all \naspire. Our high appreciation goes also to Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann for the excellent manner in which \nhe conducted the work of the previous session. \n I also express our warmest thanks and \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ntireless efforts in the service of world peace and \nsecurity to promote the role of the United Nations, \nachieve our common noble objectives and find \neffective solutions to various international problems. \n Today our world is witnessing profound and rapid \nchanges that have added new dimensions to \ninternational relations, which in turn have altered the \nbalances and equations that have long governed those \nrelations. These changes have generated major \nchallenges at various levels, requiring all parties to \nshoulder their responsibilities with vision and wisdom \nand to enhance their efforts to establish the foundations \nof a safer, more stable and more developed world and \nof balanced and equitable international relations based \non solidarity. \n We must redouble our efforts to reform the \nUnited Nations, which was designed decades ago, in \norder to update it to current global circumstances and \nenable it to carry out its essential role in maintaining \ninternational peace, security and development, and in \nserving the interests of world solidarity.  \n Global circumstances have changed since the \ncreation of the United Nations. Its present structure and \nequations no longer reflect the reality of the world \nsituation and international relations. Given our concern \nfor justice and balance in international relations, we \nhope that the international community will introduce \nthe necessary reforms to the United Nations system, in \nparticular in the context of expanding the Security \nCouncil and increasing the transparency and efficiency \nof its work, while bearing in mind need for the \nbroadest possible consensus among States on pending \nissues. \n In spite of its complex and interrelated nature, the \nworld situation can only strengthen our attachment to \nthe United Nations and to its founding principles. \nThose principles constitute the ideal framework for \ncoordinating and uniting our efforts to address issues \n  \n \n09-52598 20 \n \nand challenges in the implementation of the noble \nprinciples enshrined in the Charter, finding effective \nsolutions to pending issues, mitigating the impact of \nthe economic and social crisis, and promoting \nsolidarity-based frameworks of partnership and \ncooperation, in keeping with a more comprehensive \napproach based on the close correlation between peace, \nsecurity and development. \n Further rapprochement and solidarity among the \nnations of the world remain, in our view, among the \nnoblest aims of the United Nations and a pillar of the \nnew system of international relations. Therefore, today \nmore than ever before, we must further disseminate the \nculture of tolerance, dialogue and acceptance of the \nother and respect for cultural differences and religious \nsymbols. We must build constructive relations among \nStates and peoples, based on moderation and the \nrejection of extremism, violence and fanaticism of any \nkind. \n For many years now, Tunisia has promoted \ninitiatives to give effect to that noble objective, the \nmost recent of which was \u201cKairouan, Capital of \nIslamic Culture for the Year 2009\u201d, organized with the \ncooperation of the Islamic Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization and the International \nOrganization of la Francophonie. \n Globalization, with its numerous problems and \nmajor challenges, requires us to pay close attention to \nour young people and to constantly listen to their \nconcerns in order to protect them from exclusion, \nmarginalization and the dangers of seclusion, \nextremism, carelessness and estrangement, while at the \nsame time instilling in them a culture of tolerance, \ncompromise and moderation.  \n Based on the special status that we reserve for \nour young people, whom we consider to be our true \nwealth, the support of the present and foundation of the \nfuture, we in Tunisia have insisted on entrenching the \nspirit of responsibility within this group and encourage \nthem to participate actively in all aspects of public life \nand in establishing the country\u2019s future policies and \nobjectives. \n Based on this vision and our experience in \ndealing with our youth and its aspirations, President \nZine El Abidine Ben Ali called for the proclamation of \n2010 as the International Year of Youth and for the \nconvening, under United Nations auspices and in \ncooperation with the relevant international organizations, \nof a world youth conference to be attended by young \npeople from all over the world and to conclude with \nthe drafting of an international pact uniting world \nyouth around universal values. \n We strongly hope that this initiative will \ncontribute to deepening awareness of the position of \nyoung people in society so that they become active \nstakeholders in the success of our development \nprocesses. Furthermore, young people should play a \nmajor role in promoting dialogue and in enhancing \nunderstanding and mutual respect among peoples on \nthe basis of universal values and noble human \nprinciples concerning which all cultures and \ncivilizations agree \u2014 values such as tolerance, \nmoderation and respect of the other; rejection of all \nforms of violence, extremism and discrimination; the \nculture of citizenship, solidarity, peace and \ncommunication; stimulation of the spirit of initiative; \nvolunteerism and environmental protection. \n This initiative already enjoys the support of Arab, \nAfrican and Islamic regional organizations as well as \nthe Non-Aligned Movement. We look forward to your \nsupport, Mr. President, for the adoption of a resolution \nby the General Assembly at this session in order to \ngive concrete expression to this initiative. \n Terrorism remains a major threat to world peace, \nsecurity and development, in spite of numerous \nnational and international efforts to counter it. It \nremains a challenge to the international community, \nand we have on numerous occasions called for a \ncomprehensive approach in addressing a danger that \nspares no one. We must take into consideration the root \ncauses of such phenomena, as well as just and \nsustainable solutions to ongoing world problems. We \nmust work to decrease poverty, exclusion and \nmarginalization, and we must confront extremist \nmovements that favour fanaticism, seclusion and \nhatred. \n As one of the first countries to warn against the \ndangers of this phenomenon in the early 1990s, Tunisia \nrenews its call for the convening of an international \nconference under the auspices of the United Nations to \ncraft a universally binding code of conduct to fight \nterrorism. \n Faithful to its identity and keen to ensure its full \nintegration into its community, Tunisia strives \ntirelessly and resolutely to enhance cooperation with \nits partners in various regional affiliations. In the firm \n \n \n21 09-52598 \n \nbelief that the Arab Maghreb Union is an indispensable \nstrategic choice for the interests of the Maghreb \npeoples and will enhance the regional and international \nstatus of its members in a world where blocs and \ngroupings are proliferating, Tunisia has spared no \neffort, together with other Maghreb countries, to \ncomplete the process of building the Union, promote \ncommon Maghreb action and work to overcome the \ntemporary difficulties that are preventing its \nmaterialization. We seek thereby to ensure that the \nUnion enjoys the position it deserves on the \ninternational scene and to increase the capacity of its \nmember States to meet present and future challenges. \n Tunisia also continues to work to promote \ncommon Arab action, revitalize its mechanisms, \ndevelop cooperation and partnership relations with \nsister Arab States in various fields, and bring about the \ndesired Arab economic integration and complementarity. \n Many international problems, particularly in the \nMiddle East, remain unresolved and are a source of \ndeep concern for the international community, with \nnegative consequences for security and stability in the \nregion and the world. From this rostrum, we reaffirm \nTunisia\u2019s constant and principled support for the just \nPalestinian cause and the brotherly Palestinian people \nin their struggle to recover their legitimate rights and to \nestablish their independent State on their own land. \n We note with satisfaction the positive stance of \nthe United States Administration on the Middle East \nissue, the elements of a just and comprehensive \nsettlement of the conflict, the two-State solution, and \nsubsequent international efforts and momentum to \nrevive the peace talks.  \n Today, we renew our appeal to the international \ncommunity, especially the sponsors of the peace \nprocess, to intensify their efforts so as to compel Israel \nto end its settlement policy, without preconditions, thus \nenabling talks between the Palestinian and Israeli sides \nto resume, in accordance with international resolutions, \nall peace terms of reference and the Arab Peace \nInitiative. \n Achieving peace and ensuring security and \nstability in the Middle East will require Israel to lift the \nblockade, dismantle the roadblocks and abandon its \nhumiliating measures and other provocative steps \nagainst the Palestinians, as well as the recovery by the \nPalestinian people of its legitimate national rights, the \nestablishment of its independent State, and Israeli \nwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan and the \nLebanese lands that remain under Israeli occupation. \n We also express our solidarity with the brotherly \nIraqi people and hope that they will overcome the \ndifficulties they still face, achieve national \nreconciliation and consolidate security and stability so \nthat all Iraqis can devote themselves to the \nreconstruction of their country in a spirit of unity and \naccord. \n The hotspots of tension and conflict in many \nregions of Africa, some of which persist, have \ndevastated the continent, sapped its energies and \npotential, jeopardized its development, slowed its \ngrowth and negatively affected its societies. \n Faced with this situation and given the \nnecessarily comprehensive nature of any approach to \nworld peace and security, the international community \nand the United Nations organs, first and foremost the \nSecurity Council, must support the efforts of the \nAfrican Union and its member States and stand with \nthe African peoples as they seek to restore security and \nstability and to overcome the effects of conflict and \nwar. \n Given the organic relationship between peace, \nsecurity and development, and the world\u2019s pressing \nneed to reinvigorate the values of cooperation and \nsolidarity, Tunisia proposed an initiative that was \nadopted by the General Assembly in December 2002 to \ncreate the World Solidarity Fund to fight poverty and \nlay the foundations of solidarity-based development. \nToday we renew our call to operationalize the Fund, \nthus enabling it to assist developing countries, \nparticularly those in Africa. \n On a different level, and taking into consideration \nthe rich and long-standing political, economic, social \nand cultural links between Tunisia and Europe, our \ncountry is ever keen to strengthen its relations with all \nthe States of that sphere. Tunisia\u2019s relations with the \nEuropean Union have seen tangible progress, thanks to \nboth sides\u2019 determination to upgrade their ties to the \nlevel of advanced partnership, thus opening prospects \nfor enhanced cooperation in all fields and enabling our \ncountry to achieve further integration with its regional \nand international environment. \n The Euro-Mediterranean region remains one of \nthe main focuses of Tunisia\u2019s foreign policy. On the \nbasis of our strong belief in the importance of building \n  \n \n09-52598 22 \n \na secure, stable and prosperous Mediterranean region \non a foundation of equal partnership and mutual \ninterests, we support initiatives and mechanisms to \nconsolidate peace and promote development. From this \nperspective, Tunisia is determined to play an active \nrole in ensuring the success of Mediterranean \ncooperation for the benefit of the peoples of the region. \n Tunisia is also working to strengthen its ties of \nfriendship and to broaden and enrich its cooperation \nwith American and Asian States through the \nestablishment of a solidarity-based partnership. We are \nthus laying the groundwork for a new era in these \nrelations that will secure the interests of all sides, bring \nthem together, consolidate conditions of peace and \nstability, and achieve further progress and prosperity \naround the world. \n The peoples of the world today urgently need a \nclean environment and all States must preserve it in \norder to avoid the severe consequences of which much \nresearch and many studies have warned, as climate \nchange has caused huge economic losses to the \ninternational community. \n Seeking to meet the environmental, economic and \nsocial challenges caused by climate change, in \nNovember 2007 Tunisia hosted the International \nSolidarity Conference on Climate Change Strategies \nfor the African and Mediterranean Regions. Our \ncountry also hosted the African regional meeting of the \nPreparatory Committee for the Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Convention to Combat \nDesertification in order to develop a unified African \nposition and garner support for African States that are \nnegatively affected by desertification and land \ndeterioration, as well as to promote scientific research \nin this field. \n Tunisia has spared neither effort nor energy over \nthe past two decades to join the ranks of developed \ncountries, based on an open-minded and forward-\nlooking vision, the foundations of which were laid by \nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. This vision has \nencompassed all fields \u2014 political, economic, social \nand development \u2014 and been implemented via \nthorough reforms to strengthen democracy and the \nculture of human rights in word and deed, and through \nthe expansion of public freedoms and the participation \nof all sectors of Tunisian society in charting the \ncountry\u2019s political course within the frameworks of the \nrule of law and institutions. \n I reiterate in conclusion that our success in \nsecuring development and promoting relations of \ncooperation among all States is closely linked to an \ninternational environment characterized by security, \nstability and justice."

        "file_text": "I would like to offer my \ncongratulations, Mr. President, on your assumption of \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfourth session. Allow me also to commend your \npredecessor, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for \nhis capable leadership during the sixty-third session. I \nassure you, Sir, of my delegation\u2019s full support and \ncooperation as you lead the work of this important \nsession. \n The new millennium has been no stranger to \ncrisis. We have seen how ideological extremism can \nfoment turmoil and civil unrest in ways that do not \nrespect international borders. We have also learned that \nfinancial instability can quickly propagate through \nglobal markets and cause chaos in the real economy. \nAnd we have been repeatedly reminded that we \ndisrespect the natural environment at our peril. \n The global challenges that we face today may \nsometimes shock us, but they should not surprise us. \nMost stem from problems that have been allowed to \nfester and grow for many years, if not decades. All are \ninextricably linked to the choices made by the \ninternational community regarding international \ncommerce and development. The challenges of the new \nmillennium are global in nature and therefore require a \nglobal response. Now, more than ever, we must \nrevitalize our multilateral systems of governance in \norder to make them more responsive and more \nrepresentative. Large countries tend to dominate \ninternational forums and drown out the rest of us.  \n In the case of climate change and small island \nStates, I mean that quite literally. We must consider the \nimpacts of our activities and institutions on the most \nvulnerable, so that large and small countries alike can \nenjoy the stability and security necessary for \nsustainable economic development. In this new \nmillennium, even the mighty have been humbled. So \nwhat does that mean for a small island nation like \nNauru? When giants stumble, it is usually the smallest \nthat suffer the most serious injuries. \n The international community must begin this \nprocess of renewal by reaffirming its commitment to \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), an \ninitiative meant to alleviate the burdens of extreme \npoverty, hunger, illiteracy, inequality and disease. After \nearly success in the 1990s, progress towards the MDGs \nhas slowed throughout the world.  \n In the Pacific, where nearly 40 per cent of the \npopulation lives on less than a dollar a day, it has been \nno different. The reasons are not hard to identify. The \nAsian financial crisis was devastating for the \neconomies in our region. The recent spike in food and \nenergy prices has strained our limited financial \nresources. Now the global economic downturn \nthreatens to depress our economies even further. \n Additionally, the Pacific confronts a unique set of \nchallenges in reaching our MDGs. Our remoteness \nmakes it difficult to access world markets and greatly \nincreases the cost of doing business. Our small size \ndeprives us of the advantage of economies of scale, and \nour vulnerability to climate change places our hard-\nwon economic and social progress in jeopardy. Perhaps \nthe most vivid example of our situation is the price of a \nbag of rice. For most countries, the food crisis has \neased as commodity prices have fallen but, in Nauru, \nthe price of a bag of rice has increased by 80 per cent \nover the past year, hovering now above $60. The rest of \nthe world pays less than $25. \n The time has come for the international \ncommunity to deliver on its promises and to dedicate \n0.7 per cent of gross national income to helping \ndeveloping countries meet their development goals. \nPast recessions have led to a steep drop in levels of \nofficial development assistance. There will be no hope \nof reaching our MDGs if that happens again. \n It is vitally important for United Nations agencies \nto strengthen their engagement in the Pacific region. \nFor the past four years, Nauru has called upon the \nUnited Nations to establish a presence on the ground \nby opening an office in our country. It is my fervent \nhope that the next time that I address this body I can \nannounce that that commitment of the United Nations \nhas been fulfilled. \n The absence of the United Nations in the Pacific \nis reflected by the paucity of statistics collected in the \nregion. Accurate indicators are necessary for tracking \neconomic and social progress. It is critical for United \nNations agencies and other international institutions to \nwork more closely with our national Governments and \nwith regional organizations so that accurate data is \navailable for planning and policymaking. \n The temptation to add layer upon layer of new \nprogrammes must be avoided. We must not forget the \ncommitments made under the Mauritius Strategy for \nthe Further Implementation of the Programme of \n \n \n5 09-52463 \n \nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small \nIsland Developing States, the Monterrey Consensus, \nthe Paris Declaration and other international \nagreements. Too often, the United Nations and other \ndevelopment partners succeed in delivering many new \nreports, but fail to deliver tangible results. Action plans \nare no substitute for action. We must dispense with the \nexcuse that helping poor countries develop is \nsomething that we cannot afford. That is simply not \ntrue. Quite the opposite: in a globalized world, leaving \nlarge portions of the world to languish in poverty is \nwhat we cannot afford. \n The international community must also reform \nthe world financial system so that all developing \ncountries share equitably in global economic \nprosperity. The current economic crisis has revealed \ndeep flaws in our international financial system. The \noverriding goals of those reforms should be to facilitate \ngrowth in developing nations and to increase their \nresilience to abrupt economic fluctuations and the \nfickle flow of capital. \n While Nauru does not have a mature financial \nsector, shocks to the international system can be \ndevastating to our local economy and dry up vital \ndevelopment assistance. To be effective, development \nassistance needs to be reliable. That is not possible \nwithout a stable and transparent financial system. \n Lastly, the international community must next \ntake swift steps to mitigate climate change, starting \nwith a bold agreement in Copenhagen. Climate change \npresents the greatest threat for my country and many \nother small island developing States. Scientists warn \nthat, within our children\u2019s lifetime, sea levels may rise \nby a metre or more. That would wipe out low-lying \ncoastal areas, and many Pacific islands would be a \ndistant memory. \n However, we do not need to wait for that \ncatastrophic scenario to see the impacts of climate \nchange. We live with them every day. Flooding and \ninundation are already eroding our shores and \ncontaminating our water supply. Higher water \ntemperatures and ocean acidification are damaging the \nmarine ecosystems that we depend on for food and our \neconomic livelihood. We pray that malaria does not \nfind its way to our doorstep. \n I applaud the commitment of the Secretary-\nGeneral to addressing that issue and his efforts to build \nconsensus among world leaders this week at the high-\nlevel Summit on Climate Change. From Asia to Africa \nand the Arctic, he has visited affected regions to \nobserve the effects of climate change first hand, but not \nthe Pacific, one of the most vulnerable regions in the \nworld.  \n When the Secretary-General glances out the \nwindow of his aircraft while travelling between Asia \nand the Americas, I would ask that he remember that, \nin the vast expanse of water below, there is a whole \nregion of people living on small islands who are \nalready grappling with the consequences of climate \nchange. I encourage that his next trip be to the nations \nof the Pacific before they disappear. \n The science tells us that we must reduce the \nconcentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to \n350 parts per million or less in order to avoid the most \ndire climate change scenarios. However, most \ndeveloped countries have proposed emissions targets \nthat would result in concentrations far higher. \n That is not acceptable policy when human lives \nare at stake. If a doctor prescribes medicine to treat a \nserious illness, do we only give the patient half of what \nis needed? If an engineer says eight columns are \nnecessary to support a building, would any responsible \nperson recommend that we use only four? Then why \nare the most vulnerable countries asked to accept \nproposals that would surely lead to our extinction? \nThat is not good enough when the lives of real people \nfrom real places are being threatened. \n Developed countries must also provide the \nfinancial, technical and human resources necessary for \nus to address a problem that was not of our own \nmaking. Nauru joins the Alliance of Small Island States \nin calling for developed countries to provide the \nequivalent of 1 per cent of their gross domestic product \nfor urgent adaptation and mitigation efforts in \ndeveloping countries. That must be in addition to their \ncurrent commitments for development assistance. \n Climate change calls for the widest possible \ncooperation from every member of the international \ncommunity. Taiwan, as one of the world\u2019s 20 largest \neconomies, can contribute in many ways and should be \ninvited to play a larger role in the United Nations \nsystem, particularly in the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change process. Taiwan has \nmuch to offer to vulnerable countries, especially in \nadaptation measures, technology transfer and \nfinancing. \n  \n \n09-52463 6 \n \n Climate change is an imminent threat to \ninternational security. It is therefore vital that the \nSecurity Council be seized of the issue and closely \nmonitor new developments. Special attention must be \npaid to the most vulnerable countries, including the \nsmall island developing States and least developed \ncountries, and also to vulnerable groups within \ncountries, including women and children, indigenous \npeople and the poor. \n The challenges of the new millennium can be \novercome only through multilateral cooperation and a \nrevitalized United Nations system. It is necessary for \nthe Security Council to be more representative in both \nthe permanent and non-permanent categories to reflect \ncurrent geopolitical realities, which is why Japan, \nIndia, Germany and Brazil should be made permanent \nmembers. I also call upon the General Assembly, as the \nworld\u2019s most representative governance body, to accept \nTaiwan\u2019s meaningful participation in its specialized \nagencies and other world forums. \n We have seen the power of multilateral \ncooperation around the world and close to home. My \ncountry was at the brink of economic collapse at the \nbeginning of this decade. In cooperation with Pacific \nIslands Forum member Governments, my country \noutlined a number of key governance and development \npriorities in the Pacific Regional Assistance for Nauru \n(PRAN) programme. It included a re-evaluation of \nfiscal policies and objectives, review of our \nConstitution, and reforms for our education and health \nsectors. I am proud that in just four years we have \nreached the goals laid out in PRAN, so much so that at \nthe fortieth Pacific Islands Forum Leaders\u2019 Meeting, \nheld in Cairns, Australia just last month, leaders agreed \nthat Nauru had emerged from the crisis phase and was \non the path to sustainable economic recovery and \ndevelopment, and that PRAN was no longer required. \n PRAN was an excellent example of how country-\nfocused development aid can quickly lift a nation out \nof crisis and back onto the path towards sustainable \ndevelopment. PRAN was successful because it \nidentified concrete objectives and was backed by \nsufficient funds. Future programmes in the region \nshould likewise bring tangible benefits and be free \nfrom political influence. \n Here I must acknowledge and express Nauru\u2019s \ndeepest appreciation to Australia, New Zealand, \nTaiwan, Japan and Forum island countries, our own \nregional organizations and others for their unwavering \nfunding and other forms of support to PRAN. The \npeople of Nauru will always remember their generosity \nduring our time of need. \n We are also grateful to the United Nations \nDemocracy Fund. With its assistance, Nauru recently \nadopted a number of important constitutional \namendments that will enhance good governance and \nbring increased stability and responsiveness to my \nGovernment. \n One of the founding fathers of the United Nations \nonce said, \u201cThe test of our progress is not whether we \nadd more to the abundance of those who have much; it \nis whether we provide enough for those who have too \nlittle\u201d. President Roosevelt passed away before the \ninaugural session of the General Assembly, but those of \nus here today have the responsibility to see that his \nspirit lives on. \n The United Nations system of multilateral \ngovernance was born out of a time of great crisis and it \nushered in over half a century of peace and prosperity. \nHowever, the benefits were not shared equally, and two \nthirds of humanity was largely left behind. The time \nhas come to take up the project begun 64 years ago so \nthat future prosperity can be shared by all, including \nthe smallest and most vulnerable. The United Nations \ncontinues to be our best hope for creating a fairer and \nmore just world. \n God bless the Republic of Nauru, and God bless \nthe United Nations."

        "file_text": "Over the past year, I, like many \nothers in this Hall, have spoken about the effect of the \ncurrent global financial crisis on our people and the \nneed for an effective national or international response. \nAlthough the crisis is closely related to issues such as \npeace and security, human rights, development and \nmany other matters of common concern, we cannot let \nit cast a shadow over all the global challenges that we \ncurrently face. \n Today, a year after the collapse of the financial \nmarkets, cyclical indicators point to economic \nstabilization. The crisis is not over, however, and the \nneed to restore confidence and repair the financial \nsystem remains. Moreover, each of us should make an \neffort to refrain from raising new barriers and avoid \nlaying the foundations for new global imbalances in \nthe longer run. \n In combating climate change, we have finally \nunderstood the magnitude of our task and I would like \nto thank the Secretary-General for hosting the Summit \non Climate Change a few days ago. We are not running \na 100-metre sprint, but rather a marathon, where one \nmust maintain speed. If we manage to stay on track we \nall shall be winners in the end. But time is running out. \nMelting glaciers, frequent and abnormally large \nhurricanes, floods and heat waves \u2014 this is not the \nplanet that we want to leave to our children. \n Global and united efforts are needed to reach a \ncomprehensive and ambitious post-2012 climate \nagreement in Copenhagen this December. I call upon \nall countries to set binding goals to share the burden. \nResponsibility must be proportional to the harm that is \ncaused. I am convinced that applying the \u201cpolluter-\npays\u201d principle would motivate the biggest polluters to \nmultiply their efforts and would therefore have the \ngreatest effect. \n Green energy production, renewable energy, \nenergy efficiency and diversification of energy \nsources \u2014 all these contribute not only to sustainable \nenvironmental and economic development but also to \nour security, as we will become less dependent on \nexhaustible fossil fuels. \n As an essential part of cutting greenhouse gas \nemissions, we foresee a wider use of renewable energy \nin Estonia, particularly biomass and wind energy. By \nthe end of the year, an Estonian Energy and Climate \nAgency will be established to help consumers cut \nenergy expenditures and support building energy-\nefficient homes. This is but one example of how an \nambitious climate policy can be used to trigger new \ngrowth in the economy. \n To uphold the core of the United Nations Charter, \nwe must remain committed to providing the United \nNations with sufficient resources to fulfil its unique \nrole in contributing to international security. \nCompliance with the basic principles enshrined in the \nCharter, including the obligation of all Members to \nrefrain from the threat or use of force against the \nterritorial integrity or political independence of any \nState, must remain the fundamental basis of the United \nNations agenda. The United Nations should remain \nengaged in areas of tension where it can make a \ncontribution. \n My delegation takes this opportunity to reiterate \nits firm support for the security and stability of \nGeorgia, based on full respect for the principles of \nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. \n I follow with deep concern the situation in \nAfghanistan. It is essential that the election process \ndeliver results that are legitimate in the eyes of the \nAfghans. The future of Afghanistan lies in the hands of \nthe Afghan people; we, the international community, \ncan only help. By consolidating the efforts of the new \nGovernment and the international community, lasting \nprogress can and should be achieved. Estonia is one of \nthe countries that have steadily increased their military \nand civilian contribution to Afghanistan. \n I am convinced that the bolstered role and greater \nvisibility of the United Nations throughout the country \nhas a positive impact on the coordination of \ndevelopment activities that in turn will attract more \n  \n \n09-52463 10 \n \nnon-governmental organizations and other international \norganizations to the area. \n Besides conflicts between and inside States, new \nand asymmetrical cross-border threats have also \nemerged: the threat from the Internet, for example. \nCyber threats not only endanger vital information \ntechnology systems but they endanger entire \ncommunities. Concurrently with the rapid development \nof computer technology we are witnessing alarming \nsigns of more sinister developments: cyber attacks are \ngrowing more complex and are increasing in \nfrequency. Consequently, major cooperative efforts by \nboth the governmental and the private sectors are \nrequired to develop more effective response \ncapabilities. \n This growing global concern demands both a \nbetter coordinated international approach and an \nenhanced legal domestic framework, including steps to \ncriminalize malevolent cyber acts. Our long-term aim \nshould be the creation of a universal cyber culture \u2014 a \nuniversally accessible, secure and safe environment for \nall. \n Regarding humanitarian affairs, our task is \nequally challenging. Global ecological instability, \npolitical and military conflicts, combined with \neconomic instability and population growth, are \nexpected to increase humanitarian needs considerably \nand require that our efforts be multiplied in the future. \nWe must stand ready to provide a more predictable, \nequitable and consistently effective response to \nhumanitarian crises. The growing needs require an \nincrease in the amount of assistance, in coordination \nand in the range of donors. \n True, we all have economic concerns at the \nmoment, but it is vital to keep our commitments to \nproviding humanitarian relief. Today\u2019s short-sighted \nfinancial decisions or fading political will may in the \nend become far more expensive and entail severe long-\nterm consequences. \n I would like to commend the excellent work done \nby the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \nAffairs and Member States in making the coordination \namong humanitarian workers more efficient and \nimplementing the cluster system. The launch of the \nCentral Emergency Response Fund three years ago has \nalso proven a justified effort in providing more rapid \nand equitable response allocations to disaster-affected \nareas. As Estonia, together with Ireland, currently \nco-chairs the Good Humanitarian Donorship initiative, \nwe urge all donors to apply the principles of good \nhumanitarian donorship to make humanitarian aid more \nneeds-based and its financing more flexible. \n As a sign of the priority we give to global \nhumanitarian issues, Estonia this year holds a vice-\npresidency of the Economic and Social Council and \nhas been leading humanitarian discussions in that body. \nI am concerned that in many humanitarian situations, \nespecially in conflict situations, adherence to \nhumanitarian principles has become selective, \nhindering safe and timely access to victims. I fully \nconcur with Under-Secretary-General John Holmes \nthat this is not an ideological luxury but a practical \nnecessity to help ensure timely access as well as the \nsafety and security of humanitarian staff. \n It goes without saying that expectations are \nhigher during trying times, and therefore the United \nNations actions in carrying out its objectives have \nincreasingly come under scrutiny. Yet, how is the \nOrganization to live up to those high expectations \nwhen the United Nations is struggling to reform itself? \nOver the past years, Member States have undertaken \nconsiderable efforts to improve the United Nations \nsystem, while one important element, Security Council \nreform, still remains pending. While recognizing that \nthe reform process is complex, we must also realize \nthat there will be severe consequences if the process \nremains incomplete. \n Regarding another reform area \u2014 gender \nreform \u2014 considerable progress that is also relevant to \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals has been \nmade recently. No security, development or human \nrights-related goal can be achieved without the full \nparticipation of women. Estonia has been a dedicated \nsupporter of the United Nations funds and programmes \nthat foster gender equality. It is our common obligation \nto ensure that reform becomes a reality without delay. \n Facing the first financial crisis of the twenty-first \ncentury and the accelerating global warming process, \nwe see the necessity for a united response growing. \nThis is why we, the leaders of all nations, once again \nhave gathered here this week: to remind ourselves to \nkeep our eyes on the horizon of peace and prosperity \nand to make sure that we are in the same boat."

        "file_text": " It is with great pleasure that I speak from the rostrum of the United Nations \ntoday representing Madagascar, for which it is a particular honour to be able to \ncontribute to the reflections and deliberations in this highly significant setting. \n As we all know, the United Nations is the ideal forum for exchanging our \nrespective experiences and to maintain our solidarity. \n In such circumstances, allow me first of all to express my heartfelt thanks to \nMiguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for the excellent way in which he led the sixty-third \nsession of our General Assembly, which allowed us to make progress on various \ncurrent issues that are necessary and useful for the fulfilment of humanity as a \nwhole. \n Allow me, furthermore, to present my warm congratulations on the election of \nAli Treki as President of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am \ncertain that this august Assembly will adopt pertinent resolutions and decisions \nunder his clear-sighted leadership. \n I also wish to salute you, Mr. Secretary-General, for your exceptional and \nvisible ability to react in response to all the crises troubling the world. I can only \nwish you the greatest success in accomplishing your missions. \n This year\u2019s theme, \u201cglobal response to global crises and development through \nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue of civilizations\u201d perfectly reflects the \ndesire of us all to find a common solution to our common problems. \n Our cultural, religious or other differences should in no way constitute a factor \nin lack of understanding among us, the peoples of this world. \n On the contrary, they should provide even greater impetus to guide us towards \ndurable peace and security. \n Indeed, our differences lie in the way in which each of us approaches realities, \nbeing and events. The resulting points of view are partial, and thus necessarily \ncomplement each other. \n I join with African leaders in affirming that Africa deserves its place in the \ncommunity of nations. I also share the view that the common value of democracy \nwe all proclaim would be meaningless if geographical representation were not \napplied within this Organization. It is a matter of the very legitimacy of the United \nNations. \n As the world\u2019s second most populous continent, Africa should not be excluded \nfrom initiatives that concern it. \nA/64/470  \n \n09-53756 4 \n \n We support the demand of the President of the African Union and several \nmember States to grant it the right to a permanent seat on the United Nations \nSecurity Council with all the associated prerogatives. \n We are here to mark the way for future generations and to make concrete our \ndesire to promote dialogue among cultures and civilizations. Let us hold fast to the \nprinciples we unanimously adopted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nthat \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are \nendowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit \nof brotherhood.\u201d \n Allow me to salute all the efforts undertaken to date, at all levels of our \ninternational community, for this cause that is dear to us. Nevertheless, much \nremains to be done, for we are still far from achieving our objectives. \n Understanding, rejection of discrimination, and tolerance, religious or \notherwise, without which a durable peace will remain a utopian ideal, must be the \nwatchwords in guiding our actions. \n They must be our reference points in each decision we take, whether in the \npolitical, economic, social or cultural fields. \n In that regard, allow me briefly to examine the case of my country, \nMadagascar, whose situation, it appears to me, embodies a model of society where \n\u201cwe\u201d, the youth, must take on an increasingly important role in all decision-making \nprocesses. \n Sixty-five per cent of the population of Madagascar is under 25 years of age, \nwhich is roughly the proportion of youth throughout the world, especially in \ndeveloping countries. \n The world is in the process of searching for a reference point to survive the \nmajor challenges it is facing, in particular the economic and financial crisis, climate \nchange, food insecurity and growing poverty. \n In Madagascar, these problems, combined with failed governance over the past \ntwo decades, inevitably resulted in an acute political and social crisis. \n The Malagasy experience speaks to us all, for the youth of Madagascar have \ntaken responsibility. \n Being among the youngest Heads of State present at this General Assembly, if \nnot the youngest, I formally call on all the youth of the world to take action against \nthe new challenges facing humanity. \n \u201cLet us act in order not to suffer, and change for a better, sustainable world!\u201d \n I also appeal to our elders to have confidence in the youth of today and of \ntomorrow. And I thank the Secretary-General for the relevance of his initiative at his \nclimate change conference, when he involved youth in this struggle for the survival \nof humanity. \n We are speaking out to the whole world because: \n We have waited too long for our opportunity to choose; \n We have waited too long to attack injustice, the poverty of our countrymen, \nabuse and drift; \n A/64/470\n \n5 09-53756 \n \n We have waited too long to find real solutions to poor governance which has \nmired much of humanity in poverty. \n To suffering, anguish and despair, we must have one response: \n We want to change, \n We must change, \n We will change. \n This is not the first time in 49 years of independence that the Malagasy people \nhave manifested their will for change. \n The peaceful movement of the Malagasy people led to the establishment of a \nTransitional Authority validated by the High Constitutional Court of the Republic of \nMadagascar. \n Unfortunately, some technical and financial partners are threatening sanctions \nof various types. \n We can only regret such threats, which will serve only to increase the suffering \nof the Malagasy people, for Madagascar still depends on international assistance, \nand in the end its beneficiaries are the people and not Governments. \n Therefore, from this rostrum, we solemnly appeal to the international \ncommunity, to all donors, to review their reading of the situation and to continue \ntheir assistance to the Malagasy people in order to prevent further deterioration in \ntheir standard of living. \n The principal mission of the transition regime, which is consensual and \ninclusive, is to draft a new Constitution for the advent of the Fourth Republic in line \nwith the expectations of the Malagasy people. The major principles of this new \nConstitution will be laid down during a national conference to be organized and \nconducted by civil society. \n We would like to state our commitment to the holding of free, fair, transparent \nand regular elections as early as possible, on the basis of a new electoral code under \nthe supervision of the Independent Electoral Commission and monitored by \ninternational observers. \n We greatly hope that the United Nations will accompany us through this \nelectoral process. We request your assistance and support. \n Looking towards the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures in \n2010, the Malagasy people call for international cooperation in favour of all \ninitiatives aimed at promoting a culture of peace and dialogue among all cultures, \ncivilizations and religions. This choice is eminently meaningful as the current crises \nremind us that all countries of the world are called on to cooperate, especially \nbecause of interdependence related to globalization, and that a spirit of dialogue \nmust prevail. \n Dialogue assumes equality and mutual respect. Thus, all points of view and \nproposed solutions deserve to be considered for their worth in order to address the \ncomplex crises which are currently raging across our planet. In other words, \neffective multilateralism through international organizations is at stake, and \nideological eclecticism as well as methodological realism must be brought to bear. \nA/64/470  \n \n09-53756 6 \n \n Dialogue also requires a spirit of burden-sharing. From this viewpoint, since \ncrises have universal impact, recovery should benefit all and associated strategies \nmust be impartial. \n As long as some peoples and actors of the world are underestimated and even \nexcluded, effectiveness will miss the mark. \n The promises made at the international conferences on the economic, financial, \nfood and climate crises must be kept. Among them, I would like to cite the promise \nto allocate 0.7 per cent of the economic recovery plans adopted in rich countries to \nrespond to the immediate needs of peoples suffering from hunger and malnutrition \nand to guarantee food security for all. \n Madagascar is grateful for the support of the international community in its \nefforts for peace and development, and reaffirms its determination to contribute to \nour collective reflections in order to solve shared problems. \n May the dialogue of civilizations prosper all the nations through a gentler, \nmore humane globalization! \n \n"

I would like to assure you of Algeria\u2019s sincere \nand active support in the fulfilment of your mandate. I \nwould also like to pay heartfelt homage to your \npredecessor, Father d\u2019Escoto, for the skill he has \ndemonstrated, his moral probity and his full \ncommitment to multilateralism, based on the principles \nand purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. \n I would also like to express our gratitude to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his wise and \nenlightened conduct of the work of the Organization \nand the initiatives he consistently deploys to reinforce \nthe role of the United Nations and affirm its moral \nauthority. \n This year, once again, the global economic crisis \nis at the heart of the general debate of the session. The \nworld has had time to measure the scope and gravity of \nthis crisis. It is not yet time to take stock, since we \nknow now that this is neither a short-term economic \ncrisis nor the bursting of a bubble such as the capitalist \nsystem has seen in the past. The world has realized that \nthe crisis is that of a system governed by the rules of \nglobalization, just as it has had to face the fact that any \nserious and lasting solution to this crisis will come \nabout through courageous and concerted decisions. \nSuch decisions must be aimed at promoting global \neconomic governance based on standards of \nresponsibility, equity, solidarity and progress: \ngovernance that will be aimed at putting an end to \nfinancial and commercial practices that are opaque, \niniquitous and unfair, and imposed on the rest of the \nworld in the name of free trade and its dubious \nefficiency. \n The lack of coherence and harmony in the \napproach to the crisis is apparent from, inter alia, the \nunfair treatment meted out to developing countries. \nWhy should the nations of the southern hemisphere be \nforced to bear the burden of a crisis they are not \nresponsible for? Multilateral institutions, also \nundermined by contradictions and a lack of coherence, \nare unable to overcome impasses in negotiations on \nvital questions that have a direct impact on our \npopulations. \n This is the case, for instance, with the \nnegotiations on a treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol \non climate change. Here is an area where displaying a \nspirit of compromise and solidarity is clearly in the \ninterest of every country. And yet the positions of \ndeveloped countries continue to be motivated by \nnarrow national interests while the very survival of \nmankind is at stake. \n It is also the case with the fundamental aims of \nnon-proliferation and disarmament, which remain \nhostage to political double standards, discriminatory \npractices and non-compliance with commitments made, \nparticularly on the part of certain nuclear Powers. \n \n \n41 09-52179 \n \nThese practices have not spared the multilateral \nnegotiation frameworks, which nonetheless enjoy \nlegitimacy and the expertise necessary to realize \nprogress on the path to reinforcing the goals of \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. It is also the case \nin the fight against impunity and violations of human \nrights and international humanitarian law, which raises \nthe issue of exploitation of these noble causes for \npolitical ends. \n The question of human rights is addressed with a \nselective approach, which casts suspicion even on \ninitiatives based on a sincere desire to ensure respect \nfor human dignity. This, too, is the case with \ninternational cooperation in the struggle against \nterrorism. The Algerian delegation believes that the \nimportance of the juridical weapon would be enhanced \nby the adoption of the long-awaited global convention. \nIt is also convinced that constant adaptation of \napproach is necessary in responding to this major \nthreat. \n The African Union has undertaken not to pay \nransom to those who take hostages, and we support its \nappeal to the United Nations to make this a universal \npolicy as rapidly as possible, given the threat that this \nphenomenon poses to the security of our peoples and \nthe stability of our countries. \n We hope that this Organization will be able to \nrealize substantial achievements in the area of reform, \nwhether in revitalizing the General Assembly, \nreshaping the Security Council or strengthening the \nrole of the Economic and Social Council. Obviously, a \nrevitalized General Assembly, with a strengthened \nmandate, will be better able to reach consensus on the \nreform of the Security Council \u2014 a Security Council \nthat would reflect the legitimate aspirations of \ndeveloping countries, and those of Africa in particular, \nwith equitable representation, along with the quest for \nnew working methods more in line with the demands \nof our times. \n Algeria\u2019s commitment to a policy of good \nneighbourliness is demonstrated in particular through \nthe numerous initiatives and sincere efforts we have \ndeployed in partnership with our neighbours. We are \nfirmly convinced that preservation of peace, promotion \nof development and respect for people\u2019s rights are a \nprerequisite for building a peaceful, united and \nprosperous Arab Maghreb that is stable and fully \nintegrated.  \n Everyone knows the importance we attach to the \nright of peoples to self-determination and the effort \nthat we have put into arriving at a just and lasting \nsolution to the conflict in Western Sahara. The United \nNations can always count on Algeria\u2019s complete and \nsincere support in every initiative aimed at settling this \ndispute in accordance with the responsibilities that the \nOrganization has taken upon itself and in line with the \nCharter of the United Nations. \n We are fully committed to the cause of the \nPalestinian people, and believe that current \ndevelopments pose a grave threat to peace and security \nthroughout the Middle East. The region will never \nregain peace and stability without a just and lasting \nsettlement of the Palestinian problem, which lies at the \ncore of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is now obvious to \nall that a satisfactory solution is impossible unless \ncredible and substantial pressure is applied to the \nIsraeli occupying forces with a view to compelling \nthem to put an end to their policies of provocation and \naggression against the Palestinian people, to keep their \npromises and to respond favourably to all Arab peace \ninitiatives. \n Algeria participates actively in the efforts of the \nAfrican countries to put an end to any conflict that \nhampers their development and to achieve the political \nand economic integration of the entire continent. \n Establishment of the African Union has created a \nrespected and credible partner whose collaboration \nwith the United Nations has made possible visible \nprogress, especially through the significant reduction \nof hotspots of tension on our continent.  \n I will end by reiterating our wish that the conduct \nof our international affairs will be enhanced by the \neffective and sincere commitment of the international \ncommunity to the task of renewing and reinforcing the \nmultilateral system."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, I would like \nto congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session. At the same time, I wish to \nexpress my hope that his skilful stewardship will lead \nthe current session to success. \n The sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly \nwill mark an end to the first decade of a new century, \nwhich humankind has ushered in with a great deal of \nanticipation and aspiration. One of the major tasks \nfacing the Assembly this year is to conduct an impartial \nreview of this first decade and set the correct path \nahead. \n Humankind has yet to realize its long-cherished \ndesire to thrive in a peaceful and equitable world free \nfrom war, while its hopes are confronted with a host of \nserious challenges one after the other. The Afghan war \nis in escalation and the Iraq war is still undecided. The \ncold wind of a nuclear arms race is blowing, even \nbefore negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been \nopened. Avian influenza is not completely subdued, yet \na new strain of H1N1 flu is sweeping the world. The \nworld is undergoing a much greater degree of global \nwarming this year than last, and we are witnessing \nmore stagnant economies and many more people out of \nwork everywhere. \n The United Nations Security Council has become \nmore arrogant, resulting in further inequality and \ndouble standards in international relations. We need to \ndirect serious attention to this prevailing reality when \nwe review the first decade of the new century. \n The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, \nunder the leadership of the great General Kim Jong Il, \nhas now entered a phase of State-building. A great, \nprosperous and powerful nation is a country in which \nnational power is strong and everything thrives and \nwhose people live happily, with nothing to envy in the \nworld. To build such a country was the lifelong wish of \nthe great leader of our people President Kim Il Sung, \nand it is the firm intention and wish of the Government \nand people of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea that such a thriving nation will be a reality by \n2012, the centenary of Kim Il Sung\u2019s birth. \n The main task facing us over the next three years \nis to concentrate all our efforts on building an \neconomic power, which is the last height we need to \nscale in building a great, prosperous and powerful \nnation. The Korean peninsula remains as ever in a state \nof armistice. But now that we possess a dependable \n \n \n49 09-52604 \n \nnuclear deterrent, we may be able to prevent war and \ndefend peace. For more than half a century our country \nwas compelled to produce guns rather than butter, as \nwe suffered under nuclear threats and the danger of \nwar posed by hostile forces. But today we have settled \ndown to channel our efforts into building a great, \nprosperous and powerful nation. To all intents and \npurposes, this is completely the result of the Songun-\nbased politics instituted by the great General Kim Jong \nIl. And, when our country becomes an economic \npower, that will create new impetus to the economic \ndevelopment of the region. Our efforts to build up the \neconomy will constitute a significant part of the \ninternational community\u2019s efforts to attain the United \nNations Millennium Development Goals. \n We have never opposed the denuclearization of \nthe Korean peninsula and the rest of the world. \nDenuclearization was the wish of President Kim Il \nSung, and a nuclear-free world is a long-cherished \ndesire of mankind. \n The Korean people are more devoted to the \nsovereignty and peace of their country than any other \npeople or nation in the world, as a result of the \ncharacteristics of their country\u2019s historical \ndevelopment. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea has done its utmost to bring about the peaceful \nreunification of the country, to eliminate nuclear \nthreats and grounds for war and to secure peace and \nstability on the Korean peninsula. We initiated the \ndenuclearization of North-East Asia and of the Korean \npeninsula and put forward the proposals for the \nArmistice Agreement to be replaced by a peace \nagreement and for the adoption of a non-aggression \npact between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea and the United States. \n However, our efforts have not received an \nappropriate response from the United States. The \nUnited States considers the Korean issue only in the \nlight of its Asia strategy and does not want to see the \nentire Korean peninsula denuclearized. That has \nresulted in a greater nuclear threat facing the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The \narbitrariness of the United States can be seen in the \nclaim that the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nis not allowed to launch even a peaceful satellite. The \nSecurity Council is being manipulated by that \narbitrariness. \n We have concluded that, as long as the United \nStates does not change its existing nuclear policy, we \nhave no option but to rely on our nuclear capability in \norder to ensure the nuclear balance in the region and \npreserve peace and stability in North-East Asia. The \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula depends on \nwhether or not the United States changes its nuclear \npolicy towards Korea. In order to realize the \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the United \nStates Administration must discard its long-standing \npolicy of confrontation and put into practice the change \nthat it has recently talked about on several occasions. \n We are not engaged in a nuclear arms race. The \npurpose of our nuclear weapon is to deter war. We will \nonly possess a nuclear deterrent so as to avert a \nmilitary attack or the threat of such an attack against \nour country. Deterrence will be directly proportional to \nthe threat on the Korean peninsula, as in Europe and \nelsewhere. As long as it possesses nuclear weapons, the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will act \nresponsibly with regard to their management, use and \nnon-proliferation, and to nuclear disarmament. We \nshare the position of all peaceful countries, including \nthe non-aligned countries, in opposing nuclear war, the \nnuclear arms race and the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. \n United Nations sanctions have now been imposed \non us on the grounds that we had a nuclear deterrent. It \nmay be recalled that the United Nations was set up in \nthe country that produced the first nuclear weapon and \nthat all five permanent members of the Security \nCouncil are nuclear Powers. If those countries had \ndemonstrated their commitment to nuclear \ndisarmament a long time ago and had refrained from \narbitrarily and selectively opposing the peaceful \nsatellite launch of another country, the nuclear situation \nin the world might have developed differently. \n The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nattaches importance to the principle of sovereign \nequality enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The \nprinciple of sovereign equality is also the reason why \nwe became a Member of the United Nations. Unjust \nand selective sanctions will never be recognized or \naccepted. The position of the Government of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is to respond \nto dialogue with dialogue and to sanctions by \nstrengthening nuclear deterrence. If the United States \nbrings sanctions to the talks, we will, for our part, \n  \n \n09-52604 50 \n \nparticipate in such talks by bolstering our nuclear \ndeterrence. \n Thanks to the far-sighted bold decision of the \ngreat General Kim Jong Il, North-South relations on \nthe Korean peninsula have entered a new phase. Just \nover a year ago, the North and the South had to adapt \nto changes owing to the differences in the positions of \nthe two parties towards the historic joint declaration of \n15 June and the declaration of 4 October, which were \nrecognized and supported by the General Assembly. \n However, our sincere and noble efforts paved the \nway for a turning point so as to reach a common \nunderstanding of those grand programmes for \nreunification. Inter-Korean economic cooperation, \nincluding the operation of the Kaesong industrial \ncomplex, is back on track and separated families can be \nreunited. In the future, the Government of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will also \ncontinue to make all possible efforts to achieve \nnational reconciliation and unity and to bring forward \nthe independent and peaceful reunification of the \ncountry under the banner of \u201cby our nation itself\u201d. \n All Member States have accepted the need for \nUnited Nations reform, as the new century requires. \nCurrently, the Security Council is the most \nanachronistic organ of the United Nations. An \nimbalance in relations, by which the strong nations \nhave ruled the weaker ones for the past half century, \nremains part of the structure of the Security Council, \nand it is precisely in the rules of procedure of that \nCouncil that democracy is least developed. Today, the \nGeneral Assembly is the only place in the United \nNations where the views of the international \ncommunity can be properly reflected and democracy \nensured. \n In order to strengthen the role of the United \nNations in line with the requirement of the times and \nthe new situation, it is important to thoroughly \ndemocratize the Security Council and to substantially \nincrease the authority of the General Assembly. In \nrestructuring the Security Council, we should first \nconsider the issues that can be resolved, such as the \nexpansion of non-permanent members of the Security \nCouncil on the principle of ensuring the full \nrepresentation of non-aligned and other developing \ncountries, which make up the majority of the United \nNations Member States. \n In enhancing the authority of the General \nAssembly, we need to discuss the issue of submitting \ndecisions of the Security Council to the General \nAssembly for approval, in particular all decisions \nrelating to the principle of sovereign equality laid \ndown in the United Nations Charter. The United \nNations is required to have the proper criteria and \nprinciples in order to examine human rights issues. The \nUnited Nations Charter recognizes the rights of \nnational self-determination and choice and the \nprinciple of non-interference in internal affairs, and all \ninternational human rights instruments contain the \nbasic principle of the non-politicization of human \nrights. \n However, these days some debates in the United \nNations contradict that. Any attempt to bring into \nquestion the systems of specific countries and to \ninterfere in their internal affairs under the guise of the \nprotection of human rights is, in itself, a violation of \nhuman rights, denying the right of the people of those \ncountries to choose their own system. The United \nNations should pay attention to the fact that its human \nrights agenda covers only the situations found in small \ncountries, with no mention of large ones, the West and \nEuropean countries. Due attention should also be given \nto how to boost the role of the non-aligned and other \ndeveloping countries in the international arena. \n International efforts to attain the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and to address the central issues of \nthe United Nations, such as the global economic crisis \nand climate change, urgently call for the active \nparticipation of a wide range of developing countries, \nincluding the Non-Aligned Movement. \n The foreign policy of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea has been, is and will be based on the \nprinciples of independence, peace and friendship. The \nGovernment of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea will actively strive to further strengthen and \ndevelop friendly and cooperative relations with all \nUnited Nations Member States under those principles, \nand to fully discharge its commitment towards \ndefending the peace and security of the Korean \npeninsula and the rest of the world.

This year I take \nthe floor with renewed hope and optimism for my \ncountry. \n In May 2009, Sri Lanka was successful in \ndefeating the scourge of brutal terrorism after almost \nthree decades of conflict inflicted on us by the \nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), one of the \nmost ruthless terrorist organizations known to the \ninternational community. Our recent anti-terrorist \noperations cost us only $2.8 billion in all, compared \nwith other anti-terrorist operations elsewhere which are \ncosting much more than that. \n In an age when the international community has \ncollectively acknowledged that terrorism threatens the \nvery foundations of global and national security, our \nsuccess in defeating terrorism will benefit, not only the \npeople of Sri Lanka, but all our peace-loving partners \nin the international community. \n Today, we have entered a forward-looking, post-\nconflict phase, recognizing at the same time the urgent \nneed to deal with the scars and unresolved challenges \nof the past. In our unique victory in defeating \nterrorism, we are grateful for the assistance, \nencouragement and cooperation extended to us by \nfriendly countries and we seek similar understanding in \nmaking a steady and stable transition from ending \nconflict to ensuring lasting peace and security. \n We have shared our hopes and concerns with the \nUnited Nations. At the end of the conflict and at the \ninvitation of my President, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon was the first high-\nlevel dignitary to visit Sri Lanka. \n With the defeat of the terrorists in May this year, \napproximately 290,000 civilians in the Vanni region \nwere liberated from their decades-long subjugation. \nOne of our highest priorities thereafter has been to \nmeet the immediate humanitarian needs of these \ndisplaced civilians and to ensure their long-term, safe, \nvoluntary and dignified return to their homes. \n At present, the welfare of our people in \ntemporary transit sites must keep up with standards \nthat meet our own high expectations as well as \naccepted international norms. This task has been \nfacilitated by the assistance we receive from United \nNations agencies, international and local civil society \npartners and donors. More than 54 agencies are \nactively engaged with us in these welfare villages. In \naddition to providing food and transitional shelter, the \nwelfare villages are equipped with facilities, such as \nschools, banks, post offices, and health-care centres, to \nmeet the needs of the displaced civilians. In fact, \nchildren whose education had been denied them by the \nterrorists are now for the first time learning to read and \nwrite at these sites. \n The Government reiterates its firm resolve to \nresettle the internally displaced persons expeditiously, \nin cooperation with our international partners. In that \nregard, we have learned valuable lessons from our own \npast experiences. In both the post-tsunami context and \nthe successful resettlement programmes in the east of \nthe country completed in the past two years, we \nrealized that the pace of resettlement must not be \nforced, if it is to be truly safe and sustainable in the \nlong term. For example, against all established \nhumanitarian norms, the terrorist insurgents had \nindiscriminately scattered landmines and other \nexplosives in every area of civilian habitation in the \nNorth. The time-consuming and meticulous process of \n  \n \n09-52592 12 \n \ndemining is now under way. From another perspective, \nthe stability and security that we have restored at great \nhuman cost cannot, and must not, be compromised, \nparticularly when a large number of self-confessed \nex-terrorist cadres continue to mix with internally \ndisplaced persons. \n In the aftermath of conflict, peace cannot last \nwithout reconciliation. We have put in place a broad \nand comprehensive foundation for long-term peace and \nsecurity encompassing reconstruction, development, \npolitical empowerment and reconciliation. Sri Lanka is \ncommitted to complying with its international \nobligations in the field of human rights and \nhumanitarian standards, and will undertake further \ndomestic measures aimed at reconciliation in the light \nof lessons learned. In less than three months since the \nconflict in August, we have made significant progress. \nFor the first time in more than a decade, local-\ngovernment elections were held in the north \ncompletely free of any violence and intimidation. In \nevery area where the terrorists had suppressed all \ndissent in the past, democracy will be restored and \nelectoral processes will be re-established, encouraging \na local leadership to emerge. \n We must enable those scarred by the conflict to \nlead productive lives and resume their roles as \nneighbours and productive citizens. Children were \nforced into combat by the terrorists\u2019 abhorrent practice \nof using them as fighting cadres. President Mahinda \nRajapaksa has personally launched a national campaign \nentitled \u201cBring Back the Child\u201d, and an extensive \nrehabilitation programme is under way to provide new \nbeginnings for former child combatants. In cooperation \nwith United Nations agencies and donors, we have put \nin place a national framework for the reintegration of \nex-combatants. \n With the end of conflict, and for the first time in \nmany decades, Sri Lanka is poised to harness the full \nhuman, political and economic potential of the country \nfor the betterment of our people. Donors, international \norganizations and financial institutions have expressed \ntheir confidence in our reconstruction and development \nplans by making important contributions. After a lapse \nof many years, the Eastern province has already begun \nto contribute to the national economy under the Eastern \nRe-awakening Programme. The Waddakin Wasantham \nProgramme was initiated by President Rajapaksa this \nyear to establish a strong and modern economy in the \nNorthern province. Civilian lives are being normalized \nwith the restoration of former livelihoods, such as \nfarming and fisheries. Already people and produce \nfrom the north and east of the country are being \ntransported via previously inaccessible road and rail \nnetworks, facilitating people-to-people contact and \nintegrating the economy of the north with that of the \nrest of the country. Police stations, courts, schools and \ninfrastructure are being re-established. \n The end of conflict provides us with a historic \nopportunity to address the grievances and aspirations \nof all communities in expediting a long-term political \nsolution. Under the All-Party Representative \nCommittee process, the Government looks forward \nwith a high degree of confidence to obtaining a \nconsensus among all sections of the political spectrum \non the proposals envisaged in this regard. The solution \nthat evolves through this process, which we will offer \nto all communities, must be a home-grown product. \nComplementary to the long-term political solution \nenvisaged through the All-Party Representative \nCommittee process, an All-Party Committee of \nDevelopment and Reconciliation has been initiated by \nPresident Rajapaksa. That forum reflects the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to a pluralistic and \ninclusive approach to addressing post-conflict \nchallenges. \n The theme of this year\u2019s debate is \u201cEffective \nresponses to global crises \u2014 strengthening \nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for \ninternational peace, security and development\u201d. The \nmultilateral architecture of the United Nations was \ncreated 64 years ago to provide a collective response to \nglobal issues in order to achieve peace, security and \ndevelopment. As a result of a multitude of factors, \nincluding the accelerated globalization of recent \ndecades, the challenges we are confronted with today \nare complex and intertwined, and require a holistic, \nconcerted and collective approach. \n An individual State alone cannot meet these \nchallenges. Thus multilateralism must be strengthened \nto meet contemporary global crises such as terrorism, \nthe global financial crisis, the adverse consequences of \nclimate change, food and energy security as well as the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \nWe need to take necessary measures to ensure that the \nimpact of globalization is fair, inclusive and \nsustainable. Multilateralism is not about the United \nNations agenda responding only to the demands of a \nminority of powerful States, but also about defending \n \n \n13 09-52592 \n \nthe interests of the powerless majority. And it is \nimperative that the principle reflected in Article 2, \nparagraph 7, of the Charter \u2014 that the Organization \nshould not interfere in the internal affairs of States \u2014 \nbe respected. The Charter must be our guiding norm, \nfor it is the Charter that keeps us together. \nNon-interference in the internal affairs of States must \nbe respected at all times. \n In our own region, the South Asian Association \nfor Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which Sri Lanka \nchairs at present, has lent its voice to several issues of \nglobal importance affecting our region. Among these, \nterrorism, the impact of the global economic crisis and \nclimate change, as well as food security, are of prime \nconcern to the one fifth of humanity who live in \nSAARC nations. We in the SAARC region will \ncontinue to work in every international forum, \nincluding the United Nations, to find regional as well \nas global solutions that can deal with these issues in an \nequitable manner. \n A global problem such as terrorism, with its \ntransnational linkages, requires an effective and \ncompelling global response. As our experience in Sri \nLanka has shown, the transnational character of \ncriminal activities of terrorist groups such as the LTTE \nrequired that counter-terrorism operations meticulously \ncarried out on the battlefield be supported by concerted \nand well-coordinated measures of international \ncooperation directed against the multifaceted criminal \nnetworks of the terrorist organizations. \nMrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n We are aware that much of the financial \nsustenance for the destruction caused in Sri Lanka by \nthe LTTE came from sources overseas, particularly \ndeep-rooted networks in developed countries. The \nso-called overseas representatives of the LTTE and \ntheir front organizations procured funds and arms \nthrough a complex range of criminal activities: terrorist \nfinancing, money-laundering, arms procurement, illicit \ntrade and other organized criminal activities, such as \ndrug trafficking and human trafficking, all of which are \ninterrelated. \n The remnants of the fast-diminishing LTTE \nnetworks overseas continue those efforts to date. \nAlthough we have been successful in defeating \nterrorism in Sri Lanka, we continue to urge our friends \nand partners in the international community to be \nvigilant and to continue taking action against illegal \nacts of the LTTE on their soil. \n We are well aware that some of the front \norganizations exploit noble humanitarian sentiments, \nand masquerade in the guise of humanitarian \nnon-governmental organizations or even infiltrate \nthem. We thank our partners in the international \ncommunity that have taken action to expose those \norganizations. \n The threat posed to maritime security through the \ntransportation of large consignments of sophisticated \nequipment and lethal cargo to provide logistical \nsupport to terrorist groups requires our urgent \nattention. In recent years, Sri Lanka has experienced \nthe most unprecedented and dangerous forms of \nmaritime terrorism. Our navy has successfully \nconfronted and interdicted the movement of virtual \nfloating warehouses of arms and ammunition, which \nposed a grave threat to the security and stability of our \nnation and our region.  \n At the global level, this phenomenon calls for a \nrevision of existing laws pertaining to boarding and \nsearching vessels on the high seas. We need a \ncomprehensive legal framework to address all aspects \nof the safety and security of maritime navigation, going \nbeyond the current concerns about weapons of mass \ndestruction. That would make a distinct contribution to \nsecuring global peace and security. \n The comprehensive range of terrorist activities \nand their disastrous impact on the security and stability \nof States should awaken all States to consider, very \nseriously and as a matter of urgency, the importance of \nforging a global consensus on a comprehensive \nnormative framework for international cooperation and \nsolidarity in combating terrorism, within the \nparameters of international law. \n In this context, I wish to emphasize the urgent \nneed to finalize the ongoing negotiations on the draft \ncomprehensive convention on terrorism. The time has \ncome to reach finality on the outstanding issues and, \nthrough the exertion of the necessary political will, to \nadopt the Convention without further delay.  \n Sri Lanka, as Chairman of the United Nations Ad \nHoc Committee on International Terrorism, remains \ncommitted to doing its utmost to reach consensus on \nthe draft comprehensive convention, and looks forward \n  \n \n09-52592 14 \n \nto the fullest support of all Member States in this \nimportant task. \n Today we face the greatest challenge to the world \neconomy in modern times. The global financial and \neconomic crisis, which had its roots in the developed \ncountries, will have a long-term impact on human lives \nin developing countries. Through the pursuit of prudent \npolicies, Sri Lanka has been able to minimize the \nimpact of the crisis on the domestic financial system \nand maintain an overall positive rate of growth in the \nmidst of the crisis. \n Recovery from the crisis should go well beyond \nrestoring the stability of the economies of the \ndeveloped countries, and must address the deeper \ndevelopment crisis which ensued in developing \ncountries. The plan of action adopted at the United \nNations Conference on the World Financial and \nEconomic Crisis and its Impact on Development \nurgently needs to be implemented with the support of \nthe international financial institutions and advanced \neconomies. The global financial and economic crisis \nalso highlights the need for transparent multilateral \nregulatory structures at the helm of the world economy. \n The Millennium Declaration set 2015 as the \ntarget date for achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), and we are already nearing the target \ndate. Long before the MDGs were articulated globally, \nSri Lanka was well on track to reach the related targets \nin several areas.  \n Development as it is understood today, and as \nembodied in the internationally agreed development \ngoals and MDGs, encompasses objectives related to \nhuman well-being, including freedom, empowerment, \ndistribution patterns and environmental sustainability. \nThis broad dimension is aligned with Sri Lanka\u2019s \npluralistic democratic traditions. Sri Lanka was early \namong developing countries to understand the \nimportance of investing in human resources, of gender \nequality and of social development. We are determined \nto make further progress. We welcome the high-level \nmeeting to be convened by the Secretary-General next \nyear. \n As a developing island State, Sri Lanka is highly \nvulnerable to the adverse impact of climate change \ncaused by unsustainable production and consumption \npatterns of industrialized countries. The carbon debt \nowed to us by the developed countries must be used to \nfinance the financial and technological assistance that \nwe need in order to adapt our industries to a \nsustainable path. As the people of a developing \ncountry, our population naturally aspires to achieve \nprogress and higher living standards. We hope that we \ncan reach an agreed outcome at the Copenhagen \nConference, in accordance with the principle of \ncommon, but differentiated, responsibilities. \n Reform of the United Nations and the Security \nCouncil must be a high priority. My delegation \nbelieves that the objectives of the reform process \nshould be to strengthen multilateralism and to promote \ngreater democracy, transparency, effectiveness and \naccountability within a more democratic United \nNations system. And, in tandem, we need to take \nmeasures to pursue the four pillars that are \nfundamental to our future, as enunciated by President \nObama. \n My delegation believes that the United Nations \u2014 \nparticularly the Assembly \u2014 has primary responsibility, \nas set out in the Charter, for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. In this context, the \nnumerous unresolved conflicts around the world \ncontinue to be a matter of concern.  \n We are disappointed that little progress has been \nmade in the implementation of General Assembly \nresolutions regarding the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people to statehood and the realization of \nthe two-State solution, whereby Israel and Palestine \ncould live side-by-side in peace and harmony. A just \nand lasting peace in the Middle East, including through \npractical recognition of the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people, has been strongly advocated by \nPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa. In this regard, we are \nencouraged by the words spoken by President Obama \nin his address to the Assembly. \n Mr. Treki is presiding over the work of the \nAssembly at a critical time. As Member States, we \nmust mobilize the political will to shed our differences \nand work in a spirit of cooperation to respond \neffectively and swiftly to the challenges that confront \nus. I reiterate my delegation\u2019s confidence in President \nTreki\u2019s leadership in this endeavour."

        "file_text": "Sixty-four \nyears since the foundation of the United Nations we \nrecall the self-evident fact that the United Nations was \ncreated to prevent atrocities such as those that occurred \nduring the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945. It \nwas called into being in order to avoid a repetition of \nthe failure of the League of Nations, the first \nworldwide organization, which tried to carry out its \nduties between the two world wars. \n The United Nations over 64 years has undergone \nvarious twists and turns. There have been better and \nworse years, years when here in this Hall there were \nclashes between the forces of two camps, the so-called \nsocialist camp and the free world. There were times \nwhen here in this Hall scores of new countries of \nAfrica, Oceania and Asia emerged. There was also the \ntime, 20 years ago, when, after the collapse of the \nSoviet Union, there appeared many other new \ncountries, and when others such as mine, Poland, \ngained real, not only formal, independence.  \n At that time the whole world believed that we had \nfound a way to solve all problems, especially economic \nproblems, using market economy rules, which meant a \nfree economy and free movement of capital in all areas. \nWe have to state clearly that, as we have heard here \nmany times, in recent years this faith has been \n \n \n43 09-52228 \n \nundermined, and therefore I have to devote my address \nto the problem of the crisis to some extent. \n This crisis is a new problem. Participating in a \nGeneral Assembly session for the first time, I can state \nthat all the earlier problems, such as conflicts, of which \nthere are many, the more recent problem of climate \nchange, and the problem of poverty, are not new. To \nthem we should add the problem of health: AIDS, \nepidemics and so on. \n However, the problem of the current crisis \nappeared in the last year. Before coming to it, I should \nlike to refer to what the President of Ukraine said. \nThere are many causes of conflict in the world, one \nbeing the violation of faith in territorial integrity. \nBecause many new countries have emerged over the \npast dozens of years, it is clear that there will be \ndifferences of opinion over this or that territory. If \nforce is used to resolve such differences, as it was last \nyear against Georgia, this may give rise to fundamental \nproblems. It could be the source of local wars, but it \ncould also be the source of great conflicts, even \nconflicts on a world scale. On behalf of my country, I \nwarn against this. \n I return to the problem of the current crisis. I \nrepresent a country that continues to develop. We are \nthe only country in the European Union that will this \nyear record \u2014 albeit small \u2014 economic growth. This \nis due to some factors that are specific to my country, \nso I do not wish to dwell at length on the subject. \nHowever, it is clear that one reason for the crisis is that \nwe place too much faith in markets and banking \nsystems that become more and more complicated. \nSooner or later that must lead to the outcomes that we \nall see. \n What preventive measures can be taken? They are \nknown, but it is difficult to implement them. I believe \nthat the United Nations has a great opportunity here. It \nis not that there will be management of the global \neconomy. Such attempts are doomed to failure and will \nlead to another crisis. But it is not true that we do not \nneed new rules, new regulations, to deal with issues \nthat have also been discussed today, including \nsupervision and oversight over the banking sector. \nPerhaps that oversight should not be global in nature, \nbut it must include countries where banks are under no \ncontrol, because that is the source of an economic \npathology, which often facilitates large-scale criminal \nactivity, such as drug-trafficking. \n Another problem that has been mentioned here is \nthat of so-called tax havens. Mention can also be made \nof cheap flags of convenience for shipping. We \nunderstand that all those who use them do so to \nimprove the situation in their countries; we realize that \nfrom the point of view of various countries, especially \nthose that are not rich, there is a reason. I am not here \nto criticize them. But it is in our common interest to \nput an end to such practices. There is no other \norganization in the world that can do this but the \nUnited Nations, through the creation of international \nnorms. \n President Lula of Brazil spoke about certain very \nimportant problems, including those relating to \nfinancial agencies affiliated to the United Nations. In \nthat regard, I refer to the problem of greater flexibility \nin programmes launched by the International Monetary \nFund or the World Bank. \n There is another issue: better use of certain \norganizations affiliated to the United Nations. Here I \ndraw attention first to the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO), which has been in existence for 80 \nyears. It embraces almost all countries of the world and \nhas about 2,500 employees. Should it not to a greater \nextent be a place for the formulation of programmes \nproviding an alternative to liberal development? It \nseems that a reformed ILO could successfully perform \nthat function. It requires a common effort, but it is \nfeasible. \n I am not talking about additional funds and \nfinancial means. I am talking about formulating \nalternative programmes that take the interests of \nworkers into account to a greater extent than so far, and \nalso a balance between different social groups, not only \nin the rich countries, but also in the poorer countries. \n Today\u2019s address by the President of the United \nStates pointed to the fact that a country that, whatever \none thinks about it, is the most powerful in the world \ntoday, is now approaching the problems of the United \nNations differently. This creates a certain possibility \nfor the Organization, our Organization. This is an \nopportunity that can be taken if the United Nations \npeacekeeping operations become more effective. We \nshould appreciate the operations that have been carried \nout so far, but we need certain organizational changes \nto make the activity more effective. What I am saying \ndoes not exclude the tasks taken up by, for instance, \n  \n \n09-52228 44 \n \nNATO. But the United Nations should play the leading \nrole. \n There is also the problem of United Nations \nreform, especially reform of the Security Council. I do \nnot wish to dwell on the subject now, but we are all \naware that it is a very important issue, in that there is a \nbasic difference between what was established 64 years \nago and what we have now. \n  In the past the United Nations has placed a great \ndeal of emphasis on climate change and climate issues. \nMuch has been said about the subject, and I do not \nwant to repeat it. However, I strongly emphasize that \nthis is a very important issue, requiring great \nsensitivity. If richer countries want to become strongly \ninvolved in climate protection, they must realize that \nthe weaker States should be assisted, because this very \njust cause cannot be dealt with in such a way as to \nmake development easier for some and harder for \nothers. We should always bear that in mind in thinking \nabout the solidarity of all nations and about the \nobjectives given to the United Nations 64 years ago. \n Last, but not least, I turn to an issue that has not \nbeen discussed at great length, except in regard to \npiracy: international terrorism. Today it is an important \nproblem. The situation in some countries, such as \nAfghanistan and Pakistan, is very significant proof of \nthat. Terrorism has its sources, not all of which are \nrelated to external ideologies. There are also some \nobjective premises, and we understand this. We also \nunderstand that the United Nations can play a greater \nrole than it has played so far. \n Poland is a member of NATO, and is very much \ninvolved in operations. But we understand that under \ninternational law the only 100 per cent legitimacy for \nsuch operations derives from the United Nations. This \nis very important now and also for the future, because \nwe must realize that the problems of conflict, crisis and \nterrorism cannot be solved within a few years.  \n Many times today we heard that the United \nNations is entering a new stage. We believe that this \nwill be a phase of its greatness, because we have \nlearned from the past that this great world experiment, \nwhich has many times passed the test on a global scale, \nwill continue to do so in the near future.

        "file_text": "Allow me to warmly congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki on his well-deserved election to preside over the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I assure \nhim of the full cooperation of the Philippines as he \ndischarges the duties of his high office. \n We are gathered here today, in this parliament of \nnations, to find meaningful solutions to the conflicts \nand crises facing our world today. Although there are \nsigns of global recovery, now is neither the time for \ncomplacency nor for a return to business as usual. Our \ndrive to enhance global development has clearly \nslowed, while the challenges to peace remain starkly \nbefore us. \n Through globalization, we have witnessed \nunprecedented material progress and record poverty \nalleviation. Yet the poorest 40 per cent of the world\u2019s \npopulation still live on less than $2 per day. Nor have \nwe resolved the climate change and food crises that \noppress hundreds of millions of human beings. \n A large part of global development has been the \nresult of labour, including that of migrant workers. \nHowever, despite their contributions to the global \neconomy, many migrants remain exposed to \nexploitation and abuse. Moreover, the peace dividend \nexpected from the end of the cold war never \n  \n \n09-52470 58 \n \nmaterialized, while we continue to confront nuclear \nproliferation and violent conflict. The shortage of aid \nresources and instability in trade and investment are \ngenerating a global development emergency. Many \nnations will not attain the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). Development gains are being tragically \nlost. \n Our march of progress must not stall \u2014 not on \nour watch and not while we have the will, the vision \nand the means to build a better world inspired by a \nshared commitment to justice, fairness, \nnon-discrimination, progress and peace. We should do \nso by focusing on the five great challenges of our time.  \n The first challenge pertains to promoting nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. The second \ninvolves managing the global crisis to encourage \nequitable recovery, fairer globalization and faster \npoverty alleviation. The third entails protecting and \npromoting the rights of migrants, who continue to \ncontribute to global development and the well-being of \nour societies. The fourth has to do with the taking of \nurgent measures to effectively address the adverse \neffects of climate change without further delay. And \nthe fifth has to do with reducing the number of \nconflicts and expanding mutual understanding and \nrespect through greater interfaith and \ninter-civilizational dialogue. \n(spoke in English) \n Nuclear weapons and their technology are a \nthreat to international peace and security, and the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is our central \nmechanism to contain, and eventually eliminate, that \nthreat. The May 2010 NPT Review Conference, over \nwhich the Philippines will preside, will be the next \nopportunity for all of us to act on that matter in a \nconcerted manner. We can be encouraged by certain \nrecent developments on that front.  \n A constructive atmosphere prevailed during the \nmeetings of the Preparatory Committee for the Review \nConference. President Obama has announced that he \nwill lead the United States to ratify the Comprehensive \nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which is another key \npillar of the global disarmament and NPT system. In \naddition, the United States and Russia are making \nheadway, under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, \nto reduce their deployed nuclear warheads and delivery \nsystems beyond the Treaty\u2019s upcoming expiry in \nDecember. In addition, the South-East Asia Nuclear-\nWeapon-Free-Zone and other regional nuclear-weapon- \nfree zones are continuing to reinforce the NPT system. \nThose positive developments inspire the Philippines in \nsteering the Review Conference to conduct \nnegotiations and consultations in an open and \ntransparent manner. In that spirit, we reiterate our call \nfor the few remaining countries that have not yet done \nso to accede both to the CTBT and the NPT, in order to \ngive greater hope for lasting peace and security for our \nworld. \n The global financial and economic crisis is \nplacing intolerable strain on the poorest of the poor and \nundermining years of efforts to attain internationally \nagreed development goals, including the MDGs, and to \ncombat ill-health and hunger. The crisis has been \naccompanied by increases in unemployment, with \nconcomitant declining incomes and demand. The \nInternational Labour Organization estimates that \nunemployment could rise by 50 million by the end of \n2009, thereby bringing the global unemployment rate \nto more than 7 per cent. \n The Philippines and many other nations are \nimplementing stimulus packages, accelerated \nemployment-generation programmes and enhanced \nsocial safety nets. In the Philippines we have \nstrengthened our banking sector and fiscal position \nthrough tough reforms that have blunted the full force \nof the global crisis. The Philippines is one of the few \neconomies that continues to have positive growth in its \ngross domestic product. However, we cannot ignore the \nimpact of the global crisis elsewhere in our \ninterdependent world. The Philippines therefore joins \nother nations in the General Assembly in calling for a \nunited effort in the United Nations to act for the \ncommon good of all our peoples. \n The United Nations Conference on the World \nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \nDevelopment, which was held in this very Hall last \nJune, presented Member States with lines of action that \nwe must take now to stimulate the global economy, \nimprove regulation and monitoring and reform \nprocesses and institutions to prevent any recurrence of \nthe crisis. \n We view the Global Jobs Pact put forward by the \nInternational Labour Organization, which was endorsed \nby the Economic and Social Council this past July, as \nanother important step towards recovering from the \ncrisis. We reiterate our call on all countries to resist \n \n \n59 09-52470 \n \nprotectionism in order to expand trade and investment \nflows. We also call on developed nations to maintain \ntheir commitments with regard to official development \nassistance. Furthermore, the voice of the developing \nworld must now be fully heard in reforming \ninternational financial and development institutions so \nthat we can forge a more equitable and stable global \neconomic system to avoid future crises. \n Global migrants are among the groups most \nadversely affected by the crisis. The international \ncommunity therefore has a shared responsibility to \nensure their protection, taking into full account the \nspecial vulnerabilities of the gender and family \ndimensions of the issue. The second Global Forum on \nMigration and Development, which the Philippines was \nprivileged to chair in Manila, reinforced that important \nmessage by focusing on the human face of migration \nand on the human rights and empowerment of \nmigrants. We urge all nations to accede to the \nInternational Convention on the Protection of the \nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their \nFamilies, and to avoid unfair restrictions on, and unfair \ntreatment of, migrants. \n We must carry the momentum of the Summit on \nClimate Change, held here in New York, forward into \nthe negotiations under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change on the road to \nCopenhagen this December. The world expects nothing \nless from us. The Philippines therefore calls on the \ndeveloped countries concerned to present their firm \npost-Kyoto greenhouse gas emission targets, taking \ninto account the ideal levels suggested by the scientific \ncommunity. They must also assist developing countries \nto mitigate and adapt to worsening climate change by \nfulfilling their Framework Convention obligations to \nprovide technological and financial support. As a \ncoordinator of the G-77 in the talks, the Philippines \nwill continue to work with all parties to help to ensure \na positive outcome in Copenhagen. \n The Philippines is doing its part to advance that \nvital global agenda. We recently enacted a landmark \nlaw to promote the development and use of renewable \nenergy resources, especially biofuels. Earlier this \nmonth, the Philippines also hosted the International \nConference on Green Industry in Asia. The Manila \nDeclaration on Green Industry in Asia and the \nFramework of Action adopted at the Conference \npromote the integration of sustainable development \ninto industrial development processes for the transition \nto resource-efficient and low-carbon industries. We \nhope that elements of the Manila Declaration will \nprovide input for Copenhagen as well. \n The international community must also focus on \nthe urgent need to reduce tension and conflict fuelled \nby perceived differences between religions, faiths and \ncivilizations. If left unattended, such conflict can \nfester, causing greater tension and untold human \nsuffering and violence, which extremists can exploit. \nThe urgency of the matter has prompted the Philippines \nand many partner nations and organizations to promote \ngreater interfaith dialogue, both within the United \nNations system as well as at regional and national \nlevels. By building bridges of understanding, that \nglobal advocacy enhances peace and development. \n Every year, the Philippines has submitted to the \nUnited Nations a draft resolution calling for \ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding \nand cooperation for peace. The General Assembly has \nalways adopted it unanimously. Also at the United \nNations, we initiated the holding of the Ministerial \nMeeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for \nPeace, which includes countries from every region of \nthe world. In 2006, we also launched the global \nTripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace, \nwhich is headquartered in New York and made up of 54 \nGovernments, 15 United Nations agencies and 110 \nreligious non-governmental organizations represented \nat the United Nations. To reinforce that effort, the \nPhilippines will host the first special Non-Aligned \nMovement (NAM) ministerial meeting on interfaith \ndialogue and cooperation for peace and development in \nManila this December. We are pleased to invite all \nUnited Nations Members and other interested nations \nto that important seminal meeting. \n(spoke in Spanish) \n The spirit of multilateralism and prudent realism \nalso requires that we support United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts. In crises and emergencies around \nthe world, we must do more collectively to alleviate \nsuffering and to help nations and communities to \nachieve self-sustaining peace. The Philippines will \ncontinue to be active in United Nations peacekeeping. \nIndeed, the Philippines has become one of the largest \ncontributors of individual police officers to United \nNations peacekeeping operations. More than 600 of our \npeacekeepers are serving with distinction around the \nworld. Next month, we will send a battalion in support \n  \n \n09-52470 60 \n \nof the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, \nin the Golan Heights. \n We stand on the cusp of history. It is in our hands, \nhere at the United Nations, to shape the changes and \ntrends necessary to bequeath to succeeding generations \na lasting legacy of a world of greater justice, \ncompassion and well-being. The Philippines is deeply \nhonoured to assist and cooperate with all nations in the \ntask of building a future where peace and prosperity \nreign unceasingly for the benefit of all humankind."

        "file_text": "\nMy first words are to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki on his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. Aware of his skill \nand his vast diplomatic experience, we are convinced \nthat this session will be crowned with success. My \ncountry, Guinea-Bissau, which has excellent relations \nof friendship and cooperation with his country, Libya, \nwelcomes his election and assures him of our fraternal \ncooperation during his term. \n I wish to congratulate and express the \nappreciation of Guinea-Bissau to Father Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann for his performance and his \ndedication to the successful conduct of the work of the \n  \n \n09-52592 8 \n \nsixty-third session. I should also like to thank the \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nfor his comprehensive report on the work of our \nOrganization and the excellent work he has done to \nensure the consolidation of peace and development \nthroughout the world. In particular, I should like to \ncongratulate Mr. Treki for holding the high-level \ngathering on climate change on 22 September as a \nprelude to the Copenhagen conference to be held in \nDecember. \n Six months after the crisis caused by the \nassassination of our President, we have restored \nconstitutional normality, and the organs of State power \nare in a position to fulfil the role entrusted to them by \nour Constitution. We have just inaugurated a new \nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Malam Bacai Sanh\u00e1, \nwho was democratically elected in elections deemed \nfree, fair and transparent by all political parties and \ncandidates and by international observers. \n The party that I have the honour to chair, the \nAfrican Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau \nand Cape Verde, has a qualified majority in parliament \nand in an inclusive Government, and now the President \nof the Republic is from among its ranks. Never in its \nhistory has our country enjoyed such great conditions \nfor stability. We have thus created the conditions for \nimplementing the reforms that the country so \npressingly needs, in particular, reform of the public \nadministration, with particular emphasis on the defence \nand security sectors, as well as public finance reform \nand the decentralization and modernization of the State \napparatus. \n In this regard, I would like to highlight the role \nand contribution of subregional organizations, such as \nthe Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS), the West African Economic and Monetary \nUnion and the Community of Portuguese-speaking \nCountries (CPLP), as well as of the African Union and \nthe United Nations, whose constant support has \nallowed our Government to make substantive progress \nin the normalization of the country\u2019s political, \neconomic and social life and development. I should \nlike further to highlight the substantial support \nprovided by the European Union during the difficult \nperiod we have gone through. In addition, I should like \nto thank the brothers of the CPLP countries for their \ncontinued commitment and solidarity. \n The latest crisis situation in Guinea-Bissau \nresulted in the assassinations of the head of State and \nthe Chief of Staff of the Guinean Armed Forces. Those \ntragic events surprised and shocked all of Guinean \nsociety and the international community. They revealed \nthe vulnerabilities of our rule of law and the \nweaknesses of the national defence and security \nsystem. \n In addition to strongly condemning those crimes, \nthe Government immediately ordered the establishment \nof a committee to enable us to find out the truth and \nhold the perpetrators accountable. Since then, owing to \nits concerns about the objectivity, transparency and \nspeed of the process, our Government made a request \nto the Secretary-General that an international inquiry \nbe carried out under the auspices of the United \nNations. In response to that request and on the basis of \nSecurity Council resolutions, the Secretary-General \nurged the Government to continue its own investigation \nof those crimes, offering, however, to intervene with \nthe African Union, ECOWAS and the CPLP to provide \nthe technical, financial and other types of support that \nmight be necessary. Following that response from the \nSecretary-General, the Government sent requests for \nsupport to those organizations but has not yet received \na response. The Government is truly looking forward to \nany assistance that can be offered by the African \nUnion, ECOWAS and the CPLP. \n We want to take advantage of our presence in \nNew York to engage with all those organizations to \nensure that conditions that would give a new dynamic \nto the work of the Committee of Inquiry are \nestablished, and we consider the attainment of that \nobjective an essential condition in order to ensure \ngenuine justice and contribute to the consolidation of \nthe democratic rule of law and the protection and \npromotion of human rights. We seize this opportunity, \nfrom this rostrum, to firmly and unequivocally reaffirm \nthat we are against impunity. We will not be a party to \nit, nor give safe haven to any type of crime. So I can \nassure you that the Government of Guinea-Bissau will \ndo everything in its power to create the conditions for \nthe Committee to carry out its work in a peaceful, \ntransparent and credible manner. \n Those events caused a serious crisis in my \ncountry, which led to a radical change in the priorities \nof Government policy \u2014 specifically, it became \nnecessary to hold presidential elections. However, \ndespite the gravity of the situation, the response of our \n \n \n9 09-52592 \n \ninstitutions was swift and positive. The President of the \nPeople\u2019s National Assembly temporarily assumed the \npresidency of the Republic, as provided for in the \nConstitution, and a date was immediately set for the \nholding of early presidential elections, according to the \ncovenant of understanding among the political parties. \n The tenure of the interim president, which has \nrecently ended, was marked by the promotion of a \nconstructive and frank dialogue between civil society \nand political society, with a particular focus on \nclarifying the objectives of the defence and security \nsector reform, which is a crucial pillar for peace and \nstability in the country.  \n In Guinea-Bissau, the creation of the armed \nforces preceded the creation of the State itself, and the \nlatter inherited a burden of complex problems in the \naftermath of the armed struggle for national liberation. \nAs in other countries with a similar past, the problems \nassociated with this condition are not easy to \novercome, especially when facing survival issues that \nplague all of society. Aware of these facts, the \nGovernment held a round table discussion in Praia, \nCape Verde, last May to jointly evaluate the proposed \nreform programme for the defence and security sectors \nwith the help of our development partners, the United \nNations, ECOWAS and the CPLP. The continuation of \nthe reform programme in the military and security \nforces, within which the establishment of a Special \nPensions Fund is planned, specially designed to deal \nwith these issues, can contribute to solving those \nproblems once and for all. \n My Government has just concluded a thorough \nassessment of our national poverty reduction strategy. \nThe results of this evaluation allowed us to conclude \nthat we must strengthen our action on all the axes that \ndefine the strategy. It also enabled us, after careful \nconsideration, to determine that the greatest \nimpediment to the development of our country lies in \nthe energy sector. It was concluded that the top priority \nshould be to develop an energy plan that solves this \nproblem definitively. We would therefore like to use \nthis forum to ask our development partners to carry out \nthe interim review of our poverty reduction strategy \nand its respective programmes as soon as possible so \nthat we can organize, together with our partners, a \nround table to address the need to strengthen the \ntechnical, economic and financial cooperation \nprogrammes with our country. This round table, which \nwe would like to organize under the title of \n\u201cReconciliation and Development\u201d, will take into \naccount the new strategic direction advocated by the \nSecurity Council, with the transformation of the \ncurrent United Nations presence in Guinea-Bissau into \nan integrated mission from January 2010. \n I believe I am in a position to say that, by \nworking selflessly within this framework and with the \nresources that we obtain, we will be better able to \naccomplish the Millennium Development Goals set by \nthe United Nations, in particular with regard to the \nconsolidation of peace and stability in our country. \n We welcome with satisfaction and encourage the \npolicy of President Obama towards Africa, as recently \nclarified during his visit to some African countries; it \nshows concern for the stability of our subregion and of \nthe world at large, and devotes greater attention to the \npromotion of development. We also welcome with \nsatisfaction the peace initiatives that are under way in \nthe Middle East under his patronage, as well as the \nUnited States Administration\u2019s policy towards Cuba; \nwe hope that the embargo against Cuba will be lifted in \nthe near future. \n We have been asking our development partners \nfor many years for a post-conflict programme for \nGuinea-Bissau. A country with such severe shortages \nas ours should not be abandoned to its fate, given the \nprofound consequences of the political-military \nconflict of 1998-1999, which continue to affect all \nsocio-economic sectors of Guinea-Bissau. Guinea-\nBissau, which once possessed foreign currency \nreserves enough to provide for six months\u2019 worth of \nimports and which paid regular wages to its State \nemployees, can no longer honour its commitments \nbecause of the war. \n I am therefore particularly pleased with the \nposition of the African Development Bank, which, \nunderstanding the needs of a post-conflict country, \nturned an important part of the financial resources \navailable to Guinea-Bissau into donations. Likewise, \nwe welcome the recent decision by the International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank to negotiate and \nconclude a post-conflict programme with our \nGovernment, which will soon be joining the Poverty \nReduction and Growth Facility, which will enhance \ncooperation with our key development partners. We \nhope this new and dynamic level of cooperation will \nenable us to benefit from the initiative for debt relief \nunder the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.  \n  \n \n09-52592 10 \n \n I should like publicly to express our appreciation \nto the heads of State of the West African Economic and \nMonetary Union, Angola, Nigeria, the Leader and \nGuide of the Great Socialist Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, \nas well as to the CPLP and the European Union, for \ntheir support in covering our budget deficit, which has \ngreatly contributed to the climate of peace in which we \nnow live. Moreover, we acknowledge the presence of \nSouth Africa, Brazil and India, which have been \ncontributing significantly to mitigating food shortages \nin our country through the India, Brazil and South \nAfrica programme. \n I should like to assure the General Assembly that, \nin bearing our responsibility for the governance of \nGuinea-Bissau, we shall strive to continue to merit the \ntrust and support that the international community has \ngranted us. We will do everything possible to enable \nGuinea-Bissau to make strides towards development \nand the well-being of its people. \n We are of the opinion that the people of Guinea-\nBissau themselves should seek to resolve their internal \nproblems, especially those arising from social, political \nand military issues. However, one has to recognize that \nthe reasons for the recurrence of the cyclical issues in \nour country are not only domestic in nature. Factors \nsuch as transnational organized crime and drug \ntrafficking, in particular, have contributed to \nexacerbating the situation in Guinea-Bissau. \n By taking advantage of our shortcomings in sea \nand land border control and in our administration \nstructures, which are weak in some regions, and by \nusing sophisticated means, certain groups have \nintroduced drugs into our country with the support \nreceived from influential people in the State apparatus. \n My Government is committed to participating in \nall programmes and initiatives adopted in the subregion \nof West Africa to combat drug trafficking and \norganized crime, as we are convinced of the need to \nestablish mechanisms for coordination and support to \nfight these scourges. \n We are prepared to examine the possibility of the \nparticipation of foreign forces in our country in joint \nsurveillance missions monitoring our land and \nmaritime borders as well as our airspace, in order to \neradicate organized crime and all forms of trafficking \nin drugs, weapons and people, from or through the \nterritory of Guinea-Bissau. \n I would like to state before this Assembly my \ncommitment as Prime Minister and president of the \nhistoric party founded by Amilcar Cabral, the African \nParty for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde, \nto strive to put Guinea-Bissau on the path of peace, \nnational reconciliation and development. We will \nrespect all the commitments made by my Government, \nwhether related to peacebuilding, policy dialogue, \npoverty reduction and the creation of conditions \nconducive to economic growth and well-being of the \nGuinean people. \n I ask the international community and our \ndevelopment partners who believe in our determination \nto end the cycles of crises and the recurring conflicts in \nGuinea-Bissau to provide a new opportunity to our \ncountry for a true partnership in favour of sustainable \ndevelopment. \n I want to thank all the friends and partners of \nGuinea-Bissau for their solidarity and support. I can \nassure the Assembly that we will spare no efforts and \nwill not be deterred by any obstacles in consolidating \npeace and political stability, promoting national unity \nin Guinea-Bissau and creating better living conditions \nfor the Guinean people. \n I leave this podium with a very special expression \nof our gratitude to all those who have contributed to \nthis normalization, with particular attention, if you will \nallow me, to all of the members of the Contact Group, \nthe Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau, whose \nmandate was recently terminated, all members of the \nSecurity Council, as well as to the Secretary-General \nand his Representative in Guinea-Bissau. \n However, the most sublime show of appreciation \non our part would be to build a peaceful and \nprosperous Guinea-Bissau for all its children, which \nwe will strive to do with all our might."

        "file_text": "I am deeply honoured to \naddress this audience on behalf of the Republic of \nBulgaria. I would like to convey my delegation\u2019s \ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Treki on his assumption of \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfourth session, and wish him success in the months \nahead. \n Our gratitude goes to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann for his leadership and guidance during the \nprevious session. Let me also thank Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his resolute efforts to promote the \nUnited Nations and its values. \n Bulgaria fully aligns itself with the statement \nmade by the Prime Minister of Sweden, Mr. Fredrik \nReinfeldt, on behalf of the European Union. \n Furthermore, Bulgaria would like to express its \npleasure at the election of Ambassador Irina Bokova as \nthe new Director-General of UNESCO. We would like \nto thank all Member States for the trust invested in our \ncandidate. Bulgaria takes great pride in having such a \nhigh-level representative in the United Nations system \nand would like to assure the Assembly that our \nGovernment will continue to do everything it can to \nfoster the policies and ideals of UNESCO. \n As a member of the European Union (EU), \nBulgaria is dedicated to the spirit of multilateralism \nand therefore fully supports the efforts to strengthen \nthe United Nations capacity to deliver effective \ninternational responses to global challenges. \n The most pressing issues that require our \nattention are undoubtedly the global economic and \nfinancial crisis and the negative impact of climate \nchange. In this light, we particularly appreciate the \nSecretary-General\u2019s initiative to convene the United \nNations Summit on Climate Change on 22 September. \nFurthermore, I would like to express our support for \nthe statement made by the President of France at this \ngeneral debate. We are indeed running out of time, and \nif we want to reach an agreement in Copenhagen, \ntimely action is needed. \n In the globalized world of the twenty-first \ncentury, my country strongly reiterates its full \ncommitment to the principle of effective \nmultilateralism based on international law, the United \nNations Charter and the United Nations system, which \nplace the human being and human security, rights and \ndignity at the very centre of international politics. \n Bulgaria considers cooperation in South-East \nEurope and the Black Sea region to be a priority of its \nforeign policy. Situated at a particular geographic \ncrossroads, Bulgaria is in a unique position to assess \nthe areas\u2019 pressing issues in their complexity. Together \nwith our partners in the EU and NATO, Bulgaria is \nproactively cooperating with its immediate neighbours. \n Bulgaria strongly affirms that regional \ncooperation is an integral part of European integration \nof the western Balkans. It contributes to the \nstrengthening of confidence, stability, security and the \naffirmation of European standards in the region. To this \nend, Bulgaria is committed to pursuing efforts aimed at \ncombating and preventing the use of hate speech likely \nto create fears and tensions between groups from \ndifferent ethnic, national, religious or social \nbackgrounds. \n We therefore call for full compliance with human \nrights and fundamental freedoms in the western \nBalkans. In this context, Bulgaria believes that the \nbuilding of a stable, peaceful, democratic and \nmulti-ethnic Kosovo, living in peace with its \n \n \n31 09-52592 \n \nneighbours, is of primary importance to the security \narchitecture of the western Balkans and Europe as a \nwhole. \n Bulgaria is particularly interested in the peaceful \nlong-term development of the Black Sea region. \nDespite active cooperation among countries in the \nregion, much of its potential has so far not been \nutilized sufficiently. In this light, it must be said that \nthe South Caucasus remains a region of concern for \nBulgaria. We call upon the parties involved to \novercome their differences and to engage in a dialogue \nto ensure the peaceful and prosperous development of \nthe entire Caucasus. \n Today, it is our task not only to respond to the \nchallenges, but also to embrace the opportunities that \nthe Black Sea region provides. Bulgaria believes that \nthe strong Eastern dimension of the European \nNeighbourhood Policy addresses the needs and \npriorities of all the partners. We see opportunities for \nlaunching projects in important sectors, such as \ntransport, trade, energy, environmental protection and \nborder security. My country is one of the main \nsupporters of the Black Sea Synergy initiative, which \nserves as an inclusive cooperation platform between \nthe European Union and the countries of the wider \nBlack Sea region. Bulgaria will endeavour to \ncontribute to the success of those policies, in particular \nthrough its forthcoming chairmanship of the Black Sea \nEconomic Cooperation Organization. \n Bulgaria would, furthermore, like to thank the \nUnited States and our partners in the European Union \nfor the constructive part they have played in both the \nBalkan and the Black Sea regions. We are grateful for \ntheir counsel and support, and we very much look \nforward to further deepening and intensifying our \ncooperation. \n The list of persistent grave risks and challenges to \nglobal security is, regrettably, not a short one. We are \nconvinced of the need to step up efforts aimed at \nachieving progress in the areas of international \ndisarmament, arms control and non-proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. In this regard, the need \nfor the full and universal implementation of the \nNon-Proliferation Treaty regime remains of utmost \nimportance, and my country is dedicated to supporting \na successful outcome of the 2010 Non-Proliferation \nTreaty Review Conference. \n We are deeply concerned by the recent turn of \nevents regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear dossier, and, in this \nrespect, we strongly appeal to the Iranian authorities to \ncomply with relevant resolutions of the Security \nCouncil and to provide their full cooperation to the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. Bulgaria hopes \nthat the forthcoming negotiations between Iran and the \nfive permanent members of the Security Council plus \nGermany (P5+1), scheduled for the beginning of \nOctober, will make it possible to renew the discussion \non the Iranian nuclear programme and pave the way for \na comprehensive solution before December this year. \n Bulgaria confirms its position that further reform \nof the main United Nations bodies is necessary. We \nbelieve it is desirable to enhance the transparency and \neffectiveness of the system. Furthermore, we need only \nrecall the enormous challenges facing Member States \nand the international community in the twenty-first \ncentury world to see the need to reform the United \nNations. \n Reform of the Security Council should certainly \nbe a central element in any reform of the United \nNations. We would like to reiterate our position that \nboth categories of membership on the Council need to \nbe enlarged. Furthermore, we believe that the regional \nGroup of Eastern European States should be allocated \nat least one additional non-permanent seat. \n Bulgaria is well aware of the need to pursue \ninternational diplomacy in order to overcome existing \nconflicts. As a consequence, we welcome the positive \nrole that the European Union plays as a mediator in \nnumerous conflict areas around the world. One such \narea is the Middle East. Bulgaria firmly supports the \nefforts of the members of the Quartet in the Middle \nEast peace process and believes that re-establishing \ndirect dialogue between the Israeli and Palestinian \ndelegations is of fundamental importance. Bulgaria \nfirmly supports the position of the European Union in \nthis regard and underlines the fact that a \ncomprehensive and lasting peace can only be realized \nif the Israeli and Palestinian peoples can live \npeacefully, side by side, each in its own sovereign State \nand in mutual recognition. \n Another area where the United Nations, \nsupported by the European Union, has an enormous \npotential to be a force for peace and stability is in \nAfghanistan. Bulgaria believes that, overall, a more \ncomprehensive and coordinated approach in \n  \n \n09-52592 32 \n \nAfghanistan is desirable. In this light, the Bulgarian \nGovernment thanks the Swedish presidency of the \nEuropean Union for preparing a blue book listing all \nEuropean efforts in Afghanistan with the aim of \nhelping improve coordination on the ground. \n Together with our European Union partners, \nBulgaria is strongly committed to the cause of human \nrights. As such, Bulgaria will continue to clearly \ncondemn all such violations of human rights as torture, \nslavery, sexual abuse and female genital mutilation. \nAdditionally, in this light, we support the call by the \nSwedish presidency of the European Union for greater \nempowerment of women and gender equality. \nFurthermore, we appreciate the Secretary-General\u2019s \nreport entitled \u201cImplementation of the responsibility to \nprotect\u201d of January 2009 (A/63/677) as an important \nand timely document, and we state our firm interest in \nfurther discussing and elaborating on the concept. We \nhope that, with the recent adoption of resolution \n63/308, this concept will be implemented. \n In the course of the past year, the world has faced \nmultiple challenges related to the global economic and \nfinancial crisis. This crisis has had a huge impact on \nvirtually all sectors of our economy. Bulgaria firmly \nbelieves that we can only overcome the crisis through \nthe joint efforts of all relevant actors. We are all in the \nsame boat, and we must all ensure that the lessons of \nour past mistakes are learned and remembered. To that \nend, we call for further intensification of the \ncooperation between developing and developed \ncountries. Additional support should be provided to \ndeveloping countries in order to avoid further \naggravation of global poverty and hunger. More \nbroadly, we are more concerned that the global \nrecession might lead to a decrease in the total level of \nofficial development assistance. Greater attention \nshould therefore be paid to the conclusions put forward \nin the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness of 2005 \nand the Accra Agenda for Action of 2008. Furthermore, \nwhile we are well aware of our financial constraints, \nBulgaria, as a country that only recently emerged from \nthe status of a recipient of foreign aid, is committed to \nlive up to its international responsibilities and is \ndetermined to be a force for peace and stability. \n It is true that the efforts of the United Nations for \npeace, stability and development constitute an \nimpressive list of achievements. It is also true that a lot \nmore could and should be achieved this year and in the \nyears to come. At the end of the day, however, the \nachievements of the United Nations depend on what \nwe, the Member States, are willing to do. We have a \nshared responsibility for the future of our planet. Only \nthrough open and honest cooperation can we be \nsuccessful in overcoming the challenges ahead. \n So let us work together, demonstrate beyond any \ndoubt our goodwill, flexibility and commitment, and \nmake this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly \na real success."

        "file_text": "I stand here to \nreaffirm the Charter of the United Nations, not to tear \nit up. I call on every nation to support its universal \nprinciples.  \n A year ago, we met on the brink of a global crisis \nand, as national leaders spoke in turn at this rostrum, \nthe full scale of the danger was becoming clear \u2014 a \nthreat not just to jobs, businesses and life savings but, \nwith the imminent risk of failure of the world\u2019s \nbanking system, the prospect of entire countries failing \nas nations across Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin \nAmerica struggled to access credit. \n That crisis demanded global action. As never \nbefore, the fate of every country rested on the actions \nof all. And as the fear of the unthinkable took hold, we \nreached a clear choice: to fail separately or to succeed \ntogether. \n At the G-20 meetings in Washington and again in \nLondon, we made our choice. Governments came \ntogether to begin the fight back against the global \nrecession. We acted in concert, recognizing that \nnational interests could be protected only by serving \nthe common interest, and that in this new global \neconomy, the economy is indivisible and recession \nanywhere can threaten prosperity everywhere. We \nreckoned also that, if growth is to be sustained, it has \nto be shared. Global problems can be mastered only \nthrough global solutions. \n So I think that today we can draw strength from \nthe unprecedented unity that has defined the past year. \nBut we cannot be complacent. For while it may seem \nstrange to say so after a time of such intense global \ncooperation, our world is now entering a six-month \nperiod which may prove even more testing for \ninternational cooperation together. \n I believe that we face five urgent challenges that \ndemand momentous decisions \u2014 decisions that I \nwould argue are epoch-making \u2014 on climate change, \nterrorism, nuclear proliferation, shared prosperity and \neradicating poverty. \n Once again, we are at a point of no return. And \njust as the collapse of the banks focused our minds a \nyear ago, so we must grasp this next set of challenges \nimmediately. \n If we do not reach a climate change deal at \nCopenhagen, if we miss this great opportunity to agree \ntogether to protect our planet, we cannot hope for an \neasy second chance some time in the future. There will \nbe no retrospective global agreement to undo the \n  \n \n09-52179 52 \n \ndamage that we have caused. This is the moment now \nto limit and reverse the climate change we are \ninflicting on future generations \u2014 not later, not at \nanother conference, not in a later decade, after we have \nalready lost 10 years to inaction and delay. \n And if, in Afghanistan, we give way to the \ninsurgency and Al-Qaida , other terrorist groups and \nAl-Qaida will return and, from that sanctuary once \nagain plot, train for and launch attacks on the rest of \nthe world. \n There can be no chance, either, of a nuclear-free \nworld if we allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and, \nin doing so, set off a new arms race. \n There can be no global compact for jobs and \ngrowth if we choke off recovery by failing to act \ntogether to follow through on the coordinated global \nfiscal expansion we agreed and have now put in place. \n And if we do not act together to prevent \navoidable illness, there can be no plan to save \ntomorrow the 12,000 children who are dying in Africa \ntoday and every day. \n So I say we do need world agreement on urgent \nchallenges. \n Now let me elaborate first on climate change. \nDespite the promises we have made, the road to a \nsuccessful outcome in Copenhagen is not assured. Why \nis that? It is so because, above all, a robust and long-\nterm deal on climate change requires money. If the \npoorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to \nadapt; if the emerging economies are going to embark \non low-carbon development paths; and if the forest \nnations are going to slow and stop deforestation, then I \nknow that the richer countries must contribute \nfinancially. \n That is why I have proposed a new approach to \nfinancing our action against climate change. It will \nprovide substantially increased additional and \npredictable flows. They will be flows of capital from \nboth public and private sectors. They would be worth \naround $100  billion a year by 2020. In the coming \ndays, we must make progress. \n A post-2012 agreement on climate change at \nCopenhagen is the next great test of our global \ncooperation. Each of us has a duty of leadership to \nmake sure that it happens. We must build on the \ndiscussions at Secretary-General Ban\u2019s meeting this \nweek. I have said that I will go to Copenhagen to \nconclude the deal because I believe that it is too \nimportant an agreement \u2014 for the global economy, and \nfor the future of every nation represented here \u2014 \nsimply to leave it to chance. So I urge my fellow \nleaders to commit themselves to backing up our official \nnegotiators by going to Copenhagen too. \n I believe that a safer Afghanistan means a safer \nworld. But none of us can be safe if we walk away \nfrom that country or from our common mission and \nresolve. NATO and its partners, from Australia to Japan \nto other countries, must agree new ways to implement \nour strategy. I believe that we must ensure that \n\u201cAfghanization\u201d takes place \u2014 that the army, people \nand the people of Afghanistan assume greater \nresponsibility for the security of their own country. \n So, too, must we unite against terror and injustice \nwherever they are to be found in our world. I believe \nthat it shames us all that the people of Somalia and the \nSudan are still subject to the most terrible of violence; \nthat Israel and Palestine have still not found a way to \nlive side by side in security and peace; and that, for the \npeople of Burma, their elected leader is subjected to a \nshow trial and decades of imprisonment. There is more \nthat we can do and more that we must do. And we must \ncarry forward our efforts to make a coherent, strategic \nand more effective approach to peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding around the world. \n Once there were five nuclear-armed Powers. Now \nthere are nine. The real and present danger is that more \nwill soon follow. And the risk is not just State \naggression, but the acquisition of nuclear weapons by \nterrorists. So we must accept that we are at a moment \nof danger when decades of preventing proliferation \ncould be overturned by a damaging rise in \nproliferation. If we are serious about the ambition of a \nnuclear-free world, we will need statesmanship, not \nbrinksmanship. \n Tomorrow\u2019s Security Council resolution will be \nvital, in my view, as we move forward towards next \nyear\u2019s global nuclear security summit in April and the \nReview Conference in May. Our proposal is a grand \nglobal bargain between nuclear-weapon and  \nnon-nuclear-weapon States. There are three elements to \nit, where careful and sober international leadership is \nessential and in which Britain will play its part: the \nresponsibilities of non-nuclear States, the rights of  \n \n \n53 09-52179 \n \nnon-nuclear States and, of course, the responsibilities \nof nuclear weapon States. \n First, let there be no ambiguity: Iran and North \nKorea must now know that the world will be even \ntougher on proliferation. We are ready to consider \nfurther sanctions. Britain will insist in future that the \nonus on non-nuclear States is that in the years ahead it \nis for them to prove that they are not developing \nnuclear weapons. \n Secondly, Britain will offer civil nuclear power to \nnon-nuclear States who are ready to renounce any \nplans for nuclear weapons, helping non-nuclear States \nacquire what President Eisenhower so memorably \ncalled \u201catoms for peace\u201d. With others, we will be \nprepared to sponsor a uranium bank outside those \ncountries to help them access civil nuclear power. And \nBritain is ready to launch a new nuclear centre of \nexcellence to help develop an economic low-carbon \nproliferation-resistant nuclear fuel cycle. \n My third point is that all nuclear-weapon States \nmust reciprocally play their part in reducing nuclear \nweapons as part of an agreement by non-nuclear States \nto renounce them. This is exactly what the  \nNon-Proliferation Treaty intended, and in line with \nmaintaining our nuclear deterrent I have asked our \nNational Security Committee to report to me on the \npotential future reduction of our nuclear weapon \nsubmarines from four to three. \n While economic cooperation has stabilized the \ninternational banking system and forged the foundation \nfor the resumption of economic growth, recovery is \nneither entrenched nor irreversible. The great lesson of \nthe past year is that only the bold and global action that \nwe took prevented a recession becoming a depression. \nWe have delivered a coordinated monetary and fiscal \nresponse that the International Labour Organization \nestimates has saved 7 million to 11 million jobs across \nthe world. \n So at Pittsburgh, when the Group of 20 (G-20) \nmeets tomorrow, we must cement a global compact for \njobs and growth \u2014 a compact to bring unemployment \ndown and bring rising prosperity across the globe. We \nmust maximize the impact of the stimulus measures we \nhave agreed. There must be proper planning of exit \nstrategies together to make sure the recovery does not \nfalter. We do not and must not turn off the life support \nfor our economy prematurely. We must also facilitate \nagreement setting clear objectives on how each of us \ncan contribute to worldwide growth in the future, and \nwe must ensure that such future growth is balanced and \nsustainable. \n I believe we need stronger economic cooperation \nnow as we navigate the uncertainties of recovery. I \ntherefore propose we launch the compact by agreeing \nthat we are committed to high levels of growth on a \nsustainable and balanced basis. This must be backed up \nby comprehensive reform of the financial sector. It \nmust include international principles on bonuses. We \nmust strengthen our targeting of tax havens. From next \nmonth, real sanctions must be meted out against those \njurisdictions that fail to meet global standards. \n The voice of Africa will have to be heard and \nheeded to bring recovery in areas devastated by the \nevents of the past year and to assure that for all \ndeveloping countries, inside and outside Africa, we do \nnot put the Millennium Development Goals beyond \nreach as a result of a wider failure of global \nresponsibility. \n In London, the G-20 agreed on measures worth \n$50 billion for poor countries to help them weather the \ncrisis. Because of London, the International Monetary \nFund can lend $8 billion instead of $2 billion over this \nyear and next. This is already helping Kenya and \nTanzania to increase Government spending in response \nto the crisis. \n Amid all these challenges, we must remember a \nfundamental promise we made 10 years ago. And this \nis my fifth and final imperative: to achieve a vision for \n2015 that we are in danger of betraying, because on \npresent trends it will not take five years \u2014 as we \npledged \u2014 and not even 50 years; it will take more \nthan 100 years to deliver on some of our Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. And 100 years is too long for the \npeoples of our countries to wait for the justice that has \nbeen promised.  \n As President Obama has said, we need a global \nplan to make the Millennium Development Goals a \nreality. The unyielding, grinding, soul-destroying, so \noften lethal poverty I saw in Africa and other \ndeveloping countries has convinced me that unless \nempowerment through trade justice is matched by \nempowerment through free education and free health \ncare, then this generation in sub-Saharan Africa will \nnot have the opportunity they deserve to rise out of \npoverty and will never be fully free. \n  \n \n09-52179 54 \n \n I believe the greatest of injustice demands the \nboldest of actions. Today at this United Nations \nGeneral Assembly, we will see history being made with \nthe beginnings of universal free health care in Africa \nand Asia as Burundi, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Nepal, \nLiberia and Ghana all make major announcements, \nwhich I applaud, that extend free health care and \nabolish user fees. As a result of those actions, more \nthan 10 million additional people in Africa and Asia \nwill now have access to free health services \u2014 \n10 million people who will now for the first time get \nthe treatment they need without being turned away or \nfearing how they will pay. I urge you all to match the \nleadership of these countries with your own support, \nand I commit the United Kingdom to giving that \nsupport. \n Let us remember how in 1945, as the United \nNations was being created, countries faced a \nmultiplicity of challenges but summoned up the energy \nand vision not just to rebuild from the ruin and rubble \nof a war, but to establish a new international order for \nshared security and progress. I believe that these same \nprinciples must now inspire new and better, more \nrepresentative and more effective ways of cooperating \nglobally together. \n And as we learn from the experience of turning \ncommon purpose into common action in this our \nshared global society, so we must forge a progressive \nmultilateralism for this era, one that depends upon us \nfinding within ourselves and together the qualities of \nmoral courage and leadership that for our time and for \nour generation can make this world anew. I believe that \nif we take the right decisions and work together, we are \nin the business of creating for the first time in human \nhistory a truly global society. It is a name to be wished \nfor and an aim to be fought for by all of us."

        "file_text": "I \nwish the President all the best for this General \nAssembly. Along with Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, he can count on Portugal\u2019s firm support in \nhis work. Allow me to begin by endorsing fully \nSweden\u2019s intervention as the country holding the \npresidency of the European Union. \n Fighting climate change is both a moral \nimperative and a matter of survival. This is no longer a \nlong-term issue. Its consequences are evident \neverywhere; from the small island States to Portugal, \nwe can all witness it. The time to act is now. I \ncongratulate the Secretary-General on the timely high-\nlevel meeting on climate change. The objective of \nmobilizing political will and vision for the climate \nnegotiations has been fulfilled. The process of political \nconsciousness-raising is done. Governments are now \nbetter prepared to take the decisions necessary for an \nambitious agreement in Copenhagen. At December\u2019s \nClimate Change Summit, every State should take on \nbold commitments, to the extent that their respective \nresponsibilities and capacities allow, so that the post-\n2012 world can meet the challenge. If, however, we \nleave Copenhagen with limited results and small, \ninsignificant reforms, we will be failing in our historic \nresponsibilities. \n We are all affected by climate change, but it is \nobvious that the consequences are not equally \ndistributed. The least developed countries and small \nisland States, despite being the lowest polluters, suffer \nthe most from the effects of climate change, and their \ngreater vulnerability imposes a larger responsibility on \nthe international community. Being part of a \ncommunity means having a responsibility to the other \nmembers of the community; so, when we talk about the \ninternational community, we automatically imply that \nit is our duty to support these countries in their \nadaptation and mitigation efforts. \n The General Assembly\u2019s resolution 63/281, on \nthe impact of climate change on global security, is a \ngood step forward. But it must be followed up. The \nUnited Nations should promote in-depth debates on \nthis matter at all relevant levels during the session we \nare now starting. Portugal is a country that has built its \nhistory through an extraordinary relationship with the \nsea. It is, therefore, natural for us to promote the \nsustainable development of oceans and their resources \nwith a coherent and coordinated approach. We see this \nas a strategic issue for the whole world. In this regard, \nPortugal has contributed in multiple contexts, including \nto the maritime policy of the European Union and the \nocean strategy of the Community of Portuguese \nSpeaking Countries (CPLP). \n The preservation of the environment must also \ntackle the energy question. Climate change brings \nchallenges but also great opportunities. Fully conscious \nof this, Portugal is strongly committed to renewable \nenergy sources: solar, wind, hydro, biomass and wave \npower. In 2010 we plan to produce 45 per cent of our \nenergy from renewable sources. By 2020 we will reach \n60 per cent. Furthermore, Portugal has one of the \nlowest carbon-emission rates per capita in the \nEuropean Union, and we are ready to share our \nexperience in this area with all interested Member \nStates. \n A year ago, when we gathered in this Hall for the \nopening of the sixty-third session of the Assembly, the \nworld was waking up to an economic and financial \ncrisis that we are still dealing with today. Recent \npositive signs bear witness to the results of \ninternational cooperation in the face of this common \nthreat, but we are aware that the effects of this crisis \ncontinue to be felt in the daily lives of millions of \npeople all over the world, and that the most vulnerable \nare once again the main victims. We are convinced that \nthe international financial system must be guided by \nprinciples of responsibility and transparency, and that \nregulation and supervision must be strengthened. We \ncan and should make sure that international markets \nare based on the values, principles and standards of \nconduct that we share. \n We should also ensure that the benefits of \neconomic globalization have a more universal impact. \nThe United Nations Global Compact is an important \ncontribution to this end. The solution to this issue was \nnot, is not and will never be protectionism. Closing the \ndoor on our neighbours and partners means leaving \npeople in poverty and failing to solve our medium- to \nlong-term domestic problems. It is therefore crucial \nthat we bring the Doha Round to a rapid conclusion in \na way that corresponds fully to the sustainable global \ndevelopment objectives that have been outlined. At the \nsame time, we renew our firm commitment to the \nMillennium Development Goals. We cannot allow the \neconomic crisis to affect the gains we have achieved \nthrough this process. A State that forgets the common \ngood will sooner or later find instability, poverty and \n  \n \n09-52604 52 \n \ninsecurity knocking at its door. Portugal, with its sense \nof collective responsibility and international cohesion, \nwill continue to contribute to the limits of its capacity. \n We concentrate a large part of our action on \ndevelopment aid in Africa, where poverty is most \nmarked. In this regard, I would like to mention that \nPortugal is currently a co-president of the Africa \nPartnership Forum and, in this capacity, in concert with \nour African partners, we have communicated to the \nG-20 the specific concerns and interests of the \ncontinent in areas such as the response to the economic \nand financial crisis and climate change. In the context \nof Africa, we continue to be firmly committed to \nimplementing the first European Union Action Plan \nand Common Strategy, adopted at the second European \nUnion and Africa Summit in Lisbon in December 2007. \n Allow me at this point to salute the people of \nGuinea-Bissau for their conduct of the recent elections \nin their country. It is now up to the Guinean institutions \nto maintain and consolidate peace and stability, and it \nis up to the international community to increase its \nassistance in order to strengthen the building of \ninstitutions and security sector reform in Guinea-\nBissau. Portugal will continue to be strongly \ncommitted to this process, bearing in mind the wishes \nexpressed by the democratically elected institutions of \nGuinea-Bissau. \n This month we celebrate the tenth anniversary of \nthe self-determination referendum of Timor-Leste, and \nwe take this opportunity to pay a heartfelt tribute to the \nEast-Timorese people. The referendum was the \ncorollary of the affirmation of Timor-Leste\u2019s identity \nand its admirable will towards peace and development \nas a sovereign nation. \n Guinea-Bissau and Timor-Leste are two countries \nthat demonstrate the growing involvement of the \nCommunity of Portuguese Speaking Countries in \npromoting peace, democracy, human rights, political \nstability and social and economic development. One of \nthe fundamental pillars of that organization, over \nwhich Portugal currently presides, is the promotion of \nthe Portuguese language, one of the five most widely \nspoken languages in the world and the vehicle of \ncommunication for more than 250 million people, \nconnecting States and peoples in all corners of the \nworld. It is therefore ever more pressing and fair that \nPortuguese be made an official or working language in \ninternational organizations. Portugal is also assuming \nthe pro tempore presidency of the Ibero-American \nConference on Culture, whose summit will take place \nthis year in Estoril, Portugal, with innovation and \nknowledge as its theme. \n In this regard, I wish to emphasize that, as \nPresident of the CPLP and the Ibero-American \nConference, Portugal has, through regional institutions \nand organizations, supported the participation and \ninvolvement of emerging economies and developing \ncountries in the debate over the reform of the \ninternational financial system. \n Regarding the situation in Honduras, we call for \nthe speedy re-establishment of democratic and \nconstitutional legality, and we recall the inviolability of \nthe diplomatic mission of Brazil, under the principles \nof the Vienna Convention. \n The CPLP and the Ibero-American Conference \nare true paradigms of intercontinental cooperation, \nbased on a communion of cultures and values. We also \nconsider these paradigms to be the spirit and the \nessence of the Alliance of Civilizations. Thus, it is with \ngreat satisfaction that we witness the enormous \nprogress in the work of the Alliance and that we shall \nparticipate in the Third Forum of the Alliance, to be \nheld in Brazil in 2010, which will be an event in which \nthe CPLP will have a special role. I take this \nopportunity to congratulate the High Representative of \nthe Secretary-General for his Office\u2019s valuable work. \n Portugal is proud to have been among the first \nsignatories of the Optional Protocol to the International \nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, \nwhich has just been opened for signature. We call on \nall States Members of the United Nations to do so as \nwell, so that this new international human rights \ninstrument may enter into effect and bring about \nrespect for all human rights for every human being. \n Equally fundamental in the defence and \npromotion of human dignity is the continuous action of \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \nas well as the recent appointment of the Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General on Violence \nagainst Children. In both cases I would like to \nhighlight the committed, tireless and effective way in \nwhich they have assumed their responsibilities. \n Terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons are the greatest challenges to international \npeace and security. In combating these threats it is \n \n \n53 09-52604 \n \nessential that we implement the respective international \nregimes and continue to invest in international \ncooperation, in particular in the framework of the \nUnited Nations. All States that signed the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty must honour their obligations \nwithout reservations. \n Regarding the maintenance of international peace \nand security, we have never demanded so much from \nthe United Nations. If peacekeeping operations are to \nhave the outcome that they deserve, clear, credible and \nachievable mandates are absolutely necessary, as is the \nengagement of all Member States through contribution \nof personnel. \n Portugal has assumed its share, with both \nfinancial and operational contributions. More than \n20,000 members of Portuguese armed forces and 3,000 \nfrom the Portuguese police forces have participated so \nfar in peacekeeping operations. Today, we have \npeacekeepers in Timor-Leste, Lebanon, Afghanistan \nand Chad. \n One of the main challenges to international peace \nand security is the conflict in the Middle East. Portugal \nreiterates its support for a two-State solution, with the \ncreation of an independent, democratic and viable \nPalestinian State, to exist side by side in peace and \nsecurity with the State of Israel. But to attain this \nobjective it is paramount that Palestine have a territory \nthat enables it to exist as a State. \n In this context, Portugal will continue to support \nall efforts, in particular those of Egypt and the United \nStates, for the return to the negotiation process in \naccordance with Security Council resolution 1860 \n(2009) and in accordance with the principles contained \nin the various peace initiatives, particularly the Arab \nPeace Initiative. We are living in a time of opportunity, \nand it is fundamental that the increasingly united \nopinion of the international community be fully \nlistened to by the parties. \n In Iraq and in Afghanistan, we welcome the \nprogress achieved in the past few years, but we \nrecognize the need for the continued commitment of \nthe international community. I hereby affirm the \nguarantee that Portugal will continue to assume its \nshare of the burden. \n Climate change, the financial and economic \ncrisis, sustainable development, human rights, threats \nto the international peace and security: to face such a \nvast array of global challenges, there is no more \nappropriate forum than the United Nations, no other \nstrategic agent that may transmit our collective \nresponse. \n Today, more than ever, the collective interest \nreflects the national concern of each of us. Today, more \nthan ever, I subscribe to Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s vision of \na United Nations as a dynamic instrument to develop \nmeans of executive action that is not limited to being \nsimply a mechanism consisting of static conferences \nfor the resolution of conflicts of interests and \nideologies. To ensure that the multilateralism we \nprofess is truly effective, to ensure that the primacy of \nthe United Nations in international politics and the \nrespect for international law is not mere rhetoric, to \nensure that this Organization is increasingly more like \nthe dynamic instrument that Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld \nenvisioned, we must further the reform of the United \nNations. We must seek in this General Assembly a \nbroad consensus that will enable what we all know is \nnecessary to take place, namely, the reform of the \nSecurity Council. \n In so doing we should ask ourselves whether a \nSecurity Council without Brazil and India as \npermanent members, and where Africa is not \nrepresented with that same status, is a truly \nrepresentative Council. Is it consistent to defend a \nmore efficient and transparent Organization and yet to \nhave a Security Council without reform of its working \nmethods? \n Let us not be satisfied with merely a discussion \nof a better Organization. Let us build together a more \nefficient, transparent and representative United \nNations. \n Since 2000, Portugal has been a candidate for a \nnon-permanent seat in the Security Council for the \nbiennium 2011-2012. Our candidacy is consistent with \nthe history of our engagement with the United Nations, \nour capacity to listen and dialogue with other peoples \nand cultures, and our commitment towards fair and \nbalanced solutions in international issues. We are a \ncandidate in the name of representativeness and the \nright of all countries, including those of small and \nmedium size, which constitute the majority of the \nMembers of this Organization, to be present in the \nSecurity Council. We are a candidate for the benefit of \nsustainable development and on behalf of the human \nvalues that bind us together, of the inalienable rights of \n  \n \n09-52604 54 \n \nall human beings and of our common aspiration for a \nmore just and peaceful world."

        "file_text": "The \nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly is being \nheld at a time when the international community, faced \nwith numerous crises, is seeking ways to build a world \nof shared peace and development. However, although \nthe political and economic consequences of the current \nfinancial crisis affect the whole world, they are and \nwill continue to be more severe for African countries, \ngiven their fragility and the limited diversity of their \neconomies. \n Is it fair that those who have not caused this \ntremendous international upheaval should pay the \nhighest price? It certainly is not. That is why, in the \nface of the deep recession besetting the entire planet, it \nis important to bolster partnerships for development in \norder to correct the dysfunctions of the currently \nfailing global economic system. I welcome the incisive \nconclusions of the high-level Conference on the \nfinancial and economic crisis, which could lead to the \nestablishment of a more virtuous world government \nassuring sustainable development for all States. \n In order to relaunch growth, achieve full \nemployment and restore confidence, it is essential that \n  \n \n09-52463 14 \n \nwe adopt strict rules to regulate and manage the \ninternational financial system. At the same time, it will \nbe necessary to increase aid to developing countries in \norder to help achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n On 1 September 2009, Burkina Faso experienced \nfloods that caused extensive loss of life and material \ndamage. I reiterate my deepest thanks to the friends \nand partners who have supported us in dealing with the \nconsequences of this natural disaster. The growing \nfrequency of such events all over the world is due to \nthe effects of climate change. We must therefore take \naction to address the pressing need to come up with \nappropriate solutions. In this regard, I welcome the \nmarked convergence of views and the mobilization of \nthe international community in connection with the \nissue of climate change. \n The fifteenth United Nations Conference on \nClimate Change, to be held from 7 to 18 December in \nCopenhagen, will offer countries a prime opportunity \nto take bold decisions to protect our generation and our \nplanet from the effects of global warming. It is to that \nend that Burkina Faso will host, from 9 to 11 October \nin Ouagadougou, the Seventh World Forum of \nSustainable Development in the context of climate \nchange. This event will allow Africa, a continent ill-\nequipped to resist and adapt to the consequences of \nclimate change, to amplify its contribution to the \nglobal debate on this issue. \n The recurring conflicts affecting the world are a \ngenuine threat to peace and international security, as \nwell as a serious obstacle to the economic and social \nprogress of nations. Burkina Faso wishes to express its \ndeep concern over the current situation in Darfur and \nsouthern Sudan, and reiterates its commitment to \nworking with the Sudanese people in their quest for \npeace. In that connection, Burkina Faso will dispatch a \nmilitary battalion to join the African Union-United \nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, as well as a \nformed police unit to assist in peacekeeping operations. \nThe support of the international community for the \nefforts of the Joint African Union-United Nations \nMediator to create conditions for productive dialogue \nand forge a lasting peace agreement between the \nprincipal parties is essential. \n The equally tragic situation in Somalia calls for \ngenuine support for the Transitional Federal \nGovernment so that it can definitively restore security \nthroughout the country and in Somali territorial waters. \nBurkina Faso is also following political developments \nin Guinea and Madagascar with particular interest. I \nurge the various political actors in those two countries \nto engage in constructive dialogue with all stakeholders \nto ensure a rapid return to the constitutional order. \n I congratulate the African Union and the \nsubregional organizations for the efforts they have \nmade to find satisfactory solutions to numerous \nhotspots of tension on the continent. The holding of \npresidential elections in Guinea-Bissau is an example \nof success on the part of the international community. \nIn particular, I encourage the Peacebuilding \nCommission to support the Government of Guinea-\nBissau in the reconstruction of the country. \n In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Togo, the political actors\u2019 \ncommitment to ensuring the effective implementation \nof the accords to end the crises in those countries \naffords real reason to hope for the organization of \nregular and transparent presidential elections in future. \nI welcome the Security Council\u2019s unflagging readiness \nto work with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on implementing the \nOuagadougou Political Agreement, and I encourage it \nto continue to pursue its efforts to achieve peaceful \nsolutions to conflicts. \n In regard to the matter of Western Sahara, \nBurkina Faso reaffirms its endorsement of Security \nCouncil resolution 1813 (2008), supports the \nSecretary-General\u2019s efforts to find a political solution, \nand considers the Moroccan initiative to negotiate \nautonomy for the Western Sahara to be an appropriate \nway to settle the disagreement.  \n In the Middle East, we welcome the successful \nconduct of elections in Lebanon and encourage that \ncountry to improve its relations with Syria and Israel. \nThe restoration of stability and prospects for \nnormalized relations with Lebanon\u2019s neighbours \nrepresent an opportunity for calm consideration of a \nglobal settlement of the Palestinian question.  \n The contribution of the Republic of China on \nTaiwan to assisting the least developed countries \nshould be commended, and its participation in the \nprevious session of the World Health Assembly augurs \nwell for the positive evolution of this country\u2019s \ncontribution to the life of the international community. \n For some years, the question of the proliferation \nof nuclear weapons, which pose an enormous threat, \n \n \n15 09-52463 \n \nhas divided the international community. I thank and \nencourage President Obama for his successful \norganization and leadership of the Security Council \nsummit on disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. \nThe commitments made could lead to a denuclearized \nworld that is more ambitious in its exploitation of \nnuclear power for civil purposes and more vigilant in \npolicing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. \n The reform of the United Nations, which has \nbeen on our agenda for more than a decade, calls for a \ncautious but determined approach, particular as regards \nthe Security Council. I express the hope that \nnegotiations will soon be undertaken regarding the fair \nand equitable representation of all regions of the world, \nthe strengthening of the effectiveness of the Council\u2019s \nrole and the revitalization of the General Assembly. \nTrue to the ideals of the United Nations, Burkina Faso \nwill make its contribution to the various issues and \nactions under way to endow our global Organization \nwith the vitality and authority essential to taking on the \nnew challenges on the horizon."

        "file_text": "Let \nme begin by sending a warm greeting to Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, President of the Assembly, on \nbehalf of a country 35 times smaller than his native \nLibya and infinitely different in scenery and \ngeography. Instead of desert sandstorms we have \ntorrential rains. We know not the waves of the \nMediterranean, but the capricious tides of the \nCaribbean. Its dunes are our forests, its mosques our \ncathedrals. But I believe that such differences are at the \nvery heart of the United Nations. Aristotle posited that \nthings are distinguished by what they look like. Here, \nwithin this haven, nations are similar precisely in that \nthey are distinct, because each is irreplaceable in the \nvast catalogue of the planet. From the far reaches of \nthis variety that makes us brothers, I wish him the \ngreatest success in this Assembly. \n Twenty-three years ago, I spoke for the first time \nat this rostrum \u2014 a rock of reason amidst seas of \ninsanity. At that time, I came here bearing the cries of \nmillions of Central Americans who sought a peaceful \nsolution to the civil wars that were lacerating our \nregion. I came to ask powerful nations to stop the flow \nof arms fuelling the procession of coffins in our \nterritories, and I came to defend the right of the \npeoples of Latin America to build their own destiny \nfreely and democratically. \n The second time I visited this Hall, I came \nseeking support for the peace plan that the Presidents \nof Central America had signed. In those days, no one \nthought that little Central America would defy the \nworld and choose life in the face of all threats. No one \nthought that we would have the strength to confront the \nPowers of the cold war and find our own solution to all \nour problems. No one thought that we would be able to \nsow the seeds of democracy in our lands and go on to \nwork for the human development of our peoples. We \ngave the pessimists and the sceptics a lesson. We \nrefuted with dreams the nightmares that many \nprophesied for us. Today, I come here to recognize the \ndistance we have travelled and to warn of the risk of \nbacksliding. \n Since the last time I spoke before this Assembly, \na Central American nation has seen the demon of the \ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat awaken once again. Our region\u2019s armies \nhave received nearly $60 billion to combat imaginary \nenemies, while our peoples have struggled empty-\nhanded against the economic crisis. Some leaders have \ndefied democratic rules in the most imaginative ways, \nwhile everything that was wrong with our continent has \ncarried on the same, or worse. Poverty has continued to \nafflict more than a third of our inhabitants. One in \nthree young Latin Americans still has never seen a \nhigh-school classroom. Hundreds of thousands of \npeople have died of preventable diseases. The toll of \nviolent death in some of our countries has exceeded \nthose of countries at war, despite the fact that, with the \nexception of Colombia, there are no armed conflicts in \nour region. And millions of trees have been felled in \nterritories responsible among them for two thirds of the \nworldwide forest cover loss in the twenty-first century. \n This scenario is not a hopeful one. For those of us \nfrom Latin America, it is difficult not to feel that we \nare always rescuing our future from the clutches of our \npast, and that we are always trying to take off on a \nrunway where some foolish person spilled oil, long \nago. We have not achieved greater development. We \nhave not made our democracy stronger. We have not \ndriven from our reality the shadow of militarism and \noppression. These problems recur endemically, to \nvarying degrees, in the majority of developing \nnations \u2014 the very nations that will to a large extent \nbear the weight of the course of humanity over the next \n50 years. \n It is the developing nations that will shoulder the \nworst of the struggle against global warming, that will \ncarry the heaviest burden of population growth on the \nplanet, and that will be responsible for accelerating the \ngrowth of a global economy to which the rich cannot \ncontribute much more than they already generate. We \ndo not yet know how the leading role we have been \ngiven will play out. Our success or failure will depend \non whether we have the courage to take on at least \n \n \n15 09-52425 \n \nthree fundamental challenges: the strengthening of our \ndemocracies, the encouragement of human development \nfor our peoples through the reduction of military \nspending and cross-border arms trafficking, and the \ncreation of a new international order for the transfer of \naid, information and technology to combat climate \nchange. \n Developing nations, and middle-income nations \nin particular, live simultaneously in the medieval and \npostmodern eras. In our race to emulate the \nexperiences of developed countries, we have skipped \npast fundamental steps. There is no doubt that one of \nthese steps is the patient construction of democratic \ninstitutions, on which developed countries have spent \ncenturies, while we, if we have been lucky, have spent \ndecades.  \n As a result, beyond superficial appearances, we \nlack a true civic culture. We have democratic structures \nthat in many cases are no more than empty shells. We \nhave free elections, but lack the open social forum to \nallow all citizens freely to make political or ideological \ncontribution. We have formal separation of powers, but \nin many places power remains a single monopoly \ndisguised in multiple public entities. We have rule of \nlaw, but the reach of the law is tested every day by \nGovernments incapable of applying it, when not \ndetermined actually to weaken it. We have political \nconstitutions and international treaties that reaffirm our \nbelief in democratic values, but populations still prone \nto toss those values aside for material gain. \n Paraphrasing the great Argentinean writer Jorge \nLuis Borges, we can say that most inhabitants of \ndeveloping countries do not identify with the State, \nwhich seems to them an abstract concept, removed \nfrom their immediate concerns. That is why they allow \na Government to end before its constitutional period \nhas elapsed or to continue in power beyond that period. \nThat is why they expect the Government to offer social \nwelfare and public services, but do not recognize the \nreciprocal obligations of citizens.  \n That is why they prefer caudillos to political \nparties, messianic leaders to democratic institutions. \nThat is why they boycott the approval of new taxes in \ncountries whose tax burden is half or even a third of \nthat of developed countries. That is why they so easily \nfall for a discourse that blames national problems on \nothers instead of assuming responsibility for designing \nmechanisms that confront them. And this is the best-\ncase scenario, because in the worst there is no \ndemocracy at all. \n As long as we continue on this path, placing our \nhopes in developing nations will be like pouring water \ninto a sack. As long as we fail to dedicate more \ninternational attention, and more international aid, to \nstrengthening and perfecting democracies in this world, \nwe will watch again and again as our countries try to \ntake off on a slippery runway. \n This challenge is even more urgent in the face of \nan arms race that, year by year, moves $1.3 trillion \nglobally. The combination of strong armies and weak \ndemocracies has proved harmful in every corner of the \nplanet, and above all in Latin America, which, during \nthe second half of the twentieth century was a \nshowcase of dictatorial horrors, fuelled by the \nexistence of an omnipresent military apparatus. I will \nnever tire of repeating it: in Latin America, and in a \nsubstantial portion of the developing world, armies \nhave served no purpose other than to carry out coups \nd\u2019\u00e9tat. They have not protected the people; they have \noppressed them. They have not safeguarded liberties; \nthey have trampled on them. They have not guaranteed \nrespect for the will of the people; they have mocked it. \n What is the threat to our nations? What, for \nexample, is the great enemy of Latin America that \ncompels it to waste $165 million a day on weapons and \nsoldiers? I assure the Assembly that such threats are far \nless significant than that posed by the mosquito that \ncarries malaria, for instance. They are less significant \nthan the threat posed by the lack of opportunity that \npushes our young people into crime. They are less \nsignificant than the threat posed by the drug cartels and \nstreet gangs that survive thanks to an unrestricted \nmarket for small arms and light weapons. \n And so what we have to do is order our priorities. \nCosta Rica was the first country to abolish its army and \ndeclare peace on the world. Thanks to that visionary \ndecision, thanks to the liberating army of Commander \nJos\u00e9 Figueres, who renounced arms forever, we have \nthe opportunity today to invest our resources in things \nthat matter. And while we know that not every nation is \nready to take such a radical step, we believe that a \ngradual and progressive reduction in military spending \nis not only a good strategy for allocating resources, but \nalso a moral imperative for developing nations. \n For this reason I ask the Assembly once more to \nmake the Costa Rica Consensus a reality. This \n  \n \n09-52425 16 \n \ninitiative would create mechanisms for forgiving \nforeign debt and using international financial resources \nto support those poor and middle-income developing \ncountries that are investing more in environmental \nprotection, education, health, housing and sustainable \ndevelopment for their people and less in arms and \nsoldiers. And I also ask the Assembly to approve an \narms trade treaty, which is known to this Organization, \nand which seeks to prohibit the transfer of arms to \nStates, groups or individuals when sufficient reason \nexists to believe that those arms will be used to \nundermine human rights or international law. I assure \nmembers that these two initiatives will make us safer, \nand certainly more developed, than the costly \nmachinery of death that currently consumes our \nbudgets. \n What is more, spending on arms deprives us not \nonly of economic resources. Above all, it deprives us \nof human resources. At this moment, the greatest \narsenal of genius in the world is working on refining \nthe weaponry and defence systems of a few nations. \nThat is not where this genius should be. Its place is in \nthe laboratories where medicines are being created that \nwill be accessible to all humankind. Its place is in the \nclassrooms where the leaders of tomorrow are being \nformed. Its place is in the Governments that need help \nin protecting their harvests, their cities and their \npopulations from the effects of global warming. \n We have included sustainable development in the \nCosta Rica Consensus because we believe there is a \nconnection between arms and the protection of the \nenvironment. This is, first, because arms and wars \ngenerate more environmental devastation and pollution \nthan any productive activity; and secondly, because the \nvery existence of military spending constitutes, in and \nof itself, a negation of resources available to combat \nglobal warming. Every armoured helicopter, every \ntank, every nuclear submarine represents, in practice, \nforests that are not protected, technologies that are not \nbecoming less costly and adaptations that are not being \nmade. \n Only a few weeks remain before the Climate \nChange Conference in Copenhagen, where every \ncountry will have to undertake commitments much \ngreater than today\u2019s. My small nation, Costa Rica, will \nattend the conference with its head held high, because \nunilaterally, and at great sacrifice, we have set \nourselves goals that are ever more challenging. We \nhave launched an initiative called Peace with Nature, \nthrough which we propose, among other things, to \nbecome a carbon-neutral country by the year 2021. \nThis is possible, in large part, thanks to the nearly four \ndecades we have spent protecting our land, replanting \nour forests and safeguarding our natural species \u2014 and \nalso because, at the same time that we abolished our \narmy, we created pioneering institutions devoted to the \nsearch for renewable energy sources. Today, more than \n95 per cent of our electricity comes from water or \nwind, from the depths of the Earth or the rays of the \nsun. \n Infinite challenges remain, for Costa Rica as for \nany other middle-income country. The world\u2019s rich \nnations, which developed in the most unsustainable \nway possible, cannot now place limits that choke the \ndevelopment expectations of every other country. \nEfforts must be directed instead at forming a global \nplatform that allows us to transfer international aid, \ninformation and technology efficiently from one nation \nto another; a platform that will only make sense if the \nmember States of the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development increase their official \ndevelopment aid, which today stands at $120 billion \nper year. When it comes to mitigating and adapting \nourselves to global warming the world must share, not \ncompete. \n These three challenges \u2014 strengthening \ndemocracies, reducing military spending and \ncooperating to confront climate change \u2014 perhaps \nconstitute the most ambitious agenda humanity has \never had to take on. Neither I, nor my Government, nor \nCosta Rica, will ignore this historic call; for we simply \ncannot fail. We cannot falter. We cannot turn back \nwhen we are standing at the vanguard of 6.8 billion \nhuman beings.  \n Like Adam and Eve, we are still living in a \nheavenly Paradise minutes before being expelled due \nto our own arrogance. Our sense of responsibility, our \nhumility and our courage will determine whether we \nwaste our opportunity on Earth and squander the \nmiracle of life that has brought us heartbreak and pain \nyet has also allowed us to know happiness. The \ngreatest of the Costa Rican poets, Jorge Debravo, said \nthat hope is as strong as bone and more powerful than \nimagination or memory. May that still-present hope \ngive us the strength to embark on the last journey of an \nunsustainable civilization and the first of a civilization \nthat will survive and outlast us all."

        "file_text": "\nEcuador hails the choice of Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. We believe his broad experience in the \ninternational scene augurs success in the work of this \nAssembly. Ecuador wishes especially to commend the \nformer President, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, \nfor his determination in democratizing this \nOrganization and for his unswerving commitment to \nthe poor and the voiceless of this planet. \n The central theme of this general debate \u2014 \nstrengthening multilateralism \u2014 is the very purpose of \nthe United Nations. This Organization is called on to \nbe the expression of horizontal, democratic and \nrespectful relations among the countries of the world, \nunder the strictest observance of the principle of equal \nsovereignty among States.  \n However, with its current structure and \noperations, the Organization has not been able to \nrespond to the great challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury. For that reason, it is urgent to strengthen its \nstructural reform. The Security Council must be more \nrepresentative, democratic and efficient. To achieve \nthat, we call on all Member States to make a \ncommitment to achieve true substantial transformation \nthis year in the Council\u2019s composition and its working \nmethods. Likewise, our country believes that the \nGeneral Assembly, as the most democratic and \nuniversally representative body, must fully assume the \nrole established for it in the United Nations Charter. It \nis essential to move forward on substantial agreements \nthat can lead us to a real revitalization of the Assembly. \n Along the same lines, Ecuador is committed to \nregional integration processes as mechanisms of \ncoordination, cooperation and solidarity among \npeoples. We therefore take on with great dedication and \nenthusiasm the pro tempore presidency of the Union of \nSouth American Nations (UNASUR), as an opportunity \nto contribute to integration through a welcome \nmechanism to promote democracy and collective \nwelfare in a coordinated and consensual manner. \n Latin America and the Caribbean have \nunderstood that the best way to face today\u2019s challenges \nis through effective multilateral action. Our region is \nundergoing an intense process of integration based on \nsolidarity and cooperation. That process is \ndemonstrated in such vital regional forums as the Rio \nGroup, UNASUR, the Bolivian Alternative for the \nAmericas (ALBA) and the Caribbean Community. \nThose groups engender the most diverse proposals and \ninitiatives designed to construct common agendas on \nsocial, cultural, political and economic matters, in \norder to build a new development strategy that is more \ninclusive and less predatory. \n Every integration effort requires the recognition \nof the principles of equality and sovereignty of States. \nTherefore my country applauds the reversal of the \nunfair exclusion of our sister Republic of Cuba from \nthe Organization of American States (OAS). We have \nsettled part of Cuba\u2019s debt, but despite repeated calls \non the part of this Assembly over the past 17 years, the \neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \nby the United States of America against that brother \ncountry remains in place. The blockade is contrary to \nthe great principles of international law, and its \ncontinuance is still severely affecting the well-being \nand dignity of the Cuban people. \n Latin America and the whole world have taken a \nstand with the historic General Assembly \npronouncement (resolution 63/301) condemning the \ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the legitimate Government of the \nRepublic of Honduras. The international community \nhas categorically and unanimously rejected this attack \nagainst democracy and against all the practices of \npeaceful coexistence between peoples. We therefore \ninsist on the immediate restitution of President Zelaya, \nas well as on the protection of his physical person and \nan immediate end to the repression of the Honduran \npeople. We echo the resolutions of the United Nations, \nthe OAS, the Rio Group, UNASUR, the European \nUnion, ALBA and the many other international \norganizations that have made decisive statements on \nthis subject. \n I would also like to mention the declaration made \nby the 61 heads of State and Government of South \nAmerica and Africa who met on Margarita Island, \nVenezuela, on 26 and 27 September, in which we \n  \n \n09-52604 28 \n \ncondemned the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Honduras. In that \ndocument, we also express our support for the Security \nCouncil meeting held on 25 September 2009, which \nhighlighted the issue of the security of the Brazilian \nembassy in Tegucigalpa, where President Jos\u00e9 Manuel \nZelaya has legitimately been taking refuge since \n21 September and which has been subject to an \nunjustifiable military and police barricade. \n We call on the international community to act \ntogether to adopt strong measures that guarantee the \nrestitution of democratic order in Honduras in order to \npromote an election process of some kind and \nrecognize the authorities that are elected as a result of \nsuch a process. \n Today, we are facing a systemic and \nmultidimensional crisis that jeopardizes not only the \nbalance of an economic system but also the very \nsurvival of human beings. The food crisis, the energy \ncrisis and the scandalous financial crisis are clear \nsymptoms of the fact that the system does not work and \nmust be re-invented. \n One of the most obvious facets of the overall \ncrisis is the economic and financial crisis. Although \nthis crisis originated in the main speculative markets of \nthe rich countries of the North, that is, the casino \neconomy, its effects have been multiplying and \nexpanding in developing countries.  \n Nevertheless, the current financial crisis is only a \nsymptom of a larger crisis \u2014 the crisis of a system that \nfavours the financial and speculative economy over the \nreal economy. It is also the result of an international \nfinancial architecture that is unequal, non-inclusive and \ninefficient and that must be reformed urgently. Ecuador \nproposes that the crisis does not require merely \ntechnocratic reform but a profound change of our \neconomic model. \n For that reason, my Government strongly \nsupported the decision of the General Assembly to \nhold, this past June, the high-level Conference on the \nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on \nDevelopment. At the Conference, Rafael Correa, \nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador, became the main \nvoice of the countries of the South advocating for a \ncomprehensive reform of the current world economic \norder, which jeopardizes the life and the well-being of \nmillions of people around the planet. President Correa \nalso proposed to democratize and redefine the \ninternational financial architecture. \n At that Conference, important steps were taken in \nrecognizing the fundamental role of the United Nations \nin the reform of the international financial system and \narchitecture. We welcome the fact that the Conference \nacknowledged regional and subregional agreements as \nintegral parts of multilateral responses to the current \ncrisis.  \n I have the honour of announcing one such \nresponse in this forum. This past Saturday, \n26 September, at the South American and African \nsummit that took place on Margarita Island, our \ncountries signed the constitutive act of the Bank of the \nSouth, which will start out with a declared capital of \n$20 billion and a subscribed capital of $7 billion. The \nBank will be a multilateral financial entity aimed at \nsupporting human development in South America. This \nagreement was reached at the summit of South \nAmerican and African countries. This important event \nwas part of the proposal put forward by my country on \nthe creation of a new international financial \narchitecture based on a series of regional responses. \n In addition to this achievement, we must mention \ninitiatives such as the creation of a common Latin \nAmerican reserve fund, the establishment of a regional \nsystem of payments as a prelude to the creation of a \nregional central bank and the consolidation of a common \nmonetary system that will create an electronic currency \nto facilitate our trade. The good news is that we have \nbegun to take fundamental steps in the establishment of \nthe Centralized Payment Compensation System, called \nSUCRE, which will soon enter into force within ALBA. \n We reiterate our reservations concerning the \nactions undertaken by international credit institutions \nsuch as the International Monetary Fund and the World \nBank, since they have collaborated actively to take \nstrong economic and political measures against certain \nnations. We also reject, on the basis of the principle of \nsovereignty, the relationship between the World Bank \nand arbitration centres such as the International Centre \nfor Settlement of Investment Disputes, which has only \nserved to pass judgment on and penalize certain parties \nand to benefit transnational interests over national \ninterests. \n For our countries, the restructuring and relief of \nour external debt is more urgent than ever. We cannot \ncontinue to give higher priority to paying off external \ndebt than to financing a recovery in production and \ndevelopment. \n \n \n29 09-52604 \n \n We have an enormous task ahead of us with \nrespect to the effects of the crisis. The General \nAssembly working group on the financial crisis will be \nthe ideal mechanism through which to follow up on the \nimplementation of the commitments and tasks that \narose out of the Conference last June. \n This crisis has shown that capitalism as a model \nfor economic and social relations is not viable. It has \nalso highlighted the imbalances in the relationships \nbetween society, nature and the economy. One of the \nmost obvious examples of this is the imbalances that \nare to be found in the way that the issue of climate \nchange is dealt with. \n This past week, a high-level Summit on Climate \nChange was held in this very Hall. I must frankly state \nthat it was a great disappointment. Empty rhetoric \nabounded, and no commitments were undertaken, with \nfew exceptions. As a result, our response to the issue \nhas been nothing more than inadequate and, at times, \nirresponsible. Even worse, we heard repeatedly last \nweek that the major challenge is how to maintain \neconomic growth without affecting the environment \u2014 \nthat is, how to preserve the current system, with a few \ncosmetic adjustments. We believe, however, that we \nneed to completely transform the means of production \nand consumption and not simply promote further \ngrowth without stopping to take stock of where we are. \n The principle of shared but differentiated \nresponsibilities, as contained in the Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, recognizes that rich \nnations and the elites who consume too much are the \nmajor causes of this scourge and that they must \ntherefore assume a large proportion of the costs of \nreducing emissions. Wealthy countries must make \nadditional efforts to decrease their greenhouse gas \nemissions, beyond the reductions already brought \nabout by the economic crisis.  \n Reducing emissions is urgent but not sufficient. \nAdaptation measures must be identified, in particular \nin vulnerable countries and countries that lack the \neconomic resources to deal with the impacts of climate \nchange. We are not speaking about donations or credit \nbeing offered for adaptation efforts. Reparations must \nbe made that recognize the ecological debt and take \ninto account the historic responsibility for the \nexcessive emissions of the past several decades, when \nthe greenhouse effect was already recognized. Serious \nstudies on the subject estimate that this would amount \nto at least $50 billion dollars a year over 20 or \n30 years. \n We demand that the countries of the North \ncomply with and strengthen the commitments they \nundertook in the context of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto \nProtocol regarding measures for adaptation and \nmitigation, the development and transfer of \ntechnologies and their financing. However, we \nrecognize that we have a shared responsibility to \nprovide responses to the climate crisis. For this reason, \nEcuador has offered significant proof of its \ncommitment to this issue. I would like to briefly \nmention four initiatives that my country has \nundertaken. \n The first initiative, and the one that provides the \nguidelines and foundation for Ecuador\u2019s international \nenvironmental policy, is the Yasuni Ishpingo-\nTambococha-Tiputini (Yasuni ITT) initiative, an \ninnovative project that was introduced by President \nRafael Correa at the 2007 United Nations Climate \nChange Conference and that breaks with traditional \ndiscredited approaches. Ecuador has decided to keep a \nconsiderable amount of its proven oil reserves \nunderground \u2014 about 850 million barrels of crude \u2014 \nin order to pursue three important goals. The first goal \nis to prevent the pollution that would result from the \nemission of 410 million tons of carbon dioxide into the \natmosphere. The second is to protect the indigenous \npeoples who live in the Yasuni National Park, the \nTaromenane and Tagaeri peoples. The third goal is to \npreserve biodiversity. In that connection, an \ninternational trust fund will be established in the \ncoming weeks as a financial mechanism to enable us to \nreceive international contributions and invest them in \nconservation and sustainable development initiatives \nfor the country, in line with the development goals laid \nout in our national development plan. \n The second initiative is the Forest Partners \nProgramme, which is an initiative that provides \neconomic incentives to indigenous peoples and rural \nfarmers to protect our forest. This will enable us to \nprotect 20 per cent of our total forest areas until the \nyear 2015. \n The third initiative is a programme to transform \nthe energy grid, aimed at ensuring that the main \nsources of energy used in the country are renewable \nand sustainable. One of the projects undertaken under \n  \n \n09-52604 30 \n \nthis programme is being carried out in the Galapagos \nIslands, a world heritage site for humankind, with the \ngoal of achieving 100 per cent clean energy sources on \nthe archipelago by 2015. \n Our fourth initiative would take place in the \ncontext of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries (OPEC) and proposes the introduction of an \neco-tax of approximately 3 per cent on oil prices, in \norder to bring about a decrease in demand and thereby \na reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. This proposal \nwas first put forward by Herman Daly, an \nenvironmental economist, and subsequently taken up \nand presented to OPEC by President Rafael Correa. \nThe revenue from the proposed eco-tax would \nfacilitate, under the administration of a body such as \nthe United Nations, projects to facilitate the conversion \nof the energy grid to using renewable energy. \n Ecuador believes that this time of crisis \nrepresents an opportunity to make radical changes that \nwill allow us to transform our societies from their \ncurrent model, which is based on competition and on \nirrational and unsustainable habits of consumption that \nprioritize merchandise over people, into societies based \non human beings living in harmony with themselves, \nwith their fellow human beings and with nature. \n For us, land, nature and the physical environment \nare essential components of the fundamental principle \nof our constitutional ordering of well-being, or \u201csumak \nkawsay\u201d. This principle of well-being implies living \nwith dignity according to our cultural values and in \nharmony with nature and is the basis for the \neconomical and social policies that my Government is \nembracing in order to overcome social inequalities. \n We would also like to highlight, once again, the \ngravity of the food crisis. In an era where the \ntechnology to produce sufficient food exists, there is \nhunger in the world. This is due to the fact that access \nto food is dominated by the large transnational \nagricultural companies that control the global market. \nIn addition, subsidies and other distortions on trade \nhave a serious impact on agriculture in countries of the \nSouth. \n We firmly support the convening of the World \nSummit on Food Security, which will take place in \nRome during the sixty-fourth session of the General \nAssembly and is aimed at reaching agreements on \nassigning priority to the right to food security and \nsovereignty over the pursuit of profit and the drive to \nmaximize gains. \n In order to achieve the targets defined by the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) as the \nminimum required for survival and well-being, those \nGoals must be complemented by decisive support from \nthe countries of the North aimed at increasing official \ndevelopment assistance and international cooperation \nwithout imposing any kind of conditions. \n Review of the progress made in achieving the \nMDGs will take place in the year 2010, as mandated by \nthe Assembly, and must serve to lay the foundation for \nefforts to correct the errors and omissions of these \nGoals. They include, in particular, the failure to \nconsider the structural causes of the problems, the lack \nof attention paid to human rights, the absence of any \ngoal dealing with the generation of valuable \nemployment, the exclusion of our ancestral peoples \nfrom the process of drawing up public policies and the \nabsence of a multicultural approach in defining the \nGoals.  \n At this session, the General Assembly will be \ntaking important strategic decisions regarding Ecuador. \nWe are sure that all Member States will strive to make \nthe Organization\u2019s efforts more effective in the \npromotion and defence of the rights of differently \nabled persons, the recognition and implementation of \nthe rights of indigenous peoples, gender equality, and \nefforts to combat human trafficking, among other \nimportant issues. \n I would like to refer in particular here to my \ncountry\u2019s commitment to combating the scourge of \nillegal human trafficking. We firmly support the need \nfor a global plan of action, and we offer to the \nOrganization our national experience in terms of legal \nand control issues. \n Another subject we consider essential for the \nagenda of this Assembly is that of international \nmigration. In the current Ecuadorian Constitution, one \nof our most transformative principles is based on the \nrecognition of universal citizenship. We do not impose \nany restrictions on the freedom of movement of people \naround the world. We believe we are all citizens of the \nworld. There is no such thing as illegal human beings. \nThere are, however, such things as illegal and immoral \npractices of exclusion and exploitation. In this twenty-\nfirst century, merchandise and capital are not bound by \nany borders, but walls are being built to restrict the \n \n \n31 09-52604 \n \nmovement of human beings. Ecuador will continue to \nwork towards a constructive multilateral dialogue on \nmigration and the adoption of a comprehensive \napproach on the issue of the human rights of migrants \nand their families, in accordance with the mandate set \nby the heads of State in the 2005 World Summit \nOutcome. \n As a country that prioritizes respect for and the \nguarantee of all human rights, Ecuador currently \nreceives more refugees than any other country in the \nWestern Hemisphere. Without belittling the support \nthat we receive from the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees, we must stress that we \nhave allocated significant economic resources to assist \npeople who are in need of international protection. We \nhave implemented pioneering measures and policies \nwith respect to the protection of refugees. We have one \nof the most advanced programmes in terms of refugee \nmanagement, namely, the Expanded Registration \nprogramme. \n Ecuador, as a founding member of the United \nNations, accords priority to dialogue and international \ncooperation in the resolution of conflicts and believes \nthat military action alone cannot bring about lasting \nand sustainable peace in any conflict zone in the world.  \n The commitment of Ecuador to the stabilization \nprocess in the brotherly Republic of Haiti is \ninternationally recognized. Because of this, since the \nbeginning of the Haitian crisis in February of 2004, we \nhave actively participated in the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti, in terms of a mostly \ncivil contingent. This endeavour was undertaken in \naccordance with our foreign policy of complete support \nfor and attention to humanitarian crises and the \npeaceful resolution of conflicts.  \n I cannot conclude this statement without \nmentioning Ecuador\u2019s satisfaction at having renounced, \na few days ago, any solution that is not in accordance \nwith international law. We hope to achieve very shortly \na normalization of diplomatic relations with the \nbrotherly Republic of Colombia, which will be of great \nbenefit for both of our peoples. This was made possible \nthanks to the opportunity for dialogue and meetings \noffered by the General Assembly each year. \n Finally, I extend once again the affectionate and \nhope-filled greetings of the Ecuadorian people, the \nrevolutionary citizenry of my country, and my \nPresident, Rafael Correa, to the rest of the world\u2019s \npeople and to their representatives here."

The trend towards \npeace, development and cooperation, which represents \nthe call of our times, has grown stronger than ever. As \nthe world moves further towards multipolarity and \neconomic globalization, multilateralism and democracy \nin international relations have won greater popular \nsupport, while openness and cooperation for mutual \nbenefit and win-win progress have become the shared \naspirations of the international community. Countries \nhave become more interdependent. \n At the same time, the world remains in the grip of \nthe financial crisis, and the prospects for economic \nrecovery are still not clear. Worldwide, unemployment \nand poverty are worsening, and development \nimbalances are more acute. Global issues such as \nclimate change, food security, energy and resource \nsecurity, and public health security have been thrown \ninto sharp relief. Non-traditional security threats, \nincluding terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, transnational organized crime and \nmajor communicable diseases, are threatening our \nworld. Some long-standing hotspot issues remain \nunresolved, while regional and local conflicts continue \nto flare up. The instability and uncertainties on the \ninternational landscape pose severe challenges to world \npeace and development. \n In the face of unprecedented opportunities and \nchallenges, we members of the international \ncommunity should commit ourselves to peace, \ndevelopment, cooperation, common progress and \ntolerance, and continue our joint endeavour to build a \nharmonious world of enduring peace and common \nprosperity and contribute to the noble cause of the \npeace and development of humankind. \n First, we should view security in a broader \nperspective and safeguard world peace and stability. \nThe security of all countries has never been as closely \ninterconnected as it is today. Security is not a zero-sum \ngame, and there is no isolated or absolute security. No \ncountry can be safe and stable in the absence of world \nand regional peace and stability. \n We should embrace a new security mindset of \nmutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and coordination. \nWhile maintaining our own national security, we \nshould also respect the security concerns of other \ncountries and advance the common security of \nhumankind. We should adhere to the purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and \nseek peaceful solutions to regional hotspot issues and \ninternational disputes. There should be no wilful use or \nthreat of force. We should support the United Nations \nin continuing to play an important role in the field of \ninternational security. We should oppose terrorism, \nseparatism and extremism in all their manifestations \nand broaden international security cooperation. \n China has consistently stood for the complete \nprohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear \nweapons and for a world without nuclear weapons. We \ncall on the international community to take credible \nsteps to push forward the nuclear disarmament process, \neradicate the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation and \npromote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and related \ninternational cooperation. \n Secondly, we should take a more holistic \napproach to development and promote common \nprosperity. Increasing economic globalization has \nlinked the development of all countries closely \ntogether. Without the development and equal \nparticipation of developing countries, there can be \nneither common prosperity in the world nor a more just \nand equitable international economic order. The \ndeveloping countries now face a deteriorating external \nenvironment brought about by the international \nfinancial crisis. Their economies are slowing down, \nand their development endeavours are beset by serious \ndifficulties. \n We believe that common development is an \nimportant way to redress global development \nimbalances and achieve sustainable development. The \nUnited Nations should increase its input in \n \n \n9 09-52228 \n \ndevelopment; advance economic globalization in the \ndirection of balanced development, shared benefits and \nwin-win progress; and foster an international \nenvironment conducive to the development of \ndeveloping countries. The international financial \ninstitutions should use their newly increased resources, \nfirst and foremost, to help developing countries move \nout of poverty and provide loans to them in a more \nflexible, diverse, convenient and efficient manner. \nGreat effort should be made to increase the \nrepresentation and voice of developing countries in the \nprocess of reforming the international financial system. \n We should take responsible measures to counter \nthe international financial crisis, firmly oppose \nprotectionism and actively work for an early, \ncomprehensive and balanced outcome of the Doha \nRound negotiations. Developed countries should open \ntheir markets to developing countries and reduce or \nexempt tariffs for those countries. They should honour \ntheir official development assistance and debt relief \ncommitments and, in particular, increase assistance to \nthe least developed countries, with a focus on tackling \nsuch issues as hunger, health care and education.  \n For developing countries, self-reliance is \nessential. They should explore development models \nconducive to their development and poverty \neradication efforts. It is also in their interest to increase \ntrade and investment cooperation, open markets to one \nanother and step up South-South cooperation. \n Thirdly, we should pursue cooperation with a \nmore open mind and work for mutual benefit and \ncommon progress. Climate change, food security, \nenergy and resource security, and public health security \nare all global challenges, and no country is immune to \nthem. The only way for us to meet those challenges and \nensure harmony and peace is to engage in closer \ninternational cooperation.  \n Climate change is one of the serious challenges to \nhuman survival and development, and international \ncooperation is the key to tackling that challenge. We \nshould retain the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol \nas the main channel in addressing climate change, \nabide by the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities, adhere to the mandate of the Bali Road \nMap, and work for the success of the Copenhagen \nconference with a view to achieving mutual benefit and \ncommon progress. \n Food and energy are vital to the livelihood, \ndevelopment and stability of all nations. We should \nincrease our input into agriculture, develop advanced \ntechnologies, curb market speculation, increase food \nassistance and intensify cooperation with regard to \nagriculture and food. We should strengthen mutually \nbeneficial cooperation in the area of energy, step up the \nresearch and development of new and renewable \nenergies, put in place a system for the research, \ndevelopment and dissemination of advanced energy \ntechnologies, and diversify the energy supply. \n The continued spread of influenza A \u2014 H1N1 \u2014 \nhas presented a global public health challenge \nconfronting the entire international community. China \nis ready to provide help, within its capacities, to other \ndeveloping countries in the prevention and control of \ninfluenza A. \n Fourthly, we should be more tolerant towards one \nanother and live together in harmony. Mutual learning \nand tolerance among different civilizations are an \ninexhaustible source of strength for social progress, \nand all countries \u2014 large or small, strong or weak, rich \nor poor \u2014 are equal. We should acknowledge \ndifferences in our cultural traditions, social systems \nand values, respect the right of all countries to \nindependently choose their own development paths, let \ndifferent civilizations and models of development draw \non one another\u2019s strengths through competition and \ncomparison, and achieve common development by \nseeking common ground while reserving the right to \ndiffer.  \n The Chinese people will soon celebrate the \nsixtieth anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Sixty years ago, the Chinese people \nwon independence and liberation after a prolonged, \nhard struggle and became masters of the new China. \nToday, China\u2019s national strength has grown remarkably \nand the people are better off. \n China\u2019s development has contributed greatly to \npeace and development in the world, and China\u2019s \nfuture is more closely interconnected with that of the \nworld. A more developed China will make greater \ncontributions and bring more opportunities to the \nworld. We are committed to the path of peaceful \ndevelopment and the win-win strategy of opening up. \nWe will develop friendly relations and cooperation \nwith all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of \nPeaceful Coexistence. China has always been and will \n  \n \n09-52228 10 \n \ncontinue to be a positive force for world peace and \ncommon development. \n As a responsible and major developing country, \nChina has always made common development an \nimportant aspect of its foreign policy. We have made a \ngreat effort to provide support and assistance to other \ndeveloping countries. To further assist them, China will \nadopt the following measures. \n First, we will increase support for other \ndeveloping countries hit hard by the financial crisis, \nhonestly implement relevant capital increase and \nfinancing plans, intensify trade and investment \ncooperation and help increase the capacity of relevant \ncountries for risk resistance and sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n Secondly, we will continue to implement the \nmeasures announced at the United Nations High-level \nEvent on the Millennium Development Goals to assist \nother developing countries in accelerating development \nand facilitating attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \n Thirdly, China will follow through on the \nmeasures to help African countries that were \nannounced at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on \nChina-Africa Cooperation, increase assistance to \nAfrica, reduce or cancel debts for African countries, \nexpand trade and investment, provide human resources \nand technological support for African countries in such \nareas as agriculture, health, education and disaster \npreparedness and reduction, and intensify personnel \ntraining tailored to African needs. \n Fourthly, China will continue to participate in and \npromote regional monetary and financial cooperation, \nmaintain financial and economic stability and promote \nfinancial cooperation and trade in the region. \n Let us join hands, share the development \nopportunities, rise above the challenges and make an \nunremitting effort towards building a harmonious \nworld of enduring peace and common prosperity."

        "file_text": "With your \npermission, Sir, I would like to speak in Bangla, my \nmother tongue.\n I would like to warmly congratulate the President \non his well-deserved election to preside over the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am \nconfident that his wise and able leadership will guide \nthe Assembly\u2019s deliberations to a successful \nconclusion. I would also like to express my deep \nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session, for his sound leadership in \nsuccessfully steering the Assembly\u2019s work during his \ntenure. I should also like to pay tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless and dedicated \nefforts to reinvigorate the United Nations. \n Thirty-five years ago, the father of our nation and \nmy father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in \nhis first address to the General Assembly from this \nrostrum, expressed his gratitude to all who supported \nour struggle for independence. He also declared his \ncommitment to democracy, good governance, human \nrights and the rule of law. It is also my proud privilege \nand great honour to extend the same commitment here \ntoday on behalf of our country. \n As members may know, for many years following \nthe brutal assassination of Bangabandhu and 18 other \nmembers of our family, on 15 August 1975, by \nmisguided armed mutineers, Bangladesh was ruled by \ndictators and quasi-dictators. Aside from a period in \nthe 1990s, the country continued to suffer from \nunconstitutional rule, particularly in the most recent \nyears. Even I was sent into forced exile. But the will of \nthe people of Bangladesh and the good will of the \ninternational community permitted my return home and \nthe holding of nation-wide elections on 29 December \n2008. \n Universally acclaimed as free, fair and credible, \nand carried out under the supervision of United \nNations and international observers, the elections \nheralded democracy in Bangladesh. The resounding \nvictory of my party, the Awami League, reflected the \npeople\u2019s preference for democratic ideals, secularism \nand an outright denial of all forms of extremism. The \nelections included record high participation by young \nvoters and women. \n The huge mandate given by the voters to my \nGovernment also entrusted it with an equally huge \nresponsibility for delivering on people\u2019s expectations. \nConsequently, my Government has embarked on \nachieving a digital Bangladesh by implementing its \nVision 2021 election manifesto. Our goal is to \ntransform Bangladesh into \u201cSonar Bangla\u201d or \u201cBengal \nof Gold\u201d, as envisioned by Bangabandhu Sheikh \nMujibur Rahman. \n Despite all odds, Bangladesh is making great \nstrides in its socio-economic development. Education, \nparticularly for girls, is a priority of our Government, \nreceiving the largest single share of our annual budget. \nOur Government has pledged to ensure 100 per cent \nstudent enrolment at the primary level by 2010. \nAccordingly, primary education has been made free \u2014 \n  \n \n09-52586 22 \n \nwith free books \u2014 and compulsory for all children. \nProvision has been made for free education for girls up \nto the twelfth grade, and stipends are provided for girls \nin rural secondary schools.  \n As for the Millennium Development Goals, \nBangladesh has been successful in removing gender \ndisparities in the net enrolment of boys and girls in \nprimary and secondary schools. Our Government is \nnow planning to provide free tuition for girls up \nthrough the secondary level.  \n Since children are our future, our Government \nruns a food-for-education/cash-for-education programme \nproviding food rations to poor primary school children \nin rural areas. Our aim is to achieve full literacy by \n2014. \n Health is another major sector where our \nGovernment is striving to make progress. During our \nlast period in power, we formulated a national health \npolicy whose main thrust was to ensure basic health \ncare for all without discrimination. A national strategy \nfor maternal health has also been adopted, which \nprovides quality services for safe motherhood. \nRegarding infant mortality, our plan is to reduce the \ninfant mortality rate from 54 per thousand live births to \n15 per thousand. Our plan is also to extend child \nimmunization programmes to reach 100 per cent of the \npopulation during our present term.  \n During our last period in power, we initiated \nprogrammes to establish one community health-care \ncentre for every 6,000 people, in order to bring primary \nhealth-care services to people\u2019s homes. Only 4,000 of \nthe first phase of 18,000 could be completed during the \nperiod we were in power prior to the changeover of \ngovernment, and the programme was terminated. We \nare now reactivating the programme. \n Bangladesh is often cited for its social safety \nprogrammes. A wide range of safety nets have been put \nin place, such as cash and food transfer programmes, \nmicro-credit and other special poverty alleviation \nprogrammes, and special programmes for minorities, \nthe marginalized, the disabled, the physically \nchallenged and the underprivileged. In our earlier \nperiod in power, I had introduced an old age pension, a \npension for distressed women, Shanti Nibash or old \npeople\u2019s homes, a Karmasangsthan Bank to provide \nearnings to unemployed youth through productive job \ncreation, and Ashrayan or homes on Government-\nowned land for homeless people, as well as sustainable \njobs.  \n An innovative programme instituted by my \ncurrent Government seeks to provide employment to at \nleast one member of each family. Currently, over a half \nof our budgetary resources are allocated to reducing \nthe poverty level from 45 per cent to 15 per cent by \n2021. \n Food security has always been our Government\u2019s \nprime concern. During our earlier term in power, my \nGovernment\u2019s agricultural programmes made \nBangladesh self-sufficient in food, for which the \nUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organization \npresented us with its prestigious Ceres Award. After the \nchange in government, Bangladesh returned to being in \nfood deficit. This time around, our Government has \nadopted a national food policy to ensure sustained food \nsecurity for all, enhance people\u2019s access to food, \nparticularly for children, women and the elderly, \nreduce food prices, increase food production by \nreducing the price of fuel, fertilizer and irrigation, and \nensure supply of farm inputs. \n On the international level, at the World Summit \non Food Security to be held in Rome in November \n2009, Bangladesh will be seeking a global agreement \nfor the development of agriculture and the attainment \nof food self-sufficiency in developing countries, \nparticularly the least developed countries (LDCs). \nSubstantial financial contributions from developed \ncountries, an agreement on sustainable agricultural \npolicies, the transfer of technology, equitable and fair \ntrade rules for food and agricultural products with \nspecial preferential treatment for LDCs, and the \nremoval of agricultural subsidies in the developed \nworld will also be sought, in order to address the \nchallenges we face in ensuring the food security \ncritical for advancing our development agenda. \n For some time now, climate change has been \nadversely impacting our low-lying, deltaic, monsoonal \ncountry. Although Bangladesh\u2019s own contribution to \nclimate change is negligible, it is one of its worst \nvictims. Erratic floods, cyclones, droughts and \nearthquakes have been disrupting our agriculture and \nchallenging our water resources, as well as our health, \nenergy and urban planning. In particular, cyclones \nbattering the coastal areas have taken countless lives, \nand sudden floods have uprooted families by the \nthousands and continue to do so every year. River bank \n \n \n23 09-52586 \n \nerosion, landslides, soil degradation and deforestation \nare causing millions of climate-change refugees. They \nalready greatly affect our densely populated cities. It is \nalarming that a metre\u2019s rise in the sea level would \ninundate 18 per cent of our land mass, directly \nimpacting 11 per cent of our people. Scientific \nestimates indicate that, of the 1 billion people expected \nto be displaced worldwide by 2050 as a result of \nclimate-change factors, one in every 45 people in the \nworld and one in every seven in Bangladesh, would be \na victim. \n Bangladesh has therefore decided to take some \nmeasures immediately. Dredging all major rivers is at \nthe top of the agenda for adaptation to climate change. \nCapital dredging projects will keep rivers in their \nnatural course, deepen them to hold more water, \nrestrict flooding, reduce flood damage, reclaim \ninundated arable land and keep them navigable. \nMaintenance dredging would then ensure the sustained \nregulated flow of the rivers. With the rise in sea level, \nthe excavated silt could build, raise and fortify \nembankments, increase green belts and help create \nelevated flat ground for the homes of the displaced, \nthereby discouraging them from moving to cities. \nMeanwhile, 14,000 cyclone shelters have been \nconstructed, and more are on the way.  \n Those activities would obviously entail huge \ncosts. A climate-change trust fund has been established \nwith our own resources, but in order to implement the \nprojects the assistance of the international community \nis imperative. \n Rapid and unplanned urbanization, occupational \ndislocation and lack of food, water and land security \nare some of the consequences of climate change. The \naffected communities would not only lose their homes. \nThey would also stand to lose their identity, nationality \nand their very existence and, in some cases, their \ncountries. In December this year, we will meet in \nCopenhagen for the fifteenth session of the Conference \nof the Parties and, therefore, it is critical that the \noutcome of the Conference reflect a commitment to \nassured, adequate and easily accessible funding for \nadaptation and to affordable, eco-friendly technology \ntransfer to developing countries, particularly to the \nLDCs, as well as specific commitments to deeper cuts \nin greenhouse emissions. Bangladesh would, of course, \nmake a strong call at the Conference to consider a new \nlegal regime to protect climate migrants under the \nKyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change that ensures the social, \ncultural and economic rehabilitation of migrants \ndisplaced through climate change. \n On the vital issue of climate change, the recent \nbold and courageous proposal of Prime Minister \nGordon Brown of the United Kingdom has caught the \nimagination of States at the forefront of dealing with \nclimate change. Among his proposals, the proposed \nfund to support the adaptation and mitigation \nprogrammes of countries affected by climate change \nhas, in particular, won our support. It could be the \nbeginning of a systematic flow of funds towards \nimproving the adversely changing environmental \nconditions around the globe. The Copenhagen \nConference should seriously consider his proposal. The \nConference must also be aware that climate-change \nmitigation does not restrict the steps taken to alleviate \nenergy poverty, and that the post-2012 agreement \nshould incorporate predictable and legally binding \ncommitments to address the adaptation needs of low-\nlying coastal States, small island countries and LDCs. \n The world is caught in an economic recession, the \nlikes of which has not been seen since the Great \nDepression of the 1930s. The economically vulnerable \ncountries, such as the LDCs, which are not responsible \nfor the crisis, have become its worst victims. \nBangladesh is faced with a sharp reduction in exports, \nfalling prices for primary commodities, declining \nremittances and a severe credit crunch, leading to the \ncontraction of our economic growth, rising \nunemployment and poverty.  \n The crisis is due to years of neglect of equity and \njustice, including a fundamentally unfair international \nfinancial structure that never changed with the needs of \nthe times. The need of the hour is the immediate \nrestructuring of the global financial and economic \nsystem. The Bretton Woods institutions, namely, the \nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund, must \naccommodate a stronger presence of developing \ncountries, especially the LDCs. Indeed, a voting weight \nproportionate to share capital has proved unsuited to \nthe Bretton Woods system. \n Surely, fiscal stimulus packages would help \nsupport global demand and aid recovery. However, \nliberal trade concessions by developed countries, such \nas duty- and quota-free market access and trade \ncapacity-building for developing countries, particularly \nLDCs, would rescue them from dire straits. The early \n  \n \n09-52586 24 \n \nconclusion of the Doha Development Round of the \nWorld Trade Organization trade negotiations would be \nan important collective stimulus package for our \neconomies. \n It is also the time for the countries of the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment to fulfil their official development \nassistance commitments to contribute 0.7 per cent of \ntheir gross national income to developing countries and \n0.2 per cent specifically to the least developed \ncountries by 2010, as reaffirmed in the Brussels \nProgramme of Action. \n The economic turmoil has adversely affected \nemployment at the national level and worldwide. The \nworst affected are the LDCs, both domestically and in \nterms of employment abroad. Remittances constitute a \nsignificant part of their gross domestic income. \nHowever, recent restrictions on new admissions of \nmigrant workers and, even worse, their repatriation to \ntheir home countries have resulted in socio-economic \ninstability in many countries. Therefore, recovery \nmeasures should be designed in such a manner so as \nnot to adversely affect employment opportunities of \nimmigrant workers from developing countries. \n Bangladesh is proud of its outstanding role as a \nmajor troop-contributing country serving the United \nNations in maintaining peace and security worldwide. \nSince 1988, Bangladesh has been involved in \n32 United Nations peacekeeping operations in \n24 different countries, contributing approximately \n83,000 personnel. Today, Bangladesh is ranked second \nwith 9,567 peacekeepers serving in various United \nNations missions. \n With pride I say that, throughout the years, 84 of \nour valiant peacekeepers have laid down their lives for \nthe cause of peace under the auspices of the United \nNations. Sadly, despite our contributions and \nsacrifices, Bangladesh does not have proportionate \nrepresentation in the Department of Peacekeeping \nOperations, nor does it have a say in the planning and \nstrategy design of peacekeeping missions. Indeed, this \nsituation calls for rectification on the basis of \nproportional representation in all fairness.  \n As a peaceful nation involved in United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts, Bangladesh is naturally opposed \nto terrorism. Bangladesh is a party to all terrorism-\nrelated United Nations Conventions, which is a \ntestament to our commitment to fighting that scourge. \nWe categorically reject the claims of those who cloak \nthemselves in the rhetoric of Islam or any other faith to \njustify violence. Nationwide, we have taken stern \nmeasures against militant groups and their leaders. We \nare firmly opposed to violence and terrorism; instead, \nwe promote peace across the world. Bangladesh, in \nsessions of the General Assembly, has spearheaded the \nflagship resolution on the culture of peace. At last \nyear\u2019s session of the General Assembly, the resolution \nwas sponsored by 124 nations.  \n The International Mother Language Day was \nadopted by UNESCO, at the initiative of Bangladesh, \nin recognition of 21 February 1952, when language \nmartyrs died for their mother tongue Bangla. Now \nevery year on that day UNESCO celebrates all \nlanguages of the world. The Bangla language is spoken \nby over 250 million people worldwide, primarily in \nBangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. The \nBangladesh Parliament therefore recently adopted a \nresolution requesting the United Nations to declare \nBangla as one of its official languages. Given the rich \nheritage of the Bangla language and its singular place \nas a symbol of people\u2019s faith in the power of languages \nto sustain cultures and indeed the identity of nations, I \nseek the support of the membership of the United \nNations General Assembly for its acceptance as an \nofficial language of the United Nations. \n At present we are witnessing a rapidly changing \nworld as a result of climate change, economic turmoil \nand terrorism. It is crystal clear to those who wish to \nopen their eyes that we all belong to a global village \nwhere we must live and work together. I therefore call \nupon all States to discard short-sighted discords and \nadopt a common resolve in facing today\u2019s grim \nchallenges. Let us share each other\u2019s responsibilities, \nburdens and prosperity. After all, at stake is our \ncommon and shared future. In reaching out to one \nanother, we will leave a harmonious world for our \nchildren and future generations thereafter. \n May Bangladesh live forever! Long live the \nUnited Nations! \n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the statement she \nhas just made."

        "file_text": "May I begin by congratulating Mr. Treki on \nhis unanimous election to preside over the work of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. His \nelection to that position is an honour to the entire \nAfrican continent and a worthy tribute to the Great \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, whose \ndevotion to the African cause goes without saying. \n Furthermore and on behalf of His Excellency \nGeneral Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, President of the Republic, \nwho wishes him every success in his work, I assure \nhim of the support of the Central African delegation in \nachieving the full success of his lofty task this year. \nHis demonstrated knowledge of the United Nations and \nof world problems will ensure the success of the \npresent session. I also wish to congratulate Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua on his excellent \ncontribution to the previous session in his capacity as \nPresident. \n However, before delivering my assessment the \nstate of the world in the face of the new challenges of \nthe twenty-first century and my country\u2019s perspective \non the main issues to be addressed at this session, I \nshould also like to commend the tireless work of the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who spares no \neffort in promoting the principles and purposes of the \nUnited Nations. To him, I once again express the deep \ngratitude of the people of the Central African Republic \nfor his notable contributions with regard to the \nsituation in the Central African Republic and his \nsupport within the framework of the Peacebuilding \nCommission.  \n In fact, in March this year, pursuant to my \nGovernment\u2019s request, a country configuration of the \n \n \n37 09-52470 \n \nPeacebuilding Commission was established under the \nBelgian presidency. The Commission is working \ntogether with Central African authorities to strengthen \nthe achievements of peace and make it possible to \nimplement the recommendations resulting from the \ninclusive political dialogue held from 8 to \n20 December 2008, regarding in particular the \ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration \nprogramme, security sector reform and the process \nleading up to the 2010 general elections. \n My country welcomes this session because of the \nitems on our agenda, which are true matters of global \nconcern. Indeed, it should be recalled that we have \nseveral challenges to meet: development, peace and \nsecurity, climate change and its effects, terrorism and \nnecessary United Nations reform. The choice of theme \nfor this debate \u2014 \u201cEffective responses to global crises, \nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \ncivilizations for international peace, security and \ndevelopment\u201d \u2014 is inspired. In fact, the changes in the \nworld\u2019s configuration have given rise to new \nchallenges that can be addressed only through \ninternational cooperation. Thus, multilateralism now \nappears to be the only way to resolve the world\u2019s \nproblems. \n In this era of globalization and technological \nadvances, forums for cooperation \u2014 even the most \nfirmly established ones \u2014 must address new demands \ncalling for appropriate and united responses.  \n I am grateful for the honour shown to the Central \nAfrican Republic, and I should like to stress the \ncorrelation among some of the issues raised since the \nbeginning of this general debate. With regard to the \nworld situation, this session is being held in a \nparticularly worrisome context. This is a critical time \nfor addressing global political issues at all levels \u2014 a \ntime that requires us, as nations, to seek solutions in a \nspirit of dialogue, cooperation and openness. The \ncurrent world scene poses major challenges in the areas \nof peace and security, economic development and \nsocial progress, and human rights and the rule of law. \n As far as crucial development issues are \nconcerned, the world economic and financial crisis \nremains an unprecedented event in terms of its impact \nand the upheavals in the world\u2019s economic and \nfinancial systems. It requires a reorganization leading \nto a new world order in this area. Besides that option, \nhowever, other ways to emerge from the present crisis \ncould be to develop production capacity, to strengthen \ntrade capacity for the benefit of developing countries \nand to implement strategic partnerships among the \nvarious regions to which the Organization\u2019s Members \nbelong.  \n The food crisis, which was caused by rising \nprices and whose harmful effects continue to keep a \nlarge part of the world in conditions of famine and \nabject poverty, requires that we promote the \nagricultural sector, industry and the utilization of \nmining resources. The rise in food prices has caused a \nsignificant deterioration in the terms of trade among \ncountries in the most affected regions, including the \nAfrican continent generally and, in particular, the \nCentral African Republic. That situation could lead to \ngreater inflationary pressure and a deteriorating \nbalance of payments. The impact is being felt both at \nthe macroeconomic level and in terms of household \nincome and food security.  \n The contributions of regional economic \ncommunities and United Nations agencies such as the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations, the World Food Programme, the International \nFund for Agricultural Development and the World \nBank, will be invaluable in the quest for a coordinated \nsolution to this crisis. Agricultural development should \nbe encouraged with a view to ensuring sustainable \ngrowth and improvements in people\u2019s means of \nsubsistence, based on the sound management of \nenvironmental and natural resources.  \n Programmes and activities to promote long-term \ngrowth should, of course, be carried out in accordance \nwith the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In \n2000, when we committed ourselves to achieving the \nGoals by 2015, we aroused legitimate hopes \nthroughout the developing world. We do not have the \nright to dash those hopes, which would worsen the \nNorth-South fracture and further deepen the divisions \nwithin our own societies, with incalculable risks for the \ngovernance and stability of States.  \n A little more than nine years after the Millennium \nSummit, it is indisputable that significant progress has \nbeen made, but we must acknowledge that, in many \ncountries in Africa and elsewhere, a large majority of \nthe population lives in abject poverty. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals are the surest way to speed the \nprogress of African peoples towards well-being. The \ndevelopment projects in the MDG sectors need stable, \n  \n \n09-52470 38 \n \nsufficient and predictable long-term funding. We thus \nregard this session of the General Assembly as an \nopportunity to raise the awareness of all international \ndevelopment financing institutions, without exception, \nand lead them to effectively pledge to mobilize and \ntransfer the financial resources necessary to achieve \nthe Millennium Development Goals.  \n Likewise, the Programme of Action for the Least \nDeveloped Countries for the Decade 2001-2010, aimed \nat significantly improving the living conditions of the \nmore than 600 million people living in those countries, \nis concluding and thus should be reviewed in order to \naddress the marginalization and the new \nsocio-economic challenges facing least developed \ncountries.  \n Climate change joins the challenges confronting \nour world, because the economy, the environment and \nthe way of life of every nation represented here are \nthreatened.  \n At the United Nations Climate Change \nConference held in Bali, Indonesia, in 2007, world \nleaders decided to negotiate a new agreement on \nclimate change to succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. \nIn the Bali Road Map, States defined spheres of action \nand agreed to take them into account during the post-\nKyoto negotiations. The working meeting of the heads \nof State of the G8+5 in L\u2019Aquila on 9 July 2009 \nexamined the issue of reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions. \n My country is committed to the global fight \nagainst climate change, as demonstrated by its \nratification of several international instruments on \nclimate issues. I am referring to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \nKyoto Protocol. \n For the Central African Republic, the challenge \nof climate change relates to not only mitigation, \nnamely reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but \nalso to adaptation to the harmful effects of that change. \nHowever, for vulnerable States, with a weak economy \nlike ours, the cost of adaptation, calculated at several \ntens of billions of dollars a year, puts a still greater \nstrain on our limited resources and increases poverty. \nThis is an opportunity for me to express the wish that \nassistance in combating climate change not replace \nofficial development assistance. \n We have not come to this sixty-fourth session of \nthe General Assembly to point an accusing finger at the \nStates responsible for global warming, but rather, like \nthe brother countries of Africa, to convey a message to \nthe leaders of the world. Africa will continue its efforts \nto preserve its forest ecosystems, but the rich countries \nmust assume their responsibilities to reach concrete \nproposals for post-Kyoto. \n We support France\u2019s proposal at the summit on \nclimate change, held on 22 September 2009, for the \nestablishment of a world environment organization, the \nimplementation of the Bali Road Map through \ntechnology transfers to developing countries, and the \nfinancing of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. However, we strongly hope that, in \nCopenhagen next December, the common position of \nthe countries of Central Africa, which share the forests \nof the Congo basin, will be taken into account. \n Allow me here to recall that the countries of \nCentral Africa, members of the Commission for the \nForests of Central Africa (COMIFAC), signed a \ndeclaration in Bangui on 11 September 2008 in which \nthey call on the institutions of the United Nations \nsystem, the European Union, the International \nOrganization of la Francophonie, the Secretariat of the \nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development and the \nhigh-level panel of experts to support them in their \neffort, inter alia, to include issues relating to the \nmanagement of tropical forests in the post-Kyoto \narrangements.  \n The forests of the Congo basin, the second largest \nforest system in the world, play a key role in regulating \nthe global climate. The efforts to conserve and \nsustainably manage the forests of that natural space \nagreed to by the member countries of COMIFAC \nshould be encouraged as part of the process of reducing \nemissions from deforestation and forest degradation in \ndeveloping countries. In Copenhagen, we must reach a \nfair agreement, based on win-win partnerships that \nenable developing countries to reconcile the \npreservation of natural resources with economic \ndevelopment. \n The Central African Republic fully supports the \nstatement made by the Chairperson of the African \nUnion Commission at its recent special session on the \nconsideration and resolution of conflicts in Africa, held \nin Tripoli, Libya, on 31 August 2009. It shares the \nconviction that economic growth and sustainable \n \n \n39 09-52470 \n \ndevelopment are intertwined with the status of and \ntrends in world peace and security.  \n In view of the proliferation of arms of all kinds, \ndisarmament is a pressing issue. The United Nations \nDisarmament Commission must promote resolutions \nthat encourage multilateralism in the area of \ndisarmament and non-proliferation, the reduction of \nmilitary budgets and respect for environmental \nstandards in the drawing up and implementation of \ndisarmament agreements. An effort is also needed to \novercome the current impasse and to achieve nuclear \ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation in all their \nforms. The strategic doctrine adopted by nuclear-\nweapon States that justifies the use of or threat of the \nuse of atomic weapons is as dangerous as uranium \nenrichment for weapons purposes and should simply be \ndiscarded.  \n On the other hand, a national security concept \nbased on the promotion and development of military \nalliances and nuclear deterrence policies seems better \nsuited to the ideals that we pursue. The Central African \nRepublic welcomes the initiative of United States \nPresident Obama in convening a meeting of the \nSecurity Council on nuclear non-proliferation and \nnuclear disarmament. \n Terrorism is the most flagrant violation of \ninternational law. It prevents people from enjoying \ntheir basic freedoms and destabilizes legitimately \nestablished Governments. For those reasons, it must \nnot be tolerated by or associated with any religion, \ncivilization, ethnic group or claim, however legitimate \nit may seem. My country resolutely condemns terrorist \nacts and aligns itself with the fight against terrorism \nbeing carried out by the committees established by the \nUnited Nations Security Council. \n The issue of the control of conventional weapons \nat the regional level is all the more relevant in view of \nthe fact that it is the most effective way to tackle the \nillegal proliferation of armed groups and transnational \ncrime. The peace and security of Central Africa are \nhampered by that recurrent problem. Armed groups \nthreaten the stability of the national institutions of \nsome of our States. Along those lines, the \ncomprehensive peace agreement signed at Libreville in \nneighbouring Gabon on 21 June 2008 enabled the \nCentral African Republic to thwart an ill-intentioned \nplot to seize power. \n However, its concern, like that of other States of \nAfrica\u2019s Great Lakes region, such as the Sudan, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, is with \nthe criminal activities of the uprising of the so-called \nLord\u2019s Resistance Army, which has become a \ntransnational criminal organization, causing death and \ndestruction as far as the Central African Republic. Its \ndestructive capacity goes beyond the territory of the \nRepublic of Uganda and is becoming a regional \nproblem, for which an agreed solution is essential. The \naffected States are striving to achieve that with the \nlimited resources that they have. \n I am convinced that the Charter of the United \nNations and international law continue to be essential \ninstruments and the pillars of the preservation and \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \nRepresenting nearly the entire international \ncommunity, the United Nations has well-established \ninternational legitimacy and is the best forum for \nfinding a lasting solution to problems of that kind.  \n The United Nations remains the primary and \nfundamental forum for addressing world issues and \nseeking consensus. That is why we Member States \nattach great importance to strengthening its role and \nbelieve that reform is necessary in order to develop its \nfull potential. The reform must be comprehensive and \ncover all areas, while respecting its political nature and \nits intergovernmental and universal character. \n However, adjustments to two organs of our \nOrganization seem to be a priority in that reform: the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. The \nGeneral Assembly must be invigorated by giving \ngreater weight to its role and to its authority as the \nmain deliberative and representative organ of the \nMember States. The General Assembly\u2019s prerogatives \nas the chief oversight body of the United Nations, even \nin the area of peacekeeping, must be respected. \n As for reform of the Security Council, it must be \ndirected at achieving transparency and balance within \nthat body. Its enlargement will enable better \nrepresentation of all regions in order to allow us to \ndebate new approaches to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. This is an African \nposition that has been advocated during this general \ndebate by the Leader of the Great Socialist People\u2019s \nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya (see ), and it is one \nthat the Central African Republic supports. My country \nhopes that reform of the United Nations system will \n  \n \n09-52470 40 \n \nhave a positive impact on the development of \nmultilateral cooperation in our ever-changing world. "

        "file_text": "I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate Mr. Treki on his presidency \nand to assure him of Malaysia\u2019s full support. \n There is a difference in the General Assembly this \nyear. In light of some of the greatest challenges ever \nfaced by any generation, we have resolved to work \nmore closely together, to strengthen the ties that bind \nus as members of a human family, to fulfil our \nresponsibilities and to overcome distrust and discord. \nMalaysia will continue to do its part in this cooperative \nendeavour. We do so knowing that we are a country in \nthe middle, not too large nor too small, not too rich nor \ntoo poor, not too strong nor too weak. We do our part \nknowing that our actions have consequences for \nourselves and our children. We do so in the belief that \nhope will triumph over adversity. \n I believe that the developing world is not shirking \nits responsibilities to address the entire spectrum of \nchallenges facing us. But our efforts will be far more \neffective if done in tandem with the developed world. \nSo allow me to say this on behalf of the developing \nworld \u2014 give us fair terms and we will seal the deal. \nGive us the tools and we will help to finish the job. \nInvest in our common future, and all our children and \nhumanity henceforth will reap the rewards. \n A few days ago we deliberated on the issue of \nclimate change, among the most pressing and urgent \nissues facing us today. Therefore, I hope that we are \nnow more firm in our resolve to act immediately. In \nMalaysia\u2019s case, we are, in the context of mitigation \naction, protecting and preserving our rainforests \nthrough sustainable forest management measures. We \nare increasing the use of public transportation as part \nof the relevant Ministry\u2019s key performance indicator. \nWe are also increasing the usage of renewable energy \nsources and promoting greater energy efficiency. The \nMinistry of Energy, Water and Communications has \nbeen transformed into the Ministry of Energy, Green \nTechnology and Water. \n However, it is the developed world that must play \nthe leading role in the global effort to combat climate \nchange. Sadly, such leadership has been lacking. \nDeveloped countries\u2019 pledges to cut greenhouse gas \nemissions fall short of what is required to tackle \nincreasing global temperatures. \n We have to seal the deal in Copenhagen. \nHowever, that cannot be achieved if the developed \nworld continues to attempt to reinterpret and \nrenegotiate key principles of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \nKyoto Protocol. Let me be absolutely clear about this: \nthere will not be a deal in Copenhagen if some are keen \nto \u201csteal the deal\u201d. \n I need to state what I believe to be a very \nimportant fact. Tackling climate change entails making \ndifficult choices, given the competing interests of so \nmany constituents and needs in developing countries. \nMore important, there is a need to balance \ndevelopment, food security and poverty eradication, on \nthe one hand, and environmental considerations, on the \nother. Let us not make the glib statement that one \nperfectly complements the other. \n For example, agricultural production, the bedrock \nof efforts to address the food crisis, produces 14 per \ncent of greenhouse gas emissions. Let us not forget that \nthe world food system is still in crisis. Although the \nprices of major food grains have declined since last \nyear, they are still above average. Hunger afflicts more \nthan 1 billion people. Addressing the food crisis \nrequires more than increasing food production; it \ndemands nothing less than a transformation of market \nsystems so that they work better for the poorest and \nhungriest. It is for those reasons that we believe that \nclimate change must not be treated as a stand-alone \nsubject; it must be seen as part of the broader \nsustainable development challenge. \n The United Nations has been in existence for \nmore than 60 years, yet peace and security continue to \nelude us in many parts of the world. Malaysia has \nplayed and will continue to play its role in achieving \nglobal peace and security. We have committed our \ntroops to United Nations peacekeeping operations since \n1960. \n  \n \n09-52604 38 \n \n Closer to home, Malaysia has been playing a role \nin fostering peace within the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations region. We are actively involved in \npeace efforts in the southern Philippines. We will \ncontinue to work towards greater progress in the \ndemocratization process in Myanmar. \n Often, grave injustices are the cause of breaches \nof peace and threats to security. In that connection, we \nmust accept the fact that the Palestinian issue \nepitomizes everything that is unjust and unfair in \ninternational relations. It has taken on a symbolic value \nthat colours cultural and political relations well beyond \nits geographical scope. This issue has bedevilled the \ninternational community for too long. We must do all \nthat we can to address the Palestinian issue, as \nresolving it will have a major impact in our efforts to \nachieve peace and security in the Middle East and \nbeyond. \n For far too long, the unstinting support given to \nIsrael has resulted in an impasse. In the interest of \nglobal peace, Israel, Palestine and the affected \ncountries in the region must work together to resolve \nthe conflict. We look forward to the United States \nundertaking the role of an honest broker. We hold much \nhope for a more even-handed approach by the United \nStates on the Middle East. We expect to be able to be \npart of a just and comprehensive solution and that the \naction of the United States will match its rhetoric. After \nall, history is littered with examples of the fury and \nvehemence that result when hope turns into despair. \n Non-proliferation and disarmament are \ncornerstones of peace and security. We agree that at the \nheart of such efforts is a basic bargain comprising these \nelements: first, all nations have the right to peacefully \nuse nuclear power; second, nations that have nuclear \nweapons must move towards disarmament; and third, \nthose without nuclear weapons must renounce their \nacquisition.  \n In that regard, Malaysia draws hope from any \naction by major Powers such as the agreement between \nthe United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear \nstockpiles. We also look forward to other measures to \nstrengthen that bargain, including the strengthening of \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT) and other international instruments \nrelated to disarmament and non-proliferation. By the \nsame token, we view with grave concern any attempt \naimed at the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other \nweapons of mass destruction. \n For our part, since 1996, we have introduced the \ndraft resolution on follow-up to the advisory opinion of \nthe International Court of Justice on the legality of the \nthreat or use of nuclear weapons, and we will continue \nto do so at this session of the General Assembly. The \nresolution, inter alia, calls on all States to fulfil their \nobligation by commencing multilateral negotiations \nleading to an early conclusion of a nuclear weapons \nconvention. Malaysia\u2019s efforts in that regard will not \ncease here. We will also participate actively in the 2010 \nReview Conference of the Parties to the NPT and play \nour rightful role as President of the Board of Governors \nof the International Atomic Energy Agency. \n For many, efforts to achieve peace and security \nbegin at a more commonplace level. Given Malaysia\u2019s \nmulti-ethnic and multi-religious society, we are \nespecially conscious of the need to continuously \npromote interaction among peoples of different \nreligions, races and beliefs. For that reason, the \nMalaysian Government has introduced the \u201cone \nMalaysia\u201d concept, which builds on previous efforts to \npromote national unity yet takes present realities into \naccount. It aims to foster appreciation and respect for \nall races, seeing diversity as a source of strength. It \nenvisages unity that arises from true acceptance instead \nof mere tolerance, based on the legal principles set out \nin the Constitution, and has social justice for all at its \nheart.  \n If our collective efforts to create a better world \nare to succeed, the global governance structure must be \nimproved. Decisions are still made by the few for the \nmany. The prime example of that is the Security \nCouncil. We continue to believe that reform of the \nCouncil, including the eventual abolition of the veto, is \ncritical if the aspiration to the equality of States is to be \nfulfilled.  \n The same situation is reflected in the economic \nsphere. Perhaps the most important result of the \nrecently concluded summit of the Group of 20 (G-20) \nis the Group\u2019s designation as the premier forum for \ninternational economic cooperation. That point was \nmade twice in the Leaders\u2019 Statement. Further, G-20 \nrepresentatives are to report back to their countries \nwith recommendations on how to maximize the \neffectiveness of their cooperation. \n \n \n39 09-52604 \n \n It may be said that the G-20 is far more \nrepresentative than the Group of Eight, given the \nparticipation of the leading emerging economies. \nHowever, questions remain as to how representative \nand inclusive it truly is. Therefore, the challenge of the \nG-20 process is how best to make it more legitimate \nand more effective. \n I would like to make the following points and \nproposals in this regard. First, many of the main thrusts \nof the G-20\u2019s work, such as reform of the Bretton \nWoods institutions and strengthening the international \nfinancial regulatory system, were first articulated by \nMalaysia in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. \nSecondly, while claiming no particular credit for \nMalaysia, that means that ideas and solutions are not \nthe monopoly of the large and powerful. Thirdly, the \nchoice between legitimacy and effectiveness is often a \nfalse one. Fourthly, in addressing ways of maximizing \ncooperation among themselves, the G-20 must \nsimultaneously address ways of improving links with \nthe broader international community. Finally, there \nneeds to be greater clarity on the involvement of \nregional organizations. \n On the issue of global governance, as in many \nothers, Malaysia stands ready, willing and able to make \na meaningful contribution. We aspire to equality for all \nStates, large and small. We dream a dream of a true \nParliament of Man, a Federation of the World. \n But we are not content to be idle dreamers. We \nintend to make full use our presidency of the Economic \nand Social Council next year to address these issues. \nWe will do so in a cooperative and action-oriented \nmanner. History has shown that a state of virtue or vice is \noften the result of human endeavour and activity. Vices \nthat have existed since time immemorial have been \neradicated by dint of human action. Slavery is one such \nexample, apartheid another. Inspired by the hope that \nthese examples provide, I believe that we can yet \novercome the grave challenges that we face. However, \nthere must be a willingness to collectively bear our \ncommon burdens. \n I would therefore like to end where I began, with \nan expression of hope that in the light of some of the \ngreatest challenges ever faced by any generation of \nMan, we will finally be able to work more closely. This \nhope is that we may strengthen the ties that bind us as \nmembers of a human family, fulfil our responsibilities \nand overcome distrust and discord."

        "file_text": "I would \nlike to congratulate the President on his election, as \nwell as to express my appreciation to the outgoing \nPresident for his contributions over the past year. I \nwould also like to thank the Secretary-General, his \nstaff and the agencies of the United Nations for doing \nsuch a fine job all over the world in very difficult \nsituations. It is very much appreciated. \n I like the theme for this year\u2019s debate, but it is a \nvery long one. So I would like to say a few things \nabout the first two words, namely, effective responses. \nI think that they are the most important ones. There is \nno problem with the second word. We all know what \nresponses are, because we make them every day. But \n\u201ceffective\u201d is a far more difficult word, and that is \nbecause none of us here actually decides what it means. \nIt is not up to us to judge whether our work is \nsuccessful or not. That is up to the next generation. In \nother words, it is our children and grandchildren who \nare going to look back at the past and see whether we \ndid a good job. That is the way it has always been. \n That is what many of us in Brunei Darussalam \nhave been doing recently, because this year is an \nimportant anniversary for us. It is now 25 years since \nwe joined the Organization. Those of us who were here \nat that time remember it very well. We remember \nexactly why we joined. It was a dangerous period, and \na small country like ours did not want to be left on its \nown. We wanted to be part of a larger community, a \nworld community. But there was a real problem. The \ncold war was on and nearly everyone was divided into \ntwo camps. That meant that we had to choose sides. \nThat did not help us very much at all.\n Looking at the United Nations today, I would \njudge its response to the past 25 years as very \neffective. Things are much better than they were back \nthen. Certainly, many of the old problems may still be \nwith us, such as terrorism, poverty, disease, war and \nthe 60-year struggle by the Palestinian people for \njustice, hope and dignity. But we also have a lot of \ngood things going for us nowadays. We have much \nmore knowledge. Communication is better than ever \nbefore. The best thing of all is that we are not divided \ninto two camps. As a result, we have far more \nopportunities. \n When our next generation looks back at us and \njudges us, I think that the question they will be asking \nwill be: What did we do with those opportunities? In \nother words, were our responses effective ones? \nGetting back to where we are now, I think we have \nopportunities to make a great response. \n The Secretary-General and his staff have \nimportant proposals for reform, change and \ndevelopment. If we accept them and do something \nabout them, we can take the biggest opportunity of all: \nwe can change the whole direction of world affairs. \nWhat is more, I think that this is exactly what people \nwant us to do. \n There is a lot of support for change outside this \nbuilding. No one really wants to carry on being split up \ninto developed or developing nations any more, or as \nfirst, second or third worlds. They want us to be in one \nworld, in one situation, sharing its problems and being \npart of any solution. \n That is the message many of us got after the first \nGroup of 20 (G-20) meeting, back in April of this year. \nIt seemed to give us a real choice \u2014 either to keep on \ndoing things the way we have always done since 1946 \nor to change directions and all work together, big and \nsmall, regardless of background, culture or faith, and \nfind a new way into the twenty-first century. \n This week\u2019s G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh sent out \nthe same message, and it was good to hear. It is only a \nsoft message and a small change. The big decisions are \nstill being made for us, and not with us. But at least it \nis a start. It is the kind of change we want to see, and \n  \n \n09-52592 44 \n \nthere is nothing to stop us from taking it a long way \nfurther. After all, it is not like 25 years ago. We have a \nreal choice and no one is forcing us to take sides. So \nfor the moment it is up to us. The key words, however, \nare \u201cfor the moment\u201d. \n The G-20 are not the only ones sending us \nmessages. There are other very important ones. They \nare coming from the environment, the climate, the \nglobal economy and energy and food supplies, and they \nall add up to a serious warning. They are telling us that \nvery soon the choice will not be ours to make. Any \nchanges will be made by forces that we cannot control. \nThat means any response may be largely ineffective. \nWhen the next generation looks back at us, they may \nnot just be judging us. They could even be condemning \nus."

We are confident that, under his leadership, we \nwill harvest the opportunities the global agenda has to \noffer. \n My delegation further takes this opportunity to \ncommend his predecessor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann. He indeed provided exemplary leadership \nand inspired us to realize our unique collective \nstrength. Throughout his tenure in office, he kept the \nmost vulnerable people at the front, centre and back of \nall of our engagements. We wish him God\u2019s blessing in \nhis future endeavours. \n The global financial and economic crisis has \npresented immense challenges to the international \ncommunity. Simply put, the effects of the crisis are \nimpacting all members of the United Nations family. \nConsequently, Solomon Islands\u2019 economy has been hit \nby low commodity prices, declining revenues and \nwidening budgetary deficits. My country has responded \nby freezing all Government recruitment and reducing \nnational recurrent and development expenditures by \n35 per cent. Between 2008 and 2009, our economic \ngrowth has taken a negative dive from 6 per cent to \n1 per cent, which is affecting the delivery of services to \nour people. \n The world has taken measures to address the \nsystematic fragilities of the international financial \nsystem. To this end, Solomon Islands welcomes the \noutcome of the June 2009 Conference on the financial \ncrisis, calling for greater cooperation by all, including \nthe reform of the Bretton Woods institutions. We \nremain hopeful that the stimulus packages dished out \nreach the poorest of the poor, as many will be under \nstress for a long time to come. \n Frequent natural disasters are threatening \ndevelopment across the world and climate change \ncontinues to affect the lives of our people, creating new \npockets of poverty while continuing to increase as \nthreats. Unless an ambitious outcome emanates from \nCopenhagen, we will find that we are fighting a losing \nbattle. I join the call for urgent action, particularly for \nsmall island developing States and least developed \ncountries. For us, climate change poses the most \nserious threat to our survival and viability, and \nundermines our efforts to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment. \n Solomon Islands fully subscribes to the \ndeclaration issued this week by the Alliance of Small \nIslands Developing States. The benchmark for the \nnegotiations must be founded on the vulnerability of \nthe small island developing States and the least \ndeveloped countries. Science tells us that the future of \nlow-lying islands is uncertain unless deep and \nambitious cuts to harmful greenhouse gas emissions \nare undertaken by Annex 1 countries at levels greater \nthan 45 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 and more than \n95 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050. We call for the \nglobal average temperature to increase well below \n1.5 degrees Celsius if we are to prevent the \nacidification of our oceans from threatening our very \nexistence. \n Deforestation and forest degradation contribute \nnearly 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. \nSolomon Islands agrees that this should be one of the \nmitigating solutions for protecting the health of our \nenvironment. We further urge that this be considered as \nan outcome in Copenhagen. My country is currently \ncarrying out an inventory of its forests and intends to \nparticipate in the carbon market. We also hope that \nmultilateral financial mechanisms will become \navailable to the most vulnerable States in ensuring that \nappropriate technology transfer for renewable energy \nreceives the attention it deserves. \n Solomon Islands is a peace-loving country and \nbelieves that we need to seriously seek a stable \ninternational system. This can be achieved by calling \nfor global restraint on all military spending and making \na firm commitment to begin holistic multilateral \ndisarmament negotiations. This is an issue that has \nbeen stalled for years on end and continues to be \n  \n \n09-52470 50 \n \nweakly addressed through piecemeal multilateral arms \nagreements. \n Solomon Islands emerged from a conflict \nsituation 11 years ago. This year marks the sixth \nanniversary of our partnership with the Regional \nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, commonly \nreferred to as RAMSI. Under the partnership, State \ninstitutions have been strengthened and political \nstability has allowed our Parliament to enact some \n30 laws in less than 24 months. Public services are \nreaching out to the scattered populations on our \nhundreds of islands, indicating that change is \nhappening. \n This year, our relationship with RAMSI has \nprogressed from one of assistance to one of \npartnership, providing for a framework of cooperation \nbetween the two parties, with clearly defined joint \nstrategic goals, distinct roles and commitments, with \nthe overall objective of creating a secure, stable and \nself-sustaining socio-economic and political system for \nall Solomon Islanders. The Foreign Relations \nCommittee of our national Parliament has completed \nits review of the facilitation of the International \nAssistance Act and will submit its report to the national \nlegislature in November. I take this moment to thank \nmy Pacific neighbours for their continued support and \ncontribution to the Regional Mission. It is our fervent \nhope that this partnership can increase its international \nvisibility and interact more with the United Nations, as \nprovided for under the relevant chapter of the Charter. \n As part of our nation-building and healing \nprocess, Solomon Islands instituted its Truth and \nReconciliation Commission in April. Officiating at the \nlaunch of the Commission was Nobel laureate and \nArchbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu of South Africa. \nThe Commission allows Solomon Islands to revisit one \nof the darkest chapters of its history, and we do so with \ncourage, perseverance and a desire to seek a just and \npermanent peace within our growing nation. To this \nend, we thank the United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP) and all our partners for their \nsupport. \n The time frame for the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) is fast drawing to a close. The Solomon \nIslands supports the proposal to convene a review \nsummit next year, and hopes that the forthcoming \ngathering will reinvigorate our global partnership and \nenable it to realize the Millennium Development Goals \nwithin the given time frame. My country also \nwelcomes the decision of the General Assembly \n(resolution 63/227) to convene the Fourth United \nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries \nin 2011. Similarly, we welcome the review of the \nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of \nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable \nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, \nscheduled for next year. Both review processes should \nstrengthen the global partnerships and commitments \nundertaken within agreed international cooperative \nframeworks. \n Eighty five per cent of the population of Solomon \nIslands resides in rural areas. Therefore, we have \nadopted a rural-focused development approach in our \nefforts to meet the MDGs. Solomon Islands is poised to \nmake gains in achieving some of these goals through \nvarious partnerships. In this regard, I am pleased to \nacknowledge that, with the support of New Zealand \nand the Republic of China, the Solomon Islands is now \noffering free basic education for its children through \nthe third form. Work has also begun on eliminating \nmalaria, the number-one killer in the Solomon Islands, \nwith the launch of the programme in one of our nine \nprovinces. My Government thanks Australia for its \nsupport and contribution to that end. I also wish to \nthank the Republic of China, the European Union and \nother development partners for their contribution to the \nadvancement of the Government\u2019s rural development \npolicy. \n Human development remains a key ingredient of \nour fight against poverty. Solomon Islands opened a \nschool of tourism this year. We have shifted resources \ntowards developing our tourism industry in order to \noffset the projected revenue loss resulting from the \nreduced harvesting of our natural forests. The same \npolicy also applies to the agriculture, fisheries and \nmining sectors. \n South-South cooperation continues to invest in \nour people; it has guaranteed the education of \n50 students studying in Cuba, and my country thanks \nCuba for the gesture. Solomon Islands also thanks its \nMelanesian neighbour Papua New Guinea for its \nongoing bilateral assistance by increasing our presence \nin Port Moresby and offering scholarships to our \nstudents studying in Papua New Guinea. \n Global dynamics have changed since the United \nNations was established 64 years ago. The membership \n \n \n51 09-52470 \n \nthen numbered only 51. Reform of the Security \nCouncil has eluded us for the past 15 years. We \ntherefore need to increase the legitimacy of our \nCouncil and strengthen its role in preserving \ninternational peace. In this regard, my delegation was \npleased to see the debate on Security Council reform \nprogress into informal intergovernmental negotiations \nat the previous session of the General Assembly. We \nare equally pleased to note that three rounds of \nnegotiations have occurred in the past eight months, \nsignifying that the multilateral seed of reform of our \ninstitutions has been sowed. We need to ensure that it \ntakes root at this session. \n The relations of the Secretariat with Member \nStates are important. The interaction of Solomon \nIslands with our Organization has grown and matured \nover time. Our Government is now finalizing the \nallocation of land to give the United Nations a \npermanent home in our capital. We hope that the \nSecretariat will reciprocate this gesture and seriously \nconsider maintaining a fully fledged country presence \nin Solomon Islands. Comparatively speaking, despite \nthe fact that my nation has one of the largest \nsubregional country programmes, relations continue to \nbe micromanaged from abroad. My delegation takes \nthis opportunity once again to renew our call to \nupgrade the UNDP country presence in Solomon \nIslands from Deputy Resident Representative level to \nResident Representative. \n Here it would be remiss of me not to welcome \nUNDP\u2019s new Administrator, Ms. Helen Clark. We wish \nher every success in her tenure in office and are \nconfident that she will look at all issues with fresh \neyes. Development is, after all, one of the highest \ncallings of our Organization. Solomon Islands also \nencourages the Secretariat to ensure that its staff \nrepresents the diversity of its membership, in particular \nthat of States that have yet to fulfil their quota. \n Over the past couple of months, coastal States \nwith continental shelves have made submissions to \nextend their respective territorial claims beyond their \n200-mile exclusive economic zones. I am pleased to \ninform this Assembly that Solomon Islands has \nsubmitted a number of claims and looks forward to \nworking with the Commission on the Limits of the \nContinental Shelf. \n While extending an exclusive economic zone is a \nsovereign decision, we are mindful of our global \nenvironmental responsibilities. Solomon Islands is one \nof the six countries of the Coral Triangle Initiative. \nThree months ago, leaders from the Philippines, \nMalaysia, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea \nand Solomon Islands met in Indonesia and agreed to \nwork collaboratively across political boundaries to \nconserve 75 per cent of the world\u2019s coral species, \n40 per cent of the world\u2019s reef fish species and 51 per \ncent of the world\u2019s mangrove species. Our populations \nrely on our marine resources for survival and income. \nWe hope to keep it that way for generations to come. \n Good information and data are vital to allowing \nnational and international systems to make informed \ndecisions. In this connection, we would like to see \nUnited Nations support for our national statistics office \nfor the collation of data in real time and its distribution \nto all decision makers. \n To foster a vibrant economy, investment in \ninfrastructure is needed. I am pleased to say that we \nhave finally enacted a law that will open up our \ntelecommunications industry to competition. \n On the issue of human rights, Solomon Islands \nrecognizes that all human rights are universal, \nindivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually \nreinforcing. All human rights must be treated in a fair \nand equal manner, on the same footing and with the \nsame emphasis. That is one of the principles of the \nnewly established Human Rights Council. \n Solomon Islands continues to support the \nCouncil\u2019s internationally agreed principles. \nUnfortunately, within the Third Committee issues of \nhuman rights continue to be heavily politicized, \ndivisive and country-specific, in disregard of the \nuniversal principles of cooperation and dialogue. My \ndelegation would like to see the universal periodic \nreview be the reference point for assessing countries\u2019 \nhuman rights situations. \n Before I say anything about Taiwan\u2019s cross-Strait \nrelations, Solomon Islands conveys its sympathy and \nembraces the pain and suffering of all those impacted \nby typhoon Morakot. We also acknowledge the spirit \nand strength of the Government and people of the \nRepublic of China in rising above that tragedy with \nresilience to rebuild their lives and recover from the \nnatural catastrophe. \n My country continues to follow cross-Strait \ndevelopments with deep interest. A new era of relations \n  \n \n09-52470 52 \n \nis emerging between the Republic of China and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Relations have been \nmarked by an increased series of engagements. Direct \nflights, shipping, postal cooperation and exchanges on \nfood safety, inter alia, have been initiated. This people-\ncentred approach continues to build bridges of trust, \ntolerance and confidence. We wish this positive \ninteraction every success. \n Earlier this year, my delegation was encouraged \nto witness Taiwan\u2019s admission as an observer to the \nWorld Health Assembly. We hope with all sincerity that \nsimilar overtures will be accorded to Taiwan by other \nspecialized entities within the United Nations system. \n On the question of the Middle East, my \ndelegation associates itself with the statement of \nFinland\u2019s former President, Nobel Peace Prize recipient \nMr. Martti Ahtisaari, when he said \u201cAll conflicts can be \nsettled, and there are no excuses for allowing them to \nbecome eternal\u201d. To find a lasting and just peace in the \nregion, the determination of all Members is required. \nFor 62 years, the matter has been discussed within this \nAssembly. Solomon Islands believes that, in the right \nconditions, a politically negotiated two-State solution \ncan be reached. We support all international efforts in \nfinding a lasting and permanent solution. \n In our effort to create a better world, dialogue and \ncooperation between religions and cultures are needed. \nStereotypes created by a few must be overcome. \nExtremists thrive on mistrust, fear and suspicion and \nuse them to their advantage. They must be isolated. My \ndelegation acknowledges the initiative of Saudi Arabia \nto bring together leaders from the East and West in \npromoting a global culture of peace. This initiative \npresents a new beginning that we should all build \nupon. \n We must all work towards stabilizing the \ninternational system, which means that those with \npower must not victimize the weak by interfering with \nthe latter\u2019s health and social needs, be it for \nideological, political or security reasons. Unilateral and \nregional economic blockades and punitive action by \nStates and intergovernmental institutions must and \nshould be replaced with genuine cooperation and \nsincere dialogue. In this regard, we call on the entire \ninternational community to fully engage with Fiji. As \nits Melanesian neighbour, Solomon Islands continues \nto do so at all political levels. \n In closing, in view of the many challenges we are \nconfronting today, the words of Abraham Lincoln in \n1862 still holds true:  \n \u201cThe dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to \nthe stormy present."

        "file_text": "On behalf \nof my Government and the people of Antigua and \nBarbuda, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to \npreside over the sixty-fourth session of the General \nAssembly and wish you every success during your \ntenure. I also extend heartfelt congratulations to \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his visionary and \ninspiring leadership over the past year. \n  \u201cWe are all members of one body. The \nwelfare of the weakest and the welfare of the \nmost powerful are inseparably bound together. \nIndustry cannot flourish if labour languish. \nTransportation cannot prosper if manufactures \ndecline. The general welfare cannot be provided \nfor in any one act, but it is well to remember that \nthe benefit of one is the benefit of all, and the \nneglect of one is the neglect of all.\u201d \n Those words are taken from a 1914 speech by \nCalvin Coolidge. However, as we gather as a \ncommunity of nations almost a century later, they are \njust as timely. Our common humanity is being tested \nby the worst economic crisis since the Great \nDepression. Additional challenges that currently \nconfront us include the increased incidence and impact \nof pandemic diseases, worsening poverty and hunger \nthat trap millions around the globe, the adverse \nconsequences of climate change, tensions over peace \nand security, and increasing environmental \ndegradation. When history is recorded, our success as \nleaders will be determined by our stewardship during \nthese turbulent times. \n Years ago in much warmer and gentler climes, \nsmall island nations like our twin island nation of \nAntigua and Barbuda convened a global conference \nentitled \u201cSmall Islands, Big Issues\u201d. Today, we remain \nsmall islands, but the issues with which we grapple are \ngargantuan. In many cases, they have been exacerbated \nby ill-conceived or ineffective interventions and \nstructures. None among us is immune to the financial \ninsecurity brought about by global banking \nmismanagement and fraud. At the same time, global \nclimate change threatens to overwhelm the very fabric \nof our small nations. \n It has been said that the rising tide of \nglobalization floats all boats on a sea of economic \nopportunities. What is now clear is that such tides can \nturn into an economic tsunami that, in one swift wave, \ncan wash away development gains that took decades to \nbe realized. That is the situation in which Antigua and \nBarbuda now finds itself. An unwelcome visitor in the \nform of this global economic crisis has thrust itself \nupon our pristine shores and is threatening to wreak \nuntold damage on our economies.  \n Thus, while some members of our community of \nnations have begun to tout faint but hopeful signs of \nrecovery, prudence dictates that we pay heed to the \nwords of Calvin Coolidge and acknowledge that it \nsimply is not an option to adopt an insular approach in \nresponding to this global crisis. The stronger \n \n \n33 09-52463 \n \neconomies must remain ever cognizant of the fact that \nthe welfare of the weakest and the welfare of the most \npowerful are inseparably bound together. \n In responding to the crisis, all parties must admit \nthat the old methodologies, as reflected in the \nWashington Consensus and similar models, are \nobsolete. As we actively pursue the creation of new \nstructures and strategies, Antigua and Barbuda \nencourages the community of nations to explore \nalternative models, such as that represented by the \nBolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). With \nits foundation principles of complementarity as an \nalternative to competition, solidarity as opposed to \ndomination, cooperation as a replacement for \nexploitation, and respect for sovereignty rather than \ncorporate rule, ALBA represents an innovative and \nviable model of integration and development. \n Antigua and Barbuda, along with many of our \nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) brothers and \nsisters, welcomes the paradigm shift that now \ncharacterizes engagement with agencies such as the \nInternational Monetary Fund. The decision to limit \nconditionalities to those critical to achieving the \nobjectives of the country programme being supported, \nand the commitment to play a more supportive role and \nallow the objectives to be set by the borrowing country \nare welcome responses to earlier calls to recognize the \nabsolute necessity of using factors other than per capita \ngross domestic product as a criteria to access \nconcessionary financing. We maintain that therein lies \nthe key to mitigating a downward spiral into economic \nand social chaos. \n Decision-making on issues of international \nfinancial governance remains a privilege of the few \nwhen such decisions have great impact on the lives, \nlivelihood and basic well-being of millions of people \nthe world over. My Government calls on the developed \ncountries that are members of the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development to ensure that \ntheir response strategies involve better international \ncooperation on tax issues through inclusive and \ncooperative frameworks that ensure the involvement \nand equal treatment of small jurisdictions, as stipulated \nin the Outcome Document (resolution 63/303) of the \nUnited Nations Conference on the World Financial and \nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development. The \nOutcome Document is a welcome one, and I applaud \nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession for giving voice to the G-192, including the \ndeveloping and most vulnerable countries.  \n The genesis of the crisis lies in the capitals of the \ndeveloped world, but its effects are global and the \nresponse must be truly global. In this regard, I urge the \nAssembly, through the ad hoc working group to follow \nup on the outcome of the Conference, to take an \ninclusive approach to allow for the participation of \nthose that are not members of the exclusive Group of \nEight and Group of Twenty clubs.  \n Again, drawing on the words of Coolidge, I point \nout that the general welfare cannot be provided for in \nany one act or, I would add, by any single, small subset \nof the community of nations seeking unilaterally to \nreshape the global economic and financial architecture. \nIt is in our power to change the operating principles of \nglobal capitalism such that economic prosperity is \nshared equally among countries and within countries. \nDrastic change is needed, in theory and practice, in \neconomic assumptions and in the institutions of \ngovernance. It is the sustainable path to development \nand a challenge to which this assembly of nations and \nleaders must rise. \n Meeting transnational and global threats and \nchallenges to development requires international \ncooperation. As previously stated, traditional Western-\nbased modalities of development cooperation in which \npartners are not considered equals have failed us. A \nparadigm shift is not an option; it is an imperative. My \nGovernment firmly believes in promoting partnerships \nin support of sustainable development based on \nprinciples of mutual respect and understanding, \nequality and a genuine desire to effect the social and \neconomic development of all.  \n I have already alluded to my country\u2019s \nmembership in ALBA and commended that innovative \nmodel of integration and development. Antigua and \nBarbuda also looks forward to fully playing its role in \nensuring that the various trade arrangements entered \ninto with the European Union, the United States of \nAmerica and Canada work in the interest of all our \nnations. My Government, however, will continue to \nplace a strong emphasis on the development \ncomponents, which should be central to ensuring that \nthese arrangements produce positive results for our \npeople.  \n At the same time, we have deepened our \nintegration efforts with our CARICOM brothers and \n  \n \n09-52463 34 \n \nsisters, focusing on fully implementing the CARICOM \nSingle Market and Economy as well as deepening the \nvarious subregional regulatory frameworks. As a part \nof the smaller Organization of Eastern Caribbean States \n(OECS) grouping, Antigua and Barbuda fully supports \nthe establishment of an OECS economic union in an \neffort to build on the shared tradition of our \nsubregional integration arrangements and to expand the \nareas of shared sovereignty in order to survive and \nultimately thrive. \n As a member of the CARICOM family, Antigua \nand Barbuda is proud of its long-standing relationship \nwith the Republic of Cuba. It is my Government\u2019s firm \nbelief that the discriminatory and punitive policies and \npractices that serve to prevent Cuba from exercising its \nright freely to participate in the affairs of the \nhemisphere must be discontinued and with immediate \neffect. While the winds of change continue to move \nacross the United States of America, I call on the \nObama Administration to effect change in its dealings \nwith our sister nation of the Republic of Cuba. I call on \nthe United States of America to end the economic, \ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on our \nbrothers and sisters in Cuba. As a world leader and \ndefender of justice, the United States of America must \nembrace change fully in the interests of the men, \nwomen and children of Cuba. \n It is worth reiterating that the parallels between \nthe global economic crisis and the global climate \nchange crisis are both stark and dire for small island \ndeveloping States. Again, we are faced with the \nadverse impacts of a crisis that is not of our making but \nwhich is threatening \u2014 quite literally in the case of \nsome of our sister nations in the Pacific \u2014 to wipe us \noff the face of the Earth. It is a recognized fact, but it is \nworth repeating, that small island States contribute the \nleast to the causes of climate change, yet we suffer the \nmost from its effects.  \n At the summit of the Alliance of Small Island \nStates held earlier this week, my country joined with \nother island States in sending a strong message to the \ninternational community on the need for bold and \nambitious actions. Small island States have expressed \ntheir profound disappointment at the lack of tangible \naction within the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change negotiations to protect \nsmall island developing States and other vulnerable \ncountries, their peoples, culture, land and ecosystems.  \n The responsibility for mitigating climate change \nis a common responsibility of all nations, be they \ndeveloped or developing. However, developed \ncountries should shoulder their moral, ethical and \nhistorical responsibilities for emitting high levels of \nanthropogenic greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It \nis those actions that have now put the planet in \njeopardy and compromised the well-being of present \nand future generations. Antigua and Barbuda therefore \nfully supports our sister nation of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China in its call for developed countries to \ntake up their responsibility to provide new, additional, \nadequate and predictable financial support to \ndeveloping countries, which, in effect, represents a \njoint investment in the future of humankind.  \n At this pivotal point of the climate change \nnegotiations that will culminate in December, Antigua \nand Barbuda also anxiously awaits an international \nagreement significantly to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. A small island nation like ours, which is \nhighly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate \nchange, including sea-level rise, coral bleaching and \nmore frequent and intense hurricanes, understands that \nour fate, our very existence, hangs on the outcome of \nsuch an agreement. We wait with bated breath and hope \nthat humanity will show itself worthy of this planet and \nthat nations will have the political will and integrity of \nleadership to solve the most confounding challenge of \nour era. \n The effects of climate change have forcibly \nbrought home the absolute necessity of better disaster \npreparedness management and risk reduction. That has \nbeen clearly illustrated by several very active hurricane \nseasons in recent history. Cognizant of this, my \nGovernment has upgraded our disaster management \ncapabilities, including strengthening the national \ndisaster office, constructing hurricane shelters and \nenhancing community resilience. In the spirit of \ncooperation and solidarity, we look forward to having \nour development partners make available the necessary \nresources to enable us to implement our national \nadaptation plans and programmes. By so doing, they \nwill help to address the adverse effects of climate \nchange that we, the most vulnerable countries, are \nalready experiencing. We urge them to view this as a \ntop-most priority and moral imperative. \n Gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment \nremain centrepieces of the national development \nstrategy of Antigua and Barbuda. Having achieved \n \n \n35 09-52463 \n \nuniversal primary education, we are proud that our \nyoung males and females continue to enjoy equal \naccess and opportunity to education at the primary, \nsecondary and tertiary levels. Further, with a growing \nnumber of female parliamentarians and key high-level \npolitical positions occupied by women, we continue to \nimprove on our record of female empowerment. The \nadvocacy work of the United Nations system on gender \nissues has been instrumental in the progress we have \nmade thus far, and we look forward to continuing \nsupport as we continue to break down the traditional \nbarriers to the active participation of more than 50 per \ncent of our country\u2019s human capital. \n Transnational crime has burdened our societies \nwith social and financial costs that we cannot afford to \nbear. Crime prevention and small arms control are \npriorities for my Government. Our geography has \nplaced us at a major trans-shipment point for \ntransnational organized crime networks trafficking in \narms and narcotics. \n In recent years, the level of gun violence and \ngun-related crime has escalated significantly, placing \nfurther pressure on an already fragile economy. This \nhas led to insecurity, fear and loss of life in our \nsocieties, hampering our development efforts and \nthreatening the general peace and stability of the \nregion. We need greater cooperation from countries, as \nwell as the support of the United Nations system, to \neliminate this threat to hemispheric and international \npeace and security. Antigua and Barbuda is in full \nsupport of a legally binding arms trade treaty that will \nprevent the illegal international transfer of arms and \nwill govern the trade in conventional arms according to \ncommon international standards. \n As a peace-loving nation, Antigua and Barbuda is \nalso concerned by the lack of progress in the field of \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. We remain \nsteadfast in our commitment to a world free of nuclear \nweapons. The threat posed by non-State actors \nacquiring weapons of mass destruction is shared by all \ncountries, large and small. For this reason we support \nthe extension of the mandate of Security Council \nresolution 1540 (2004). Pursuant to our obligations \nunder that resolution we are pleased to have submitted \nthe relevant reports to the respective Security Council \ncommittees. \n The trans-shipment of nuclear waste through the \nwaters of the Caribbean also remains a critical issue. \nThe risk of an accident or a terrorist attack on one of \nthese shipments poses a grave threat to the \nenvironmental and economic sustainability of the \nregion. Heads of Government of CARICOM and of the \nwider Association of Caribbean States have \nconsistently called for a total cessation of these \nshipments in our waters, and we reiterate our strenuous \nand forceful rejection of the continued use of the \nCaribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclear and \nother hazardous waste material. \n Finally, as Caribbean people of African descent, \nour past is clouded by the dark days of the transatlantic \nslave trade. However, with steady hands, committed \nminds and innovative plans, a bright future looms with \nthe sunrise. We must ensure that we develop \nprogrammes to educate and inculcate in future \ngenerations an understanding of the lessons, history \nand consequences of slavery and the slave trade. We \nmust not forget. We must encourage continued action \nin this regard. Antigua and Barbuda looks forward to \nthe erection of a permanent memorial to the victims of \nthe transatlantic slave trade and slavery, an initiative \nbeing championed by CARICOM. We look forward \nalso to the continuation of serious dialogue and \neventual consensus on the issue of reparations. \n In conclusion, it is very clear that the multiple \nand multifaceted nature of the global threats and \nchallenges we face will test the abilities of this \nassembly of nations and its leaders. Is the United \nNations up to the task? Will we, both individually and \ncollectively, heed the admonition of Calvin Coolidge \nand demonstrate in both word and deed a firm \nconviction that the welfare of the weakest and the \nwelfare of the most powerful are inseparably bound \ntogether? For us, a small island with big aspirations \nand dreams for the future of our people, we remain \nhopeful that we will all find the political will and the \nability to rise to the task."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I should like \nto congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session. I am confident that his extensive \ndiplomatic experience and talent will contribute to the \nfruitful and successful work of the General Assembly \nat this session. \n In recent decades, the world has made \nconsiderable progress in terms of technology, \ninformation and economic and social development, \nwhich, due to globalization, is being spread throughout \nthe world. However, the negative aspects of this \nphenomenon, such as international terrorism, \nextremism, transnational organized crime, narcotics \ntrafficking, pandemic outbreaks and emerging \necological challenges, pose a serious threat to the \ninternational community. The United Nations plays the \nkey role in coordinating Member States\u2019 efforts to \neffectively meet the challenges of modern times and to \nattain the Millennium Development Goals. \n Tajikistan regards peacekeeping as one of the \nmost important aspects of the work of the United \nNations. Last year, for the first time ever, citizens of \nthe Republic of Tajikistan joined police forces in \npeacekeeping operations, contributing to efforts to \nstrengthening peace and stability in conflict zones. A \nnational strategy on the development of Tajikistan\u2019s \npeacekeeping capacity is currently being drafted. \n Tajikistan attaches the utmost importance to \nstrengthening the disarmament process. We hope that, \nat the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, a \nconstructive exchange of views will take place on \nurgent issues related to the practical implementation of \nthat agreement. We are convinced that the \nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones is equally \nimportant at the regional and global levels. Tajikistan \nis therefore prepared to work to enhance its practical \nimplementation of the provisions of the Treaty on a \nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, which \ncame into effect on 21 March 2009. \n We support the leading role played by the United \nNations in combating the illicit trade in small arms and \nlight weapons. We hope that important measures for \n \n \n5 09-52228 \n \ncoordinating further steps in this direction will be \ndeveloped at the next Biennial Meeting to be held on \nthe Programme of Action. \n Tajikistan supports the efforts of the international \ncommunity to achieve the comprehensive prohibition \nof the use of anti-personnel mines. For our part, we are \nmeeting our commitments under the Convention on the \nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and \nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their \nDestruction, by providing mine-risk information to the \nSecretary-General on an annual basis. \n The first international conference to address the \nissues of the consequences of landmines was held in \nDushanbe, the capital of my country, in June 2009. \nTajikistan has long suffered the effects of landmines. \nWe believe that Central Asia must be free from the \nthreat of mines and we call upon the international \ncommunity to do its utmost to achieve this noble goal. \n The international community continues to fight \nterrorism, extremism, transnational organized crime \nand illicit drug trafficking. These combined threats \ngive rise to greater concerns. We therefore consider it \nessential to expedite the adoption of a comprehensive \nconvention on international terrorism. Double \nstandards must be avoided in this endeavour, since \nterrorism has no national or religious affiliations. \n The prevention of illicit drug trafficking is an \nintegral part of the common struggle against terrorism. \nTajikistan has developed bilateral, regional and \nmultilateral short- and long-term programmes of action, \nand ratified approximately 30 intergovernmental \nagreements. \n The Drug Control Agency established by the \nPresident of the Republic of Tajikistan, with the active \ninvolvement of the United Nations, has now been in \nexistence for over a decade. The total value of heroin \nseized during these years, in terms of its average price \nin Europe, is estimated at $1.12 billion. This initiative \nhas helped save more than 36 million lives from drug \naddiction. The Tajik initiative to establish an \nanti-narcotics security belt around Afghanistan was \nlaunched from the lofty podium of the General \nAssembly at its twentieth special session in 1998. \n We believe that rendering assistance to \nAfghanistan\u2019s target programmes could be one way to \ncounteract the drug threat emanating from that country. \nRegrettably, the efforts undertaken to date and the \nresources allocated by the international community to \naddress this challenge have not always been sufficient \nto counteract the increasingly aggressive spread of \nnarcotics. In our view, the borders of the countries \nneighbouring Afghanistan should be regarded as the \nfront line in this struggle, and efforts to reinforce that \nline should be enhanced. For many years, Tajikistan \nhas acted as a buffer zone against the spread and export \nof narcotics, terrorism, extremism and other negative \nphenomena emanating from this area. \n We are profoundly interested in strengthening \nlasting peace and stability in our neighbour \nAfghanistan because the security of Central Asia \ndepends in every respect on the situation in \nAfghanistan. Today, it is obvious that the Afghan issue \ncannot be resolved by military means alone, but \nrequires a comprehensive approach taking into account \nall the many factors involved. First and foremost, \nsocial and educational projects and programmes should \nbe implemented in that country. We support the current \nefforts at peaceful rehabilitation and believe that the \ninternational strategy of action in Afghanistan should \nto a larger extent rely upon the Afghan people \nthemselves, and that priority should be given to \nensuring close and efficient cooperation with the \ncountry\u2019s authorities. \n The world situation is rapidly changing because \nof the financial and economic crisis. It not only \nundermines our efforts and capacity to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals, but imposes new and \ncomplex tasks. We highly appreciate the United \nNations role and efforts to address the current threefold \ncrisis and mitigate its consequences.  \n It is well known that the global financial and \neconomic crisis was caused primarily by the most \nadvanced and wealthy countries, which unreasonably \ninflated banking assets on the basis of unsecured loans. \nWe therefore believe that these countries must bear \ntheir share of responsibility towards the developing \ncountries, whose already difficult situation was further \naggravated by the global financial crisis. Partial write-\noffs of the debts incurred during the crisis, ongoing \nincreases in donor assistance and rational management \nof labour migration would be very helpful in this \nsituation. In my opinion, it is high time for a number of \nforums to be replaced by practical support for the \nefforts of the developing countries to mitigate and \novercome the impact of the crisis. If the crisis should \n  \n \n09-52228 6 \n \npersist over the long term, it may be fraught with ever-\nmore serious consequences. \n Along with other Member States, Tajikistan \nsupported the outcome of the United Nations \nConference on the World Financial and Economic \nCrisis and Its Impact on Development. We highly \nappreciate the efforts undertaken by the High-level \nTask Force on the Global Food Security Crisis, and \ndeem it necessary to enhance assistance to the \ndeveloping countries in the form of financial and \neconomic support and the transfer of modern \ntechnology and seed stocks.  \n Meanwhile, in our opinion the efforts to solve the \nproblems caused by the energy crisis have not been \nsuccessful enough. We believe that, along with the \nMillennium Development Goals, access to energy \nshould be given top priority. Tajikistan, which ranks \neighth in the world in terms of available hydropower \nresources \u2014 the total amount of which is estimated at \n527 billion kilowatt hours \u2014 currently utilizes less \nthan 5 per cent of its potential, and over the past \n18 years has endured a chronic energy crisis for eight \nmonths of every year, primarily in autumn and winter. \nIn recent years, the electricity shortage has been \nexacerbated by abnormally severe and long winters, the \nresult of climate change. It is perfectly logical that, in \nthe absence of explored hydrocarbon resources, \nTajikistan should develop its hydropower engineering \nin a concerted and comprehensive manner. \n The completion of the construction of a number \nof small, medium-size and large hydropower stations \nwill help to provide energy not only to the whole of \nCentral Asia, but to neighbouring countries as well. In \nthis regard, the implementation of such regional \nprojects as the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity \nTransmission and Trade Project will define the \ndevelopment prospects of our vast region, which \nincludes Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and \nPakistan. \n The ever-increasing need for cost-efficient and \nenvironmentally sound energy requires the construction \nof hydropower stations and water reservoirs, which are \nessential to providing reliable volumes of water, \nespecially in years of drought. As hydropower facilities \ngenerate energy by utilizing water rather than by \nconsuming it, hydropower engineering plays an \nimportant role in developing energy production and the \nsocio-economic sphere, as well as in environmental \nprotection not only in Tajikistan but in the entire \nCentral Asian region.  \n Global climate change requires a comprehensive \nand integrated approach to the use of natural resources. \nWe are deeply convinced that the Copenhagen meeting \nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change will \nendorse a new comprehensive agreement on this issue. \n Every year, natural disasters cause severe damage \nto agriculture, the environment and the entire economy \nof countries such as ours. In Tajikistan, 93 per cent of \nthe terrain consists of mountains. The damage done to \nour country\u2019s economy in recent years by such natural \ndisasters as mud flows, landslides and floods is \nestimated at hundreds of millions of United States \ndollars. Tragically, that damage entails human \ncasualties. \n An assessment of the impact of climate change on \nTajikistan\u2019s glaciers has shown that, during the period \nof observation begun in 1930, the total area of the \nglaciers has been reduced by approximately one third. \nSince glaciers and snowcaps are the main sources for \nwater runoff into the rivers, there is a probability that \nin the near future river capacity will be diminished by \n5 to 15 per cent. At the same time, water consumption \nhas increased, due to demographic growth and the \nexpansion of areas of irrigation. In the previous \ncentury alone, the total area of irrigated land increased \nfrom 2.5 million to 9 million hectares, while the \npopulation of Central Asia grew from 20 million in \n1956 to 63 million people today. In these \ncircumstances, the countries of the region should \nreview their programmes and strategies with regard to \nwater use, especially in agriculture, and take \nconsolidated and concerted action to promote \nsustainable development. \n From this lofty rostrum, we should like once \nagain to remind everyone of the problems caused by \nthe degradation of the Aral Sea. The large-scale use of \nland for cultivating such agricultural crops as cotton \nand rice, which consume a great deal of water, has \nbecome the primary cause of this ecological disaster. \n The most reasonable solution to the current \nsituation, which is characterized by the salinization of \nsoil and the irretrievable loss of 30 to 60 per cent of \nirrigation water, would be to adopt specific water-\nsaving measures, such as the rehabilitation of irrigation \nsystems, the reclamation of irrigated land, the \n \n \n7 09-52228 \n \nintroduction of advanced irrigation technologies and \nthe partial replacement of cotton and rice with crops \nthat consume less water, which would also help to \naddress the food crisis issue.  \n Only an integrated and mutually beneficial \napproach of the countries of the region towards the use \nof water energy and other natural resources can help to \nresolve the interrelated energy, food and environment \nproblems and to ensure the sustainable development of \nall Central Asian countries. It is no secret that \nhumankind is already facing a shortage of safe \ndrinking water, which is not accessible to more than \n1 billion people on the planet, while in some countries \nthe price of freshwater currently exceeds that of petrol.  \n As a country that has one of the largest amounts \nof freshwater resources in the world, Tajikistan is \nconvinced that creating an economic mechanism for \nthe cross-flow of water and energy resources between \nupstream countries that are rich in water resources and \ndownstream countries where hydrocarbon deposits are \nprimarily located would promote long-term mutually \nbeneficial cooperation among those States.  \n Having put forward the idea of using safe \ndrinking water from Lake Sarez to meet the needs of \nthe population of the entire region, we propose specific \nmeasures in that area. We hope that the United Nations \nand other international organizations, regional \ncommissions and relevant institutions can offer \nconstructive and unwavering assistance on that issue, \nwhich is of utmost significance to our region. \n As the initiator of the International Year of \nFreshwater 2003 and the International Decade for \nAction, \u201cWater for Life\u201d, 2005-2015, Tajikistan \nbelieves that it is of paramount importance to expedite \nthe implementation of the United Nations water agenda \nand to enhance it by achieving the Decade goals. World \nWater Day on 22 March 2010 will mark the fifth year \nsince the commencement of the Water Decade. In that \nregard, Tajikistan proposes holding on that day a high-\nlevel dialogue of the General Assembly to discuss the \nimplementation of the international water Decade and \nthe Millennium Development Goals on water and \nsanitation. That event could be a milestone in the \nmidterm review of the implementation of half of the \nDecade and evaluation of the progress in achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n My Government has already put forward a \nproposal to hold a conference for a midterm review in \nDushanbe in 2010 that would serve as one of the \npreparatory events for the United Nations millennium \nreview summit in 2010. I hope that that initiative will \nfind understanding among and receive support from all \nMember States. \n Bearing in mind the water crisis, which has been \naggravated by population growth and global climate \nchange, the international community should take \nspecific measures to ensure the fair and integrated use \nof water resources in order to meet the needs of the \npeople, environment and economies of all countries \naround the world. To that end, the Republic of \nTajikistan has proposed declaring 2012 international \nyear of water diplomacy, with the aim of developing, \nwithin the United Nations, further coordinated steps \ntowards the rational use of water resources at the \nnational, regional and international levels. Our country \nintends to further promote that issue at the General \nAssembly, and hopes for the support of all Member \nStates. \n Next year will mark the beginning of the third \nfive-year term on the way towards the international \ncommunity\u2019s achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. The year 2010 will be a landmark in the \nassessment of our efforts to meet global challenges, \novercome difficulties and evaluate the progress in \nattaining the goals outlined in the United Nations \nMillennium Declaration. \n In conclusion, I would like to stress that, as an \nadvocate of broad-based cooperation, Tajikistan \nbelieves that only collective and coordinated efforts \nand effective regional and international cooperation \ncan serve as a foundation for our common success in \nthat area. The mutual understanding and cooperation \nthat have prevailed in this Organization since its \nestablishment remain the only way to a bright and clear \nfuture and to universal peace and prosperity."

        "file_text": "This has been a truly \nremarkable week, remarkable for the leadership shown \nby the Secretary-General on climate change, the new \npolicies of President Obama, which he so eloquently \nset out before us, the constructive responses to those \ninitiatives from many parts of the world and the \nhistoric meeting of the Security Council, which \ncommitted itself to a world without nuclear weapons. \nWe have all witnessed something new and different: a \ngenuine opportunity for a real renaissance of \nmultilateralism. \n There is a real chance to turn the United Nations \nonce again into what was originally envisaged in the \nCharter: not just a forum for discussion, but a place for \naction, the central focal point of the efforts of the \ninternational community to find common solutions to \ncommon challenges. It will depend on each and every \nMember of the Organization to make sure that this \n \n \n21 09-52592 \n \nhistoric opportunity is seized. Cooperation is not a \nmere option, but an indispensable necessity, if we want \nto succeed. \n Together, we must build a world based on \npredictable and equitable rules applicable to every \nMember, big or small, strong or weak. Adherence to \nthe rule of law and the principles of the Charter is \ncritical to conflict prevention, stability and sustainable \nlong-term development. \n A year ago, Member States entrusted my country \nwith a seat on the Security Council for the years 2009-\n2010. We take that responsibility very seriously. \n One important focus of our work in the Council is \nto improve the protection of civilians in armed conflict. \nDespite significant progress, armed conflicts continue \nto darken the lives of men, women and children in \nmany parts of the world. \n Austria has been working actively with others on \nexpanding the monitoring and reporting of serious \nviolations of children\u2019s rights. Austria fully supports \nSecurity Council resolution 1820 (2008) and the \nfollow-up resolution to be adopted next week as a \ndecisive response by the international community to \nsexual violence in conflict situations. At the same time, \nAustria attaches great importance to the participation \nof women in the promotion of peace and security. \nWomen must have a voice in every peace process \nthroughout the world. \n But many challenges remain. How can we \nimprove the protection of civilians on the ground, in \nparticular in situations in which the Council has \nprovided peacekeeping operations with a clear \nprotection mandate? How can we ensure better \ncompliance by parties to conflict with their obligations \nunder international humanitarian law \u2014 for instance, \nto allow full access for humanitarian assistance? We \nwill therefore use our Security Council presidency in \nNovember to identify concrete measures to improve the \nprotection of civilians. In order to do so, I invite all \npartners to join me in an open debate on 13 November. \nI am pleased that the Secretary-General has agreed to \nparticipate. \n In recent years, several peacekeeping missions \u2014 \nsuch as the United Nations Organization Mission in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo \u2014 have been \nmandated by the Council to ensure the physical \nprotection of the civilian population.  \n Its role of providing protection to refugees and \ninternally displaced persons was a strong factor in \nAustria\u2019s decision to contribute troops to the European \nUnion and United Nations Missions in Chad and the \nCentral African Republic. Austria has also contributed \nto the United Nations study analysing experience in the \nimplementation of such protection mandates in peace \noperations. We thus hope to contribute to the overall \nefforts to reform United Nations peacekeeping. Our \naim must be to have more effective and better-\nresourced peacekeeping missions that are in a position \nto implement their mandates in a credible and \nconsistent manner. \n To achieve sustainable peace, security and \ndevelopment, peacekeeping must be complemented by \nthe rebuilding of functioning institutions, particularly \nin the judiciary and the security sector. In that context, \nwe commend the efforts of the United Nations Office \non Drugs and Crime in combating corruption, \norganized crime and drug trafficking. \n The Peacebuilding Commission is a new form of \npartnership between countries emerging from conflict, \ndonors and main providers of personnel to United \nNations missions to ensure that support is tailored to \nspecific local needs. Austria is committed to the work \nof the Peacebuilding Commission, and has recently \njoined the country-specific configuration for Sierra \nLeone, a model case for successful peacebuilding. \n Sustainable peace can be achieved only when a \nsociety also addresses its past. The establishment of \neffective justice and reconciliation mechanisms at the \nnational level is crucial to end impunity and to ensure \nthe rights of victims. Such efforts can be \ncomplemented by international criminal justice \nmechanisms, such as the ad hoc tribunals and the \nInternational Criminal Court. \n Peace, security and stability are preconditions for \nsustainable development. Eradicating extreme poverty \nand hunger continues to be one of the main challenges \nfacing the international community. Achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals by 2015 is far from \nassured. In view of the global financial crisis, \nincreased efforts by the international community are \nurgently needed. Austria will contribute its share to \nthat global endeavour. \n All those efforts will be in vain if we are unable \nto protect our planet. Climate change is a fundamental \nthreat to humankind, aggravating poverty, hunger, \n  \n \n09-52592 22 \n \nenvironmental degradation and insecurity, and thus \nseriously threatening the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. The United Nations \nClimate Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen \nin December must decide on concrete actions to curb \nclimate change on the basis of mutual trust and strong \ninternational cooperation. \n Climate and energy measures can also be an \nimportant part of our response to the current economic \ncrisis. Investments in green technologies and \nsustainable, affordable and stable energy supplies will \nbenefit both the economy and the climate. \n The Security Council summit on nuclear \nnon-proliferation and disarmament held earlier this \nweek issued a strong call for a world free of nuclear \nweapons. For that vision to become reality, we need \nprogress on several fronts.  \n Austria, as Co-Chair, together with Costa Rica, of \nthe 2007 Conference on Facilitating the Entry into \nForce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \nand co-leader of the process for the past two years, is \nproud to have contributed to bringing the Treaty closer \nto entering into force.  \n As current Chair of the Conference on \nDisarmament in Geneva, Austria is working hard to \ntranslate the recent positive momentum into substantial \nprogress, especially on a verifiable fissile material cut-\noff treaty. \n The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty must be \nreinforced. The Review Conference of Parties to the \nTreaty to be held next year will have to agree on a \npackage of measures and procedures that address the \nkey issues, but most of all it will need to build trust and \nconfidence. \n Let me continue with three short remarks on \nconventional disarmament.  \n First, I appeal to all States to make a success of \nthe Second Review Conference of the Ottawa \nLandmines Ban Convention, to be held in Colombia in \nDecember, and, in particular, to ensure improved \nassistance to victims.  \n Secondly, I welcome the growing support for the \nConvention on Cluster Munitions, which Austria \nratified in April. We appeal to all other States to sign \nand ratify it as soon as possible. \n Thirdly, we must counter the illegal proliferation \nof small arms and light weapons. An arms trade treaty \nwould be an important step in that regard. Hoping to \ncontribute to speedy negotiations, Austria will host an \ninternational conference in Vienna in February next \nyear. \n With regard to the Iranian nuclear programme, it \nis indispensable that Iran fully comply with all relevant \nSecurity Council resolutions and closely cooperate \nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency. The \nmost recent announcement by the Government of Iran \nconcerning an additional enrichment facility is \ndiscouraging and further increases our concern. \n As an important regional actor, Iran has the \nresponsibility to contribute to peace and security in the \narea. The time has now come for Iran to finally enter \ninto a constructive dialogue with the international \ncommunity. Iran should therefore grasp the hand \nextended by its international partners and engage in \ngenuine and serious negotiations. The debates during \nthis week have clearly shown that the world will not \naccept an Iran armed with nuclear weapons. \n Let me also underline that Austria firmly rejects \nthe unacceptable remarks made by President \nAhmadinejad during his speech on Wednesday. We \nreject any abuse of the United Nations General \nAssembly as a platform for intolerance, anti-Semitism, \nand racial hatred. \n Mr. Grauls (Belgium), Vice-President took the \nChair. \n Regarding the Middle East, we saw this week\u2019s \nsummit between President Obama, Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and President Abbas as a sign of hope. We \nappeal to the parties to remove any remaining obstacles \nto the early resumption of negotiations. \n After decades of hostility and violence, time has \ncome to move decisively forward. Israel\u2019s right to exist \nin security and peace and the realization of the rights \nof the Palestinian people to their own State are not \nmutually exclusive. On the contrary, they are both \ncrucial elements of a comprehensive and just solution. \n Austria will continue to help establish the \neconomic foundation and the institutional \ninfrastructure of a future Palestine State. It will also, \nwithin the framework of the European Union, \ncontribute to the efforts to promote a dynamic and \nresults-oriented peace process. \n \n \n23 09-52592 \n \n International cooperation and dialogue are the \nbasis for sustainable peace and development. Only by \nclosely working together will we be able to \nsuccessfully address the many challenges of today\u2019s \nglobalized world. We therefore appreciate President \nTreki\u2019s initiative to make the need for dialogue a main \ntheme of this week\u2019s debate. Situated in the heart of \nEurope, and for most of its history at the crossroads of \ndifferent cultures, religions and political systems, \nAustria has developed a practice of constructive \ndialogue as the host country of one of the seats of the \nUnited Nations for the past three decades. \n I have made it one of my foreign policy priorities \nto position Austria even more firmly as a platform for \npeace and dialogue. We stand ready to host \ninternational negotiations and provide our services, as \nwe did most recently for the informal talks on Western \nSahara. Austria can be counted on to be a partner in \ntranslating the words, ideas and initiatives of this week \ninto concrete action."

        "file_text": "Since the last session of the General \n \n \n11 09-52598 \n \nAssembly, a number of crises have tested the \ncapabilities of multilateral institutions to face them \nfirmly and with unified purpose. The international \ncommunity has come to understand that only joint \naction in which developing countries are full \nparticipants can offer sustainable responses to these \nemergencies. Fortunately, we see some positive signs \nof economic growth in some places. \n Nevertheless, insecurity and uncertainty prevail. \nThe insecurity results from the persistence of armed \nconflicts, terrorism and transnational organized crime, \nwhich threaten our achievements in sustainable human \ndevelopment. The uncertainty is linked to the \nnegotiations that will lead to the United Nations \nClimate Change Conference in Copenhagen in \nDecember. Global warming is now a threat to humanity \nof incalculable proportions, to which we all contribute \nand for which we all, without exception, are \nresponsible. \n Contributing to sustainable human development \nrequires, first, conditions conducive to international \npeace and security. As President Felipe Calder\u00f3n \npointed out in the Security Council summit (see \nS/PV.6191), nuclear proliferation and highly \ninsufficient legal access to peaceful uses for atomic \nenergy demand a renewed commitment to disarmament \nand the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime. \n I also echo the emphatic call, issued by global \ncivil society at the sixty-second Annual Conference of \nthe Department of Public Information for \nNon-Governmental Organizations, held in Mexico City \nthis year, that we, the Governments of the world, fulfil \nour responsibilities to attain our goal of a world free of \nnuclear weapons. \n The promotion and protection of human rights \nconstitute a universal ethical imperative and an \nobligation that no government can renounce. The \nprogress attained in this field at the national level has \nbeen possible thanks to my country\u2019s close alignment \nwith the international system for the promotion and \nprotection of human rights, which has proved an \ninvaluable tool for promoting improvements in our \nnational structures. \n It is clear that to attain full sustainable human \ndevelopment we must tackle poverty and inequality, \nfostering a development that ensures access for all \npeople to adequate food, health, education and \nhousing. \n In response to the health emergency that Mexico \nfaced some months ago with the outbreak of influenza \nA(H1N1), the World Health Organization gave its full \nsupport to the timely, energetic and responsible actions \nof my Government. This is proof that the United \nNations system is capable of mobilizing coordinated \naction by States and avoiding unilateral measures that \nare not appropriate in response to such emergencies. \nWe must continue to update our protocols for action. \n For Mexico, meeting the Millennium Development \nGoals is a State commitment. Our priority continues to \nbe the eradication of poverty. We must make the \nnecessary structural changes to reduce inequality and \nattain prosperity for all. We must implement policies \nthat ensure that concrete action is taken based on the \nMonterrey Consensus on financing for development, \nthat the Doha Round is successfully concluded and that \ncontributions by developed countries and multilateral \ndevelopment banks to projects in countries with low \ngrowth rates are increased. \n It is imperative to address urgent needs such as \nfood security in order to reduce inequality and \nstrengthen the capacities enjoyed by our peoples. Food \nsecurity is the very foundation of development. \nTherefore, we must ensure food security by eliminating \nmarket distortions, boosting production through the use \nof technology and improving productivity without \nmaking sacrifices on the environmental agenda. \n The recent Group of 20 Summit in Pittsburgh \ndemonstrated that the scale of the global financial \ncrisis requires a firm response, both in coordinating the \nmeasures taken by individual countries to mitigate \nimpact in areas such as unemployment and in avoiding \nprotectionist measures. There is still much left to do, \nbut it is a fact that the timely intervention by the Group \nof 20 allowed further resources to be channelled to the \ninternational financial institutions and strengthened the \nparticipation of developing countries in the decision-\nmaking bodies within those institutions. \n The United Nations must realize that we are \nwitnessing a reconfiguration of global economic \ngovernance, and that policies must be adjusted to this \nnew reality. We require an Organization that is strong, \neffective and efficient. The cuts that are being imposed \non all countries at home must also be reflected in \nUnited Nations system budgets. If it remains passive, \nalienated and conformist, our Organization risks losing \n  \n \n09-52598 12 \n \nits relevance as the premier universal and legitimate \nforum for solving the major problems of humanity. \n The challenges of global warming have made it \nclear that the absence of economic incentives is one of \nthe main reasons that the commitments under the \nKyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change have not been fulfilled. \nFor this reason, Mexico has proposed, in the \npreparatory negotiations for the Copenhagen \nConference, an innovative financing scheme, known as \nthe Green Fund, which would reward the efforts of \nStates that adopt policies aimed at reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions, without jeopardizing their development \ngoals. The Green Fund fully responds to the principle \nof common but differentiated responsibility. It is not \njust another financial mechanism that obeys the \nconventional criteria. \n All countries must be able to receive financing, \nbut the scale of the contributions will result from a \ncombination of factors that take into account, among \nother things, their level of development, the size of \ntheir population and the volume of their emissions. \nLeast-developed countries will not be obliged to \ncontribute. This initiative of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n \nhas received growing support from Member States, \nwhich reinforces the will of my Government to \ncontinue moving forward with all parties in the \nnegotiations prior to Copenhagen. \n The negotiations aimed at achieving \ncomprehensive Security Council reform have made \nsignificant progress through a process that has heard \ndebate on all aspects of reform and identified proposals \nthat can garner the broadest possible consensus. We \nmust continue negotiations towards compromise \nsolutions which would increase the representative \nnature of the Council and translate into greater \naccountability, without jeopardizing its effectiveness. \n The world has undoubtedly changed since 1945, \nand remains in a state of permanent mutation, as the \nongoing discussions on the international economic and \nfinancial architecture demonstrate. It is absurd to argue \nfor static institutions in a world that is anything but \nstatic. \n As we presented our candidacy as a \nnon-permanent member of the Security Council for the \n2009-2010 term, Mexico announced that it would seek \nto foster closer communications between Member \nStates and the Security Council, something which is \nessential if the Council is to accomplish its tasks. As \nPresident of the Council during the month of April, \nMexico made progress in increasing the transparency \nof that body by issuing information on a significant \nnumber of the Council\u2019s consultations. We will keep \nworking to enhance the effectiveness and legitimacy of \nthe Council in several ways. First, we will seek to \nstrengthen the work of the Council in preventing \ninternational crises relating to massive human rights \nviolations and strengthening protection for the \nthousands of internally displaced persons and refugees. \nSecondly, we will seek to focus the Council\u2019s attention \non preventing conflicts, and not just managing them, \nby incorporating in its resolutions mandates that link \nsecurity with strengthened development aid and \nhumanitarian assistance. Thirdly, we wish to make \ndevelopment assistance a fundamental strategy for \nconflict prevention and reconstruction. \n The situation in Honduras has made evident the \nimportance of continuing to improve our means in \npreventing actions that suspend democracy and the rule \nof law. We can celebrate the fact that the international \ncommunity responded unanimously to the forceful \ninterruption of constitutional order in Honduras and the \nousting of President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya. Mexico, \ntogether with the majority of countries of the \nhemisphere, has acted within regional mechanisms, \nincluding the Rio Group, which we chair, to secure \nPresident Zelaya\u2019s return to office and that democratic \norder is restored based on the initiative of President \nArias of Costa Rica. We issue an emphatic call to the \nde facto authorities to continue the dialogue with the \ncommission established under the auspices of the \nOrganization of American States, to abstain from any \nact that would endanger the inviolability of the \nEmbassy of Brazil, where President Zelaya is located \nand to respect his physical safety and that of those who \nare with him. \n Let us work together for a world that is more \nsecure and more just, a world where in the words of the \ngreat Octavio Paz, liberty can take root \u2014 a prosperous \nworld anchored by the rights and freedoms of \nindividuals."

        "file_text": "I \nwould like at the outset to welcome the election of \nMr. Ali Treki to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session, which is taking \nplace at a time when major challenges continue to test \nthe effectiveness of our Organization. From this \nrostrum, I would also like to pay tribute to his \npredecessor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, and to \nhis courageous and energetic actions throughout his \nterm. I also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \nhis exceptional work at the head of our Organization at \na time in history when important reforms are being \nundertaken. \n I wish to emphasize the extent to which, now \nmore than ever, the United Nations symbolizes hope in \nthe face of the major challenges threatening our planet, \nwhich no nation can meet alone. People have never had \nsuch need of that hope.  \n The Summit on Climate Change, held recently at \nthe initiative of the Secretary-General, called once \nagain upon the collective conscience of all nations \nlarge and small, united and stirred by a common \nresolve to work to build the better world of which the \nfounding fathers of our Organization dreamed. In this \nvillage that our world has become, we Members of the \nUnited Nations are the guarantors of people\u2019s liberties \nand rights, their security and their future, their dignity \nand the promise of world peace. \n Mr. Hackett (Barbados), Vice-President, took the \nchair. \n I know what solidarity owes to the dedication of \nthe United Nations, and what peace owes to its actions, \ncommitment and determination. And I foresee what the \nfuture will owe it. It is here that are forged freedom \nand human rights, solidarity and universal justice \u2014 in \na word, the destiny of humankind. The men and women \nhere know that more than a billion people still live on \nless than a dollar a day and that children die \nunnecessarily of hunger and disease. All of us here \nknow how climate change is abetting these scourges \nand how the countries least responsible for it suffer the \nmost from its effects. Producing only 3.8 per cent of \ngreenhouse gas emissions, our continent is the most \naffected by global warming. Poor populations are its \nmain victims. The agriculture, fauna and infrastructure \nof coastal regions are on the front line. \n The Brundtland report of the World Commission \non Environment and Development (A/42/427, annex), \nsubmitted to the General Assembly in 1987, gave us, \nmore than 20 years ago, the following definition of \nsustainable development: \u201cdevelopment that meets the \nneeds of the present without compromising the ability \nof future generations to meet their own needs\u201d \n(Ibid., p. 54).  \n Sustainable development is not a concept, as we \nhave all learned at our own expense; it is an issue \nfraught with genuine responsibilities. The balance of \necosystems has never been so threatened. Urgent \nmeasures are required in Africa and in all nations to \nguarantee food security, combat drought and \ndesertification, and restore natural ecosystems. Such \nmeasures require the mobilization of significant \nresources.  \n \n  \n \n09-52470 8 \n \nWhen one\u2019s main resource is the forest, one bears \nan immense responsibility. We represent the Earth\u2019s \nsecond most important environmental lung, after the \nAmazon. Together with our Latin American brothers, \nwe are aware of our responsibility as guardians of \nforests that represent an essential treasure for all \nhumankind. \n Since the 1990s, the Congo has worked \ncontinuously with the international community to \ncombat global warming and to implement a policy of \nforest protection. Today, our action is more essential \nthan ever. Our forests represent vast carbon sinks of \nglobal importance for regulating the greenhouse-gas \neffect. They are our common salvation and home to \n400 species of mammals, more than 1,000 species of \nbirds and more than 10,000 species of plants, 3,000 of \nwhich are endemic. Gorillas, forest buffaloes, \nchimpanzees, bonobos and forest elephants \u2014 these \nare what must inspire our action, as they help to \nmaintain the ecological functions of natural systems. \n In 1999, the countries of the Congo basin \nlaunched a unique forestry experiment by proclaiming \ntheir common resolve to preserve their biodiversity and \npromote the sustainable and joint management of their \nforest ecosystems, as well as by ensuring the use of \nresources for Central Africa\u2019s economic and social \ndevelopment. The resulting plan is one of the strategic \ncomponents of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment. It represents a significant contribution \nby Central Africa to the effort to address the problems \nrelated to global warming. Unfortunately, the funds \nnecessary for the programme\u2019s implementation are still \nlacking.  \n The countries of the region have nonetheless \nmade great progress in forest preservation. Today, \nAfrica requests that the forthcoming Copenhagen \nConference consider mechanisms for adaptation, \nmitigation, capacity-building, technology transfer and \nfinancing based on the principle of equity. In \nCopenhagen, we must take earnest account of the \nforests, which represent carbon sinks of global \nimportance for regulating and stabilizing our planet\u2019s \nclimate.  \n The economic and financial crisis, whose effects \nwe continue to feel, is the most serious economic \nrecession that the world has experienced since the \nGreat Depression of the 1930s. This crisis should help \nto raise our awareness. It justifies an overhaul of the \ninternational financial architecture and can enable us, \nthrough new commitments, to realize the vision of a \nmore unified and equitable world. But time is running \nout, in Africa more than elsewhere, and the adoption of \ndecisive measures can wait no longer. \n Halfway towards the deadline for achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals, our success will \ndepend on the international community\u2019s new choices \nand on the effective implementation of announced \nmeasures. The commitments undertaken at the April \n2009 London summit of the Group of 20 must be \nhonoured, and we hope that the meeting to be held in \nPittsburgh will fulfil all our expectations.  \n In its capacity as African Union co-mediator, \ntogether with Libya, of the crisis between Chad and the \nSudan, the Republic of the Congo welcomes the \nwillingness, expressed by both parties at the African \nUnion summit, to relaunch negotiations based on the \nDoha Agreement of 3 May 2009. We also note with \nsatisfaction that the tripartite initiative aimed at a joint \nsettlement in the subregion, with the assistance of the \nUnited Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in the \nCentral African Republic, the General Secretariat of \nthe Economic Community of Central African States, \nthe Commission of the Central African Economic and \nMonetary Community and the General Secretariat of \nthe Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, should \nenable us to curb the insecurity on the borders of \nCameroon, the Central African Republic and Chad for \nthe long term.  \n We welcome the significant progress seen \nrecently in relations among the countries of the Great \nLakes region on our continent. The warming of \nrelations between the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo and Rwanda, the revitalization of the Economic \nCommunity of the Great Lakes Countries, and the \nnormalization of relations between Uganda and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo reflect the common \nwill of the Great Lakes countries to work to \nconsolidate peace.  \n With respect to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, we \nencourage any initiative to promote sustained dialogue \nbetween the parties in the quest for a definitive and \nequitable solution to the crisis. \n We welcome the unanimous adoption, on \n24 September 2009 at the historic Security Council \n \n \n9 09-52470 \n \nsummit (see S/PV.6191), of resolution 1887 (2009), \nwhich reflects the determination of the international \ncommunity to work towards disarmament and nuclear \nnon-proliferation for a safer world. \n In the light of these many challenges, we call for \nstrict compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty in all its aspects, including the right of all \ncountries to develop nuclear technologies for civilian \npurposes. \n The Congolese people renewed their confidence \nin me last July. That confidence is based on the concept \nthat we call the \u201cpath of the future\u201d. That path proposes \nopening the Congo to modernization and \nindustrialization, to the pursuit of peacebuilding, the \nstrengthening of democracy and the rule of law, to the \npromotion of good governance and to the protection of \nhuman rights. We have pledged to open a new path to \nthe future and to mark it with proper behaviour and \nclean technologies. We have pledged in my country to \nnever sit on our hands and watch the Earth suffer. That \nis a promise which I repeat here. \n Our African storytellers have often said that men \nwere the dream of the Earth. I solemnly promise that \nnot only will Africans do everything in their power to \nnever become its nightmare; they will, on the contrary, \nopen up a gateway to the future for all of us."

        "file_text": "I would like to extend \nto Mr. Ali Treki my sincere congratulations on his \nelection as President of the sixty-fourth session of the \nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. I would also \nlike to express my appreciation for the excellent work \ndone by his predecessor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann. I should also like to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral for his comprehensive report (A/64/1) on the \nwork of the Organization, as well as to congratulate \nhim on his initiative in convening the high-level \nClimate Change Summit. \n Since its independence, the Republic of Cyprus \nhas been committed to multilateral diplomacy and the \nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations. World \nstability and welfare have been threatened by the \nrecent global economic crisis. The crisis revealed the \nweaknesses of our collective oversight systems. It is \nonly through collective international action, and not \nthrough economic nationalism, that we can overcome \nsuch challenges. The same is true of action against \ndisease and poverty, as well as the prevention of \nfurther damage to the environment, which affects the \nlives of us all. \n The most important lesson to be learned from the \nfinancial crisis is that the economy cannot be seen in \nisolation from the needs of society. Despite the \nremarkable development of production forces that \ncould have secured decent living conditions for all, \npeople in many parts of the world are still deprived of \nbasic needs such as drinking water, health care and \naccess to education and work. The magnitude of the \nfinancial crisis shows that it is a crisis of the system \nand of its most extreme manifestation, namely, \nneo-liberalism and market lawlessness. In its present \nform, globalization is not the realization of the vision \nof philosophers and social revolutionaries for global \nbrotherhood and prosperity for all. That is because \nglobalization is driven by the pursuit of excessive \nprofits. As a result, the rich are becoming richer and \nthe poor poorer. \n More than half way to the 2015 deadline for the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals, the \nfinancial crisis is forcing States and institutions to \nreassess global priorities. The United Nations is the \nmost important international body able to tackle the \neffects of the global financial crisis and to act \ncollectively and effectively to prevent their most dire \nconsequences. \n The world today faces multiple challenges and \nthreats, including climate change, the depletion of \nresources, human rights abuses, the failure to protect \nvulnerable populations, increased regional and \ninter-State conflict, the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction and pandemics. From this rostrum, we \nhave heard the desperate voices of those who live on \nsmall-island States, the despairing appeal of young \npeople and the dramatic warnings of scientists about \nclimate change. If we do not take measures now, we \nface the risk of extinction. We join our voice and lend \nour support to the proposals for taking concrete action. \nWe must take measures now. Tomorrow will be too \nlate. The December meeting in Copenhagen must \nbecome a historic turning point in effectively \naddressing catastrophic climate change. \n Since its independence, the Republic of Cyprus \nhas relied on the principles of the United Nations in \nmaintaining its independence, its sovereignty and its \nterritorial integrity. After the dual crime of a military \ncoup and the foreign invasion of Cyprus in 1974, when \nmilitary forces attempted to obliterate our statehood \nand violated the integrity of our State, the United \nNations responded with a number of important \nresolutions that expressed the international \ncommunity\u2019s moral and legal support for the Republic \nof Cyprus. The plethora of Security Council and \nGeneral Assembly resolutions on Cyprus provided my \ncountry with the necessary support to continue its \nstruggle for a solution to its political problem on the \nbasis of those resolutions, the principles of the Charter \nof the United Nations and international law. \n Shortly after my election to office, I undertook \nthe initiative of bringing the stalemate to an end. As a \nresult of that, and on the basis of the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions and under the auspices of the good \noffices mission of the Secretary-General, a year ago we \nembarked upon intensive negotiations with the leader \nof the Turkish Cypriot community, Mr. Mehmet \nAli Talat.  \n Trusting in the sincerity of Mr. Talat\u2019s intentions, \nwe have engaged in a common effort to bring an end to \nthe division of our country. We agreed that the process \nwould be in the hands of Cypriots, without arbitration \nor artificial timetables. Some progress has been \nachieved in the negotiations, but not such as to make us \nconfident that we are close to a final solution to the \nCyprus problem. Our goal is the restoration of the \nsovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and \n \n \n09-52320 14 \n \nunity of the Republic of Cyprus, the common \nhomeland of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. It is \nalso our goal to restore the human rights and basic \nfreedoms of all citizens of the Republic of Cyprus, \nregardless of their ethnic background. \n We are committed to the evolution of the unitary \nState into a federal State consisting of two largely \nautonomous regions. One region will be administered \nby the Greek Cypriot community and the other by the \nTurkish Cypriot community. The fact that the \npopulation of Cyprus lived intermingled throughout the \nisland constituted for us a great historical concession \non the part of the late President Makarios to our \nTurkish Cypriot compatriots. We remain true to that \ncommitment. The united federal republic of Cyprus \nmust safeguard the unity of the State and its \ninstitutions, as well as of the economy and the people. \n Unfortunately, despite our common efforts, the \nTurkish Cypriot side, supported by Turkey, continues \nto present positions and proposals that take us outside \nthe framework of the United Nations resolutions on \nCyprus with regard to the termination of military \noccupation, the illegal possession of properties and the \npresence of settlers. Acceptance of those positions \nwould lead to acceptance of many consequences of the \noccupation and to violations of international \nconventions on human rights, basic freedoms and the \nprinciples on which federations are built. It is clear that \nsuch a solution would be neither viable nor functional \nand would not ensure the continuing unity of the State \nand the country. \n We sincerely hope that during the second round \nof negotiations, which has just started, the Turkish \npositions will be reconsidered so that we can, as soon \nas possible, reach an agreed solution that we can then \npresent to the people in separate simultaneous \nreferendums. That solution must be by the Cypriots for \nthe Cypriots. It is clear that we will not present to the \npeople a solution that originates from outside, nor can \nwe accept arbitration or pressure being exercised \nthrough artificial timetables.  \n Those preconditions were agreed with the \nSecretary-General, under whose auspices the \nnegotiations are taking place. I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank once again the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his good offices mission and for \nthe role of the United Nations as a facilitator in the \nnegotiating process. \n After the 1974 invasion and the occupation of \n30 per cent of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, \nTurkey has become a key player in the solution of the \nCyprus problem. The success of our efforts towards a \nsolution of the problem depends on Turkey\u2019s political \nwill and on the policies that it implements. It is not \nenough for the Turkish leadership to publicly state that \nit supports the negotiating process. \n Turkey should contribute in a practical way to a \nsolution that seeks a bizonal and bicommunal \nfederation with political equality, as defined in the \nrelevant Security Council resolutions. Instead, Turkey \npursues a confederal solution. A measure of goodwill \non the part of Turkey would have been the \nimplementation of Security Council resolution \n550 (1984), which stipulates the transfer of the \noccupied ghost town of Varosha to the administration \nof the United Nations and the return of its legal \ninhabitants to their homes and property. In addition, \nTurkey should proceed with normalizing its relations \nwith the Republic of Cyprus and with recognizing it, as \nstipulated in the decisions of the European Union. \n I ask if it is not a paradox for a country that is a \nmember of the Security Council not to recognize the \nRepublic of Cyprus, a State Member of the United \nNations, of the European Union and of all international \norganizations. Is it not a paradox for a member of the \nSecurity Council to keep occupation troops on the \nterritory of another United Nations Member State and a \nmember State of the European Union for 35 years? Is it \nnot a paradox to undermine the unity and the territorial \nintegrity of the Republic of Cyprus by promoting the \ncreation of a second State on the island in violation of \nSecurity Council resolution 541 (1983), which \nunanimously condemns the illegal unilateral \ndeclaration of independence, calling it null and void, \nand calls on all States to respect the sovereignty, \nindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic \nof Cyprus? \n Yes, it is a paradox, and it is also illegal. Cyprus \nhas never sought, nor wishes, to have hostile relations \nwith its neighbour, Turkey, but it is our responsibility \nto defend the independence, territorial integrity and \nsovereignty of our State. \n Nevertheless, before this body, I would like to \nexpress my readiness to initiate dialogue with the \nTurkish leadership, in parallel to our negotiations with \nTurkish Cypriot leader, and to share ideas on a future \n \n \n15 09-52320 \n \nthat would greatly enhance the possibility of a positive \noutcome to the negotiations. Cyprus has consistently \nsupported Turkey\u2019s accession to the European Union in \nthe belief that the entire adaptation process and \nTurkey\u2019s eventual membership would benefit our \nneighbours, our region and us. However, that support is \nnot unconditional. Turkey should fulfil its obligations \ntowards the Republic of Cyprus and towards the \nEuropean Union. \n I would like to state once again that our Turkish \nCypriot compatriots are equal citizens of the Republic \nof Cyprus and that I personally will consistently strive \nfor their rights and for finding their rightful place in all \norgans of the State. My political roots are in the \nprogressive people\u2019s movement of my country, which \nhas always stood by our Turkish Cypriot compatriots \nfor peace and harmonious coexistence.  \n Nevertheless, the rights of our Turkish Cypriot \ncompatriots cannot be implemented at the expense of \nthose of the larger community, which is the Greek \nCypriot one. There must be mutual respect. I want to \naffirm that I will spare no effort in order to achieve a \nbalanced and just solution that would restore the rights \nof the people as a whole.  \n We have all paid a heavy price \u2014 human, \npolitical and economic \u2014 and continue to do so. The \ngains of lasting peace will benefit the people of \nCyprus, of Turkey and of our region as a whole. True \npolitical leaders are not those who think of the next \nelection, but of the next generation. We have the \nresponsibility to work together to achieve a lasting \npeace in our region. \n I wish the family of the United Nations a \nsuccessful outcome to the deliberations of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, His \nExcellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of \nthe Republic, is unable to attend but has instructed me \nto convey to you his most heartfelt congratulations on \nyour election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. The head of State \nhas no doubt that your vast experience in the \nOrganization, broadened by your talents and your \nknowledge, will help you to overcome the myriad of \nchallenges that come with your new office. He \nexpresses his wish also for every success in your work \nat this regular session. \n Let me, as I begin my statement, commend your \npredecessor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, and \nexpress to him our gratitude for his excellent service as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession, which has just been completed, and this to the \nsatisfaction of all Member States.  \n Lastly, I pay well-deserved tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his commitment to the \nquest for peace and security worldwide, in general, and \nfor his very commendable involvement in restoring \n \n \n33 09-52598 \n \nlasting peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nmy country, in particular. \n At this time when the sixty-fourth regular session \nof the General Assembly is beginning, it is worth \ndwelling on the situation currently prevailing in certain \nregions of the planet. In the Middle East, the situation \ncontinues to be tenuous and to be the focus of attention \nof the global public. The Democratic Republic of the \nCongo recognizes the right of the people of Israel to \nlive in peace in a State with internationally recognized \nborders, just as it would like to reiterate that the \nsettlement of this conflict specifically entails \nrecognition of the fact that the Palestinian question is \nat the heart of the very problem in the Middle East.  \n The situations in Afghanistan and in Iraq continue \nto be of concern. The Democratic Republic of the \nCongo urges the international community to eradicate \nthe scourge of terrorism, so that those two countries \ncan fully return to their place on the international \nscene. \n In Africa, and speaking just about our own \ngeographic area in the central and southern portion of \nthe continent, we would like to refer to the healthy \nprogress made in the implementation of the agreements \nreached in 2006 between the Government of Burundi \nand the Forces Nationales de Lib\u00e9ration; the smooth \nevolution of the inclusive political dialogue in the \nCentral African Republic; the needed promotion of \ngood-neighbourly relations between Chad and the \nSudan; the admittedly slow but sure and determined \npromotion of democracy; and the consolidation of \npeace and stability in Southern Africa. \n I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely \nthank the South African facilitation, the Economic \nCommunity of Central African States, the Southern \nAfrican Development Community (SADC) and the \ninternational community, as well as other bilateral and \nmultilateral partners, for the efforts that they have \ncontinued to make to achieve the considerable progress \nthat we hail today.  \n With respect to the Republic of Madagascar, I \nwould particularly like to express my full satisfaction \nwith the mediation by the eminent SADC representative \nwith respect to the political dialogue. Here, I would \nlike to reiterate the SADC position, which rejects and \ncondemns any unilateral decision that would violate \nthe spirit of the Maputo agreements.  \n No social or economic order remains safe, if it \nfails to bring beneficial effects to the greatest number \nof people. The crisis of the global financial system \ncontinues to undermine global economies worldwide, \nbe they developed or developing. For my country, in \nparticular, this crisis has led to a significant drop in \nexport commodity prices, declining currency reserves, \nthe growing cost of imports, with a depreciation of the \nnational currency, declining growth rates and a decline \nin budget and tax revenues. \n The consequences of this turn of events are \nconsiderable. This crisis has led to a shortfall in \nresources to finance infrastructure. It has led to broad \njob loss, worsening of social conflict, and, particularly \nat a time when we are coming out of a complex \nconflict, a shrinking budget to finance the necessary \nrestoration of State authority throughout the national \nterritory in order to complete the establishment of \npeace. It is urgently necessary therefore to review the \ninternational financial system. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is aware \nthat we will need colossal resources to ensure \nsustainable development in a world context that has \nseen surging food and energy prices and a global \nfinancial crisis. These phenomena are compounded by \nthe effects of climate change. That is why I welcome \nthe holding by the Secretary-General on 22 September \n2009 of the high-level event on this issue. If we do not \nmake decisions on the fate of present and future \ngenerations with respect to global warming and climate \nchange and if we are not able to prevent rising sea \nlevels, desertification or the extinction of species and \nthe loss of biodiversity, inter alia, our world will \ninevitably move towards the risk of a disaster for \nwhich the African continent will be the first to bear the \ncosts.  \n The issue of adopting a post-Kyoto agreement \nthat would require polluter countries to reduce their \ngreenhouse gas emissions and financially compensate \nthose who have forests needs to be seriously considered. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo accounts \nfor more than half of the forests in the Congo basin, \nwhich is the second largest in the world after the \nAmazon region. This area has an enormous asset that it \nwill defend at the Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, scheduled for December 2009 in Copenhagen.  \n  \n \n09-52598 34 \n \n With respect to reform of the United Nations \nsystem, the Democratic Republic of the Congo agrees \nwith the view that the current United Nations system is \nno longer, in its current design, in keeping with the \nexpectations of those who promote it or even with the \nletter of Charter, which is its inspiration. That is why \nwe would like to reiterate our plea for the full \nrepresentation of Africa in the decision-making bodies, \nand more specifically in the Security Council.  \n Regardless of the outcome of the current \nnegotiations on this matter, my delegation continues to \nbe of the view that any viable reform of the Security \nCouncil must take into account the political and \nnumerical weight of Africa in the General Assembly, \nespecially since two thirds of the situations before the \nSecurity Council involve Africa.  \n With respect to the responsibility to protect, we \nbelieve that it is up to each State to protect its people \nfrom genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity or \nethnic cleansing. We are also of the view that the \nprincipal role of the international community in these \nareas should be to determine how to build institutional \ncapacities and provide substantial assistance to States, \nmore specifically to the Administrations of countries in \npost-conflict situations, so that they can acquire the \nmeans to ensure that they have the resources to provide \nthis protection.  \n I have very succinctly addressed the major \nchallenges that today\u2019s world faces and for which we \nneed to build a common response. I have talked about \nreform of the United Nations and about the \nresponsibility to protect. I have not addressed the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo or the troubled \nregion of the African Great Lakes. Three years after the \nsuccess of the electoral operations in 2006, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is now, at long last, \nfacing the trying process of normalizing democratic \nlife. We understand that restoring the rule of law is an \nurgent priority. \n In that context, peace and stability can only \npersist if the citizens realize that politically sensitive \nissues can be resolved by legitimate and fair means. \nThe rule of law cannot go hand in hand with \ncorruption. It is no exaggeration to assert that the \nefforts initiated recently by the President of the \nRepublic and the Government to fight corruption and \nto put an end to the rule of impunity have begun to \nbear fruit. However, we accept that much remains to be \ndone in terms of capacity-building to ensure proper \nadministration of justice. \n The Congolese experience of the 2006 \ndemocratic elections was built on a difficult legacy of \nthe dark years of foreign occupation followed by an \ninternal rift, the consequences of which are still seen \ntoday in the ongoing use of rape as a weapon of war. \nTo address that situation, at the request of the \nCongolese authorities, the first investigation of the \nInternational Criminal Court began by considering the \nserious crimes that had been committed on the territory \nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1 July \n2002. The rest is well known: the first three cases \nbefore the International Criminal Court are based on \nthat submission and the national courts have also been \ncalled upon to work on those issues. \n The Congolese courts currently involved are \ncertainly already playing an important role in restoring \nthe rule of law, but a successful transition from war to \npeace, from a divided past to a shared future, cannot be \nenvisaged for the people of the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo without a mechanism that can bring a sense \nof justice to all citizens, establish or renew civic trust, \nrestore the duty of memory and reconcile the people \nand the communities. \n The sexual violence perpetrated against women \nand girls in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo is, in our view, the most shameful and \ngravest crime witnessed by humankind in the twenty-\nfirst century. Statistically, 80 per cent of the crimes \ncommitted in the entire country took place mainly in \nthe two provinces in the East of the country most \naffected by the effects of war, namely South and North \nKivu. In fact, 60 per cent of the rapes were committed \nin North Kivu and 20 per cent in South Kivu. Justice \nmust be done to the women and girls who have been \nraped. \n I can already attest to the strong resolve of His \nExcellency President Joseph Kabila Kabange to put an \nend to impunity for the perpetrators of those heinous \ncrimes, whether civilian or military. Despite the \napocalyptic picture, the situation that persists in the \nEast of my country continues to improve. \n In conformity with the relevant provisions of the \nPact on Security, Stability and Development in the \nGreat Lakes Region, the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, working with Rwanda and Uganda respectively, \nlaunched joint military operations last year and early \n \n \n35 09-52598 \n \nthis year with a view to disarming and, where \nnecessary, forcing the rebels of the Lord\u2019s Resistance \nArmy, on the one hand, and those of the Forces \nd\u00e9mocratiques de lib\u00e9ration du Rwanda (FDLR), on the \nother, to return to their respective countries. As part of \nthe same military operations, called Kimia II, the \nForces arm\u00e9es de la R\u00e9publique d\u00e9mocratique du \nCongo (FARDC) are carrying out an offensive against \nthe elements of the FDLR that have remained in the \nmountains of South Kivu, in order to bring peace to \nthat region.  \n The results, I repeat, are positive. By way of \nillustration, the authority of the State has been restored; \nthe FDLR command posts in North and South Kivu \nhave been destroyed; more and more FDLR troops are \nsurrendering to the FARDC and to the United Nations \nObserver Mission in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo (MONUC); several FDLR elements have \nreturned to their country of origin; all the \ncommunication and supply lines in North and South \nKivu are now open; the fight against the illegal \nexploitation of natural resources and the protection of \nVirunga National Park have been strengthened; and the \nincidents of rape and all other forms of sexual violence \nagainst women have seen an appreciable decline.  \n Peace is gradually being established to the great \nbenefit of the Congolese people. Moreover, fruitful \ntalks aimed at benefiting our bilateral and multilateral \nrelations with Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda are under \nway, and the future looks better. \n The return to normalcy in our subregion is \nenabling us to make efforts towards the urgent \npeacebuilding and economic recovery of the country. \nAs the President of the Republic continues to \nunderscore, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has \nresolutely undertaken to strengthen and promote the \nideals of national reconciliation, peace, democracy and \ngood governance within its borders, and is \nunquestionably committed to a policy of openness \nwithout exclusion based on dialogue and cooperation \nof all kinds with all countries that favour peace and \ndialogue. Our wish today is to see the international \ncommunity step up its efforts and continue to support \nthe process of bringing about peace and unity. \n On the elections, my country is preparing to hold \ncity, municipal and local elections, which represents a \ngreat meeting of the people with its history. The steps \nto update the national register of the Independent \nElectoral Commission started in the first half of 2009.  \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is already \ninvolved in the reform of its institutions. It is important \nto conclude those various reforms, in particular in the \narea of the administration of justice. The Congolese \njustice system will be more effective and efficient if it \nhas the international community\u2019s support, especially \nin terms of capacity-building. \n Reform of the security system is also under way. \nThe reform of the army and police services has had the \nconsistent support of bilateral partners and of the \nUnited Nations through MONUC, its Mission in the \nCongo. My country is firmly committed to working to \nsuccessfully conclude that reform aimed at ensuring \nnot only its peace, unity, territorial integrity, national \nsovereignty and stability but also those of the entire \nsubregion by preventing the reoccurrence of the \nsecurity problems and tensions seen there. \n In addition, the Government is doing its utmost, \nthrough duly identified ways to increase prosperity, to \nimplement programmes in order to meet the basic \nneeds of the people, in particular on health, education, \nfood self-sufficiency, basic infrastructure, electricity \nand drinking water for all, not to mention, of course, \nthe fight against malaria and HIV/AIDS as well as \npoverty alleviation.  \n Like other post-conflict countries, the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo underscores the urgent need to \norganize and hold an international conference on the \nfinancing of its reconstruction as soon as possible. For \nus, it is a question of building a new Congo, a nation \nopening up to the world at the centre of a continent full \nof change, a country where every foreigner, \nindiscriminately, can be free, assured of the protection \nof his investments, to work for his better future. All \nthat foreigners do to contribute to our development will \nbe duly acknowledged and appreciated. \n Emerging from a long war with many outside \nimplications, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nmy country, is fully aware of the importance of \nregional cooperation. The most fervent wish of the \nCongolese people is to restore relations of trust and \ncooperation with all its neighbours, without exception. \nThe Government intends to pursue a policy of \ndialogue, openness, friendship, cooperation and good-\nneighbourliness, because the country has always \nstrived to work to bring about a more united Africa that \n  \n \n09-52598 36 \n \nstands together, distinct in its greater understanding, \ntolerance, peace and solidarity.  \n By way of conclusion, allow me to reiterate that \nso much war and fratricidal violence has taught us that \nthe most expensive peace is still less onerous than the \ncheapest war. In this regard, I appeal for international \nsolidarity during this stage of building our hard-won \npeace, for a peaceful and stable Democratic Republic \nof the Congo is an asset to our planet\u2019s common \ndestiny. \n I would be remiss if I did not conclude my \nstatement without thanking once again all those whose \ncommitment, courage and determination have helped \nand continue to help my country embrace the concepts \nof negotiation and peaceful settlement of crisis by \ncasting aside war and the use of force."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I \nwish to congratulate you on your election as the head \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and \nto assure you that the delegation of the Republic of San \nMarino will do its utmost in collaborating with you \nthroughout the session. \n In my first speech before this Assembly as \nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of San \nMarino, I would like to express my most sincere thanks \nto the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, for guiding this Organization with great \nenergy and extraordinary dedication. I wish to mention \nhis admirable commitment in the area of reform and \nhis constant and important involvement in world \naffairs. \n The United Nations reform process is fundamental \nto ensuring future world stability and must remain a \npriority in our efforts, not only because we have the \nduty to guarantee that the Organization and all its \nactivities are fully effective, but in particular in order \nto preserve its primary and essential value. We cannot \nafford to witness a decentralization of the substantial \nrole of the United Nations caused by the impossibility \nof reaching agreement on measures to be implemented \nfor the improvement of its functioning.  \n Moreover, I would like to express the \nappreciation of San Marino for the work accomplished \nin the General Assembly with the contribution of all \nStates Members of the United Nations, as well as for \nthe attention paid to particularly relevant issues, such \nas the world economic and financial crisis, climate \nchange and the global food crisis. \n The Republic of San Marino supports the process \nof the revitalization of the General Assembly. That \nprocess is a political reform necessary to reaffirm the \nAssembly\u2019s role as the most representative body of the \nUnited Nations, as well as the role and leadership of its \nPresident. San Marino believes that the reform should \nmake the activities of the General Assembly more \nefficient and effective, improve its relations with the \nother main United Nations bodies to avoid duplication \nof work and aim at the effective implementation of its \nresolutions. \n The Security Council reform process, which the \nRepublic of San Marino has been following with \ncommitment and interest since the beginning, is also \nvery important. We are grateful to the Afghan Chair for \nthe important activity carried out and for the way in \nwhich it has presided over the intergovernmental \nnegotiations aimed at reaching the widest possible \npolitical agreement on Security Council reforms. \n San Marino believes that the aims of the reform \nshould be to make the Security Council more \ndemocratic, transparent, efficient, accountable and \n  \n \n09-52598 2 \n \nrepresentative, to restore the balance between the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, and to \nenhance its cooperation with the Secretariat. It is \nimportant that this process allow for the development \nof a sense of belonging to the Security Council among \nall Member States, thus avoiding the risk that it could \nbe perceived as an isolated body within the United \nNations. Moreover, the reform should take into \nconsideration the legitimate interest of all States, big \nand small, in being elected to the Security Council. \n San Marino participates with commitment and \ninterest in the intergovernmental negotiations on the \nreform of the Security Council and regrets that, to date, \nno reasonable compromise has been reached to make it \nmore representative, democratic and possibly less \nparalyzed by cross-vetoes concerning fundamental \nissues. \n Mr. Acharya (Nepal), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n The reforms of the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council are encompassed in a wider process \nof transformation and strengthening of the role of the \nUnited Nations within the global governance system. \nSan Marino believes that the United Nations plays and \nmust continue to play a pivotal role in managing the \nglobal governance system and that the United Nations \nreform process must be aimed at reaching this \nobjective. \n Today\u2019s world is characterized by marked \ndifferences in terms of power, wealth, income and \nsocial well-being among nations and peoples, and \nwithin individual nations. Unfortunately, the world is \nbeset by numerous ethnic and interreligious conflicts, \nwhich are sometimes fuelled by economic and \ngeopolitical factors originating outside the area of the \nconflict. Moreover, global warming, which is also a \nconsequence of indiscriminate energy consumption in \ndeveloped and developing countries, is one of the \nmajor causes of disasters and is leading, inter alia, to a \nreduction in agricultural yields in tropical and \nsubtropical countries. Furthermore, this year in \nparticular the world economy has undergone one of the \nmost devastating financial crises in history, whose \nconsequences are clear to everyone. \n These challenges can be faced only through \nglobal and coordinated action, and the United Nations \nhas the responsibility and the duty to be at the centre of \nthis process. Only by tapping into the rich and varied \ncultures and traditions represented by the United \nNations is it possible to manage the global governance \nsystem in such a way as to achieve sustainable human \ndevelopment. That the United Nations might relinquish \nits role as leader of the global governance system in \nfavour of other bodies would be a defeat for all. \n Unfortunately, the widespread poverty that affects \nsuch a large percentage of the global population, \ncausing hunger, disease and underdevelopment, is one \nof the most endemic problems faced by States. Despite \nthe efforts made and the commitments undertaken at a \nglobal level, poverty continues to plague the whole \nplanet. \n San Marino values the efforts and success of the \nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) over the last \n60 years and is proud to host Jacques Diouf, FAO \nDirector-General, as the official speaker at the \ninvestiture ceremony of the new Captains-Regent, the \nheads of State of the Republic of San Marino, which \nwill take place on 1 October 2009. \n San Marino endorses the Millennium Development \nGoals \u2014 which have unfortunately become more \ndifficult to achieve because of the crisis we are \ncurrently facing \u2014 and believes we must continue in \nour commitment. \n The strengthening of multilateralism \u2014 included \nby the Assembly President in the theme proposed for \nthis general debate, namely \u201cEffective responses to \nglobal crises: strengthening multilateralism and \ndialogue among civilizations for international peace, \nsecurity and development\u201d \u2014 is, in my opinion, a \ncentral element. In fact, international organizations, \nand the United Nations in the first instance, promote \nthe affirmation of democracy, rule of law, freedoms \nand human rights as a condition for economic and \nsocial development, cultural growth and education. \n The current world economic and financial crisis \nis the greatest global disaster since the very birth of the \nUnited Nations, all the more so because it has added to \na severe food crisis that has affected many regions of \nthe world. As this crisis concerns all countries and \nregions indiscriminately, it is now one of the major \nchallenges our Organization has to face. \n The Republic of San Marino, as a small State, \nattaches great importance to the role of the General \nAssembly in the lives of our nations. It has welcomed \nthe high-level Conference on the World Financial and \n \n \n3 09-52598 \n \nEconomic Crisis and has supported its outcome \ndocument (resolution 63/303, annex), which is the \nresult of long and complex negotiations. However, I \nnote with regret that the uncertainty in the preparation \nof the Conference and the difficulties encountered in \ndrafting the final document discouraged the \nparticipation of many world leaders, whose presence \ncould have made that United Nations conference an \nhistoric event. \n The task of the United Nations is to find, through \ncoordinated and global action, the right methods to \nmitigate the impact of the crisis and to achieve \nsustainable economic growth and development, taking \ninto account the negative effects of the crisis on the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. \n Climate change has become a central issue on the \nUnited Nations agenda in the last three years, thanks to \nthe commitment and efforts undertaken by the \nSecretary-General in this regard. Climate change, \nwhich in the 1990s was already among the main \nenvironmental concerns, has now become an absolute \npriority on the political agenda of all States, including \nthe smallest ones like our Republic. The deep changes \ncaused by human intervention in the energy dynamics \nof the climate system are indeed the elements of this \nconcern for the present and immediate future. \nTherefore, urgent and significant changes in social and \neconomic development patterns cannot be further \npostponed. \n San Marino has recently submitted its first \nnational communication in accordance with the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \nThat communication represents the beginning of a \nprocess, first of all of a social and cultural nature, \naimed at making all citizens of our country aware of \nthe need to face climate changes and effectively \ncommit to reducing as much as possible the impact of \nthese changes. \n Among the most serious challenges we have to \nface at national and international levels, terrorism in all \nits forms and manifestations is of primary importance. \nThe Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the \nGeneral Assembly in 2006 represents a fundamental \ninitiative, because for the first time all Member States \nagreed to a common strategic and operational approach \nto counter terrorism. Such a strategy laid the \nfoundations for a coordinated response to this \nemergency by envisaging preventive measures and the \nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations in the \nfight against terrorism. It also recognizes that counter-\nterrorism measures and the protection of human rights \nare not conflicting goals; on the contrary, they are \ncomplementary and mutually reinforcing. \n However, an effective response to terrorism must \nalso be based on education in order to foster \nunderstanding and respect for each other as a sine qua \nnon condition for achieving justice and peace. Indeed, \nhatred, lack of understanding and injustice provide \nbreeding grounds for terrorist groups and organizations \nto recruit new members. \n My country focuses great attention, both at the \nnational and international levels, to the promotion and \nprotection of human rights, with special attention paid \nto those of the weakest and most vulnerable groups. I \nam pleased to recall that this year we celebrate the \ntwentieth anniversary of the adoption of the United \nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a \nfundamental instrument that has been ratified by a \nlarge number of States. However, we must not forget \nthat still today 9.2 million children under the age of \nfive die every year from largely preventable causes and \nmore than 100 million school-age children do not have \naccess to education. Furthermore, many children are \nrobbed of their childhood, are victims of sexual \nviolence, are used by armies or armed groups as \nsoldiers or sold as sexual slaves. \n San Marino applauds and supports the United \nNations and UNICEF for the efforts undertaken \nworldwide in order to improve the life of these \nchildren. We also actively endorse the United Nations \ncommitment to women\u2019s rights. \n Finally, the protection of human rights is strictly \nconnected to the need to guarantee every human being \nand every population the possibility of living in peace \nand justice. It is therefore necessary to give new \nmomentum to the disarmament process. An important \nstep was taken last year in this regard by adopting the \nConvention on Cluster Munitions, an instrument that \nwill prove essential to protecting affected populations \nfrom those weapons, which have devastating effects on \ncivilians. The Republic of San Marino attaches great \nimportance to this Convention, which is focused on \nhuman dignity and the interests of victims, and hopes \nthat it will promptly enter into force. We therefore call \nupon the States that have not yet ratified it to do so as \nsoon as possible."

        "file_text": "On behalf of Her \nExcellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \nHellenic Republic, Ms. Dora Bakoyannis, who \nunfortunately could not be in New York today, I would \nlike to address the General Assembly. \n Allow me first to congratulate the President of \nthis body, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki. I am confident \nthat his extensive prior experience will serve us well \nand guide us through the trials that we are called upon \nto address. I would also like to pay tribute to \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for his tireless efforts \nto promote the work of the General Assembly during \nits sixty-third session. \n I cannot but take pride in addressing the General \nAssembly of the most important ecumenical institution \nhumankind has ever created, the original idea of which \nwas initially conceived and put into practice by Greeks \n25 centuries ago. The ancient Greek Amphictyony was \nthe precursor and matrix of the concept of \nmultilateralism, which is the only way to deal \neffectively with the many and varied challenges faced \nby the international community. The United Nations is \nin fact, along with the various regional alliances and \norganizations, the essential framework for joining \nforces and collectively confronting our common threats \nand promoting our common values. \n Greece currently has the privilege of being at the \nhelm of one of the most important regional security \norganizations, the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE\u2019s \nconsensus-based decision-making process, along with \nits comprehensive approach to security, is a testament \nto the power of multilateralism. Greece has pledged to \nbe an honest broker and to work with every single \nparticipating State to realize the common vision for \npeace, security and development for all 56 members of \nthe organization. The Corfu Process, our common \npromise to turn the page on European security within \nthe framework of a structured all-inclusive dialogue, \nproves once more that where there is a will there is a \nway. \n Indeed, our annual gathering at the United \nNations is important, but it is not enough. What is \nneeded first and foremost is the political will to turn \nwords into deeds. We stand at a most critical juncture \n \n \n27 09-53165 \n \nfor our environmental, social and economic future, and \nall of us \u2014 policy-makers, diplomats, scientists, \nactivists and concerned citizens alike \u2014 have a \nresponsibility to preserve the habitability of our planet \nand hand over to our children a better world than the \none bequeathed to us. \n It was Aristotle who said that nature acts as if she \nforesees the future, and currently nature\u2019s auguries are \nnot encouraging at all. We cannot afford to forget that \nour planet is in a state of environmental emergency. \nScientific evidence on the issue is compelling. The \nsocio-economic impact of climate change on the global \neconomy, if left unchecked, is likely to dwarf the \ncurrent economic recession.  \n Now is the time to speed up our joint efforts to \neffectively address the negative impact of climate \nchange, while respecting the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities and the respective \ncapabilities of each country. Copenhagen will be the \nlitmus test of our commitment to an ambitious, all-\ninclusive climate change agreement. \n The urgency of the situation is such that, if I may \nparaphrase the man who first set foot on the moon, \neven if man now takes a giant leap in trying to mitigate \nthe consequences of climate change, it will \nunfortunately still only be a small step for mankind. \nBut small steps are important too. Greece continues to \nstrongly support the financing of climate change \nadaptation and mitigation projects and of low-carbon \ndevelopment strategies. We have repeatedly proven our \ncommitment to this effect by supporting the most \nvulnerable countries\u2019 adaptation to climate change \nthrough the provision of a total sum of \u20ac21 million \nthrough the end of 2011. \n The challenges posed to all nations by the current \neconomic crisis require an ambitious and imaginative \nrange of responses that provide effective and lasting \nsolutions. The United Nations can play a vital role in \nachieving these objectives. Our commitment to the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) needs to be \nreaffirmed. Regenerating the world economy and \npromoting sustainable pro-growth policies are \nfundamental to solving the crisis and essential to \nmaintaining and improving progress towards the \nachievement of the MDGs. Support for the most \nvulnerable nations, which have been even more deeply \naffected by food insecurity and climate change, is \nwhere a special effort must be made. \n Our action against hunger and want has not yet \nproduced the desired results, while humanitarian and \ndevelopment aid needs to be streamlined in order to be \nmore effective and productive. Synergetic multilateral \naction is urgently needed. People living on the edge \nhave run out of time. They need to know whether the \ndecisions of their leaders at the Pittsburgh summit are \nthe right decisions that will put us back on the road to \ndevelopment. \n We know that climate change, the economic crisis \nand the North-South divide are exacerbating pressures \non people to migrate. These crises are creating living \nconditions that contribute to one of the greatest \ndisgraces of humanity and one of the greatest insults to \nhuman dignity \u2014 the modern slave trade or human \ntrafficking.  \n Some 192 million people have been forced from \nthe lands of their birth. Almost a million people have \nbeen arrested since 2000 while trying to cross from \nTurkey to Greece in their quest for a better life. This \nmodern form of the slave trade has claimed thousands \nof lives. We owe it to them and to the people who have \nlost their lives to change things, to fight traffickers and \nwork together to discourage illegal migration by \nbringing development and giving a vision to countries \nthat migrants leave.  \n Athens will host the Global Forum on Migration \nand Development from 2 to 5 November 2009. We seek \nspecific proposals for actions and policies and we want \nto formulate best practices for adoption by the \nparticipating States. \n Terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to \ninternational peace, stability and security. The \ninternational commitment to confronting terrorism \nmust remain strong, and our efforts to successfully \naddress this challenge should be intensified. But if our \nefforts are to be successful and self-sustaining, they \nmust garner the broadest possible consensus and \nacceptance and be based on respect for the fundamental \nprinciples of international law and international \nhumanitarian law and on full respect for and the \nprotection of human rights. \n This brings me to an issue that has come to the \nforefront of international attention and concern \u2014 the \nissue of human rights. Respect for human rights is one \nof the cornerstones of the contemporary legal order. \nHuman rights conventions and institutions have raised \nthe awareness and sensitivity of States, Governments, \n \n \n09-53165 28 \n \ncivil society, international organizations and \nnon-governmental organizations. \n Greece has submitted its candidacy for a seat on \nthe United Nations Human Rights Council for the \nperiod 2012-2015, as it wishes to play a proactive role \nin the protection of human rights. We believe that the \nCouncil can play a crucial role in the improvement of \nthe situation of human rights worldwide. That role \nshould not be restricted to pointing out the violators, \nbut should mainly help overcome shortfalls and \nimplement universal standards. \n Interest in the protection of human rights must be \ngenuine and anthropocentric, and protection must be \ncarried out in full compliance with the fundamental \nprinciples of international law and the Charter of the \nUnited Nations.  \n We should award a special place to gender issues \nin the system of human rights protection. Women\u2019s \nrights deserve all our attention, because they continue \nto be violated systematically and flagrantly in many \ncorners of the world. Education and equal working \nopportunities are key areas. \n As I said earlier, Greece approached its current \nterm in office as OSCE Chair with a heightened sense \nof responsibility and sensitivity, based on the belief \nthat security and stability are not and should not be a \nzero-sum game. In the post-cold-war era, where \nsecurity challenges are multifaceted and interlinked, \nthe security needs of all States should be given due \nconsideration despite contradictory and often mutually \nexclusive political perceptions of what is right and just. \n Since January, our aim has been to build \nconsensus and achieve collective and comprehensive \nsolutions to deep-rooted and protracted conflicts, \nconvinced that enhancing the security of one will \nundoubtedly enhance the security of all. Our efforts \nhave been based on mutual trust and confidence and on \nthe realization that security is both indivisible and \ncomprehensive. In some cases however, as in Georgia, \nconsensus has been elusive. \n Our most important collective achievement has \nbeen the launching of the Corfu Process, a profound \nand open debate on the future of security in Europe. \nThe Corfu Process marks a pan-European effort to \nrevisit and redefine the broader European security \nsystem. At the Athens Ministerial Meeting in \nDecember, we aim to lay a solid foundation, so that our \ndialogue will start producing tangible results. \n A few days ago the Security Council adopted \nresolution 1887 (2009), thus taking an important step \nin the direction of advancing nuclear disarmament and \nnon-proliferation. We applaud that important decision. \nYet, practical tools are essential for the achievement of \nhigh-minded political goals such as this. Greece firmly \nbelieves that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons remains the cornerstone of the \nnuclear non-proliferation regime. Broad participation \nin it, along with the conclusion of comprehensive \nsafeguards agreements and the implementation of the \nadditional protocol, is, beyond any doubt, the most \neffective answer to threats of nuclear proliferation. It is \nequally important to have additional ratifications of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the early drafting \nof a fissile material cut-off treaty. \n As regards major international and regional \nissues, conflicts and flashpoints, Greece fully \nsubscribes to the European Union (EU) policy and \naction, as described by its presidency. The role of the \nEU in the handling of a number of urgent and difficult \nsituations, such as piracy in Somalia, has proved to be \nvital, successful and effective. \n The broader region of South-Eastern Europe and \nthe Eastern Mediterranean is at the forefront of Greek \nforeign policy. It is a vital region from a geopolitical \nand geo-strategic perspective, but also one of the most \nvolatile areas of the world. Our vision for the region \nincorporates the consolidation of security, stability and \ndevelopment. Our aim is to work with all neighbouring \nStates in the region to promote stability, democracy \nand robust economies, with the ultimate goal of \nelevating the quality of life of the citizens to the \nhighest European standards. This vision is founded on \nfour pillars: first, the establishment and safeguarding \nof good neighbourly relations; secondly, the full \nintegration of all the countries of South-Eastern Europe \ninto European and Euro-Atlantic structures; thirdly, the \nenhancement and further deepening of regional \ncooperation in the fields of infrastructure, economy \nand trade; and, last but not least, the strengthening of \nbonds and cultural interaction at the level of civil \nsocieties. We are doing everything in our power to \nmaterialize this vision. \n We continue to build upon the agenda of the \nThessaloniki European Council of 2003, which laid the \n \n \n29 09-53165 \n \nfoundations for the integration of the Western Balkan \ncountries into the European Union, on the condition, of \ncourse, that the accession criteria and requirements are \nfully met. The prospect of a future within Europe for \nalmost all the Western Balkan countries is now within \nreach and seems more feasible than ever. \n At the same time, Greece is promoting regional \ncooperation by financing of and participating in \nsignificant infrastructure projects, and by joining \nforces with other neighbouring countries to establish a \nreliable and adequate energy-distribution network. It is \none of the top investment and trade partners in most of \nthe neighbouring countries, thus contributing to the \ndevelopment of the entire area. \n Above all, we are working hard to establish and \nconsolidate good neighbourly relations by pursuing and \npromoting the peaceful settlement of disputes on the \nbasis of international law. However, long-standing \ndisputes persist. For the past 15 years Greece has \nparticipated in United Nations-led negotiations on the \nissue of the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia. Greece has participated in good faith. \nRegrettably, no substantive or tangible progress has \nbeen made so far, despite the fact that Greece has taken \na huge step towards a compromise. We have accepted \nthe use of the term \u201cMacedonia\u201d along with a \ngeographical qualifier that reflects reality. Of the large \ngeographical region of Macedonia, only a part falls \nwithin our neighbour\u2019s territory. So how can this \ncountry claim exclusive rights to the name? The \npersistence of the leadership in Skopje in claiming \nexclusive rights to the name by denying a geographic \nqualifier and the anachronistic rhetoric and policies \nthat run contrary to the principle of good neighbourly \nrelations raise serious questions as to that \nGovernment\u2019s real motives. Greece is negotiating for a \nsolution that will respect the dignity of both countries \nand both peoples. We are negotiating for a clear \nsolution to which both sides will agree and which our \nneighbour will use with pride in its dealings with \neveryone \u2014 a solution that will make everyone a \nwinner. \n The Cyprus issue is still an open wound at the \nvery heart of Europe. Thanks to the efforts of President \nChristofias, a new round of talks has started under the \nauspices of the United Nations. This gives rise to hope, \nbut there is still a long way to go, and there are many \nhurdles and difficulties to overcome. Greece supports a \ndefinitive, sustainable and just solution, based on the \nUnited Nations resolutions and compatible with \nEuropean Union values, principles and institutional \nframework, one that will lead to the reunification of the \nisland. We strongly believe that the two communities \nshould be left alone, with no external pressures, \nguidance or interventions, to decide on their common \nfuture. The solution must be theirs and theirs alone. \nArtificial deadlines, strict time frames and threats of a \npermanent division have no role in the quest for a \ndurable solution. They add unnecessary pressure and \nstrain to the delicate negotiating process and raise \nquestions about the true intentions of those promoting \nthem. \n The current situation in Cyprus is unacceptable. \nTurkish military forces continue to occupy part of the \nterritory of a European Union member State. Turkey \u2014 \na European Union candidate \u2014 refuses to recognize a \nfully fledged European Union member and future \npartner. Once-vibrant cities like Famagusta remain \nghost towns. The families of missing persons continue \nto wonder about their loved ones\u2019 fates, while the \nunspeakable atrocities of the past come to light, little \nby little. This picture is unimaginable in the eyes of the \naverage European citizen and completely incompatible \nwith today\u2019s European reality. We hope that the Cypriot \npeople \u2014 both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots \u2014 \nwill be able to leave behind the painful past and look, \nreunited, to the future that awaits them within the \nEuropean family, which constitutes the best guarantee \nfor their security and prosperity. Turkey, which holds \nthe key to the solution of the Cyprus issue, knows full \nwell that such a solution would also speed up its own \njourney to the European Union. \n Greece is probably the most sincere supporter of \nTurkey\u2019 s accession to the European Union \u2014 and this \nis true even at a difficult time. It is our conviction that \nTurkey would be a better neighbour for Greece if it \ncarried out all necessary reforms and became a \nEuropean Union member State. Turkish membership \nwould contribute to stability in our region. Yet, this is \nnot a blank check, nor is it a leap of faith. In order to \nbecome a member of the European Union, Turkey will \nhave to fulfil all the criteria set by the European Union. \n The Government I represent has invested in \nGreek-Turkish rapprochement. Kostas Karamanlis is \nthe first Greek Prime Minister to have paid an official \nvisit to Ankara in 40 years. We dared to turn the page. \nWe went beyond words, but we have not seen an active \nresponse from the other side. Turkey declares that it \n \n \n09-53165 30 \n \nwants zero problems with its neighbours. Yet, Turkish \nfighter jets kept flying only a few metres above the \nrooftops of Greek islanders\u2019 homes throughout the \nsummer. The Turkish Parliament maintains a threat of \nwar against my country. \n Disputes should be settled peacefully and in \naccordance with international law. The United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea, which embodies \ncustomary law, shows the way to settle maritime \nboundary disputes peacefully. Greece would welcome a \ndecision by Turkey to follow the example of the other \n160 Members of the United Nations that have ratified \nthe Convention. Such a move, along with clear \npolitical will on the Turkish side to invest in friendly \nrelations with Greece, could strike a definitive blow to \nthe tensions and mistrust in our bilateral relations and \ncontribute to the promotion of peace and stability in \nour entire region. \n Aristotle proposed that it is possible to fail in \nmany ways, while to succeed is possible in only one \nway. It is our conviction that this one way is effective \nmultilateralism led by the United Nations. We need the \nleadership of the United Nations, if we are to carry out \nour ultimate mission \u2014 safeguarding the dignity, lives \nand freedoms of the citizens we represent. We need to \ngive the Secretary-General the tools to guide this \nOrganization, so that the United Nations can once \nagain take up its central role in international life and \nmeet the myriad challenges facing humanity. We have \nto identify the weaknesses of the United Nations and \nwe must have the courage to redress them, using \ncommon sense, just as we would do at home, in our \ncountries, because every failure of the United Nations \nis a personal failure for each and every one of us, and \nbecause the world is changing, and we have to change \nwith it."

        "file_text": "I would like to \njoin previous speakers in congratulating His \nExcellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of Libya on his \nelection to the post of President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. I wish him every \nsuccess. I should also like to thank his predecessor, \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for his work. I would \nlike to express my profound respect and appreciation to \nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, for his leadership in mobilizing the \ninternational community to make our world a better \nplace to live. \n We all recognize that the security of every State \nof the world can be better promoted and ensured with a \nmultilateral security system. That paradigm was a \nprincipal reason behind the creation of the collective \nsecurity system that has the United Nations at its core. \nYet, after more than 60 years since the founding of the \nUnited Nations, the question remains of whether the \ncontemporary international security architecture is \naddressing effectively and in a timely manner the \nmultifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats \nconfronting our world today.  \n The global character of today\u2019s challenges and \nthreats makes geographic distance irrelevant when it \ncomes to the formulation of security policy, as threats \nas we know them today transcend national borders and \nentire continents. The indirect repercussions of these \nthreats may be as devastating and as costly as their \ndirect impact. The interconnected and intertwined \nnature of current threats requires that we reconsider the \nvery concept of security in broader terms that are not \nconfined to the traditional military aspect of security, \nbut also include its political, economic, energy, \ncultural, information and other dimensions. \n The security of each State and, more broadly, \ninternational peace and security will depend upon \nwhether States follow the norms and principles of \ninternational law and use them as a guiding tool for \nshaping their foreign and security policies. Following a \ncommon set of norms and rules on the international \narena contributes to the transparency and predictability \nof State behaviour and hence consolidates international \npeace and security. \n Unfortunately, the unlawful use of force has still \nnot been eliminated from international relations. \nCivilian populations are still suffering today in many \nplaces around the world due to the manifest failure of \nindividual States to fulfil their most basic and \ncompelling responsibilities. Armed conflict, military \naggression and foreign occupation involving the most \nserious international crimes are but a few vivid \nexamples from our recent history of the bitter \nconsequences of non-compliance by individual States \nwith the norms and principles of international law. \nGovernments that fail to obey the rules of international \nconduct will inevitably infringe upon individual \nliberties and freedoms at home, thus undermining \ndemocratic development. \n The most vivid example of misconduct when it \ncomes to the norms and principles of international law \nis the almost two-decades-long, and still unresolved, \nArmenia-Azerbaijan Nagorny-Karabakh conflict, \nwhich also stands out as a major threat to international \nand regional peace and security. As a result of the \naggression carried out by Armenia, almost one-fifth of \nthe territory of Azerbaijan has been occupied, \napproximately 1 million ethnically cleansed \nAzerbaijanis have become internally displaced persons \nor refugees and thousands of Azerbaijan\u2019s historical \nand cultural heritage artifacts have been destroyed or \nlooted.  \n In its four resolutions on the conflict, the Security \nCouncil has reaffirmed the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of Azerbaijan and the inadmissibility of the \nuse of force to acquire the territory of the other States. \nIt has also recognized Nagorny-Karabakh as a part of \nAzerbaijan and called for an immediate, complete and \nunconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from \nall occupied territories of Azerbaijan. The General \nAssembly \u2014 in resolution 62/243, which was adopted \n \n \n61 09-52470 \n \non 14 March 2008 and which is entitled \u201cThe situation \nin the occupied territories of Azerbaijan\u201d \u2014 expressed \nrespect and support for the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of Azerbaijan within its internationally \nrecognized borders. \n As reflected in those resolutions, the approach of \nthe General Assembly and the Security Council is fully \nconsistent with the position of Azerbaijan, which from \nthe beginning advocated a step-by-step approach to \nsettling the conflict as the only viable option. A number \nof important steps have to be taken, starting with the \nwithdrawal of Armenian forces from all the occupied \nterritories, the rehabilitation of those territories, the \nreturn of internally displaced persons to their homes in \nand around the Nagorny-Karabakh region and the \nopening of all communications channels for mutual \nuse. That will make it possible to eliminate the \nconsequences of the conflict, and will pave the way for \nthe establishment of a durable peace and stability in the \nregion that is conducive to the establishment of the \nlegal status of the Nagorny-Karabakh region within \nAzerbaijan, with due account taken of, and an equal \nhearing for, the voices of the Azerbaijani and Armenian \ncommunities of the region. \n The current settlement process offers some hope \nof breaking the stalemate in the process of resolution \nof the conflict. The acceptance by Armenia of the step-\nby-step approach to a settlement to the conflict on the \nbasis of the principles and norms of international law \nand the decisions and documents adopted in that \nframework, as reflected in the joint declaration signed \nin Moscow in November 2008 by the Presidents of \nAzerbaijan, Armenia and the Russian Federation, is a \npositive sign. Azerbaijan is ready to continue talks with \nArmenia\u2019s leadership for a secure and stable South \nCaucasus region and beyond, which will make it \npossible to take advantage of the existing ample \nregional opportunities for the benefit of all. \n Against the background of the negative \ndevelopments in the region to which I have referred, let \nme briefly share some information about the positive \neconomic performance of my country.  \n Azerbaijan has minimized the impact of the \nglobal economic downturn on its economy and \nmanaged to sustain growth. Having maintained its \ndynamism in 2009, as of today our gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth stands at almost 4 per cent. We \nhave recorded a drop in the poverty rate since 2003, \nfrom 44 per cent to 13 per cent. The Government of \nAzerbaijan has substantially improved trade and \ninvestment conditions in an effort to strengthen \nnational competitiveness and spur private-sector \ndevelopment, especially in the non-oil sector. Non-oil \nGDP growth is at almost 16 per cent, the highest rate in \n5 years. In recognition of its results-oriented reforms \nand thought-out economic policy, Azerbaijan was \nqualified by the World Bank as one of the world\u2019s top \nreformers. \n Azerbaijan \u2014 a strategically located country with \na young and skilled population, great resources and a \ndynamic economy \u2014 is inevitably taking a leading role \nin the region and increasingly becoming a pivotal \nplayer and credible actor beyond the region. The \nsuccessful implementation of such infrastructure \nprojects as the Baku-Supsa and Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan \noil-exporting pipelines and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum \ngas pipeline have not only boosted our economy, they \nhave also contributed to the development of \nneighbouring States. A modern energy infrastructure \ncoupled with vast energy resources have transformed \nAzerbaijan into an energy hub of international \nimportance. Azerbaijan has proven itself a reliable \npartner and an indispensable and secure energy source \nfor Europe and beyond. \n Azerbaijan\u2019s location at the crossroads of major \nEast-West and North-South transport corridors and its \nrapidly developing national transportation \ninfrastructure, which is connected to regional highway \nand railroad networks, highlights the strategic \nimportance of my country. The completion of the \nconstruction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad and the \ncommissioning of the brand new seaport at Alat, on \nAzerbaijan\u2019s coast on the Caspian Sea, will increase \nthe role of Azerbaijan as a communications hub linking \nEurope with Asia. \n Azerbaijan has also put forward an initiative to \nestablish a Trans-Eurasian information superhighway, \nwhich is expected to serve as a major element of the \nEast-West transport corridor and facilitate the \nprovision of Internet service, telecommunications \nsystems, e-information resources and e-economies to \n20 countries of the region. \n Today we are living at a time of heightened \nreligious and ethnic awareness, which in certain \ninstances has taken exaggerated forms and is \nsometimes maliciously exploited to fuel conflicts on \n  \n \n09-52470 62 \n \nethnic, religious or cultural grounds. The broad \nrecognition by the Member States of the United \nNations of the role of the dialogue among civilizations, \nand specifically of inter-cultural and inter-religious \nharmony in maintaining international peace and \nsecurity, can only be praised. \n We fully support the recommendations of the \nSecretary-General on the importance of increasing \neducational efforts to eliminate hate messages, \ndistortion, prejudice and negative bias from textbooks \nand other educational media and to ensure a basic \nknowledge and understanding of the world\u2019s main \ncultures, civilizations and religions. \n As a country where long-standing traditions of \ntolerance and peaceful coexistence of different \nreligions and ethnic groups over centuries have become \nan inseparable part of the culture, Azerbaijan has \nrepeatedly demonstrated its determination to act as a \nnatural bridge bringing together different continents, \ncultures and civilizations through the promotion of \ninter-religious and intercultural dialogue based on \nmutual respect and understanding among peoples of \ndifferent cultures and religions. \n Azerbaijan was among the first countries to join \nthe Alliance of Civilizations, an initiative by Turkey \nand Spain. Azerbaijan has hosted a number of \nimportant events in recent years, with a view to \ntranslating into concrete actions the recommendations \ncontained in the Alliance of Civilizations report of the \nHigh-level Group appointed by the Secretary-General. \nMost recently, we held the Baku International Forum \non Expanding the Role of Women in Cross-cultural \nDialogue, which we believe will raise awareness about \nthe role of women in that regard. In December 2008, \nwe hosted a conference of culture ministers from \nCouncil of Europe member States. For the first time in \nthe history of the Council of Europe, ministers from \nmember States of the Islamic Educational, Scientific \nand Cultural Organization and the Arab League \nEducational, Cultural and Scientific Organization \njoined the event. The Baku declaration adopted at the \nconference envisages, inter alia, an intercultural \ndialogue between European and neighbouring States. \n At the fifth Islamic Conference of Culture \nMinisters, Azerbaijan\u2019s capital of Baku was declared \nthe Islamic culture capital for 2009. This autumn we \nwill be hosting the sixth Conference of Ministers of \nCulture of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, \nwhere we will continue discussions of our future \nactions in fostering dialogue among civilizations. \n The multilateral system, with the United Nations \nat its heart, is undergoing serious changes that will test \nits strength, viability and credibility. This requires \nmore dedicated efforts aimed at strengthening the \nUnited Nations and promoting the effectiveness of the \nOrganization through the implementation of its \ndecisions and resolutions. Azerbaijan believes that, as \nthe only truly global organization, the United Nations \nhas to be stronger and capable of engaging on a range \nof pressing global issues in every part of the world, as \nwell as addressing the aspirations and concerns of each \nMember State. We continue to support reform of the \nOrganization so that it may be renewed and revitalized \nand made more responsive."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to \ncongratulate the President on his assumption of the \nhigh post of the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-fourth session. In fulfilling his challenging \ntasks during this session, he may rest assured of the \nsupport and cooperation of the delegation of the \nRepublic of Hungary. \n The current session of the General Assembly \nbegins its work against the backdrop of an \nextraordinary downturn of the world economy. \nHungary was among those countries which were \nespecially hard hit by the storm of the current financial \nand economic crisis. In order to cope with its \nconsequences, the Hungarian Government has adopted \nand implemented a series of stabilization measures. As \na result of this policy, the first positive trends have \nalready emerged. Today we can claim that the \nHungarian economy is well on its way towards \nrecovery and that the foundations of a more sustainable \ndevelopment have been laid. If implemented \nvigorously, the strict fiscal policy of my Government \nwill put the country back into the ranks of the \nfinancially stable economies. \n At the same time, Hungary cannot and does not \nwant to turn a blind eye to the plight of millions \nworldwide, especially the most vulnerable ones in the \ndeveloping world, particularly in Africa, who have \nbeen thrown into poverty as a consequence of the \nglobal economic crisis. The present crisis should not \nundermine our common efforts to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. Hungary continues to \ntake its share of responsibility by implementing its \ndonor programmes in Afghanistan, Viet Nam and the \nneighbouring middle-income countries of the Western \nBalkans. \n Global crises require that we all think and act \ntogether in the spirit of shared responsibility. It is right \nthat climate change is high on the United Nations \nagenda, as it threatens the very foundations of our life. \nYet for too long we failed to respond adequately. \nHungary is willing to accept its share of responsibility \nand is fully committed to achieving important results at \nthe United Nations Climate Change Conference in \nCopenhagen. In this regard, the summit on climate \nchange recently convened by the Secretary-General \nwas a useful forum in identifying the necessary steps \ntowards a successful outcome. \n Preventing conflicts and managing crises remain \nhigh on our agenda. The United Nations, in \ncooperation with regional organizations, continues to \nplay a key role in this respect. Full integration of the \nWestern Balkans into European and Euro-Atlantic \nstructures is a means to promote the stability and \nprosperity of that region, a goal that Hungary supports \nactively. Interaction among countries of the region to \nfulfil the conditions of European integration is an \nessential tool. International efforts in Kosovo represent \na good example of effective cooperation among various \nstakeholders, such as the European Union and NATO. \n In Georgia, the situation on the ground remains \nfragile. We firmly believe that a peaceful and lasting \nsolution to the conflict must be based on full respect \nfor the independence, sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of that country within its internationally \nrecognized borders. We deplore the decision that led to \nthe termination of the monitoring activities of the \nUnited Nations and the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe in the breakaway parts of \nGeorgia/Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The resumption \n  \n \n09-52598 44 \n \nof the international presence in these regions is \nnecessary. \n The stakes in Afghanistan are high. The success \nof international stabilization and reconstruction efforts \nwill have a major impact both on our security and on \nthe defence of the values our societies stand for. \nFailure is not an option. Hungary will remain \ncommitted to supporting, politically and by \ncontributing troops and civilian and development \nassistance, the creation of a stable Afghanistan \ngoverned by the rule of law. We welcome the joint \ninitiative of the United Kingdom, Germany and France \nto hold an international conference at the ministerial \nlevel, co-chaired by the United Nations and the Afghan \nGovernment. \n In the Middle East, Hungary warmly welcomes \nthe commitment of the United States to vigorously \npursue a two-State solution and a comprehensive \npeace. It is now up to the parties themselves to engage \nin a meaningful process of negotiation. It is our \nresponsibility to assist them in carrying the process \nforward. \n The nuclear programme of Iran continues to be a \nmatter of most serious concern. We deeply regret that \nIran\u2019s leadership has refused to abide by the relevant \nSecurity Council resolutions. In flagrant violation of its \ninternational obligations, Iran has even increased its \nuranium-enrichment capacities. Recent revelations \nabout the existence of a second enrichment facility \nunderscore the legitimacy of our previous concerns. We \nurge Iran to engage in substantive negotiations on its \nnuclear programme without further delay. The news of \nrecent missile tests only reinforces our sense of \nurgency. \n The idea of a world without nuclear weapons has \nlong been cherished. We welcome the affirmations of \ncommitment to this goal made at the recent summit-\nlevel meeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.6191), \nalong with the adoption of a comprehensive set of \nmeasures to strengthen the global non-proliferation \nregime. Hungary hopes that the momentum created by \nthat meeting will also have a positive impact on the \n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \n The global economic and financial crisis has \naffected the political landscape in many countries and \nhas led to the re-emergence of extreme nationalist, \nracist and xenophobic ideologies and political \nmovements. Like many other countries, Hungary is not \nimmune from this phenomenon. We cannot allow those \nalarming trends to prevail or to roll back the advance \nof democratic values and human rights. The \nGovernment of Hungary condemns, in the most \nresolute terms, all forms of racism, anti-Semitism and \nxenophobia and fights any manifestation of them not \nonly in words, but also in deeds. \n The promotion and protection of human rights, \nincluding the rights of national minorities and the \npreservation of their cultural and linguistic identities, \nhave traditionally been high on the agenda of the \nHungarian Government. The presence of flourishing \nminority communities does not weaken a State, but \nrather makes it stronger. Trust between the majority \nand minorities within a country can be built only on \nthat basis. The Republic of Hungary attaches great \nimportance to the work of the United Nations Forum \non Minority Issues and is determined to contribute \nactively to the Forum\u2019s second meeting, to be held this \nNovember in Geneva. We are witnessing alarming \ntendencies that have a detrimental effect on the \npolitical participation, cultural life and educational \nopportunities of minorities. The international \ncommunity should pay special attention to respect for \nminority rights. \n At this point, I would also like to confirm the \ncommitment of Hungary, as a newly elected member of \nthe Human Rights Council, to play an active role in the \nmost important human rights body of the United \nNations. We strongly believe that there is a clear and \nurgent need for further institution-building in the field \nof the prevention of genocide and mass atrocities. For \nthat reason, this year Hungary prepared a feasibility \nstudy on the establishment of the Budapest Centre for \nthe International Prevention of Genocide and Mass \nAtrocities. It is envisaged that the Centre will work in \nclose cooperation with the United Nations, including \nthe Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of \nGenocide and Mass Atrocities and the Office of the \nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. \n The ongoing changes in international politics and \nthe world economy have created a new situation for the \nUnited Nations. We welcome and strongly support the \nefforts aimed at strengthening the ability of the \nOrganization to adapt to the new realities, but we \ncannot be satisfied with the pace of the transformation. \nThe present challenges should lend additional impetus \nto moving forward more vigorously on such issues as \n \n \n45 09-52598 \n \nSecurity Council reform, peacekeeping activities, \nsystem-wide coherence, budgeting of the Organization, \nmanagement reform and reform of the environmental \ngovernance system of the United Nations. With a view \nto actively promoting those goals, Hungary presented \nits candidacies for the Security Council for the term \n2012-2013 and for the Economic and Social Council \nfor the term 2011-2013. \n Once again the United Nations stands at a \ncrossroads. It needs to adapt to the changing \ninternational environment. This change will require \nsacrifices, but it also offers new opportunities as it \npaves the way for new consensus on the future of the \nUnited Nations."

        "file_name": "ISL_64_2009.txt",
        "file_text": "It is indeed an \nhonour for me to address this Assembly for the first \ntime. I would like to start by congratulating His \nExcellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfourth session, and I pledge him the full support of the \nIcelandic delegation in the difficult and arduous work \nthat lies ahead of all of us. \n Only a year ago this weekend, my country, \nIceland, found itself caught up in the beginning of the \nglobal financial storm. It swept almost the entire \nbanking system in Iceland off the ground and left my \ncountry facing its most severe economic setback in \nliving memory. Iceland was the first country to fall \nvictim to the greed and excess of financiers who \nabused rules, followed dubious ethics, hid their money \nin tax havens and introduced an irresponsible system of \nstellar bonuses that incited reckless behaviour and risk-\ntaking beyond anything that we had ever seen before. \n In Iceland, those responsible left in their wake a \nscorched earth: bewildered citizens, full of sorrow and \nanger, scarred by the possibility of imminent \nbankruptcy and the loss of their houses and jobs. I can \ntell this Assembly, however, that Iceland is pulling \nthrough, not least because of the hard work of our \ncitizens, but also because we had friends that we could \nlean on. Our Nordic family did not desert us. The \nBaltic countries gave us their full moral support. And I \nwould especially like to mention Poland, which, out of \nthe generosity of her heart, lent us a hand without ever \nbeing asked \u2014 which we shall never forget. \n The International Monetary Fund offered us a \nstabilization programme that remains broadly on track, \nalthough I have to use this opportunity to voice \n \n \n33 09-52592 \n \nIceland\u2019s grave dissatisfaction with the fact that \nunrelated bilateral disputes have prevented the \nprogramme from being fully implemented. I would \nalso like to mention that our application to join the \nEuropean Union has been very warmly received by our \nEuropean neighbours, for which I am very thankful. I \ncan therefore stand before this Assembly and say with \nconfidence in my voice that despite the hardships that \nare behind us, the financial storms in Iceland are \nbeginning to break. That is due to the resilience and \nhard work of the Icelandic people, but also because \nyou, the international community, lent us some very \nimportant support in the hour of our greatest need. \n The salient point is this. In a globalized world, \nwe have to tackle problems together, globally. We need \nto fight together the corruption that contributed to the \ninternational recession; we must work together to \nensure that the financial czars are not allowed to \nspeculate again with people\u2019s lives; we have to work \ntogether to obliterate the tax havens they used and we \nalso need to lock arms to create a sound global \nregulatory framework. The world has to fight the \nrecession together, in the spirit of the United Nations, \nbut also within the framework that is created by the \nUnited Nations. \n Earlier in the week I had the privilege and honour \nto take part in the high-level Summit on Climate \nChange. It touched my heart when I heard the President \nof Kiribati describe the plight of his country, which \nmight literally be obliterated from the face of the earth \nwithout his nation being responsible for it in any way. \nThis is due to the drastic climate change that the whole \nworld is facing. The President of Kiribati asked for the \nonly thing that every human and every nation on earth \nreally deserves: he asked for justice. \n I believe that the best way to give justice to the \npeople of Kiribati, to the people of the nations in the \nSouth Pacific and elsewhere, and to the generations of \nthe future, is that we together put all our effort into \nreaching a decision on a legally binding agreement in \nCopenhagen that will strike at the core of this problem. \nI also believe that the best way to convince the sceptics \nto take that step is to highlight the success stories that \nwe have. We have to show the sceptics that our goals \nare realistic and that we can achieve them. \n I remind the Assembly that at the beginning of \nthe general debate we heard President Lula present the \nsuccess story of Brazil in terms of the sustainable use \nof energy resources that they have achieved. Allow me \nto take this opportunity to tell the success story of \nIceland in this regard. A generation ago, we were as \ndependent on imported fossil fuel as any other nation \nin the world. Today, a generation later, 80 per cent of \nour energy needs are met by renewables. All our \nheating, all our electricity is 100 per cent renewable. \nWhat we did was to use the treasures that we had not \nrealized were under our feet and before our eyes, in the \nform of rivers \u2014 we used hydro and geothermal power. \nAnd I maintain that what we did, others can also do. \n I want especially to focus attention on the vastly \nunderestimated possibilities of geothermal energy. \nMany of the countries of the African Rift Valley have \nsimilar potential to that of Iceland. In South-East Asia \nwe have the greatest geothermal potential in the world, \nand in Latin America there is also valuable potential. \nMany of these countries could, with the geothermal \nexpertise that countries such as Iceland have, achieve a \nreal transformation to clean energy; some could even \nbecome self-sustaining in terms of energy. But, of \ncourse, as always, what we need is finance. What we \nreally need is a global climatic fund to transfer \nrenewable technologies to developing countries to \nenable them to continue growing on a sustainable, \nrenewable basis. The expertise we have developed in \nIceland is available, and I would like to add that, \ndespite our present financial difficulties, we have \nensured that the geothermal training programme of the \nUnited Nations University in Iceland remains open and \nfully funded, as it has been for the past 25 years. \n Climate change is also producing drastic effects \nin the Arctic. Iceland, the only State that lies entirely \nwithin the Arctic region, has therefore designated the \nArctic as one of the main areas of her foreign policy. \nScience tells us, and we can read about it in the news, \nthat soon a great part of the Arctic Ocean might be ice-\nfree at the end of summer. This is a development that \nwe have not experienced in our lifetimes, and it bears \nboth good and bad tidings. If it happens soon, it will \nopen a pathway for transportation between the Pacific \nand the Atlantic via the Arctic Ocean, with great \nbenefits to trade. For better or worse, it will also \nfacilitate access to vitally important resources in the \nArctic. \n However, here we must tread very carefully. The \nArctic also possesses the most fragile ecosystem of the \nworld, and it will be a real challenge to strike the right \nbalance between the fragile environment and the use of \n  \n \n09-52592 34 \n \nits resources. In Iceland, we believe that it is very \nimportant to address those challenges regionally \nthrough the Arctic Council and that any territorial \nclaims \u2014 which we have already seen emerge in the \nnews \u2014 should to be settled on the basis of the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \n Climate changes are also likely to have \nconsiderably negative effects on the fishing stocks of \nthe world. Representatives would know better than me \nthat more than a billion people, 95 per cent of whom \nlive in developing countries, depend on fish as their \nmain source of protein. As is known, Iceland\u2019s track \nrecord in the sustainable management of fishing stocks \nis second to none. In that, as in the geothermal field, \nwe also have technological expertise that we are \nwilling and would like to share. In that respect, I am \nalso happy to say that despite Iceland\u2019s current \nfinancial woes, we have ensured that the UNU \nFisheries Training Programme in Iceland is fully \nfunded. It is available to Member States, and I would \nbe very happy for them to take us up on that offer. \n During the course of this week, I have heard \nmany speakers criticize the United Nations, but I \nwould like to use the occasion of my first speech to \nthis Assembly to praise the work of the Organization. \nIn many fields, it has done well in times when the odds \nhave really been heavily stacked against it. I want \nespecially to take two examples from a great many that \nI could relate. \n Iceland and my Government have always strongly \nendorsed the rights of women. In particular, we have \ntaken to heart Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) \non the rights of women, of women in the world to take \npart and be active in the peace processes in war-torn \nregions. I wish to remind the Assembly that next year \nis the tenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution \n1325 (2000) and to take this opportunity to urge the \nUnited Nations to actively use that anniversary to \npromote the role of women as peacemakers all over the \nworld. I would add that in that context, the unanimous \ndecision of the General Assembly to create a new \nUnited Nations composite gender entity, to be headed \nby a special Under-Secretary-General (resolution \n63/311), was also very helpful. We thank all \nrepresentatives for those important steps, and I urge the \nSecretary-General to move forward on that matter as \nexpeditiously as possible. \n The other cause that I wish to mention as a reason \nfor my gratitude is the unanimous decision of the \nSecurity Council earlier this week to call for global \nefforts to stop the spread of nuclear arms and to boost \ndisarmament (Security Council resolution 1887 \n(2009)). I remember when I was a very young editor in \nReykjavik in 1986, when President Reagan and \nGeneral Secretary Gorbachev descended on the capital \nof Iceland. That historic meeting really signalled the \nend of the cold war. I will never forget that at that time, \nfor the first time in my life, a world free of the nuclear \nnightmare became a workable goal, and that goal must \nbe vigorously pursued. Only 15 minutes ago, I heard \nthe Foreign Minister of India state that one of the \ngreatest goals of the Indian Government was to support \nthat development. Even though Iceland is a little bit \nsmaller than India, I would add its weight to that goal. \nWe really must pursue it as strongly as we can, and I \nam grateful to the United Nations for providing the \nframework for that. \n There have also been other happy events for me, \nas a newcomer to this Assembly, during my first days \nhere. I found it invigorating to hear President Barack \nObama boldly describe his vision of a peace agreement \nin the Middle East based on the two-State solution and \nthe cessation of all settlements. I believe that his strong \ndeclaration has created a fresh political momentum that \nwe who are assembled here and the Governments of \nthis world must not allow to fade away. \n To sum up, I have talked about my nation\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties, but I have also said that we are \npulling through, not least because we have been able to \nseek the advice and support of the international \ncommunity. Of course, Iceland is a small nation, but I \nhave also described how, even though we are a small \nnation, we have much to offer that could contribute to \nthe solution of some of the problems that, together, the \nworld is facing today. Our expertise in the geothermal \nfield, for example, can be of vital importance in the \nface of the climate crisis, and our experience in \nsustainable fishing can be instrumental in staving off \nthe depletion of fishing stocks. Our geopolitical \nposition in the Arctic and our cohabitation with its \ndangers and beauty for more than a thousand years can \nbe of great value in striking the right balance between a \nfragile ecosystem in the Arctic and the use of its \nresources. \n It is true that the crisis destroyed financial assets, \nbut Iceland\u2019s real assets \u2014 natural resources, human \n \n \n35 09-52592 \n \ncapital and social welfare \u2014 remain intact. That is why \nI am so confident when I say that although Iceland was \nthe first to fall victim to the global financial crisis, it is \nalready on the road to recovery."

As such, it is called to fulfil the \nexpectations and hopes of peoples and individuals \naround the world \u2014 hopes for peace, hopes for an end \nto poverty and suffering and hopes to see human rights \nrespected. \n Since my arrival in New York a couple of days \nago, I have been encouraged by the multiple calls for \ninternational cooperation and the renewed commitment \nto multilateralism. For Liechtenstein, the United Nations \nhas always been the epitome of multilateralism. We \nbelieve that genuine multilateralism is needed today in \norder to address the challenges before us. \n On disarmament and non-proliferation, we seem \nto be finally about to enter a new era. \n On climate change, the United Nations is working \nhard to seal the deal. Last Tuesday, an unprecedented \nnumber of heads of State or Government gathered in \nthis Hall to discuss climate change threats.

It is about investing \ninto the future of our planet. \n The global financial and economic crisis has \nrippled through our countries and disrupted the lives of \npeople worldwide. It has also deeply affected our \nprogress towards the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. While much attention has been \npaid and much money has been mobilized to keep the \nworld economy afloat, another crisis has emerged in its \nwake. It is a crisis of global governance, and it may \nhave lasting repercussions. \n We acknowledge that there are times when \nconcerted action by groups such as the Group of Eight \nand the Group of 20 (G-20) can bring us closer to \nsolutions for everyone. But we cannot ignore the gap \nbetween those who are taking decisions and the rest of \nus. Good and effective solutions require the support of \nthose who are to implement them. Most important, \nrules must apply to everyone equally, on the basis of a \nlevel playing field. \n The notion of sovereign equality is one of the \ncore principles of the United Nations Charter. Indeed, \nit is the main pillar of genuine multilateralism. I was \ntherefore pleased to accept an invitation from the \nForeign Minister of Singapore to discuss issues of \nglobal governance together with some other colleagues \nand friends. I look forward to continuing those \nexchanges and I hope that the G-20 and other partners \nwill find interest in our input and ideas. Our goal is \npositive engagement, productive cooperation and the \nhighest possible quality in decision-making. \n The drafters of the United Nations Charter \nunderstood that the inclusion of all States was a \nprerequisite for effective multilateralism. In today\u2019s \ninterconnected world, we must uphold this principle \nmore than ever. But the practice of the Organization \nhas sometimes veered away from the ideals of \ninclusion, transparency and legitimacy. \n On international peace and security, the Security \nCouncil is mandated to carry out its functions on behalf \nof all of us. Our understanding is therefore that the \nCouncil\u2019s legitimacy depends on the extent to which its \nactions reflect a very wide political consensus. Often, \n \n \n45 09-52592 \n \nthough, the Council shows little interest in including in \nits decision-making process those who are instrumental \nfor implementation. Together with the other members \nof the Small Five Group, we will continue to work for \ninclusion and transparency in the Council\u2019s work. We \nwill also look for further improvements in the \nCouncil\u2019s sanctions procedures. As numerous judicial \nchallenges have shown, those procedures must be \nbrought closer to international standards of human \nrights and due process. Such improvements would go a \nlong way in improving the effectiveness, perception \nand legitimacy of sanctions. \n The composition of the Security Council is \noutdated. This is sadly almost the only agreement we \nhave found after many years of controversial \ndiscussions on its enlargement. Our position on the \nmatter is clear. None of the proposals submitted at the \n2005 World Summit, or variations thereof, will receive \nthe necessary support in the Assembly, let alone in the \nratification process. We see only two avenues towards \nexpansion. We can wait for a massive institutional \ncrisis to hit the Organization and then expand the \nCouncil under enormous public pressure, or we can \nwork in a cooperative manner towards a solution that is \nboth a compromise and politically sustainable. We \nbelieve that only the latter approach is in the best \ninterest of the Organization. As a result of the last \nsession, there are now clear ideas on the table on how \nto bridge the gap. They deserve a thorough review \nduring the coming months. \n Over the past two decades, multilateralism has \nperhaps been most successful in the area of \ninternational criminal justice. The first generation of \ninternational tribunals has had a tremendous impact, \nand is now approaching the conclusion of its work. \nMost important, we have created the International \nCriminal Court \u2014 an institution that seemed a distant \ndream not too long ago. During its first years in \noperation, the Court has been remarkably successful. It \nhas also been subject to controversial political \ndiscussions. This is not surprising, because justice can \nbe difficult and can seem inconvenient. That is \nparticularly true in situations of ongoing conflict. But it \nis not a choice. To quote Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \nthe debate is no longer between peace and justice but \nbetween peace and what kind of justice. Indeed, peace, \ndevelopment and justice go hand in hand. These tasks \nmust be fulfilled, first and foremost, by States \nthemselves. We must therefore galvanize efforts to \nstrengthen national judiciaries, in accordance with the \nprinciple of complementarity. \n The International Criminal Court will not be able \nto put on trial all perpetrators of the most serious \ncrimes. But its work illustrates the world\u2019s consensus \nthat there must be accountability for these crimes and \nthat impunity is no longer an option. The 2010 review \nconference will give us the opportunity to add the \ncrime of aggression to the list of crimes under the \nactive jurisdiction of the Court. We hope that we will \nfind it in ourselves to seize this historic event. \n The General Assembly remains the heart of \ngenuine multilateral work. We must trust that the \nPresident will lead the Assembly in a manner that \nreflects the priorities of the membership as a whole. \nImportant negotiations are ahead of us. We will prepare \nthe 2010 summit on the Millennium Development \nGoals, continue discussions on the arms trade treaty, \nmove ahead with various reform processes, negotiate both \na new budget and a new scale of assessments, address \nhuman rights both in specific situations and thematically, \nkeep working on the promotion of the rule of law at all \nlevels, work to strengthen the framework for development \nand humanitarian assistance, and much more.  \n Looking at the work programme ahead, it seems \nto us that the General Assembly does not need much \nrevitalization. There are numerous concrete challenges \nin front of us, to which we Member States must rise. \nWe must look beyond our short-term domestic interests \nand work hard to make progress on our comprehensive \nagenda. The renewed expressions of commitment that \nwe have witnessed in this Hall over the past days give \nus confidence. The Assembly will do its best to live up \nto the world\u2019s expectations and, more than ever, strive \nin unison. "

        "file_text": "I greet all the citizens of the world who have come \nhere \u2014 as they do every year \u2014 for this gathering of \nsuch great importance for the world. I am very pleased \nto be back in New York and at the United Nations \nfollowing a few years\u2019 absence. I am very grateful for \nall the cooperation and the manner in which our \ndelegation has been received.  \n Last night we visited Lincoln Center to see a film \nmade by Oliver Stone during the past year. The title of \nthe film already stirs your thoughts. It is called \u201cSouth \nof the Border\u201d. In this film, you can see President Evo \nMorales chewing coca leaves, together with Oliver \nStone. And, as President Morales says, coca is not the \nsame as cocaine. You can see Cristina, the President of \nArgentina, and the automobile of General Per\u00f3n. You \ncan hear what she has to say about events in South \nAmerica, in Latin America. And you can see Lula, the \nPresident of Brazil, in the Guajira region of Venezuela, \nworking with us to help the indigenous peoples, who \nwere exploited for centuries, through core industrial \nprojects. You will see President Fernando Lugo, a \nbishop and liberation theologian, living today in the \nresidence occupied for many years by Stroessner. And \nyou can see how a bishop became a president.  \n You can also see Rafael Correa, the President of \nEcuador, in Havana with President Ra\u00fal Castro. You \ncan see Fidel. You can even see Obama, in Trinidad, \nchatting with a group of us, with his hand held out to \nus and an open smile. \n I think it is an interesting film, one of the many \nmade by this great filmmaker of the United States, \nOliver Stone. He had already made two films about \nFidel, \u201cLooking for Fidel\u201d and \u201cEl Comandante\u201d. \nThere is a lot in this film, many messages that could \nhelp us to decipher the enigmas of the times in which \nwe live.  \n We stayed behind after the film was over last \nnight, chatting with a group of people from the United \nStates and other parts of the world. And this contact \nwas very instructive and very symptomatic of the \nimportance of what Fidel calls \u201cthe battle of ideas\u201d. A \nlady in her fifties came up to me and said \u201cI am very \nhappy\u201d. She was a North American, very white; a \ntypical United States citizen, born in this country, but \nshe spoke some Spanish. She told me, \u201cI am very \n  \n \n09-52425 2 \n \nhappy\u201d. And I asked her why. \u201cBecause, now having \nseen this movie, I realize what you are. I thought you \nwere a very bad person\u201d.  \n This person was a victim of the hostile media \nbombardment, the ideological bombardment, of the \nUnited States and of the entire world, whose aim is to \nturn reality inside out and to turn the world upside \ndown, as Eduardo Galeano put it. \n The film is called \u201cSouth of the Border\u201d and I am \ntaking advantage of this opportunity and that title to \ntell you that, south of the border, a revolution is under \nway. A revolution is under way in South America. A \nrevolution is under way in Latin America. There is a \nrevolution in the Caribbean. The world must see this, it \nmust truly realize this and accept it, because it is a \nreality and it is not going to change. What is more, this \nis a revolution that goes beyond ideology. It is a \ngeographical and geopolitical revolution. It is a historic \nrevolution; it is part of our times. It has very deep \nroots. It is a total, moral and spiritual revolution. And \nwe believe that it is a necessary revolution. This \nrevolution is great in both spirit and magnitude, and it \nis going to keep growing as the days, months and years \ngo by. And why is it great? It is great because it has \nbeen a long time coming: centuries of history have led \nup to this moment in time. It is great in terms of the \nspace that it covers. \n I am not going to speak any longer than  \nMr. Al-Qadhafi. Al-Qadhafi has said everything there \nis to say. This applause is for Al-Qadhafi and his \nspeech. But nor will I speak any less than Mr. Obama, \nor Lula.  \n I was explaining why this revolution is great. \nFirst, because of time, the accumulated time that has \ngone by. It is centuries, centuries of battles, of \nstruggles, of hopes, of suffering of millions and \nmillions of human beings in Latin America and the \nCaribbean. This revolution is great in the area it \ncovers. This revolution is great in the depth of its \nfoundations. This revolution is great in the masses of \npeople that are joining it. No one seeks to slow it down \nand no one will be able to. \n Yesterday, it was said by President Morales here \n(see ), by this great companion and \nindigenous leader of the Aymara, Evo Morales. He also \nsaid it in the film, which you should not miss, \u201cSouth \nof the Border\u201d. Oliver Stone told me last night that \npressure is already being exerted to prevent the \nAmerican people from seeing it. Where is their \nfreedom of expression? It is just a movie. How can \nthey be afraid of a movie? But there is already pressure \nfrom the monopolies that run the film industry, that \noperate the theatres \u2014 these are all monopolies and \nthey are putting on pressure. But the movie will be \nshown elsewhere. Fortunately, we are in the age of \ncomputers and telecommunications. We no longer \ndepend on movie theatres run by monopolies.  \n In the film, Evo, speaking with Oliver Stone, \nrecalls a phrase pronounced by a great leader of the \nAymara, an ancestor of his who was murdered, just one \nof the many millions that were murdered by the \nSpanish, Portuguese and English invasion, by the \nEuropean invasion of our continent. I know that all \npresent are aware that when the European ships arrived \nat the American shores there were approximately \n90 million indigenous people living here.  \n Two hundred years later only four million \nsurvived. This is one of the greatest genocides in \nhistory \u2014 the genocide of the continent itself, of the \nAbya Yala, as our indigenous people call it. So Evo in \nthe movie repeats the sentence uttered by this great \nAymara leader, who was drawn and quartered \u2014 he \nwas tied to four horses by the arms and legs and he was \ntorn apart, and as he died the Indian uttered a \nprophesy: \u201cToday I die,\u201d said T\u00fapac Katari, \u201ctoday I \ndie, but one day I will return as millions.\u201d T\u00fapac Katari \nhas returned, and we are millions. We are millions. \n Nothing and no one can hold back the great South \nAmerican, Latin American, Caribbean revolution. And \nI think the world should support it. The United States \nshould support it. Europe should support it, because \nthis revolution \u2014 some brothers and sisters may not \nhave noticed \u2014 is the start of the road to salvation for \nthis planet, and to salvation for the human race, \nthreatened as it is by capitalism, imperialism, hunger \nand war. This is the necessary revolution. For centuries \nthis has been called \u201cthe New World\u201d. Now we can \ntruly call it \u201ca new world\u201d. \n Years ago \u2014 as we recalled last night \u2014 I was \ninvited to a conversation \u2014 a large group of important \nleaders. They were important in their own right. They \nwere trade union leaders here in the United States. \nSome workers were complaining about a biscuit \nfactory that was not paying them. They were striking, \nand one of them asked me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you buy that \nfactory?\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see. Maybe we can make it a \n \n \n3 09-52425 \n \nsocialist biscuit factory, if Obama gives me permission. \nMaybe we could do that \u2014 buy it, give it to the \nworkers, let them make the crackers and distribute \nthem. Why should there just be one or two capitalists \nexploiting a lot of people?\u201d That is socialism and that \nis the path to salvation for this planet. \n Yesterday a journalist asked me \u2014 after the \nmovie there was forum at which he asked me \u2014 \u201cDo \nyou defend socialism even though the Soviet Union \nfailed?\u201d The reply is very simple. The Soviet Union \nlost its way early on. There was never real socialism in \nthe Soviet Union. But this century, the twenty-first \ncentury, will be the century of socialism \u2014 the \nsocialism of the human race.  \n I\u2019m sure everyone listening to me has read \nEinstein. Albert Einstein convinced the American \nPresident to build the atomic bomb \u2014 to begin the \nresearch before the Nazis did. Then later he regretted \nwhat he had done when he saw the disaster of \nHiroshima and the disaster of Nagasaki. But Albert \nEinstein, after all his years of study, the great scientist, \namong the greatest scientists ever to have walked the \nEarth, came to the conclusion \u2014 and this is written in \nhis own hand \u2014 \u201cWhy socialism?\u201d Einstein came to \nthe conclusion that the only way for the human race to \nlive on this planet is socialism. Capitalism is the road \nto extinction of the human species. We as a species \nhave only been around for what? This is Castro \nterritory, he knows these figures. But, whereas life first \nappeared here at least three billion years ago, we the \nhuman species only appeared maybe less than 300,000 \nyears ago, hardly 0.01 per cent of the time that life has \nexisted on this planet. So we appear after so long and \nwe\u2019re going to wipe out life on this planet? \n We\u2019ve heard it from everybody \u2014 Obama, Lula, \nCristina Fern\u00e1ndez, Al-Qadhafi, Sarkozy \u2014 everyone \nsaid the same thing. They have all clamoured for \nchange. And what is the change? Capitalism allows no \nchange. Let us not fool ourselves. It\u2019s only through \nsocialism that we can bring about genuine change. And \nthe revolution in Latin America has it all and it has a \nstrong socialist element. As Mari\u00e1tequi, the great \nPeruvian thinker said, it is an Indian-American \nsocialism. It is our own socialism. It is a Bolivarian \nsocialism. It is a Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed socialism. It is a new \nsocialism. It has not been copied from anybody else. \nThere are no manuals for socialism, said Mari\u00e1tequi. It \nis a heroic creation that has to be constantly reinvented. \n Yesterday we were remembering what a North \nAmerican President, that is to say a United States \nPresident, said shortly before he was assassinated, and \nthis is on the record, in a speech before the United \nStates Congress. John Kennedy spoke of a revolution \nin the South, saying that the principal cause was \nhunger. Only a few days later he was assassinated. \nJohn Kennedy was not a revolutionary, but he was an \nintelligent man, just as I think President Obama is an \nintelligent man. And I hope God protects Obama from \nthe bullets that killed Kennedy. I hope Obama will be \nable to look and see \u2014 genuinely see \u2014 what has to be \nseen. It does not smell of sulphur here anymore. That \nsmell has gone. It smells of something else \u2014 it smells \nof hope. And you have to have hope in your heart and \nbelieve in the hope.  \n We cannot destroy this planet. What about our \nchildren? What about future generations? Come, let\u2019s \ntake on the challenge. Lula was saying yesterday that \nthere was no political will. Those words were whips. I \nknow Lula\u2019s will. I am deeply aware of his humane \nattitude. He is a true brother of mine, and he was right \nto say what he said. But I would not exactly say that \nthere is no political will. I would say rather that some \npolitical will is lacking, because Lula has it and we \nhave it, but it has to be increased. It has to continue to \ngrow in the leaders, in society, among the people, \namong the youth \u2014 particularly in the hearts of the \nyoung \u2014 and the workers, everywhere in the world.  \n Kennedy said it: there is a revolution in the \nSouth. And he added, \u201cThose who make peaceful \nrevolution impossible will make violent revolution \ninevitable\u201d. Jack Kennedy said that. You can find it on \nthe Internet; you can find everything on the Internet. \n My dear Maria Fernanda Espinosa, once \nambassador from fraternal Ecuador, whom I have not \nseen for days. We\u2019d like to say hello to President \nCorrea. The ambassador was Minister for Foreign \nAffairs at the beginning of the citizens\u2019 revolution, \nwith Correa leading the people of Ecuador, the people \nof Manuela Saenz and Bolivar and Eloy Alfaro, the \nnoble and great people in Bolivia and that whole area. \n Some are trying to block the path to our peaceful \nrevolution. And there\u2019s another brave woman, Patricia \nRodas, the Foreign Minister of Honduras; please, a \nhand for this brave Central American woman, from the \npeople of Moraz\u00e1n. Long live Honduras! Long live \nMoraz\u00e1n! And long live the dignity of the people!  \n  \n \n09-52425 4 \n \n At 1 p.m. exactly, I was jotting down these \nnotes \u2014 I don\u2019t have much farther to go, Mr. President; \ndon\u2019t anybody throw a shoe at me. The Cuban Minister \nhas taken off his shoe to throw it at me. He had some \nrubber shoes \u2014 if you are going to throw me a shoe, \nthrow one of those. I spoke to Manuel Zelaya at 1 p.m. \nsharp; I remember it was 1 p.m. sharp \u2014 we started at \n1 and finished at 1.13. \n While we are here, comrades of the world, there \nis a President, firm, dignified, who with a small group \nof people, almost martyrs, was able to escape those \ntrying to carry out a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. The perpetrators of \nthe coup had brought repression to the Plaza Moraz\u00e1n \nin Tegucigalpa and had taken every single road. They \nhad an entire army; it was as if they had invaded \nHonduras with their own army \u2014 what an indignity. \nFrom here I make an appeal \u2014 I, who am a \nrevolutionary soldier \u2014 to the soldiers of Honduras, to \nthe sons of Moraz\u00e1n to not continue to repress an \ninnocent people. \n While we are here, Manuel Zelaya, the President \nof Honduras, is in the Brazilian embassy, which has \ngiven him refuge. According to what the President has \ntold me, there are more than 200 soldiers surrounding \nthe embassy in the most brutal fashion. Were they \ntrying to go back to the Stone Age? It will not work. Is \nthat what the perpetrators of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat had in \nmind? They will be swept away by the wind of the new \nage. The coup cannot succeed, these regressive forces \ncannot have their way, not in Honduras, not in any of \nthe countries of the Americas. These people have been \nout in the streets for 90 days, resisting, resisting, \nresisting. \n So, there we have a President, firm in his \nconviction, with a group of compatriots, with his wife, \nthe First Lady. Apparently they are not letting food \nthrough; the water is cut off every now and then. \nLuckily there is a cistern with water. This morning they \nwere able to get some of the most up-to-date telephone \ninterception equipment, which the President told me is \nan Israeli brand. Israel has recognized the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat \nGovernment; I think it is the only country in the world \nthat has. They have all kinds of equipment to block \nsignals and jam communications, and they are also \ntrying to create panic among the few people inside the \nBrazilian embassy, threatening them with incursion \ninto the embassy. Does the Assembly realize how \nretrograde this is? It is like some kind of trolls or dark \ngiants or magicians, something from the age of the \ncavemen. But they will not return. \n The people are in the street, protesting. The \nairport is closed now. Who is behind the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat? It \nis the Honduran bourgeoisie; the State is taken over by \nthe bourgeoisie, by the rich. Four or five wealthy, \npowerful families own the State. I think we have to \npull out our copies of Lenin, his State and Revolution, \nwhere he talks about the bourgeois State, the control of \neverything by the bourgeois State including the \nnational congress, the judiciary, the army. \n The people are in the street, but they are being \nfired on. Yesterday the President told me that he knows \nof at least three people in the vicinity of the Brazilian \nembassy who were killed. And the President is asking \nfor dialogue, so as to return to the road to democracy. \nSo let us send the expression of our strongest solidarity \nto the people of Honduras and President Zelaya, and let \nus ask that the United Nations resolution be complied \nwith, and the resolution of the Organization of \nAmerican States. \n The United States Government \u2014 and this is \nstrange \u2014 has not recognized that a military coup \nd\u2019\u00e9tat has occurred. President Zelaya told me today \nthat there is some friction between the State \nDepartment and the Pentagon. Yesterday I was reading \nPentagonism, a book by the great Dominican author \nJuan Bosch, who was overthrown by imperialism. The \nPentagon is the imperial cave. They do not want \nObama. They do not want change. They want to \ndominate the world with their military bases, with all \ntheir threats, their bombs, their soldiers and bases. \n The Pentagon is behind the coup in Honduras. \nPresident Zelaya was dragged out of his home, out of \nhis bed, at dawn on 28 June, taken to a plane, bundled \nup by Honduran soldiers under command from the \nUnited States base there, in Palmerola. The plane took \noff from Tegucigalpa and landed at the Palmerola base. \nThey held the Honduran President there for some time. \nThen they decided to take him to Costa Rica. The \nAmerican military in Honduras knew about the coup; \nthey supported it. They supported the Honduran \nmilitary. Hence the contradictions that Obama has to \nface. \n At times we wonder if are there two Obamas \u2014 \nthe one who spoke here yesterday and the other \u2014 a \ndouble? The one who supports, or allows his military \nto support, the coup on Honduras? I want to present \n \n \n5 09-52425 \n \nthis question for thought. Is there one Obama, or are \nthere two? Let us hope the one we heard yesterday will \nprevail. That is what the world needs; that is what the \nworld is calling for. \n What is the backdrop of the coup in Honduras? It \nhas to do with everything we are talking about here \u2014 \nit is the revolution of the South. It is not the kind of \nrevolution where there are columns of guerrillas, \nheroes such as in the Sierra Maestra, heroes of the high \nmountains of Bolivia, where Ernesto Che Guevara was. \n But this is not that kind of revolution. This \nrevolution is different. It does not break out in the \nmountains with guerrilla groups. No, it starts in the \ntowns among the masses. It is a mass revolution, but it \nis peaceful and wants to remain peaceful. It is \ndemocratic, deeply democratic. \n Do not be afraid of democracy. Here, I am \nparaphrasing Noam Chomsky in another wonderful \nwork that I did not know until I obtained the book in \nMadrid a few days ago. I went to visit my friend, the \nKing of Spain, mainly because an Ibero-American \nsummit was coming up in Portugal, and I said that I \nwould go if he did not tell me to shut up. He told me \nthat he would not. So, I am going. King Juan Carlos \nand I are great friends. I went to a recommended \nbookshop \u2014 La Casa del Libro \u2014 in Madrid, and I got \nChomsky\u2019s book Fear of Democracy. We should all \nread that book, Fear of Democracy.  \n The elite are afraid of the people. They are afraid \nof true democracy, which Abraham Lincoln, another \nmartyr, defined very clearly in three ideas: democracy \nis government of the people, by the people and for the \npeople. It is not government of the bourgeoisie or of \nthe elite when the people rise up and the thugs are \npushed out. That happened in Honduras, and in \nVenezuela in 2002. It happened in Brazil with Jo\u00e3o \nGoulart, and in the Dominican Republic. Why were the \npeoples of Latin America and of the Caribbean not \nallowed to build their own future in the twentieth \ncentury? They did not let them.  \n This century is ours. This century, in Latin \nAmerica and in the Caribbean we will build our own \nway and no one can stop it. No one can stop it. \nImperialism must end. At times, one wonders. I was \nonce asking Lula what America, our Latin America, \nwould be today if the Governments of the United States \nhad not dug their claws into our America to impose a \nmodel by violently cutting off the hope and the \nstruggle of millions of people, extinguishing the dawn. \n I was born in 1954. Fidel was already in prison, \nand they were dropping bombs in Guatemala. They \ninvaded the Guatemala of Jacobo \u00c1rbenz Guzm\u00e1n; and \nthen the Bay of Pigs, although they failed there; then \nthis revolutionary Cuba \u2014 admirable, but blockaded.  \n I call on Obama to lift the blockade on Cuba. \nWhat is he waiting for? Let him do what he says. Or \nare there two Obamas? Yesterday, Obama said, and I \nnoted it \u2014 here, I noted down Lula, who spoke before \nObama, and then I noted Obama\u2019s words \u2014 that a \npolitical system cannot be imposed on any people and \nthat each people and its sovereignty must be respected. \nThen what is President Obama waiting for to order the \nlifting of the brutal and murderous blockade on Cuba? \nDoes anyone have doubts about that? Does anyone \nthink that it is rhetorical? No. There is persecution \nagainst businesses in any part of the world that provide \neven food to Cuba, and now also to Venezuela.  \n Not long ago, Fidel Castro mentioned in one of \nhis reflections that a company known throughout the \nworld that manufactures and supplies medical \nequipment did not meet its obligations to the \nGovernments of Cuba or of Venezuela this past year or \nthe one before. They did not send the spare parts for \nhundreds of pieces of medical equipment that the two \nGovernments had bought to bring free quality health \ncare to our peoples. These include 64-row CT scanners \nand electrocardiogram machines that are now in the \npoor areas of Caracas. Where the indigenous people \nlive, there are medical facilities. We have 30,000 \nCuban doctors there and a free, good health-care \nsystem for the people. We tried to quietly find solutions \nwith the company \u2014 Philips \u2014 but the company has \nrefused to send the spare parts for that high-tech \nequipment. Why? Under pressure from whom? From \nthe Government of the United States? Is it this Obama \nor another Obama? Is it Obama one or Obama two? \nWho are you, Obama? Who are you? I want to believe \nin yesterday\u2019s Obama, whom I saw here, but these \nthings keep happening, and they affect the lives of \nmillions of human beings. Why? In whose name? Why \ndoes the United States continue to do that? \n It is fear of democracy, just as happened in \nHonduras. It is the fear of the Bolivarian Alliance for \nthe Americas that rises up as a new and innovative \nmechanism of solidarity, and we have brought into line \n  \n \n09-52425 6 \n \nthe Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our Americas \nand the Governments and the countries of Cuba, \nNicaragua, Honduras, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, \nAntigua and Barbuda, Dominica and Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines. They attack us and try to stop us, but \nthey will not succeed. The Common Market of the \nSouth and the Union of South American Nations are \nbeing set up and are all part of the great historic Latin \nAmerican geographic and geopolitical revolution.  \n Along the same lines are the seven military bases \nthat the United States is going to establish in \nColombia. Yesterday, Obama spoke \u2014 I have it noted \nhere \u2014 about four pillars. Everyone remembers that. \nSo let us accomplish that. I take him at his word. We \ntake the President of the United States at his word: \nnuclear non-proliferation, agreed? They could begin by \ndestroying all the nuclear weapons that they have. \nThen go ahead and destroy them.  \n Obama\u2019s second pillar \u2014 the first was \nnon-proliferation \u2014 is the pursuit of peace. So, \nPresident Obama, let us pursue peace in Colombia, in \ndear sister Colombia. There is a civil war in Colombia. \nThat some do not want to acknowledge it is another \nmatter. There is a long-standing, historical conflict in \nColombia. The United Nations must acknowledge it \nand consider it, and we all should extend a hand to \nColombia, while of course respecting its sovereignty, \nto pull it from and help it out of that tragedy that that \nbrother people is experiencing. \n I remember that I mentioned that peace to Obama \nin front of Lula in Trinidad and Tobago at the Summit \nof the Americas. Let us seek peace in Colombia. If \nonly peace were achieved in Central America, in \nGuatemala. When I was an active soldier, I was in \nGuatemala. That was war. It was war, with thousands \nand thousands dead and disappeared. Look at \nEl Salvador and Nicaragua. And now Daniel Ortega is \nback in Government after almost 20 years. The \nSandinista people brought him back. \n What is good for the goose is good for the gander. \nFarabundo Mart\u00ed and the people of El Salvador brought \nPresident Fun\u00e9s to the presidency of that sister \nrepublic. Peace was achieved \u2014 I know President \nArias is here \u2014 and if peace was achieved in Central \nAmerica, my God, why can peace not be achieved in \nColombia? This is one of the greatest desires of my \nlife. I am Venezuelan, but I feel like a Colombian \u2014 \nthe Colombia of Bolivar, the Colombia of Miranda, our \nColombia.  \n Is President Obama thinking of seeking peace \u2014 \nhis second pillar \u2014 with seven more military bases in \nColombia? These seven bases are a threat, not only for \nthe possible peace in Colombia but for peace in South \nAmerica. We are right \u2014 we the Governments of South \nAmerica \u2014 to have said, each in our own way and in \nour own degree of intensity, how concerned we are \nabout the installation of these seven American military \nbases on Colombian territory. I would like to denounce \nit and point it out. I ask President Obama to think about \nit and that he apply his pillars. \n Let us promote peace. The United Nations could \nset up a peace commission in Colombia or Venezuela. \nNaturally, we would cooperate, I am sure, all countries \nthat want peace. We do not want any more war among \nourselves. \n I will skip some pages. There is another topic that \nFidel touches upon in his 21 September thoughts. It has \nto do with climate change. I am going to take another \ntwo minutes, Mr. President, to insist on this point. \nSome people think this is a metaphysical concern, it is \nfor intellectuals. No, we are destroying our planet. As a \nreputable Venezuelan journalist has said, this rocket we \nare travelling on \u2014 because this planet is like a rocket \nship \u2014 we are destroying it.  \n Fidel says, in his piece entitled \u201cA species in \ndanger of extinction\u201d, from 21 September 2009, \u201cAt \nthe international environmental conference held by the \nUnited Nations in Rio de Janeiro\u201d \u2014 that was in 1992; \nI remember because I was in jail at the time \u2014 \u201cI \nstated, as the then head of the Cuban State, \u2018A species \nis in danger of extinction \u2014 man\u2019\u201d. Fidel goes on to \nsay:  \n  \u201cWhen I uttered and backed up those words, \nreceived and applauded by the heads of State in \nattendance \u2014 including the President of the \nUnited States, a Bush less dismal than his son \nGeorge W. \u2014 they still believed that they had \nseveral centuries to confront the problem. I \nmyself\u201d \u2014 Fidel \u2014 \u201cdid not envision a date any \ncloser than 60 or 80 years. \n  \u201cToday we are dealing with a truly \nimminent danger and its effects are already \nvisible. \n \n \n7 09-52425 \n \n  \u201cAverage temperatures have increased \n0.8 degrees centigrade since 1980.\u201d \n That is scientific data, according to the NASA \nInstitute for Space Studies \u2014 0.8 degrees in the last \nalmost 30 years. Fidel continues,  \n  \u201cThe last two decades of the twentieth \ncentury were the warmest in hundreds of years. \nThe temperatures in Alaska, the Canadian west \nand eastern Russia have gone up at a pace that \ndoubles the world average. Arctic ice has been \nquickly disappearing and the region can \nexperience its first completely ice-free summer as \nsoon as the year 2040. The effects are visible in \nthe 2-kilometre-high masses of ice melting in \nGreenland, the South American glaciers, from \nEcuador all the way to Cape Horn, fundamental \nsources of water, and the gigantic ice cap \ncovering the extensive area of Antarctica.  \n  \u201cCurrent carbon dioxide concentrations \nhave reached the equivalent of 380 parts per \nmillion, a figure surpassing the natural range of \nthe last 650,000 years.\u201d \n We are destroying our planet. We must be aware \nof this, and we must act, as Lula stated at the 3rd \nmeeting yesterday. With respect to climate change, \nLula said there is no will. The most developed \ncountries do not want to take decisions. But Obama \nsays they do. But we are told that the United States is \ngoing to take some decisions. Please do, Mr. President, \ndo that. But now is time to move from words to action. \nLet us save this planet. Let us save the human race.  \n Let us hope that the summit in Denmark in \nDecember will produce decisions, truly forceful ones. \nVenezuela is willing to accept those decisions. \nVenezuela calls on everyone to take decisions \nproportionate to the extent of their responsibility.  \n Now, what is the basic cause of this \ncontamination? It is hyper-consumption. We are \nexhausting the petroleum, gas and other fossil fuel \nreserves. Reserves that accumulated over millions of \nyears are being burned in a single century, in less than \na century.  \n And that of course has to do with the economy. I \nshall not read this document, Mr. President; I shall \nmerely refer to it. It is the Stiglitz report. I invite the \nAssembly to analyse it. Yesterday the President of \nFrance also invited the Assembly to analyse it. It is \nthanks to him that the report of the Stiglitz \nCommission exists. But it is nothing more than a mere \ngesture.  \n The report contains 12 recommendations of the \nStiglitz Commission. Let us assess them. I think that \nthey address the substance, although they do not \nquestion the capitalist model. We socialists do question \nthat model, but let us talk about it, let us find \nconsensus solutions for the circumstances and later for \nthe medium and long terms.  \n In its recommendations, the Stiglitz report says, \nfirst, that we should look at income and consumption \nto assess material well-being. Second, it recommends \nprioritizing the family perspective; third, taking into \naccount the heritage; fourth, giving more importance to \nredistribution of income beyond the average. Fifth, it \nrecommends expanding indicators of non-commercial \nactivities. For example, certain services such as child \ncare, bricklaying, plumbing and carpentry appear in \nnational accounts only if they are carried out by a \nsalaried person.  \n Delegates know that this has to do with \naccounting for gross domestic product (GDP). These \nare merely capitalist mechanisms. According to the \nreport, the following is certain: the GDP rises with \ntraffic, while the anxiety of the people also rises, just \nas the unhappiness of passers-by and passengers in \ntraffic rises as they lost precious time in the traffic.  \n The GDP rises. Why is it rising? It is rising \nbecause more gasoline is consumed. Moreover, \npollution increases. We know why. The capitalist world \nhas created measuring methods for the economy that \nare destructive. That is why I think the Stiglitz report \noffers important considerations. Here, in its second \npoint, it says that we should establish a battery of \nindicators for the environment and for climate change. \n Turning to the economy, this report is very \ntimely. Let us now adopt it, and above all, \nGovernments, particularly Governments of the most \ndeveloped countries \u2014 I think they are meeting in \nPittsburgh today, not as the Pittsburgh Pirates, but as \nPresidents of the Group of 20 \u2014 should discuss it. \nTomorrow I will ask Lula and Cristina how the meeting \nwent, because they are coming to Caracas on their way \nto Margarita Island for the Africa-South American \nsummit.  \n  \n \n09-52425 8 \n \n The economy, the economy, the economy. We are \nin favour of socialism, but let us discuss it and talk \nabout indicators and methods and modes of production. \nAs President Obama said yesterday with regards to his \nfourth pillar, we need an economy that serves human \nbeings. Well, President Obama, that is called socialism. \nCome over to the side of socialism, President Obama, \ncome join the axis of evil and we will build an \neconomy that truly serves human beings. It is \nimpossible to do that with capitalism. Capitalism only \nbenefits a minority and excludes the majority. Besides, \nit destroys the environment and destroys lives. That is \ncapitalism. \n Finally \u2014 and I think I have now been speaking \nfor my allotted 10 minutes \u2014 I will end with a phrase \nof Lula\u2019s. He was the first speaker in the Assembly \nyesterday. He said there is no political will. I have \nalready commented on that, and I would add to it \nbecause I know Lula and I know exactly what he said \nto us. He is calling upon all of us to strengthen political \nwill. \n Unlike other Governments elsewhere, which have \ndoubts and do not want to change despite the terrible \ncrisis in which we are living, we in southern America \nhave a lot of political will \u2014 here I am speaking for \nVenezuela and, I know, also for South America, for \nLatin America \u2014 a tremendous political will for true \nchange.  \n I recommend this book by Istv\u00e1n M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, a \ngreat Hungarian philosopher and thinker who has been \na professor at various universities in London for many \nyears: Beyond Capital: Toward a Theory of Transition. \nI think the book is among the greatest writings of the \ntwentieth century. It is a complete renewal of socialist \ntheory. In one of the interesting chapters M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros \nquotes another great person, Karl Marx. We must not \nbe afraid of Karl Marx \u2014 he was the Einstein of \npolitics. Yes, he was demonized, but Karl Marx was \nright about so many things. \n Quoting Marx, M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros says in this book that \ncrises act as a general threat and thus urgently lead us \nbeyond presuppositions towards a new historic \nparadigm. We need a new historic paradigm. For years \nwe have been hearing about a new world, but what \nactually exists is this old, moribund order. We need the \nnew order to be born, the new historic paradigm, the \nnew political paradigm, a new global paradigm. \nYesterday Al-Qadhafi said here that we need a new \ninstitutionalism, a new economy, a new society, but \ntruly new \u2014 a world that is new.  \n Now, I think Lula said yesterday \u2014 he finished \nspeaking at 10:10 in the morning \u2014 that we must \nbecome the midwives of history. I agree. I would add \nto what Lula said. Has the birth already started? The \nbirth is not a future event; it is here. Let us be, as \nComrade Lula said, midwives of the new history, \nprevailing over those who would bury it. Let us \nstruggle on the planet for the birth of this new history, \nthis new time, this new multi-polar, free world, this \neconomy at the service of all people, not of minorities, \nthis world of peace.  \n I am a Christian. One day Christ said, \u201cMy \nkingdom is not of this world.\u201d It is of a future world, \nthe reign of love among us, where we can truly live as \nbrothers and sisters. \n Last Sunday in Havana \u2014 and I will put my little \nbooks away and I will wind up now \u2014 on the Plaza de \nla Revoluci\u00f3n there was a great concert, the \u201cConcert \nfor Peace\u201d, with Miguel Bos\u00e9, Juanes, Olga Ta\u00f1\u00f3 and \nCuban singers. Silvio Rodr\u00edguez was there \u2014 the Great \nSilvio \u2014 and they sang to the whole world. Some \npeople in Miami went crazy and tried to destroy \nJuanes\u2019 CDs \u2014 that great Colombian \u2014 just because \nhe had gone to sing on the Plaza of the Revolution. \nHow crazy can you get? Fortunately they are a \nminority. Silvio was there with his guitar, and I am sure \nhe sang, \u201cThis era is giving birth to a heart\u201d. He ends \nhis song, Cita Con Angeles, like this: \u201cLet us be a tiny \nbit better and a little less selfish.\u201d \n Cheers!"

        "file_text": "This session is being \nheld at a time of unprecedented efforts made by States \nand international institutions to overcome the global \nfinancial and economic crisis. Unfortunately, the \npresent state of regional and national anti-crisis \nprogrammes and the huge cost of their implementation \ndo not yet guarantee the stabilization of the world \nfinancial market, growth of demand and the revival of \neconomic activity in the industrial sphere. \n In our opinion, effectively overcoming the global \ncrisis and mitigating its consequences largely depend \non the effectiveness and coordination of measures \ntaken within individual States and by the world \ncommunity as a whole \u2014 as well as, in particular, on \nthe development of new rules to regulate financial \nmarkets that meet modern requirements, and on \nensuring stricter control over the efficient use of \nenormous State and corporate financial assets by \ntransnational and national banking institutions in order \nto avoid a new wave of inflation and economic bubbles \nand a collapse in the commodities and stock markets. \n I would like to say a few words about the \nmeasures taken in Uzbekistan to mitigate and \nneutralize the impact of the world financial and \neconomic crisis. Our own model of transition from a \ncentralized plan and ideological system to a free \nmarket, which is based on five well-known principles, \nhas played a key role in those measures and in ensuring \nstability during the 1990s as well as the balanced \ndevelopment of Uzbekistan\u2019s economy. Another \nelement of success is our 2009-2012 anti-crisis \nprogramme, which is being carried out at this time. \n Thanks to the measures taken, macroeconomic \nstability, steady annual rates of economic growth \naveraging 8 to 9 per cent, low rates of inflation, the \nwide-scale attraction of foreign investments and an \nincrease in the real level of income of the population \nhave been ensured in the country in recent years. For \nthe first half of 2009 and continuing throughout, gross \ndomestic product growth amounted to 8.2 per cent. \n From this high rostrum, I would like to speak \nbriefly about problems related to the growing threats to \nenvironmental security. Those include not only the \nthreats arising from global warming, but also the \nserious problems of possible technological accidents \nand risks posed by gigantic hydropower installations in \nthe region, which could seriously undermine the fragile \necological balance of Central Asia. \n We speak of these problems while keeping in \nmind the human-caused accidents at the world\u2019s largest \nhydropower stations and hydraulic installations caused \nby their inadequate design and operation \u2014 for \nexample, the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya \nhydropower station in Russia. We who live in Central \nAsia are seriously concerned about similar large hydro-\ninstallations operating today in watersheds of the \nlargest transboundary rivers \u2014 the Amu-Darya and the \nSyr-Darya \u2014 and providing water to the populations of \nall of the countries of the region. \n The active manipulation of public opinion and \nattempts to attract wide-scale investments to build the \ntwo newest and largest hydropower stations \u2014 Rogun \non the Amu-Darya river and Kambarata on the \nSyr-Darya river \u2014 are occurring today without taking \ninto account the fact that the glaciers on the Pamir and \nTian Shan mountains, which are the basic sources of \nwater for these rivers, are shrinking every year. In \naddition, and of particular importance \u2014 even without \nconsidering the possible tragic consequences of \npotential technological accidents at these installations \u2014 \nis the knowledge that these territories have seismic \nratings ranging from 9 to 10 on the Richter scale and \nare more prone to strong earthquakes. \n In this regard, Uzbekistan will continue to insist \nthat all planned construction of large hydropower \ninstallations in Central Asia be implemented only after \nimpartial evaluation by international experts under the \nauspices of the United Nations in order to avoid \npossible catastrophic consequences. There is also an \nurgent need to re-evaluate the existing large \nhydropower stations on the Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya \nrivers that were constructed in the Soviet period. \n The war in Afghanistan, where tensions are \ncurrently growing, is one of the main sources of \n  \n \n09-52604 10 \n \nconcern to the world community today and in \nparticular of security threats in Central Asia. This \nproblem and ways to resolve it are, without \nexaggeration, the focus of attention of the world\u2019s \nlargest Powers and the international community today. \nIt is no longer a secret that the Afghan problem, which \nbegan 30 years ago, has no military solution. The \noverwhelming majority of countries involved in \nsettling the conflict agree on this. \n It is impossible to improve and radically change \nthe situation in the country without solving such urgent \nissues as the reconstruction of Afghanistan\u2019s economy, \ncommunications and social infrastructure destroyed by \nwar; without involving the Afghan people in this \nprocess; without a thoroughly considered and seriously \norganized negotiation process and the achievement of \nconsensus between the conflicting parties; and without \nstrengthening the vertical power structure. \n It is extremely important to pay full respect to the \ndeep historical and ethno-demographic roots of the \nmultinational people of Afghanistan, including the \ntraditional values of Islam and of all confessions, \nwhich should be the main condition and guarantee of \nthe negotiating process. \n The settlement of the Afghan problem could be \nfacilitated by the creation of the six plus three contact \ngroup under the auspices of the United Nations, with \nthe participation of the plenipotentiary representatives \nof the States neighbouring Afghanistan plus Russia, the \nUnited States and NATO. The President of the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, has repeatedly \nemphasized that the implementation of this initiative \ninvolving neighbouring countries would allow the \nachievement of an accord both in and around \nAfghanistan. \n The interdependence of regional and global \nproblems necessitates close cooperation between the \nUnited Nations and such regional structures as the \nShanghai Cooperation Organization. In its capacity as \nthe current Chair of the Shanghai Cooperation \nOrganization, Uzbekistan intends to intensify \ninteraction between the United Nations and the \nShanghai Cooperation Organization by turning the \ncooperation into a real partnership.  \n In our opinion, interaction between the United \nNations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization \nshould develop in such priority areas as security and \nstability and economic, social and humanitarian \ndevelopment, as well as other spheres of mutual \ninterest. We believe that the effective combination of \nthe United Nations great experience and the Shanghai \nCooperation Organization\u2019s potential will strengthen \nregional and international security and promote \nsustainable development in the countries of the region. \nIn this regard, we call upon Members of the United \nNations to support a draft resolution on cooperation \nbetween the United Nations and the Shanghai \nCooperation Organization, to be considered during the \nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. \n In conclusion, I would like to confirm \nUzbekistan\u2019s commitment to developing constructive \nmultilateral cooperation within the framework of the \nUnited Nations for solving the most topical issues on \nthe international agenda.

        "file_text": "I wish to pay \ntribute to the President of the General Assembly and \nthe Secretary-General for their dedication to their \nnoble missions.  \n For once, I do not wish to conclude my statement \nwith the issue of the Comorian island of Mayotte, as I \nusually do. I should like to address that sensitive issue \nfirst. It affects not only the unity and integrity of the \nComoros and its history and international law, but also \npeace in the region of the Indian Ocean.  \n The General Assembly has condemned the French \npresence on the Comorian island of Mayotte several \ntimes, because the Comoros was admitted to the \ninternational community with its colonial borders, \nwhich include the islands of Mayotte, Anjouan, Moheli \nand Grand Comore. Despite many relevant and final \nUnited Nations resolutions and several consultations \nheld on the island, France continues to hold \nreferendums on Mayotte to definitively anchor that \nComorian island to the French Republic. Those \nconsultations have made it possible to change the \nstatus of the Comorian island of Mayotte several \ntimes \u2014 only within the framework of internal French \nlaw \u2014 until, through the most recent consultation, the \nisland became the 101st French department.  \n Moreover, it should be noted that the relations \nbetween France and the Comoros are unique. Indeed, \ndespite the dispute arising from the separation of one \nisland from its three sisters \u2014 thus handicapping the \nComoros Archipelago by changing it into a three-\nlegged cow, as President Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane \nsaid \u2014 the Comoros, contrary to what one might think, \nenjoys a special partnership with France.  \n France is present on the Comoros in the sense \nthat, in the international community, it is always \nassociated with major decisions that affect my \ncountry\u2019s future. France remains the primary economic \npartner of the Comoros. It is one of the largest \ncontributors of development assistance to my country. \nMore than 200,000 Comorian citizens live on French \nsoil. Those are just a few examples to demonstrate that \nno hostility exists between our two peoples or our two \ncountries. And we are firmly resolved not only to \n \n \n09-52320 2 \n \ncontinue that special partnership, but also to reaffirm it \neven more.  \n However, this desire for harmony in no way \nconstitutes a renunciation of our firm attachment to the \nterritorial integrity of our country. That is why I have \ntaken the initiative to come here to solemnly present to \nFrance, before the entire international community, a \nproposal to resolve this dispute.  \n In fact, I propose to France that it recognize that \nthe four islands of the Comoros Archipelago remain an \nindivisible nation based on the principle of one \ncountry, two administrations. By that principle, I mean \nthat France recognizes the full sovereignty of the \nUnion of the Comoros throughout its territory while \ncontinuing to administer the Comorian island of \nMayotte.  \n Obviously, both parties must reach agreement on \nthe duration of the French presence on the Comorian \nisland of Mayotte. On the other hand, we request that \nFrance actively assist in the economic development of \nthe three other islands to achieve a certain balance \nthroughout the Archipelago \u2014 a balance that will \nnecessarily encourage a harmonious rapprochement \namong them and will enable the Comorian island of \nMayotte to finally return to its natural home. This \nprocess will enable our brothers and sisters of Mayotte \nto maintain their social advantages and their standard \nof living and the other three islands to rise to the many \ndevelopment challenges they face. \n I am convinced that with the active participation \nof the whole of the international community these new \nproposals, which should become part of the \nnegotiations between France and the Comoros, would \nlead to a happy outcome. France and the Comoros have \nnearly two centuries of life together, two centuries of \nshared history, culture and language. We do not have \nthe right to spoil that patrimony by allowing \nmisunderstandings to persist, by continuing to let play \nout the tragedies that make of the sea lane between \nAnjouan and Mayotte one of the greatest maritime \ncemeteries in the world. For all of these reasons we \ncome here, in the full view of the world, to \ndemonstrate our good will, which we dare to hope will \nnever be obliterated by an attitude of inflexibility or \nintransigence. \n We meet every year in these prestigious \nsurroundings to debate questions of peace, security and \ndevelopment. Unfortunately, we have to acknowledge \nthat our joint efforts do not always lead to conclusive \nresults, since as of today numerous challenges remain, \nand their consequences for our countries and our \npeoples are becoming ever more dire.  \n Certainly, some progress can be seen here and \nthere, yet our people continue to suffer hunger, \nmalnutrition and sickness. Our children do not have the \nbenefit of an education of the quality necessary to \nassure them a better future. Health care remains a \nluxury for most of our citizens. Some of our villages \nand even cities suffer a cruel lack of basic social \nservices, indeed even of potable water and electricity.  \n Finally, many of our countries, particularly small \nisland States like my own, are threatened by multiple \nnatural catastrophes whose consequences only \naggravate an already fragile socio-economic situation. \nCertain of our nations are even at risk of no longer \nappearing on the map of the world in a few years. That \ncatastrophic situation, which prevails in an era when, \nparadoxically, every day sees enormous technical and \ntechnological advances, must challenge and incite us to \nredouble our efforts to find appropriate responses. \n Thus a genuine international mobilization \u2014 \nespecially on the part of those countries most equipped \nto face the challenges confronting us all \u2014 is required. \nWe must take concrete, urgent and concerted action \nand make a determined stand against the consequences \nof the economic, financial and food crises that lash all \nour countries without distinction. \n I believe now is the time to demonstrate active \nsolidarity and pragmatism if we want our words to \ntranslate into concrete actions and if we want to \nrekindle hope in our peoples, who have suffered more \nthan enough. Obviously our developing nations are not \nasking for the moon \u2014 at least not for now. We merely \nask that we join our efforts to satisfy the legitimate \ndemands of our peoples, who only aspire to live better \nand with dignity, peace and peace of mind. \n Our Organization has a great role to play in the \nrealization of that goal, and for its voice to reach as far \nas necessary we must all agree on the need to bring to \nits various branches the necessary reforms. Indeed, \nonly an organization that is more representative, more \ndemocratic and more equitable in its various \ninstitutions will be in a position to better address the \nproblems all countries face, to understand them and \nconceive the solutions most likely to produce more \npeace, stability and development. \n \n \n3 09-52320 \n \n Furthermore, in the framework of respect for \nhuman rights and good international governance, the \nabusive use of universal jurisdiction should be fought \nby working for a better structure for such jurisdiction, \nbut also to put in place an organ to regulate the \nprinciple of jurisdiction itself. A better definition of the \nconcept of the responsibility to protect should also be \nsought, with sufficient time allocated to seriously \nconsider its implementation. \n Peace and security remain essential conditions for \nthe promotion of socio-economic development. Thus \nthe conflict conditions that prevail in numerous regions \nof the world call out a challenge to us. We must show \ngreater solidarity in regard to the populations of \nregions that for years on end have known only \ndesolation, despair and humiliation. \n We should also celebrate the initiative undertaken \nby President Barack Obama in the Middle East, which \noffers the hope of seeing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \nresolved through a solution that is just, equitable and \nacceptable to the parties involved \u2014 notably the \nsolidification of the two-State principle, as stipulated \nby the various United Nations resolutions on the \nmatter. \n Moreover, I take this opportunity to applaud the \npresence among us of His Excellency President Barack \nObama, whose charisma, dynamism and sense of \njustice renew our hope to see the United States of \nAmerica act with more engagement and pragmatism in \nthe service of peace, justice and development in the \nworld.  \n I will not neglect to mention Iraq, Afghanistan, \nSomalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Great \nLakes region and Darfur, where fratricidal conflicts \nonly further exacerbate poverty and underdevelopment. \nWe therefore urge the international community to offer \nits assistance to those brother countries so as to put an \nend to that unfortunate situation. \n I cannot close this chapter on crises and conflicts \nwithout wishing my Malagasy brothers and sisters \ncomplete success in the ongoing negotiations for a \npeaceful transition that quickly leads to peace and \nstability being restored in this sister island and to \nrenewed efforts for its economic prosperity. \n Here, I would also like to reiterate the \nunwavering support of the Union of the Comoros to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and to the Kingdom of \nMorocco in their legitimate efforts to recover their \nterritorial integrity. \n To conclude, I am greatly honoured to express the \nwarm thanks and deep appreciation of the Comorian \ndelegation to all the American authorities, in particular \nthose of the State of New York, for the good \narrangements to ensure us a pleasant stay in this great \nand beautiful country.  \n(spoke in Arabic) \n I beseech God that we have a session that serves \nhumanity."

        "file_text": "First, I would like to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Treki on his election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. Afghanistan looks forward to working with \nhim over the next year and to strengthening \ninternational responses to the crises that we are facing \ntoday. \n Since its inception the United Nations has been \ninstrumental in addressing the world\u2019s challenges, \nparticularly in the global South. But significant \nchallenges remain unresolved. The growing gap \nbetween and within nations in terms of opportunity and \nprosperity reminds us that we are still far from meeting \nthe ideals and objectives of the Charter of the United \nNations for creating a just and secure world. \n Strengthening and restructuring United Nations \nagencies remain pivotal in closing the gap between the \nobjectives of the Charter and the realities of the world. \nThe United Nations is not a forum for lip service. It \nmust embody the ideals of the Charter by providing \npolitical and moral direction and leadership. In our \nincreasingly interdependent world and the \nmultilaterally oriented international system, the United \nNations must assume greater responsibility for finding \ncollective solutions to our challenges.  \n The world, and in particular developing nations, is \nfaced with the threat of poverty, underdevelopment, \nenvironmental degradation, extremism, fundamentalism, \nterrorism, culturally based racism, the spread of weapons \nof mass destruction and the arms race. Rather than just \nmanaging and reacting to problems, the United Nations \nmust find ways to address the structural causes of the \nworld\u2019s problems and conflicts. To this end, closer \ncooperation between the United Nations, the \nInternational Criminal Court, international financial \norganizations and global civil society is vital in moving \ntowards more just and friendly relations among nations. \n Our efforts to address new challenges must be \nfollowed up by redoubling our commitment to resolve \n  \n \n09-52604 40 \n \nremaining historical conflicts, chief among which is \nthe conflict in the Middle East. Afghanistan reiterates \nits call for the full implementation of United Nations \nresolutions and regional initiatives for bringing an end \nto the suffering of the Palestinian nation and creating a \nsafe region for all Middle Eastern nations. \n On the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the \nestablishment of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference, the Islamic world faces a number of \nimportant internal and external questions and issues. \nAddressing those issues and reviving the prominent \nrole of Muslims in contributing to the progress of \nhumanity and civilization can be achieved only if we, \nmembers of the Islamic world, collectively confront \nthe current intellectual stagnation that many of us \nsuffer from. As was the case during the golden era of \nIslamic history, intellectual freedom and creativity \nmust be elevated to our highest social and political \npriorities. The Islamic world is in urgent need of an \nintellectual renaissance. Islamophobia and associating \nMuslims with a violent minority are additional issues \nthat call all of us, particularly Western nations, to seek \neffective ways to confront them.  \n Let me now turn to the situation of my country, \nAfghanistan. Unfortunately, negative coverage of the \nsituation by international media has overshadowed the \nmany positive trends and developments since the \ncollapse of the Taliban regime in 2001. Alongside our \nchallenges, a new Afghanistan is emerging. That \nAfghanistan includes an emerging democracy, \nascendant State institutions, a nascent civil society, a \ngrowing private sector and strong international \nsolidarity. \n I can refer to many examples of how that new \nAfghanistan is advancing. In the fields of education, \nhealth, infrastructure, media and economic growth, the \ngenerous support and sacrifices of the international \ncommunity have been vital in our joint and proud \nachievements in Afghanistan, for which we Afghans \nremain grateful. \n The Afghanistan presidential and provincial \nelections in August demonstrated the many positive \nchanges. It was the first time in the modern history of \nAfghanistan that Afghan institutions were tasked with \norganizing and holding a nationwide election. Taking \ninto account the socio-historic realities of Afghanistan, \nwe passed that national test successfully. In addition to \nit being our first experience, we were faced with \ndangerous enemies who did their utmost to disrupt and \nderail the process by terrorizing Afghan voters. By \nbraving Al-Qaida, the Taliban and other terrorist \ngroups, Afghan voters demonstrated their determination \nand desire to have a modern, moderate and democratic \npolitical system. \n As in any emerging democracy, undoubtedly \nthere were irregularities. But one should not assess a \nyoung, terrorist-inflicted democracy with the criteria \nused for old, stable and prosperous democracies. In \npassing judgement we should be conscious of the \ncontext, the process and the full picture, rather than of \nonly one aspect or issue. \n In due course, the Independent Election \nCommission and the Electoral Complaints Commission \nwill announce and certify the final results of the \nelections. For the sake of the stability and \nconsolidation of our young democratic institutions and \nprocesses, it is imperative that all of us respect and \nsupport their decision. Continuing efforts to \ndelegitimize and undermine the integrity of the process \nand our institutions will certainly result in worsening \nthe situation not only for Afghanistan but also for the \ninternational community. \n Afghanistan still faces significant challenges. \nChief among them is terrorism, which enjoys safe \nhavens and institutional support beyond our borders. \nAs long as terrorist infrastructure, including the \nTaliban leadership, and sanctuaries remain protected, \nAfghanistan, the region and the world will be at the \nmercy of terrorists and their totalitarian ideology and \nobjectives. Only by pursuing a comprehensive strategy \nwith adequate resources, effective implementation and, \nmore importantly, strategic patience, can we address \nour interconnected challenges. The main pillars of such \na comprehensive strategy are security, good \ngovernance, economic development, regional \ncooperation and international solidarity. \n Afghanistan fully endorses President Obama\u2019s \nnew strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan and the new \nassessment by General McChrystal, in particular their \nemphasis on the need for a comprehensive and \nlong-term strategy. The forthcoming international \nconference on Afghanistan will be an opportunity for \nus to review and reiterate our mutual commitment and \ndetermination to address Afghanistan\u2019s remaining \nchallenges. We must renew the sense of partnership \n \n \n41 09-52604 \n \nand cooperation between Afghanistan and the \ninternational community.  \n The principles of good governance, mutual \naccountability and regional cooperation are of the \nhighest priority. There must be a zero tolerance for any \ndrug-related activity or corruption by the Afghan \nGovernment or our international partners. \n What the Afghan nation expects and deserves \nfrom a renewed partnership with the international \ncommunity is assurance of a long-term commitment \nand solidarity. Afghans are rightly fearful of being \nabandoned once again to lawlessness, extremism and \nexternal interference. Abandoning the Afghan nation \nwill undermine the spirit of collective cooperation and \nthe ideals of the United Nations and will weaken the \nmoral credibility of those who fail to honour their \npromises and commitments to Afghanistan for many \ngenerations. Furthermore, it will embolden extremists \nin the region and beyond. \n I have full confidence that with the full support \nand commitment of the family of nations, Afghanistan \nwill be able to overcome the legacy of decades of \nviolence and suffering. We will restore our historic \nposition as a model of cooperation between different \ncultures and as a regional crossroads and hub for trade, \ntransit, transportation and tourism on the Asian \ncontinent."

        "file_text": "I am deeply honoured to \naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the \nRepublic of Moldova. At the outset, I would like to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki \non his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session, to wish him \nsuccess and to assure his Bureau of the full support of \nour delegation. I would also like to pay tribute to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his high \ncompetence and professionalism, and his tireless \nefforts in leading the United Nations in these complex \ntimes. \n The distinguished speakers who have taken the \nfloor in this debate have elaborated extensively on the \nmost pressing issues that the international community \nhas faced over the past year. The current financial and \neconomic crisis, the food and energy crises, the first flu \npandemic of this century, and climate change have \nbeen at the core of deliberations in the United Nations, \nrevealing the central role of the Organization in dealing \nwith these problems. A reformed, robust and effective \nOrganization has to deliver prompt reactions and \nsustainable responses to the major challenges to peace, \nsecurity and development: disarmament and \nnon-proliferation, climate change, food and energy \nsecurity, and the spread of international terrorism. \n We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General \nin strengthening the United Nations and promoting the \ncore values enshrined in our founding Charter: the \nfundamental principles of peace, justice and human \nrights. The Republic of Moldova supports the ongoing \nprocess of reform of the United Nations aimed at \ncreating a revitalized, representative, efficient and \nmore responsive Organization. Following significant \nadvances in the reform of its principal organs, we \nrecognize the steps being undertaken towards reform of \nthe Security Council, which undoubtedly necessitates a \nfirm political pledge on the part of the entire \nmembership.  \n In our opinion, the expansion of the Security \nCouncil is a matter not only of equity but also of \nefficiency. Any proposal for reform of the Council has \nto reflect the legitimate aspirations of the regional \ngroups. Thus, in supporting the expansion of the \nCouncil in both permanent and non-permanent \ncategories, we believe it indispensable to allocate an \nadditional non-permanent seat to the Eastern European \nGroup. \n By virtue of the primary responsibility of the \nSecurity Council laid down in the United Nations \nCharter, its reform should also contain provisions for \nconsolidating United Nations operational capacities in \nthe field and revitalizing peacekeeping operations in \norder to make them more effective and capable of \nachieving their goals, including the development of \ncooperation with regional organizations and Member \nStates for the resolution of conflicts in various areas of \nthe globe. \n Building a safer world requires the greater \ncommitment of Member States in the area of \ndisarmament, arms control and non-proliferation. We \nhave recently witnessed a historic summit of the \nSecurity Council, which voted to stop the spread of \nnuclear arms and endorsed a broad framework of \naction to reduce global nuclear dangers. The Republic \nof Moldova welcomes the results of the most recent \nConference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and looks \nforward to continued positive trends in the work of the \nConference on Disarmament and the Preparatory \nCommittee for the Review Conference of the Parties to \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons. \n The current global economic and financial crisis, \none of the most serious since the creation of the United \nNations, has affected virtually all countries, including \nthe Republic of Moldova. In 2008, the previous \nCommunist Government in Chisinau denied the \nexistence of an economic and financial crisis; only \nafter its defeat in the elections of 29 July 2009 did its \nrepresentatives begin to raise the alarm. \n The current administration, the Alliance for \nEuropean Integration, is assuming full responsibility \n \n \n09-53165 24 \n \nfor managing the economic crisis by attracting funds \nfrom international financial organizations, securing \nforeign investment, providing jobs, reviving the real \nsector of the economy, ensuring the de-monopolization \nof production sectors, and liberalizing exports and \nimports. The liberal democratic Government relies on \nthe support of United Nations institutions and all \ninternational structures in promoting the rule of law, \nsafeguarding fundamental human rights and freedoms, \nand ensuring the functionality of democratic \ninstitutions and the freedom of mass media. \n The Republic of Moldova followed intently the \nwork of the high-level Conference on the World \nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \nDevelopment, held this summer at the United Nations, \nand welcomed the adoption of its Outcome Document \n(resolution 63/303). The Conference highlighted once \nagain the role of the United Nations and gave a strong \nimpetus to the dialogue on identifying solutions for \novercoming the crisis and reforming the international \nfinancial architecture.  \n At the same time, Moldova stands for \nstrengthening the Economic and Social Council\u2019s \ncoordinating role in formulating global economic and \nsocial policies and in further promoting active dialogue \nwith the international financial institutions and the \nGovernments of Member States in implementing the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n Nine years ago, in September 2000, the world\u2019s \nleaders committed our countries to a global partnership \nin fighting poverty and achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Today, in the context of the global \neconomic and financial crisis, considerable common \nefforts on the part of developed and developing \ncountries alike are needed to achieve our commitments \nby 2015. We welcome the decision to convene a high-\nlevel meeting in 2010 dedicated to evaluating the \nMillennium Summit decisions. \n The General Assembly has proclaimed 2009 the \nInternational Year of Reconciliation and the \nInternational Year of Human Rights Learning, and \n21 September as an International Day of Peace. It is in \nthis vein that we would like to reiterate the necessity \nfor an increased United Nations role and strengthened \ncooperation with regional organizations, such as the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nin preventing and managing crisis and conflict \nsituations; guaranteeing respect for and the promotion \nof fundamental human rights in separatist regions; \nundertaking more efficient international actions to \nstabilize the situation in countries affected by internal \nconflict; and taking a complex approach under \ninternational law to mediation and conflict resolution. \nThe intensification of international cooperation with a \nview to solving conflicts and preventing the future \nemergence or escalation of crisis situations that \nthreaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \nStates is of paramount importance for the Republic of \nMoldova, which faces a secessionist movement in the \neastern regions of the country.  \n Respecting the principle of the peaceful \nresolution of conflicts, we are confident that the \ndemilitarization and democratization of the \nTransdniestrian region are indispensable to a viable \nsolution to the Transdniestrian problem. The new \nLiberal Democratic Government\u2019s coalition will \nundertake sustainable efforts to identify a lasting \nsolution to the Transdniestrian problem in the current \nfive plus two format and will consistently urge an \nincreased United States and European Union (EU) role \nin the resolution process. Concurrently, the Republic of \nMoldova will revive its efforts towards the withdrawal \nof foreign troops from the country, replacing the \npresent peacekeeping operation with a multinational \nmission with an international mandate, and achieving \nthe integration of the country in all socio-economic \nsegments by encouraging the broad participation of the \nnon-governmental sector.  \n We will consistently act in accordance with the \nlaw on the basic provisions of the Special Legal Status \nof Localities from the Left Bank of the Dniester River, \nadopted unanimously by Parliament on 22 July 2005. \nFocused on the creation of conditions needed for \nreconciliation and advancing the resolution process, we \nput forward a series of initiatives in 2007 to strengthen \ntrust and security between the two banks of the \nDniester River, in particular by ensuring free \nmovement, instituting common participation in \ndeveloping and implementing projects to restore and \nmodernize infrastructure, and addressing various social \nissues.  \n Unfortunately, the so-called Transdniestrian \nauthorities time and again have undermined these \ninitiatives by introducing illegal customs taxes, \nimpeding the elections process in the villages situated \non the left bank of the Dniester River, and confiscating \nschool premises, gravely violating the right of the \n \n \n25 09-53165 \n \nMoldovan citizens to study in their native language. \nThe implementation of democratic reforms and the \nnormalization of the economic and social climate on \nthe right side of the Dniester will accelerate the \nresolution of the Transdniestrian problem.  \n The Republic of Moldova appreciates the activity \nof the EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and \nUkraine and its close cooperation with the relevant \nborder management bodies in both States. Its \ncontribution to border security and transparency has \ncreated a more constructive atmosphere in which to \nseek a resolution of the Transdniestrian problem. The \nRepublic of Moldova will further direct its efforts to \nresuming negotiations in the existing format in view of \nresolving the Transdniestrian problem. We count on the \nconsistent support and political will of all mediators \nand observers in the resolution of this conflict. \n Ongoing terrorist activities in various parts of the \nworld demonstrate that terrorism continuously \nthreatens the security, fundamental democratic values, \nhuman rights and the letter of the law that are the basis \nof the United Nations Charter. This scourge can be \ndefeated only by firm, common action by the \ninternational community. In this context, we would like \nto reaffirm that the Republic of Moldova fully \nparticipates in the global fight against terrorism by \nimplementing measures at the national level and by \ncontributing to the international community\u2019s efforts. \nThe new Government of Moldova will take concrete \naction in combating international terrorism in \naccordance with international instruments, pertinent \nresolutions of the Security Council and relevant \nnational documents, such as our national strategy for \npreventing and combating money-laundering and the \nfinancing of terrorism.  \n In compliance with the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (see resolution 60/288), the \nRepublic of Moldova will further contribute to future \nUnited Nations efforts at consolidating international \nlegislation to combat terrorism, especially in view of \nfinalizing the negotiations of the comprehensive \nconvention on international terrorism and organizing a \nhigh-level conference on terrorism under United \nNations auspices. We believe that special attention \nneeds to be paid to fighting those aspects of terrorism \nthat are nourished by separatist tendencies that affect \nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. \n Climate change poses a grave challenge to the \ninternational community. Global warming and its \nrelated effects, including natural disasters, have \nbecome major threats to our peoples and to \ninternational security. Its consequences greatly affect \nvulnerable States, compromising economic growth and \nthe achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals. International cooperation is essential to dealing \nwith the obvious threat of climate change. We have to \nraise alarm concerning the urgent need to strengthen \nregional and global cooperation and to enhance the \nassistance of donor States to developing countries and \nto countries with economies in transition.  \n In recent years, the Republic of Moldova has \nbeen confronted with considerable natural calamities, \nfrom acute droughts to severe floods. Each year, the \nintensity and frequency of these phenomena increase. \nThe harm caused to the population, to the agricultural \nand food sectors, as well as to the overall national \neconomy is huge. In this respect, the implementation of \nthe United Nations Conventions addressing climate \nchange and desertification and the development of an \ninternational strategy for disaster reduction are of \nincreasing urgency for countries severely affected by \ndroughts and desertification.  \n The Republic of Moldova recognizes the \nimportance of environmental protection to ensuring the \nsustainable development of the country, as well as the \nneed for this issue to inform all national policies. In \nthis connection, we welcome the outcome of last \nweek\u2019s Summit on Climate Change and strongly \nsupport the continuation of negotiations. We hope that \nwe will conclude the forthcoming Copenhagen \nConference with a new far-reaching document. We \npraise the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts in mobilizing the \npolitical will needed for the adoption of a new, \nequitable and ambitious agreement.  \n The Republic of Moldova strongly supports the \nactivity of the High-Level Task Force on the Global \nFood Security Crisis set up and led by the Secretary-\nGeneral. The efficient collaboration between the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, \nthe Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant \nUnited Nations structures, aimed at mobilizing new \nfunds in order to overcome the global food crisis, will \nsignificantly contribute to the achievement of a \ncomprehensive action plan on food security. We \nsupport the convening of the World Summit on Food \nSecurity in Rome in November this year.  \n \n \n09-53165 26 \n \n The Republic of Moldova is firm in its path \ntowards European integration and committed to the \nuniversal values of peace, democracy, respect for \nhuman rights, the rule of law and economic freedom. \nEuropean integration constitutes the major strategic \ngoal of Moldova\u2019s foreign and internal policies. We \nwelcome positive developments in our relations with \nthe European Union and their progress over the past \nfew years, particularly after the victory of the Alliance \nfor European Integration in the parliamentary elections \nheld on 29 July 2009.  \n The new Government will firmly pursue the goal \nof rehabilitating the image of the Republic of Moldova \nin the international arena and will negotiate in the near \nfuture a new association agreement with the European \nUnion. The leaders of the Alliance for European \nIntegration are firmly committed to an efficient reform \nof the socio-economic system in the Republic of \nMoldova, without which the advancement of the \ncountry towards progress and prosperity is hardly \npossible. Those commitments represent eloquent proof \nof the positive evolution of the political situation in the \nRepublic of Moldova after the recent parliamentary \nelections. The democratic process has been resumed.  \n The new Parliament has accepted the \nresponsibility of complying with all the \nrecommendations formulated by the European \nParliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the \nCouncil of Europe with regard to the events of 7 April. \nThose recommendations call for Moldova to improve \nits electoral legislation and to initiate the process of \ndirect application of EU legislation. From this \nperspective, we count on the support and opportunities \noffered by the United Nations and its Member States to \npromote Moldova\u2019s political and social economic \nobjectives, its aspirations to European integration, the \nresolution of the Transdniestrian problem and the \nwithdrawal of foreign troops. \n In conclusion, I would like to confirm the \nadherence of the Republic of Moldova to the ideals of \nthe United Nations and the will to further cooperate \nthrough concrete action with a view to accomplishing \nthe commitments assumed. While respecting the \ndiversity of views, cultures and religions of everyone, \nwe must also be united in reaching for a common \ngoal \u2014 protecting humanity and preserving human \ndignity as a foremost universal value."

        "file_text": "The people of Panama welcome the very \nsound decision to elect Mr. Ali Treki to serve as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its current \nsession. We are sure that he possesses the vision and \nthe leadership to guide the nations represented here \ntoday. \n I should also like to thank the Secretary-General \nfor his tireless pursuit of dialogue in the interests of \npeace, security and the peaceful coexistence of peoples \nand brothers. \n Yesterday saw the conclusion of the Summit on \nClimate Change. I congratulate all nations for their \ncollaborative efforts in confronting the global-warming \ncrisis. The beauty, resources and biodiversity of our \nshared heritage are in peril. \n Global warming is the most serious symptom of a \ncrisis caused by the excessive exploitation of \nresources. We must apply new formulas, change our \nbehaviour and learn to value our relationship with \nnature. Our options are clear: we can talk or we can \nact. If we do not act with global responsibility, the \nconsequences will be irreversible.  \n Three million years ago, the Isthmus of Panama \nemerged from the sea. We are one of the youngest \ncountries on Earth. As a result of our birth, a land \nbridge was formed between North and South America \nand constituted the narrowest stretch of land between \nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Panama parted the \nseas to unite continents, and generated a new global \nnetwork of ocean currents that transformed the climate \nof the entire planet. The whole world changed when \nPanama came into being. \n Today, all forms of life upon this planet are the \nresult of an evolutionary process that adapted to our \nbirth. The great African savannahs and deserts came \nforth from these changes, and modern man evolved \nfrom those new savannahs. \n Panamanians have always played an important \nrole for our neighbours and for the world at large. In \nthe next five years, it is our duty to demonstrate how \nour economic and governmental model can serve as an \nexample for all who aspire to prosperity and progress. \n I am an entrepreneur, not a politician. I went into \npolitics to change how things are done. I am a simple \nand direct man. I believe that time is very short and \nvery valuable. I will expand upon my experiences in \nthe private sector and put them to work in the public \nsector. \n I was elected to the presidency with an \nunprecedented mandate. Panamanians gave me a clear \nmandate to deliver change to our country and build a \nbetter Panama for all. We are placing the interests of \nthe people first and foremost, above personal or \npartisan interests, because a country is more important \nthan a political party.  \n I have selected the best people to work in our \nGovernment without regard to their political \naffiliations. I have plans for the nation. We want \ncapitalism which is based on opportunities and rewards \nresponsible entrepreneurs who show solidarity, but \n \n \n21 09-52320 \n \ncapitalism which also strongly demands responsibility \nand solidarity from any old-fashioned entrepreneurs \nwho do not satisfy those two criteria.  \n We formed this Government during a crisis. Less \nthan a year ago, we saw the collapse of the \ninternational financial framework. The global \neconomic model was forever changed. Our guiding \nlight is the improvement of our peoples\u2019 quality of life. \nThat is why, during the first 100 days, we increased the \nsalaries of all public officials and distributed $100 per \nmonth to senior citizens over the age of 70 who do not \nhave a pension and require economic aid.  \n We will be building a modern new metro in \nPanama, and it will be the largest employment \nprogramme in the history of the country after the \nexpansion of the canal currently under way. \n We have launched a construction project for low-\ncost housing which will not only provide a safe roof \nover the heads of thousands of Panamanians, but will \ngenerate jobs at difficult times during a crisis.  \n The promises we have made meet the demands of \nour people. But beyond that, they are part of the plan \nwe need to boost our economy.  \n America is a recently populated continent, and \nPanama was the bridge across which the first native \nAmericans crossed to South America. They built great \ncultures and civilizations such as those of the Incas and \nthe Chibchas. When the Spanish arrived, they made our \ncountry into the commercial hub of their colonies. \nWhen Panama separated from Spain, the first railroad \nin the world between the Atlantic and the Pacific was \nbuilt, and that in turn led to the construction of our \ncanal. Today, Panama is the gatekeeper of the global \neconomy. \n We are a small country, with less than 3.5 million \ninhabitants, and services represent more than 75 \nper cent of our gross national product. The United \nStates dollar is our currency. We have a solid banking \nand financial centre which is very conservative and \nstrictly regulated. The Col\u00f3n Free Zone is the largest in \nthe hemisphere, thanks to the most important \ncommercial maritime route in the world, and this \nmakes us the most efficient logistical hub in the \nAmericas.  \n We shall soon begin the construction of a third set \nof locks to expand the capacity of the Panama Canal, \nthereby opening an important gateway for international \ntrade.  \n Panama is an ideal place to invest, to establish \nenterprises and also to live. We will be transforming \nPanama into the Hong Kong or the Dubai of the \nAmericas. Within the new Panama-Pacific Special \nEconomic Area, labour and immigration laws are \nwelcoming and flexible. Throughout our national \nterritory, there are fantastic incentives for investors. \nOur spirit of service and open door policy make \nPanama an enjoyable, exciting place of true \nopportunities.  \n And despite the crisis Panama is growing. Talent \nand creativity, social assistance, infrastructure and \ninvestment in human capital will allow us to weather \nthe storm.  \n Panama was born to serve the world. Everyone is \nmore than welcome in Panama. We are open for \nbusiness. \n We believe in free trade as a tool to improve \npeople\u2019s lives. We want to do business with all nations \nand have signed free trade agreements with our \nstrategic partners. We have already signed one with the \nUnited States. To be ratified, it just needs one small \n\u201cpush\u201d, and I believe that President Obama will deliver \nthat push very shortly. \n In Panama, we are proud of our history and our \nheritage, our freedom of expression and thought, our \nfreedom to determine our country\u2019s direction, and our \ntradition of peace.  \n Peace is the best sentiment that any country or, \nindeed, the whole planet can have. Peace brings with it \ntranquillity, stability and growth. There is absolutely \nno reason why neighbouring peoples should offend one \nanother, because no one wins and we all lose. The \nchildren of Bol\u00edvar share the same history and the same \nchallenges. We have the same blood in our veins. We \nare a single nation. Here, anyone who attacks, attacks \nonly himself. Anyone who retaliates, retaliates against \nhimself. Anyone who bears arms does so against \nhimself. Because here we are all siblings. \n Weapons of war bring poverty. They steal the \nbread from our mouths and the future from our \nchildren. These weapons are not necessary, and at the \nend of the day they solve nothing. Let us sit down \ntogether, for there is nothing that we cannot solve \ntogether. There is nothing like peace. And peace is \n \n \n09-52320 22 \n \nwhat all countries of the world should be pursuing until \nit is achieved. \n I would like to talk here about our sister country \nof Honduras, and the need for it to return to the rule of \nlaw, which is necessary for its well-being and that of \nCentral America. That is why we are closely following \nthe reconciliation in Honduras.  \n The San Jos\u00e9 accord constitutes the best method \nfor formulating a consensus Government that can \noversee new elections and guarantee a peaceful return \nto democracy. Let us allow the Honduran people to \nsolve their destiny and future with one another. We \nPanamanians have the utmost trust in the Honduran \nsociety\u2019s capacity for reconciliation. \n Nothing is stronger than words, either spoken or \nwritten, and through dialogue we understand one \nanother, to paraphrase the poet. Communication is the \nbest conduit for cultures, education, ethnicities, history, \nreligions and politics. In Panama, we are a melting pot \nof races, nationalities and ideologies that, through \ncommunication and mutual respect, has created a \ndiverse society with common interests. That is part of \nour idiosyncrasy and is what makes us who we are.  \n Tolerance is the secret to the coexistence of \npeoples. Nuclear tests make us all nervous, and living \nin a state of alert only serves to increase tensions \nbetween nations whose relations are already less than \nstable. That is why we live in constant fear and \nmistrust, which has a significant impact on dialogue \nbetween us. \n In Panama, we respect the use of science as a tool \nfor human development, but we reject its use as a front \nto conceal nuclear proliferation and the production of \nweapons of mass destruction.  \n A challenge to global peace and security lies in \nthe war on drug trafficking, money-laundering and \narms trafficking. Because it is a crossroads, Panama is \nused by organized crime for drugs and arms trafficking. \nBut we are declaring our own war. We have become an \nactive partner with Mexico and Colombia in the battle \nagainst narco-terrorists. Alongside President Uribe and \nPresident Calder\u00f3n, we are committed to strengthening \nthe ties of cooperation, so that Panama can be an active \nsource of intelligence.  \n The many efforts and improvements that Panama \nhas achieved in this field have been recognized in \nreports by the Financial Action Task Force on Money \nLaundering and the International Monetary Fund. \nPanama has information exchange agreements with \n39 countries to combat money-laundering and the \nfinancing of illicit activities. \n Drugs are not good business. Those who dedicate \nthemselves to them are destined to jail or the cemetery. \nThey have no future. \n Mr. Nasheed (Maldives), Vice-President, took the \n Chair. \n Everyone knows Panama as a banking centre, as a \nplace to do business, and because of our canal. But in \nfact, we are nature\u2019s best-kept secret in the world. \nTourism is our new passion. Panama City has the \nhighest concentration of migratory birds on the planet. \nWe are the hub for America\u2019s flying species. The Gulf \nof Chiriqu\u00ed has the greatest biodiversity of any spot in \nthe eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Forty percent of our \nnational territory is protected. This includes over \n1.5 million hectares of uninterrupted forests between \nChagres and Dari\u00e9n. \n Our national parks have been declared biosphere \nreserves and world heritage sites, as has the island of \nCoiba, a natural jewel where they are still discovering \nnew species and where whales from the Arctic and \nAntarctic meet to give birth to their calves. \n Over 1,000 islands and coral reefs beautify our \nseas, and we are framed by over 2,500 kilometres of \ncoastline, many of them as pristine and untouched as \nwhen Christopher Columbus first arrived in the \nAmericas. \n But the very best resource we have is our people. \nWe are a multiethnic and friendly people. Our \nindigenous peoples of the comarcas are an example of \nresistance to mistreatment at the hands of nature and \ncultural assimilation.  \n All the countries represented in this Hall have \ntheir own wonders that the entire world admires. We \nmust unite to protect and conserve our beauty, \nresources, biodiversity, world heritage and, first and \nforemost, our peoples. \n I am an eternal optimist. I see my country, \nPanama, providing more jobs for its men and women. I \nsee a middle class that keeps growing and earning \nmore. I see new technologies spawning unprecedented \neconomic growth. I see the first country in the world \nwith free internet access for all its citizens. \n \n \n23 09-52320 \n \n I see Panama with better health care, better \neducation, better transportation, and with families that \nare happier and more unified. We Panamanians can do \nanything we dream of. And if each and every one of us \nachieves our dreams, we will have a better world. \n In the five years ahead of us, we are going to \ndream big. Our best days are yet to come. \n If I had to describe Panama in just a few words, I \nwould say we are a country and a people full of \nsurprises. Panama will amaze you, and Panama will \namaze the world."

        "file_text": "As I did \nfour years ago (see A/60/PV.6), I once again extend the \ngreetings of the people and the Government of the \nEastern Republic of Uruguay to this forum, which is \nthe most broadly representative body of today\u2019s world. \n Those of us here are aware of the contrasting \nrealities of the present world; we are conscious that \nnever before has humanity simultaneously been offered \nso many possibilities and faced so many threats as is \nthe case today. We know that we cannot be indifferent \nto or be paralysed by those possibilities and threats; \nnor are we disposed to be, but what are we doing to \ndissipate the threats and take advantage of the \nopportunities presented by this reality? Surely not \neverything we would like to or that we deem necessary, \nand perhaps not all that we are capable of. \n Concerning this task, the Eastern Republic of \nUruguay once again reaffirms its unwavering respect \nfor international law, which is the greatest guarantee \nfor the sovereignty of peoples and their peaceful \ncoexistence. We also reiterate, first, our firm rejection \nof the threat of the use of force or of its use, of \nterrorism, drug trafficking and all types of violence and \ndiscrimination. Secondly, we repeat our determined \nsupport for a peaceful solution to conflicts, to the \nsovereign equality of States, to non-intervention in the \ninternal affairs of States, to the self-determination of \npeoples, to international cooperation in economic and \nsocial matters, and to multilateralism that also includes \nfree trade, because protectionism is to commerce as \nauthoritarianism is to democracy. \n Thirdly, we reiterate our steadfast commitment to \nthe advancement and protection of human rights, \nbecause they constitute the ethics of liberty and \ndemocracy and are aspects of the dignity that we need, \nmuch as we need the air we breathe almost without \nbeing conscious of it. \n Fourthly, we repeat our unwavering responsibility \nin the protection of the environment as a human right \nand as a fundamental aspect of achieving truly \nsustainable development. \n As Americans, we feel it is our ethical duty and \npolitical responsibility to reiterate in this global forum \nthat, first, we reject the institutional rupture in the \nfraternal Republic of Honduras, and we demand the \nimmediate restoration of constitutional order and the \nrestoring to their posts of the authorities democratically \nelected by the Honduran people. Secondly, we will \npersevere in the effort to achieve an American \nintegration without exclusions or exceptions or \nembargoes, such the one imposed on Cuba, one without \nfirst, second or third class members. We are all \nAmericans, and equals. \n Without actions following, postulates are sterile. \nUruguay is one of the main troop contributors to \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. The \ndifficulties that this peacekeeping system is going \nthrough are due, among other factors, to the growing \ndemand for missions, their equally growing complexity \nand the effects of the global economic crisis on the \nfunding for these operations. Far from discouraging us, \nthey stimulate us to bolster and coordinate efforts with \nother Member States and the United Nations \nSecretariat to collaborate in stabilizing the areas \naffected by conflicts, in the protection of the civilian \npopulation, institutional strengthening and the \npromotion of bases for economic and social \ndevelopment of affected countries. Similarly, our \nstaunch rejection of terrorism is not incompatible with \ncooperation among States in the fight against it while \nmaintaining absolute respect for international law and \nhuman rights. \n Uruguay is among the countries that are \nsignatories to the widest range of human rights \nconventions, and on the occasion of the treaty-signing \nceremony for the present period, Uruguay will sign the \nOptional Protocol to the International Covenant on \nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, becoming one \nof the first signatories to that important international \ninstrument. Uruguay is also party to the main \ninternational conventions in the sphere of the \nenvironment and sustainable development. \n As is well known, Uruguay receives significant \ninvestments that contribute to its industrial \ndevelopment, but it also exercises rigorous control over \ntheir environmental quality, applying its internationally \nrecognized regulations, demanding the use of the best \n \n \n39 09-52179 \n \navailable technologies, and practising effective control \nin the field over environmental impacts. Uruguay is \nalso responsible, transparent and reliable as regards \ninvestment for sustainable development. \n In the era of globalization, it is not only the \neconomy that has to be globalized. Peace, freedom, \ndemocracy, justice, dignity and the welfare of the \npeople must be globalized as well. The countries \nrepresented here, each according to its respective \nidentity, are working towards that end, as is Uruguay. \nFaced with the impossibility of discussing the vast \nsystem of policies and actions that are involved in that \ntask, I will mention just two that Uruguayans wish to \nshare with the international community, because they \nconcern the needs, hopes, rights and responsibilities of \nall humankind. \n Our country has taken a firm commitment as \nregards tobacco control policies, both at the \ninternational level through its ratification of the World \nHealth Organization Framework Convention on \nTobacco Control, and at the national level through the \nimplementation of policies for the improvement of the \nwell-being of the population. In 2006, Uruguay became \nthe first smoke-free country in the Americas and the \nseventh in the world. \n This is no insignificant matter when one takes \ninto account that, according to the World Health \nOrganization, smoking is the leading avoidable cause \nof death worldwide. It is an epidemic that annually \ncauses more than 5 million deaths throughout the world \nand more than 1 million in the Americas. Five million \ndeaths a year are far more than those caused by \nalcoholism, traffic accidents, AIDS, illegal drugs, \nmurder, suicide and the H1N1 virus combined. When \nwe add up all the deaths caused by these pathologies, \nwe find that the number of tobacco-related deaths is \ngreater still. If the current trend continues, over the \nnext 20 years tobacco-related deaths will double in the \nworld and triple in our region, and in particular in the \npoorest countries. \n Given that tobacco smoke does not affect \nsmokers alone, in a study published in 1985 the \nEnglish epidemiologist Richard Doll maintained that \nbeing in a room with a smoker for one hour a day is \n100 times more likely to cause lung cancer in a \nnon-smoker than spending 20 years in a building \ncontaining asbestos. \n Our delegation at the United Nations sponsored \nand promoted resolution 63/8, whose implementation \nwill allow us to have, at least in this environment, a \nsmoke-free United Nations. It represents partial but \nauspicious progress in the fight against this epidemic. \n In May 2007, a year after becoming a smoke-free \ncountry, Uruguay set out on the path to becoming a \ncountry with equal-opportunity access to information \ntechnologies. We are achieving this by means of the \nCeibal project, also known as \u201cone laptop per child\u201d, \nwhich consists, precisely, in providing each student and \nteacher of our public primary school system with a free \ncomputer and access to the Internet. By the end of this \nyear, we will have provided a prototype to each of the \n301,143 students and to 12,879 teachers in the \ncountry\u2019s 2,064 public elementary schools. This may \nseem like a small number, but it should be recalled that \nUruguay has only some 3 million inhabitants. \n The project is open to students with learning, \nmotor or visual disabilities, who receive computers \nespecially designed for their needs. Private schools are \nnot excluded from the programme and can take part by \npurchasing the prototype for a modest sum. The Ceibal \nproject is completely funded by the Uruguayan State, \nwhich allocates funds not only for acquiring and \npreparing the prototypes, but also for their maintenance \nand the continuity of the programme. \n The Ceibal project is much more than simply the \nprovision of computers and is therefore worth much \nmore than its price. Its true worth lies in developing \nintelligence, introducing deep changes in teaching and \nlearning, offering equal opportunities in access to \ninformation from childhood on \u2014 because equality is \nnot a right for adults alone \u2014 and providing the \ninformation and knowledge indispensable to becoming \na member of society and thus ensuring its proper \nfunctioning. \n At the beginning of this address, I stated that if \nthe United Nations raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to improve what we \nare as human beings, the Organization must be capable \nof improving itself as a system. But the United Nations \nis those who comprise it \u2014 we ourselves. Uruguay \nreaffirms its commitment to the United Nations reform \nprocess. The process that began at the 2005 Summit, \nwhich saw the creation of two new structures within \nthe Organization \u2014 the Human Rights Council and the \nPeacebuilding Commission \u2014 should be completed \nwith consideration for those issues whose practical \n  \n \n09-52179 40 \n \nimplementation is pending or behind schedule with \nrespect to the goals we have set. \n Michel de Montaigne taught us that there is no \ngreater destiny for human beings than seeing to the \nbusiness of being human. Almost five centuries later, it \nis fitting to remember the teachings of that great \nRenaissance humanist. It should not, however, be \nremembered solely as something of the past; we should \nembrace it as a task of the present and put it into \npractice, or at least try. I believe that there is no other \noption if we really wish to survive as a species and to \nimprove as human beings. I also believe that, if we all \nmake a responsible attempt, we shall achieve it. In that \nconviction, intention and confidence, I greet the United \nNations on behalf of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay."

        "file_text": "On behalf of my \ndelegation I congratulate Mr. Ali Treki on his election \nas President of the sixty-fourth session of the General \nAssembly. I am sure that his wisdom and experience \nwill guide us as we address the challenges on the \nglobal agenda. I would like to pay tribute to the \nimportant work of your predecessor Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann. He led the Assembly\u2019s sixty-\nthird session through complex discussions and \nextensive investigations in a spirit of responsibility and \ngood faith. I also take this opportunity to commend the \nSecretary-General and his staff for their continued \ndedication in overseeing the ongoing efforts for \nimproving the working methods of the Organization \nand its interaction with Member States. \n The world continues to face many challenges, \nboth traditional and new. Whilst traditional challenges \nto international peace and security persist, we also \nhave to cope with non-traditional threats such as \npervasive poverty, deadly diseases, increased \nfrequency and intensity of natural disasters and \nenvironmental degradation. Added to those challenges \nare the energy, food, financial and economic crises, all \nof which are hampering the realization of the \nMillennium Development Goals by the target date of \n2015. \n Our growing interdependence in today\u2019s world \nonly strengthens the understanding that current \nchallenges transcend national borders and therefore \nrequire concerted action and responses from the \ninternational community. The United Nations therefore \nremains the central forum for addressing global issues, \nand we continue to advocate effective multilateralism \nnot as an option but as a necessity. \n In this regard we deem it indispensable for the \nUnited Nations to continue its reform efforts. This \nshould include meaningful reform of the Security \nCouncil, to make it more effective and responsive to \ntoday\u2019s challenging world. Of equal importance is \nstrengthened cooperation within and between regional \ngroups. We should continue to promote and pursue \nintensified channels of political dialogue between \nregional groups in reaffirming our shared commitment \nto multilateralism. \n In this spirit, my country participates in regional \nand interregional endeavours to strengthen political, \neconomic, cultural and social cooperation and \nintegration. I would like to highlight the importance of \nthe United Nations as an effective agent in advancing \nmultilateralism and emphasize the need for it to \nstrengthen its role of consultation and coordination \nwith regional organizations. \n The urgency of the threat posed by climate \nchange requires the same degree of multilateral \nengagement as has been demonstrated in areas ranging \nfrom the fight against the uncontrolled spread of illicit \nsmall arms and light weapons, the fight against \ninternational terrorism and the effort to control \nHIV/AIDS, on the one hand, and peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding, the advancement of women and the \nprotection of human rights, on the other. \n We express our appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral for convening the recent Summit on Climate \nChange to garner the necessary political support to \n\u201cseal the deal\u201d in Copenhagen. Suriname expects an \nagreement in Copenhagen with ambitious mitigation \nand adaptation targets. We expect the commitments \nnecessary to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in \nappropriate quantities and to support adaptation in \ndeveloping countries. Countries that are historically \n \n \n23 09-52470 \n \nresponsible for the current emissions of greenhouse \ngases in the atmosphere should take the lead in this \narea.\n In the spirit of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities, we look forward to appropriate \nmitigation efforts by developing countries. As a high-\nforest low-deforestation (HFLD) country, Suriname \nwill continue with its efforts to manage its forests \nsustainably. In this way we aim to keep and improve \nthe climate-stabilizing capacity of our standing forests. \nWe attach great importance to the establishment of a \nfuture forest carbon-mitigation regime providing \npositive incentives to HFLD countries. In this regard \nwe call your attention to the report of the Informal \nWorking Group on Interim Finance for Reducing \nEmissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation \n(REDD). This report estimates that, if financing of \n\u20ac15 billion to \u20ac25 billion is available for the 2010-\n2015 period, a 25 per cent reduction in annual global \ndeforestation rates will be achievable by 2015. In this \nregard we call upon institutions and fellow Member \nStates to support United Nations REDD+ efforts in \nrecognition of the beneficial potential of tropical \nforests in mitigating climate change. \n Suriname has emphasized its support for the \npromotion of dialogue among civilizations and the \nculture of peace in various international forums, \nespecially through the full implementation of the \nGlobal Agenda and Programme of Action for Dialogue \namong Civilizations, as well as the Declaration and \nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace \n(resolutions 56/6 and 53/243, respectively). \n Our democracy serves as an illustration of our \nquest for peace, security and development. Various \nethnic groups with different multicultural backgrounds \nand religious traditions have come a long way in \ncoexisting and cooperating in a harmonious and \npeaceful way. This engagement is reflected in the \npolitical representation of our administration. It is \nwithin this atmosphere of democratic values, of high \nlevels of religious and ethnic tolerance, that we are \nbuilding a society that can prosper and engage with the \nregion and the world beyond. In order to achieve \ninternational peace, security and development, \ncooperation should be based upon constructive and \nrespectful dialogue. This dialogue should be guided by \na spirit of tolerance, acceptance and trust among \nreligions, peoples and cultures. Only with mutual trust \nand understanding will we be able to overcome \ninternational tensions. \n The Secretary-General recently emphasized the \nimportance of education for development. Education \nhas always been the foundation of economic \nopportunity and prosperity. Knowledge and advanced \nskills are critical tools for enhancing every country\u2019s \neconomic potential, growth and standard of living. This \nis why we have to join our efforts to improve the \ncapacity of countries to adopt, disseminate and \nmaximize technological advances. Improved \ninternational cooperation aimed at creating better \neducational systems will help developing countries \nprogress faster towards achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, particularly those related to all \nlevels of education, health and gender equality. \n The promotion and protection of human rights are \namong the most effective strategies for eliminating \ninequalities between social groups and within and \nbetween countries, and Suriname therefore remains \ncommitted to the promotion and protection of all \nhuman rights.  \n With regard to what is called the supreme \ninternational crime \u2014 namely, the crime of \naggression \u2014 Suriname expresses the hope that a \ndecision on the elements of crime will be taken very \nsoon. The upcoming Review Conference of the Rome \nStatute of the International Criminal Court, to be held in \nUganda next year, should therefore address this issue \nseriously. \n For more than 60 years the United Nations has \nbeen able to build confidence and understanding \nbetween Member States and help keep global peace. \nMy delegation reiterates its commitment to \ndevelopment, respect for human rights and \ninternational peace and security. We will continue to \nengage in constructive dialogue aimed at contributing \nto a better future for all."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by extending \nour warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session. Your election to this high office is \na fitting and eloquent tribute to the personal and \ndiplomatic qualities that we have witnessed in you over \nthe years. We are indeed proud of the honour that has \nbeen bestowed upon the African continent by your \nelection. We are confident that under your wise \nstewardship we will make pleasing progress on the \nimportant agenda before us. \n In the same vein, Mr. President, I wish to \ncommend your predecessor, the President at the sixty-\nthird session, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for \nhaving brought his experience and wisdom to bear \nupon the various meetings and conferences that he \npresided over during the last year. He brought integrity, \ntransparency and credibility to the deliberations of the \nGeneral Assembly. Indeed, we share his assertion that \nthe \u201cG-192\u201d \u2014 that is, the General Assembly \u2014 being \nthe most representative body of the United Nations, is \nthe best forum in which to tackle global issues, which \ninclude the current financial and economic crises. We \ncommend him for standing up for what is right and for \nupholding the right of each Member State, no matter \nhow small, to be heard. \n Over the years, my delegation has underlined the \nneed for the United Nations and other international \nbodies to truly serve the collective interest of all \nMember States. Our unchanging conviction is that all \ninternational institutions should abide by the universal \nprinciples that underlie the multilateral processes of \ndecision-making, particularly, the principle of equality \namong States and the right to development. It is in this \ncontext that we welcome the appropriate, indeed, \ntimely, theme of this session, namely, effective global \nresponses to global crises, and strengthening \nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations. It is \nour hope that we will have a candid and holistic debate \non the global responses to the crises that currently \naffect our world. \n Zimbabwe supports the revitalization of the \nGeneral Assembly in order to make it more effective \nand thus enable it to fulfil its mandate. As the \npre-eminent deliberative and policymaking body of the \nUnited Nations, the Assembly should play a more \nactive role in mobilizing action against such challenges \n  \n \n09-52463 2 \n \ntoday as the maintenance of peace and security, the \nfinancial and economic crises, economic and social \ndevelopment and climate change.  \n Accordingly, the encroachment of other United \nNations organs on the work of the General Assembly is \nof great concern to us. We therefore reiterate that any \nprocess of revitalization should strengthen the principle \nof the accountability of all principal and subsidiary \norgans of the United Nations to the Assembly. \n It is our hope that the current negotiations on the \nreform of the Security Council will break the deadlock \nthat for some time now has prevented us from making \nprogress in an area of strategic interest to Africa. The \nreform of the Council is not only desirable but \nimperative if it is to ensure the successful \nimplementation of its global mandate to maintain \ninternational peace and security on behalf of all \nMember States.  \n The fact that Africa, a major geographical region, \nremains underrepresented and without a permanent seat \non the Security Council is not only a serious and \nantiquated anomaly whose time for address is overdue. \nIt is also clearly an untenable violation of the principle \nand practice of democracy in international relations. \nThe reform of the Security Council should urgently \ntake full notice of the African position, which demands \ntwo permanent seats, with complete veto power \u2014 as \nlong as the veto lasts \u2014 plus two additional \nnon-permanent seats. \n The United Nations Conference on the World \nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \nDevelopment, held in June 2009, rightfully positioned \nthe Organization at the centre of efforts to deal with the \nglobal financial and economic crisis. The devastating \neffect of the current global crisis has clearly exposed \nthe folly of leaving the management of the global \neconomy in the hands of a few self-appointed countries \nand groupings.  \n My delegation, therefore, fully supports the \nsetting up of a follow-up working group under the \naegis of the General Assembly. It is urgent and critical \nthat the working group reach an early agreement on \nimmediate policy actions to be taken by the \ninternational community in support of developing \ncountries, which have suffered the most as a result of \nthis global financial meltdown. Such actions should \ninclude the development of a global stimulus plan to \nrespond to the crisis and issues related to it. \n Those measures will not achieve the desired \nobjectives unless accompanied by a comprehensive \nreform of the Bretton Woods institutions. Such reforms \nwould, inter alia, include representation of sub-Saharan \nAfrica on the Executive Boards of these institutions. \nWe are glad that our unequivocal call for their reform \nis beginning to bear fruit. We welcome the recent \ndecision by the World Bank to establish three seats for \nAfrica on its Executive Board. We are similarly pleased \nthat, earlier this month, the International Monetary \nFund finalized the re-allocation of special drawing \nrights on the basis of the $250 billion pledged by the \nGroup of 20 at its meeting in April 2009. Regrettably, \nonly a mere $18 billion of this money was allocated to \nlow-income countries, while the developed countries \u2014 \nwhich caused the crisis, after all \u2014 got the lion\u2019s share. \n The need to ensure global food security has been \nraised and restated at many international forums. We \nreiterate our call for an urgent and substantial increase \nin investment in agriculture in developing countries. It \nis critical that provisions of agricultural inputs \u2014 \nseeds, fertilizers and chemicals \u2014 be put in place for \nsmall-scale farmers, particularly women.  \n To achieve this, we need to channel more support \ntowards agriculture, which has dwindled over the last \nfew decades. In addition, we call upon developed \ncountries to remove or reduce their agricultural \nsubsidies and to open up their markets to agricultural \nproducts from developing countries. \n In the area of health, efforts to reduce maternal \nand child mortality and to combat HIV and AIDS, \nmalaria and tuberculosis still fall short of targets \ndespite the commitments made at national and \ninternational levels. Over the last few years, Zimbabwe \nhas made great strides in the fight against the HIV and \nAIDS pandemic, our limited resources \nnotwithstanding. The country has witnessed a drop in \nthe adult prevalence rate from 20 per cent in 2000 to \n11 per cent this year.  \n However, we still face a major challenge in \nincreasing the availability of affordable antiretroviral \ndrugs. We therefore continue to urge the international \ncommunity, in cooperation with pharmaceutical \ncompanies, to assist in increasing access to affordable \nessential drugs, particularly for people in Africa. \nPeople living with HIV and AIDS expect delivery on \nthe commitments we have made.  \n \n \n3 09-52463 \n \n For sub-Saharan Africa, malaria presents yet \nanother still-formidable challenge. The commitment of \nthe international community and national Governments \ntherefore needs to be strengthened to eradicate the \nscourge of malaria in our part of the world. \n We warmly welcome the renewed enthusiasm on \nthe part of Russia and the United States to pursue \nactions to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons, and \nwe urge other nuclear-armed States to do the same. In \nthis regard, Zimbabwe is honoured to have chaired, in \nMay of this year, the third session of the Preparatory \nCommittee for the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty Review Conference and takes this opportunity \nto thank all members for their support. We are hopeful \nthat, having secured agreement on the Conference \nagenda, members will produce a renewed commitment \nto the three pillars of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty: nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and \npeaceful use of nuclear energy. \n I would now like to turn to developments in my \ncountry. Since its formation in February this year, the \nInclusive Government in Zimbabwe has demonstrated \na conviction and unity of purpose and an unwavering \ncommitment to chart a new vision for the country and \nto improve the lives of the people in peace and \nharmony. In the Global Political Agreement, we have \ndefined our priorities as the maintenance of conditions \nof peace and stability, economic recovery, \ndevelopment, promotion of human rights and \nimprovement of the condition of women and children. \n Regrettably, while countries in the Southern \nAfrican Development Community (SADC) region have \nmade huge sacrifices and given Zimbabwe financial \nand other support at a time when they too are reeling \nfrom the effects of the global economic crisis, the \nWestern countries \u2014 in particular the United States \nand the European Union, who imposed illegal \nsanctions on Zimbabwe \u2014 have, to our surprise, and \nthat of SADC and the rest of Africa, refused to remove \nthe sanctions. We wonder what their motives are, and \nwe ask what they would want to see us do. Indeed, \nsome Western countries are working strenuously to \ndivide the parties in the Inclusive Government. If they \nwill not assist the Inclusive Government in \nrehabilitating our economy, could they please, please \nstop their filthy clandestine, divisive antics. Where \nstand their humanitarian principles, we ask, when their \nillegal sanctions are ruining the lives of our children? \n We simply call for an immediate end to the \ncoercive, illegal and unjustified 50-year economic, \ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba, which \nis estimated to have cost Cuba a total of some \n$96 billion so far. My delegation joins other countries \nof the Non-Aligned Movement that have repeatedly \ncondemned the use of unilateral coercive measures as a \nflagrant violation of the norms of international law and \ninternational relations, especially as they govern \nrelations between States under the United Nations \nCharter. \n Let me conclude by reiterating the need for \neffective and comprehensive multilateralism to \npromote a global partnership for peace and \ndevelopment. The United Nations and other \ninternational organizations that carry the legitimacy of \nmultilateralism should play a leading role in directing \nthe course of events and developments, taking into \naccount the interests of the majority of the \nOrganization\u2019s members in an inclusive, peaceful, just, \nuniversal and democratic manner.  \n It is our hope that through our unity, solidarity, \ncooperation and commitment, the challenges facing the \ninternational community can be addressed. Let us rise \nto the occasion and demonstrate our political will and \nability to work together for the good of humanity. \nZimbabwe is willing and ready to play its part."

We wholeheartedly agree \nand endorse that assessment.  \n It is a discontent with the status quo of a 63-year-\nold Security Council, which continues to administer \nour collective security unchanged and impervious to \nthe logic of a new world. It is a discontent with the \nrole, effectiveness and mandate of the 65-year-old \nBretton Woods institutions, which were created in a \nbygone era to address bygone circumstances. It is a \ndiscontent with a 49-year-old blockade on the noble \npeople of our neighbour Cuba, the continued illegal \napplication of which is illogical when viewed through \nthe prism of geopolitics, economics or \nhumanitarianism, and can be successfully explained \nonly by reference to narrow local political \nconsiderations.  \n It is a discontent, even, with the stagnation of \nefforts to change the status quo in other critical \nrespects: the eight years of unresolved negotiations of \nthe Doha Development Round, the 12 years of the \ntoothless commitments of the Kyoto Protocol, and the \nseven years of unfulfilled Monterrey Consensus \npromises to achieve a 0.7 per cent of gross national \nproduct for official development assistance, a full 40 \nyears after this modest percentage was first mooted. \n Through it all, the geopolitical status quo \nremains. The structural bases of international \ninteraction are distressingly similar to their decades-\nold antecedents. Those structures were forged in the \nfires of World War II, hardened in the frost of the Cold \nWar and entrenched by the legacies of colonialism and \nexploitation. But World War II has long since ended, \nthe Cold War is relegated to history books, and the \nreach of formal colonialism continues to recede. The \nstructures spawned by those historical episodes are no \nlonger valid. \n Our discontent is born not only of stagnation but \nalso of exclusion. Although we have a seat in this \nhallowed building, it is often the seat of a spectator in a \nhistorical drama. The directors and actors script history \nnot in the General Assembly, but in other rooms and \nlocales, without our input or knowledge. In many \nsignificant ways we are attendees, rather than \nparticipants, on the international stage. \n We are in the midst of a global financial and \neconomic crisis of unparalleled depth and scope. Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines played no part in the \nreckless speculation and corruption that precipitated \nthis crisis, yet the people of our country are hard hit by \nits effects. Our tourism industry is suffering, \nremittances are shrinking, foreign direct investment is \nscarce, and the spectre of unemployment is a real and \ngathering regional threat. However, we are actively \nexcluded from the solutions to this problem.  \n Last week, we learned that the Group of 20 \n(G-20) anointed itself \u201cthe premier forum for our \ninternational economic cooperation\u201d. Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines is not a member of the G-20, nor were \nwe consulted on its ascension to the ranks of arbiters of \nour economic fate. While there is an undeniable logic \nto a small group of the world\u2019s largest economies \nmeeting informally to thrash out matters that affect \nonly their own large economies, the logic fades in the \nface of a crisis that has spread rapidly and \ncomprehensively to every corner of the globe. \n Additionally, the G-20 faces a serious legitimacy \nproblem. Aside from the Group\u2019s being non-inclusive \nand unofficial, many of the countries at that table \nrepresent the champions of the financial and economic \northodoxies that led the world down the rabbit hole to \nits current economic malaise. \n Further, the G-20\u2019s recent self-congratulatory \npronouncements of \u201cmission accomplished\u201d in the \n \n \n21 09-53165 \n \nmidst of this economic upheaval are of cold comfort to \nthe suffering peoples and countries of the world. While \nthe G-20 may claim that its actions have \u201cworked\u201d, and \nclaim a \u201csense of normalcy\u201d, the people of Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines and our Caribbean region \nare under no such illusions. The invisible hand of the \nmarket is still clasped firmly around the throats of poor \npeople and the developing countries of the world. We \nsee none of the so-called green shoots that populate the \nfantasies of discredited economic cheerleaders. \n Indeed, the seeds sown by this crisis may produce \nthe strange and bitter fruit of increased poverty, \nsuffering and social and political upheaval. The crisis \nitself, with its disproportionate impact on the poor, will \nonly widen and deepen the yawning gap between \ndeveloped and developing countries. \n It is not merely the economic crisis against which \nthe people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \ncontinue to struggle heroically. Today, we face the \ntriple threat of being globalized, climatized and \nstigmatized. We have already been globalized by the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) out of our trade in \nbananas, which, until very recently, was the engine of \nour economic growth. We are on the verge of being \nclimatized out of our reliance on tourism as its \ndevelopment substitute, as climate change wreaks \nhavoc on our weather systems, intensifies our \nhurricanes, destroys our coral reefs, damages our costal \ninfrastructure and erodes our beaches. \n Now, we face being stigmatized out of our \ntransition into financial services, as the G-20, the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment and other non-inclusive bodies seek to \nscapegoat and root out so-called tax havens in a \npathetic effort to cast a wide and indiscriminate net of \nblame across a swath of legitimate and well-regulated \ncountries\u2019 development efforts. \n We note the irony of hearing these paternalistic \nprescriptions from the same countries that are unable to \nstem corruption and mismanagement within their own \nborders, where corporations recklessly squander \ntrillions of dollars and a single buccaneer investor can \nmake $50 billion \u2014 an amount greater than the \ncombined annual budget expenditures of the entire \nCaribbean Community subregion \u2014 disappear into thin \nair. \n The unholy trinity of exogenous assaults on our \ndevelopment prospects posed by globalization, \nclimatization and stigmatization cannot be ignored, nor \ncan the security threats engendered by the illicit trade \nin firearms and narcotics. We in Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines find ourselves unfortunately located \nbetween the supply of and demand for these poisons \nand weapons, and their deleterious effects rip holes in \nour cohesive social fabric. The Caribbean, which \nproduces not one single firearm or one single kilo of \ncocaine, is awash in drugs and guns, and is now the \nsubregion with the world\u2019s highest per capita murder \nrate. \n Our plight cannot be ignored. Indeed, we are \nheartened that the United Nations Office on Drugs and \nCrime, which inexplicably ended its presence in our \nregion, has now seen fit to reconsider its decision to \ncede the Caribbean to drug cartels and murderers. We \nhope that it represents a genuine and generous \nrecommitment to our regional challenges. \n As a small archipelagic State, we, more than \nmost, are affected and threatened by the ravages of \nclimate change. We, more than most, recognize the \ncritical importance of a meaningful, measurable and \nenforceable global compact on climate change. \nHowever, we do not simply want to \u201cseal the deal\u201d at \nCopenhagen, as posited by the sloganeers of the United \nNations. We want to seal the right deal, the just deal, \nand the deal that ensures our continued survival. We \nmost emphatically will not seal a suicide pact that will \nassure the elimination of small island States and our \nway of life. \n The Alliance of Small Island States has recently \nissued a declaration that contains what we consider to \nbe the essential contours of any meaningful agreement \non climate change. We trust that our blameless position \non the front lines of climate change fallout will be \nconsidered and respected in the global effort to seal the \ndeal. We cannot, as in the case of the world economy, \nbe excluded in any way from the solutions to a problem \nthat so fundamentally affects us. \n The theme of exclusion is equally applicable to \nour friends in Taiwan. The United Nations and its \nspecialized agencies must find ways to ensure the \nmeaningful participation of the 23 million people of \nTaiwan. Just as their economic strength has merited \ninclusion in the WTO and the universality of global \nhealth challenges have logically compelled their \nparticipation in the World Health Assembly, so too \nshould the global reach of climate change merit their \n \n \n09-53165 22 \n \nmeaningful participation in the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \n The interconnected networks of global air travel \nand our shared safety concerns similarly mandate the \nparticipation of Taiwan in the International Civil \nAviation Organization. The Government and people of \nTaiwan have advanced a reasonable and responsible \npolicy of engagement to usher a new era in cross-strait \nrelations. The international community can and should \nencourage and reward this fledgling rapprochement \nwith meaningful participation in the relevant \nspecialized agencies. \n Any cursory analysis of the excluded and the \nincluded, of the discontented and the defenders of the \nstatus quo, will quickly reveal that many current \ninequities are rooted in our colonial history and that the \nstruggle for geopolitical balance and inclusiveness is \nindeed the last struggle of decolonization as we, the \nformer colonial territories, remain excluded from the \ninner sanctums and power structures that were \nestablished by and for the colonizers in a time long \nsince passed. \n On 27 October this year, Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary of \nindependence. However, we recognize that \nindependence is a process, not a one-time event. Our \nindependence journey continues today. Thirty years \nafter gaining formal independence, we retain the Queen \nas our Head of State, and our highest judicial appeals \ntravel from our shores to the United Kingdom to be \ndecided by Her Majesty in Council. While we cherish a \nspecial, modern and respectful relationship with the \nUnited Kingdom, we do not intend to tarry on colonial \npremises a moment longer than is necessary. \n Even as we wage a wider war of attrition against \ngeopolitical colonialism, our citizens are preparing to \nvote on a new and home-grown constitution that will \nbreak the chains of outmoded dependence and place \nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines firmly on its two feet \nas a truly independent republic. This new proposed \nconstitution, the product of six years of open, \ntransparent and inclusive public consultations, is \ntestament to the political maturity of our people and to \nthe value of locally tailored solutions to externally \nimposed impediments. \n In a similar manner, our brothers and sisters in \nthe developing world, including Cuba, the Bolivarian \nRepublic of Venezuela, Turkey, Mexico, Malaysia, \nIran, Libya, Brazil and many others, have forged new \nlinks and bonds of friendship, cooperation and \nsolidarity with our country that go beyond historical, \ngeographical or colonial linkages. We value these \nfriendships and partnerships as important additions to \nour traditional and treasured allies in the United States, \nthe United Kingdom, Taiwan, Canada and the \nEuropean Union. \n Just as our myriad bilateral friendships and \npartnerships span geographic, economic and \nideological divides, so too must our multilateral \ncooperation be inclusive and participatory. We can no \nlonger maintain the illusion of holding hands in \nartificial solidarity across the moats and turrets of \nstructural and systemic inequalities. Modern \nmultilateralism cannot proceed on the bases of the \nincluded and the excluded, of the political haves and \nhave-nots, nor can token assimilations of individual \ndeveloping countries serve to mask the necessity for \ndeep structural changes to existing power \narrangements.  \n We urge our brothers and sisters who have gained \nlimited access to the halls of power to not only be a \nvoice for their excluded brothers and to not only \nremember where they came from, but also to view \nthemselves as the tip of the spear, the thin edge of the \nwedge that will use their newfound privileges to \ndismantle these structures from within, even as we \ncontinue to make our presence felt outside the citadels \nof stasis and indifference. \n Psalm 118 of the Bible teaches that the stone that \nthe builder rejected shall become the cornerstone. We, \nthe poor and developing countries of the world, are the \nstones that the builders of this body refused and \nignored. In rebuilding and revitalizing, either we will \nbecome the cornerstones of this institution, or this \nedifice of multilateral cooperation will crumble into \nirrelevance and illegitimacy. \n Addressing the economic crisis, poverty and \ndevelopment is not an academic exercise. Climate \nchange is not a theoretical event. Reform of global \ngovernance is not a diplomatic parlour game. They are \nthe clear and present dangers of our time, and they \nreflect the need for the real and inclusive participation \nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Caribbean and \nthe developing world. They represent also a need to \nreflect and address our discontent with the status quo \nperpetuated for far too long. \n \n \n23 09-53165 \n \n We stand now in the autumn of our discontent, \nbut, as Gandhi said, \u201cHealthy discontent is the prelude \nto progress\u201d. The challenge of the discontented is to \nrise above ancient animosities and artificial \nbalkanization to achieve the clarity of vision, unity of \npurpose and political will to finally and successfully \nstorm the castles of stagnation and status quo and to \ndrive our peoples, our politics and our planet into a \nnew era of genuine inclusiveness, equity and \nmeaningful, people-centred progress."

        "file_text": "\nI believe it is fair to say that we have just come \nthrough an annus horribilis: a year marked by the \nworldwide financial and economic crisis, the worst \nsince the Great Depression of 1929; by an increase in \nhunger and poverty \u2014 we are speaking about some \n100 million more people sinking into hunger and \nchronic poverty due to the crisis, and more than \n1 billion people suffering from hunger in 2009; by the \ndramatic rise in unemployment \u2014 the International \nLabour Organization (ILO) indicates that 50 million \nworkers are at risk of losing or have already lost their \njobs; by set-backs in the hard-won progress towards \nthe Millennium Development Goals; and by the \noutbreak of a pandemic. It was also a year during \nwhich questions about the relevance of the United \nNations and calls for an overhaul of international \ngovernance grew ever louder. \n Accordingly, we see the need to take stock and \ndraw lessons, namely, to review the major challenges \nthe international community is confronting in terms of \ndevelopment, human rights and the rule of law, \npeacekeeping and security, disarmament and \nnon-proliferation and the fight against climate change. \nAnd what better forum to discuss these issues than the \nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations? \n The economic crisis that hit the world a year ago \nwas even more devastating, as it took place while we \nwere still struggling to cope with, without having \novercome them, the food and energy crises, as well as \nthe acceleration, obviously, of climate change. \n I have just mentioned the particularly negative \nimpact of the crisis on the poorest. To face those \nchallenges, we need concerted action, coherent action, \nglobal action, a true global partnership for \ndevelopment, based on the shared responsibilities of \ndonors and recipients. \n My country will continue to assume its share of \nresponsibility by maintaining its efforts in terms of \nofficial development assistance (ODA). Having spent \n0.95 per cent of its gross national income on ODA in \n2008, the Government that was elected in June 2009 \nhas not only confirmed that it maintains the \nquantitative target of 1 per cent of its gross national \nincome, but will also continue to insist on the \nqualitative improvement of Luxembourg\u2019s cooperation \nin order to further increase efficiency, all of it in the \n  \n \n09-52470 44 \n \ncontext of sustainable development integrating \neconomic, social and environmental issues. \n Luxembourg calls on all Member States to make \nthe necessary efforts to keep all the commitments that \nwere made together in this forum and that we have \nreiterated at the Millennium Summit in Monterrey and \nmore recently in Doha. \n We must, however, learn the lessons provided by \nthis multidimensional crisis and contemplate a more \nsystemic reform of the existing multilateral system, \nincluding the financial and economic architecture, and \nadapt it to the current political and socio-economic \nrealities. \n As I stated in this forum in June at the \nConference on the World Financial and Economic \nCrisis and Its Impact on Development, the United \nNations and its principal organs must be at the centre \nof such a reflection. The Economic and Social Council, \nwhich is the central mechanism for coordination and \nthe principal organ of the United Nations responsible \nfor economic and social issues, will have a particularly \nimportant role to play in this regard. \n Luxembourg, which chairs the Economic and \nSocial Council this year, has assumed its \nresponsibilities in that regard and is working towards \nfull implementation of the various mandates entrusted \nto the Council by Member States in the framework of \nthe international Conference. \n All these actions require a strong multilateral \nframework based on sound legal rules that are binding \non all Member States. In times of crisis, unilateral \ntendencies unfortunately tend to recur. While it is \nimportant that representatives of the major economies \nof the world meet to discuss common problems, \nparticularly the economic and financial crisis we have \nexperienced in recent months, such forums should not \nand must not substitute for multilateral structures and \nexisting intergovernmental mandates. \n In order to retain the relevance of our multilateral \nstructures, they must be based on trust and cooperation: \ntrust between the citizen and the State, trust among \nStates themselves, whether they are from the North or \nthe South, rich or poor, and confidence of States in the \nUnited Nations, which is our common good. \n It lies in our hands to assume our responsibilities, \nto overcome our divisions, to move the thinking and \nthe decision-making forward, and to ensure \nconsistency. It lies in our hands to undertake the \nnecessary reform efforts required for a Security \nCouncil that reflects, at last, the geopolitical realities \nof today, and which is more representative, efficient \nand transparent; for a revitalized General Assembly, \nand for a stronger and more effective Economic and \nSocial Council. It lies in our hands to demonstrate the \ncontinued relevance of our Organization and its \ncapacity to act and to formulate joint responses, global \nresponses and legitimate responses. \n In our globalized world, there is no turning away. \n We are all concerned, and the challenges we are \nfacing are of an ever-increasing complexity, including \nin matters of peace and security. Yesterday, we \ncommemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the United \nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA), an anniversary \nthat one would somehow have preferred not to have to \ncelebrate, for while it allowed us to express our \ngratitude for the outstanding work done by that United \nNations agency in the service of the Palestinian people \non a daily basis, it is true, it is also synonymous with \nfailure. Sixty years later, the situation in the Middle \nEast remains unresolved. \n While we welcome that the new Administration \nin the United States is determined to seek a solution \nbased on the coexistence of two States and a \ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East, and while we, \ntogether with our European Union partners, are \ncommitted to working actively with the United States \nand other Quartet members, including, obviously, the \nUnited Nations, to achieve this goal, at the same time \nwe deeply regret that Israel persists in its policy of \ncolonization.  \n Mr. Shaheed (Maldives), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n It cannot be repeated too often: the settlement \nactivity is not only illegal under international law, but \nit is also an obstacle to peace. To continue colonization \nis to persist in humiliating the Palestinians, in \ndominating the Palestinian people. Without the clear \nsignal of an end to this policy, it is unlikely that serious \nnegotiations can resume. \n We fully support the intention of the President of \nthe United States to engage in negotiations, and we \nwill support him in this endeavour. Annapolis showed \nthat Israelis and Palestinians, when they are alone \n \n \n45 09-52470 \n \naround the negotiating table, are not able to show a \nlevel of commitment commensurate with the \nfundamental problems, namely, Jerusalem, the question \nof refugees and their right to return, security and the \nissue of borders. \n We call on all parties to shoulder their \nresponsibilities and, through their actions, to establish \nan environment conducive to the resumption of \nnegotiations to resolve the conflict. The end of \ndivisions among Palestinians and the intra-Palestinian \nreconciliation that is centred on President Mahmoud \nAbbas, who has demonstrated in the West Bank that \nsubstantial progress in terms of security and \ngovernance is possible, are just as much a part of this \nas the adoption of confidence-building measures by \nIsrael and Arab countries or the simultaneous search \nfor solutions to the conflicts between, on the one hand, \nIsrael and the Syrian Arab Republic and, on the other \nhand, Israel and Lebanon. \n In that context, I would also like to stress just \nhow urgent it is to find a sustainable solution to the \ncrisis in Gaza through the full implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1860 (2009). An end must \nbe put to the untenable situation of 1.5 million \nPalestinians living in a prison. Giving hope and \nmotivation to the Palestinian people is a basic human \nobligation. Light must also be shed on the events in \nGaza, including the events following the release of the \nUnited Nations fact-finding mission\u2019s report, which has \njust been published and which has brought shocking \nacts to light. The credibility of the United Nations is at \nstake in this matter. \n The credibility of the international community \ntoo is at stake in a number of respects with regard to \nthe situation in Afghanistan. It is at stake as far as the \nestablishment and maintenance of peace and security is \nconcerned, but also in terms of preserving the rule of \nlaw and respect for our fundamental values, ensuring \nthe economic and social development of the country \nand combating poverty. That was the mandate given to \nthe United Nations back in 2001. It has become clear \nthat, eight years after the adoption of that mandate, the \nprogress made is still not enough. In the light of the \nincreasing number of bloody attacks carried out across \nthe country, the events surrounding the recent \npresidential elections and the alarming figures in terms \nof development objectives, public opinion is beginning \nto wonder whether in fact we are not moving \nbackwards. \n There is no easy solution, but there is certainly no \nalternative to our continued engagement in the country. \nI would like to stress that, together with our European \nUnion and NATO partners, we will remain engaged \nalongside the authorities and the people of \nAfghanistan. There can be no question of abandoning \nthe people, who have been devastated by decades of \nconflict and violations of their most basic rights. The \ngoal must be a stable and democratic State where all \nforces, including the Taliban, recognize and respect the \nrule of law and basic human rights. \n Another conflict area that has long been a source \nof concern and where our hopes of lasting peace were \nonce again called into question in the past year is the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Once again it is \ncivilians who must suffer the consequences. We are \nseriously concerned about the crimes committed \nagainst civilians, especially women and children. \n In that context I would like to welcome the draft \nSecurity Council resolution that provides for concrete \nfollow-up to resolution 1820 (2008), on women and \npeace and security. Luxembourg fully supports that \ntext. I also welcome the personal commitment of the \nSecretary-General in the fight against sexual violence. \nIt is important that the United Nations system as a \nwhole address the phenomenon of sexual violence, \nwhich is used increasingly as a weapon of war in \narmed conflict even after hostilities have ended. It is \nessential to strengthen efforts to prevent such acts from \nhappening and to bring to justice those who commit \nthose horrible crimes. \n While much remains to be said about the \nchallenges in terms of the maintenance of peace and \nsecurity, especially in the context of the current debate \non the future of peacekeeping operations \u2014 a debate \nthat I applaud \u2014 allow me to dwell for a moment on \nthe current encouraging developments in the field of \ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. \n I welcome President Obama\u2019s initiative to engage \nthe Security Council in a broader discussion of issues \npertaining to non-proliferation and disarmament, \nbeyond the specific area of issues related to sanctions. \nAs we are only a few months from the eighth Review \nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), it is \nimportant that we demonstrate our determination to \ncarry out that task as regards the three pillars of the \n  \n \n09-52470 46 \n \nNPT, the ultimate goal being a world free of nuclear \nweapons. \n The same goes for the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the other cornerstone of the \nnuclear non-proliferation regime. As I said yesterday \nduring the meeting of States that have ratified the \nCTBT, the call of the Security Council to sign and \nratify the CTBT and the commitment of President \nObama to do everything possible to ensure ratification \nin the United States are crucial. The Treaty must at last \nenter into force. We hope that those encouraging \ndevelopments will lead others to adopt a more \nconstructive attitude, with full respect for their \ninternational obligations. \n Beyond non-proliferation issues, however, we \nmust not overlook disarmament itself. In that regard, \nwe certainly welcome the decision of the United States \nand the Russian Federation to conduct negotiations to \nconclude a new comprehensive agreement following \nthe expiry of the START II Treaty next December. \n Allow me as well to say a few words about an \nissue that is also relevant in terms of security and \ndefence. I am referring to the welcome decision \u2014 in \nmy opinion, at least \u2014 by the United States \nAdministration to abandon the effort to put in place a \nmissile defence shield. It always seemed to me that the \nway forward in that regard was not to adopt unilateral \nmeasures, but to engage in discussion and cooperation \nwith our Russian partners with a view to ensuring our \ncommon security. \n I cannot conclude without saying a few words \nabout climate change, which is perhaps the greatest \nchallenge to world prosperity in the long term. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral once again for convening the summit of \n22 September. That resulted in political mobilization at \nthe highest level, which is crucial if we want to make \nthe Copenhagen Conference a success and set a new \ncourse towards sustainable development and green \ngrowth that reduces carbon emissions. \n The scientific evidence exists. It is now up to us \nto respond with determination in facing those facts. \nDeveloped countries will have to set the example by \nagreeing to ambitious and higher than average targets \nto reduce carbon dioxide by 2050. They must do so by \nentering into binding legal commitments, including for \nthe medium term, in the context of an effective and \nuniversal international regime to which countries \ncontribute on the basis of their capacity. \n Moreover, the issue of adaptation to climate \nchange \u2014 including also the financing of related \nefforts, which will necessarily constitute an additional \nexpense \u2014 should be treated as a priority at \nCopenhagen. Allow me to note in passing that the \ndisarmament efforts that I have just described should \nfree up financial resources that could be put to better \nuse in this regard. \n Meanwhile, together with its partners in the \nEuropean Union, Luxembourg has already committed \nitself to reach the so-called 20-20-20 goal of increasing \nenergy efficiency in the European Union by 20 per \ncent, increasing renewable energy by 20 per cent of \ntotal energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions by 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels. \nBeginning several years ago, Luxembourg began to \nsystematically incorporate the issue of adaptation to \nclimate change in its development programmes. \n Climate change, however, will have an impact not \nonly on development, but also on the full enjoyment of \nhuman rights and on the security of countries. I \ntherefore very much welcome the report produced by \nthe Secretary-General following the initiative taken in \nthat regard by Pacific small island developing States, \nwhich addresses the full scope of the problem. \n Luxembourg remains firmly convinced of the \nrelevance of a multilateral approach in which the \nUnited Nations is at the centre. We will continue to \nbase our policies and make our contributions with a \nview to creating a world that is more just, more \npeaceful and more prosperous, as enshrined in our \nfounding Charter. It is also because of this passionate \nmotivation to work towards a strong and effective \nmultilateralism that Luxembourg, a founding Member \nof the United Nations, aspires to become, for the first \ntime, a non-permanent member of the Security Council \nin 2013-2014.

        "file_text": "Let me join previous speakers \nin congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the \npresidency at the sixty-fourth session of the General \nAssembly. I should also like to extend Zambia\u2019s \nsincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann for his able leadership during the \nsixty-third session. \n The theme for this session provides us with an \nopportunity to evaluate existing multilateral \napproaches to address the challenges arising from \nglobalization. Those include threats to socio-economic \ndevelopment and international peace and security. \nThere is a need to develop innovative approaches and \nresponses to those challenges, which include \nHIV/AIDS and influenza A(H1N1), terrorism, climate \nchange, nuclear weapons and, more recently, the global \neconomic and financial crisis. In this globalized and \ninterdependent world, no country, however wealthy or \npowerful it is, can resolve all those challenges single-\nhandedly. Common solutions are therefore required \nthrough a strong United Nations. \n This session is taking place against the backdrop \nof the adverse effects of the recent global economic \nand financial crisis, which has spared no one. In my \nown country of Zambia and in other African countries, \nthe economic growth achieved from 2000 to 2007 is \nnow declining as a result of the global economic and \nfinancial crisis. We are faced with serious financial \nconstraints, lower commodity prices and weak external \nand domestic demand for our products, high inflation \nand rising unemployment. Manufacturing and \nconstruction activities have also slackened. As copper \naccounts for about 70 per cent of Zambia\u2019s exports, the \neffect of the collapse of international copper prices \u2014 \nfrom $8,985 per metric tonne in August 2008 to $2,902 \nat the end of 2008 \u2014 has, among other things, resulted \nin greatly reduced revenue collections. \n Zambia\u2019s experience from the recent global \nfinancial and economic crisis is a timely reminder of \nthe consequences of overdependence on a single \neconomic sector. My Government has therefore \ndeveloped a diversification plan to shift the economy \nfrom dependence on copper. That is being done \nthrough policy interventions in the agriculture, tourism \nand manufacturing sectors, coupled with programmes \naimed at improving the business environment in \nZambia. \n For those efforts to succeed, however, there must \nbe an expeditious conclusion to the World Trade \nOrganization\u2019s Doha Round of negotiations. Zambia \nconsiders the aid-for-trade component of the \nnegotiations as critical, as it will develop our country\u2019s \ncapacity to overcome supply-side constraints and \nencourage value addition in its commodities. \n \n \n47 09-52425 \n \n Zambia\u2019s response to the global economic crisis \nneeds the support of its international development \npartners. We appreciate that our cooperating partners \nhave also been affected by the global economic crisis. \nNonetheless, we urge them to fulfil their pledge to \nincrease their contributions to official development \nassistance to 0.71 per cent of gross national income. \nThat is necessary if the global development agenda is \nto help vulnerable economies, such as Zambia\u2019s, meet \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \n Zambia believes that there is a need to reform \ninternational financial governance systems in order to \navoid future global financial crises. The changes, \nwhich must be inclusive, should respond to the needs \nand concerns of all nations, regardless of status. It is \nessential that there be an increase in the voice and \npower of developing countries at the World Bank and \nthe International Monetary Fund. The reform process \nshould aim to improve the predictability of aid flows \nand emphasize reforms that promote faster aid delivery \nand fewer conditionalities. \n Zambia roundly applauds the leadership that the \nUnited Nations provides in tackling climate change, as \nwas illustrated only two days ago by the hosting of the \nhigh-level Summit on Climate Change. Our efforts to \nraise the standards of living for the world\u2019s poor people \nin order to meet the Millennium Development Goals \nare being frustrated by the effects of climate change.  \n Scientists have spoken. We have seen with our \nown eyes, in just one generation, how great an effect \nclimate change has had on our environment. On the eve \nof the Climate Change Summit, just a few days ago, \nunprecedented floods hit the state of Georgia in this \ncountry, as if to rebuke any of us who still doubt the \nevidence. Let us just look around us. We do not need \nscience to tell us that deserts have expanded, that \nforests have drastically shrunk, that rivers have dried \nup and that it rains less and less in many places, and \nyet so much more in others. Nature has lost its balance \nand humankind has lost its footing. \n In our own short lifespan, in my own country, I \nremember a time when forests were within a child\u2019s \nwalking distance, teeming with a profusion of animals, \nbirds, plants, insects and fruits. Today my \ngrandchildren would be lucky to name the indigenous \nfruits of our country on the fingers of one hand. So \nmany species of our countries\u2019 flora and fauna have \nbecome extinct \u2014 forever lost to the world \u2014 in such \na short time.  \n Our children have spoken. Our citizens have \nspoken. If we go to Copenhagen to question the science \nyet again, or to make more speeches justifying \ninaction, if we still believe that we can only act after \nour competitors act, then we as leaders will have failed \nour peoples and consigned the world to utter \ndestruction. Copenhagen is the precipice, either we \nstep back and let live or tip over into the abyss. We \nmust act, and act now. \n With regard to mitigation, Zambia\u2019s view is that \nthe shared vision should be based on shared \nresponsibilities for climate change; and that there must \nbe an equitable burden-sharing mechanism that requires \ndeveloped countries to commit to reducing emissions to \nlegally binding levels, while developing countries take \nactions to ensure a substantial reduction from \nenvironment-degrading development programmes. \n As the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference \ndraws near, Zambia expects an agreement that will \nbalance climate change concerns with development. \nThe Copenhagen agreement must provide increased \nand predictable support for the implementation of the \nadaptation programme, which must be established \nwithin a binding legal instrument under the United \nNations Framework Convention. \n Speaking in my capacity as the Chairman of the \nInternational Conference on Great Lakes Region, I am \nhappy to report to the Assembly that the Great Lakes \nregion of Africa is now more stable and peaceful than \nit has ever been in the past 15 years, albeit with \nchallenges. The improved relations between the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, and \ntheir joint efforts to tackle the problem of negative \nforces in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo, has opened up opportunities for achieving \nsustainable peace and stability in the region. \n However, the region is still faced with the threat \nposed by the continued presence of illegal armed \ngroups and negative forces, namely, the Forces \nd\u00e9mocratiques de lib\u00e9ration du Rwanda (FDLR)/ \nex-Forces arm\u00e9es rwandaises/Interahamwe, the Lord\u2019s \nResistance Army (LRA) and the Allied Democratic \nForces. Although the recent joint military operations \nbetween the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \nRwanda succeeded in dislodging FDLR elements from \nmost of their strongholds, the continued atrocities \n  \n \n09-52425 48 \n \ncommitted by the remnants of that group against \ncivilians remains a great source of concern. \n We applaud the role of the international \ncommunity through the United Nations Organization \nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in \nproviding support for the Government of that country \nin its efforts to build military capacity to neutralize the \nnegative forces in the eastern part of its territory. The \ninternational community needs to exert more sustained \npressure on the leadership of those negative forces \nliving within and outside the region, so that they are \nbrought to justice. \n The Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, which fled to the \nnorth-eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo and the Central African Republic after the Juba \ntalks failed, continues to commit atrocities against the \ninnocent civilian population. The Great Lakes \nmechanisms allowed for a joint military operation \nagainst the LRA, which, challenges notwithstanding, \nachieved some progress in dislodging rebel forces. \n There is a need for sustained military and \ndiplomatic pressure to bring Joseph Kony back to the \nnegotiating table. There is also a need for more \nlogistical support from the international community to \nprotect the civilian population and, at the same time, \nput an end to the atrocities and brutality committed \nwith impunity by the LRA. \n The Great Lakes region is organizing a round \ntable conference in Bujumbura, Burundi, to be held \nfrom 5 to 6 November 2009, at which we expect \nrenewed support from the Group of Friends and other \npartners to finance the Pact on Security, Stability and \nDevelopment in the Great Lakes Region. \n Prior to the global economic downturn, Zambia\u2019s \neconomic growth was on course to meet all but one of \nthe Millennium Development Goals, namely, ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability. However, the effect of the \nglobal financial and economic crisis, coupled with the \neffects of climate change, threaten the prospects of \nmeeting the MDGs on poverty, agriculture and \nenvironmental sustainability. \n The United Nations remains the central principal \norgan for coordinating international cooperation in \nsocio-economic development, peace, security, human \nrights and the rule of law. There is a need to reform the \nUnited Nations in order to make it more effective and \nefficient. Zambia believes that the reform of the United \nNations will not be complete without meaningful \nreform of the Security Council. Making the Council \nmore representative, democratic and accountable to all \nMember States, irrespective of status, is essential if its \ndecisions are to be acceptable to the entire \ninternational community. The Security Council must \nadapt to the realities of the new geopolitical situation \nthat characterize the world. \n Given that Africa constitutes the second largest \nbloc of United Nations membership, proposals to \nreform the Security Council should heed Africa\u2019s call \nfor two permanent seats with veto power and two \nadditional non-permanent seats. That would address the \nhistorical injustice against Africa while responding to \nthe need to democratize the Security Council. Equally \nimportant in that regard is the need to reform the \nworking methods of that important United Nations \nbody. \n Human rights issues are an important component \nin the maintenance of peace and stability in any \ncountry. I wish to inform the Assembly that, since \nZambia was elected a member of the Human Rights \nCouncil, in 2006, it has continued to advocate for the \npromotion and protection of human rights. In May \n2008, Zambia extended an open invitation to all \nmandate holders on special areas of focus relating to \nissues of human rights to visit and evaluate the extent \nto which Zambia observes its obligations under the \nvarious United Nations conventions. We urge other \ncountries to follow suit. \n Even in the post-cold-war era, nuclear arms pose \na threat to international peace and security and the very \nexistence of humankind. It is for that reason that \nZambia stands for general and complete disarmament \nin a time-bound manner, to include biological, \nchemical, nuclear and radiological weapons. The \ndemand of the time is that we compete for peace, not \nwar, for development and not armaments.  \n There is no doubt that the United Nations \ncontinues to be the only multilateral institution capable \nof addressing the challenges of our one world. This \nsession\u2019s theme attests to that fact. The world looks up \nto this body to encourage dialogue among civilizations \non all global challenges in an inclusive manner as the \nonly practical way to ensure meaningful and effective \ninternational cooperation. \n Allow me to conclude by quoting Jonathan Rauch \nin the January 2001 issue of The Atlantic magazine, in \n \n \n49 09-52425 \n \nhis article entitled \u201cThe New Old Economy: Oil, \nComputers and the Reinvention of the Earth\u201d, as \nquoted by R. A. Bisson and Jay Lehr in the preface to \ntheir book entitled Modern Groundwater Exploration. \nIn the article, which looked at future oil supply, \nMr. Rauch predicted that demand for oil will peter out \nwell before supply runs out because, he argued, \nsomething cheaper and cleaner would come along. He \nconcluded by stating that \u201cknowledge, not petroleum, \nis becoming the critical resource in the oil business\u201d \nand that, although the supply of oil is fixed, the supply \nof knowledge is boundless. \n Thus human ingenuity holds the secret to \nresolving problems confronting humankind. So it is \nwith all the issues facing us and this United Nations of \nours today. The resolution of our problems of climate \nchange, the economic and financial crisis, peace and \nsecurity and human rights and democracy depends \nupon human ingenuity. The United Nations must \ntherefore first \u2014 and most important \u2014 work to create \nan environment where ingenuity can indeed flourish, \nthat is, a peaceful world where all feel they belong and \nare treated with dignity. \n Before I conclude my remarks, let me just say a \nword or two about the embargo that has been imposed \non the people and Government of Cuba since 1959 by \nthe United States of America. Those unfair and \nunjustified sanctions have greatly hurt the people of \nCuba. The time has come for those sanctions to be \nlifted. I join those who are calling for the lifting of \nsanctions. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people and the Government \nof Turkmenistan, I heartily welcome and congratulate \nyou, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, on the opening of the \nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly and on \nyour election as President of the Assembly and express \nmy confidence that, under your leadership, this body \nwill work successfully and fruitfully. I should also like \nto thank Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-third session, for his \nskilful and effective work in that post. \n The current state of global realities and the nature \nof and trends in today\u2019s political, economic and social \nprocesses objectively require closer and more \ncoordinated interaction between States and major \ninternational organizations if we are to accomplish our \ncommon main goals: achieving world peace and \nsecurity, creating conditions for further development \nand progress, and protecting the legal and moral \nfoundations of today\u2019s world order. \n The level of effectiveness of such interaction, \nstriking a reasonable balance between national interests \nand the interests of the entire international community, \nwill greatly determine how successfully we resolve \nequally important global problems with regard to the \necology, energy, food, issues of fair distribution of \nwater resources, effectiveness in fighting poverty and \ninfectious diseases, countering the drug threat and \nmany other challenges. \n It is impossible to talk about achieving these \ngoals without acknowledging and confirming the \ncritical role of the United Nations. For more than 60 \nyears the Organization has been the main guarantor in \nmaintaining and supporting universal peace, security \nand development. During that time, our Organization \nhas won great credibility in the world, accumulating \nunique experience in resolving difficult international \nproblems and forging a firm legal foundation for \ncooperation between States. \n The United Nations was and remains the \nunderpinning of today\u2019s world order, a pole of \nattraction of the hopes and aspirations of all mankind. \nIn the present conditions it is the United Nations that \nmust become a pillar in the constructive activity of \nStates in building a just and harmonized system of \ninternational relations. \n It is from this angle that Turkmenistan considers \nissues of United Nations reform. We realize that on a \nnumber of aspects our Organization needs \nimprovement and greater effectiveness to meet today\u2019s \nneeds. That is a normal and logical process in line with \nthe logic of contemporary dynamic world development. \nTherefore we are for a rational reform of the United \nNations. We will achieve that only by further \nstrengthening it and steadily consolidating its position \nin the international system, expanding its role and \nfunctions as a guarantor of global peace, stability and \ndevelopment. \n We are confident that United Nations reform must \nbe sensible, targeted and related to the real needs of the \ninternational community. Turkmenistan supports efforts \nof Member States and of the Secretary-General aimed \nat making the Organization\u2019s work more dynamic, \nmore effective, more open and more democratic. In this \ncontext, Turkmenistan shares the view on the need to \nfurther improve the structure of the Security Council, \ncreating closer and effective interaction between the \nCouncil and the General Assembly. \n The main goal of our foreign policy remains the \nsame: comprehensive assistance to the world \ncommunity in its efforts to support and strengthen a \nglobal security system, to warn of and neutralize \nthreats of conflict and to provide conditions for stable \nand sustainable development of States and peoples and \nfor broad and constructive international cooperation. \n In this regard, we believe that the permanent \nneutrality of Turkmenistan and the related \nconsequences of its legal status give the community of \nnations good practical opportunities to positively \nimpact the course and nature of processes under way in \nCentral Asia and the region of the Caspian basin. That \nmeans creating here permanently functioning \nmechanisms of international contacts for discussing \n \n \n33 09-52179 \n \nvarious aspects of regional problems and working out \nmutually acceptable and consensual decisions. Based \non available experience and on political and diplomatic \npeacemaking under United Nations auspices, \nTurkmenistan states that it is ready to provide the \nworld community with all the necessary political and \nlogistical conditions for that activity. \n In this context we consider exceptionally \nimportant and promising the decision of the United \nNations in 2007 on opening the United Nations \nRegional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central \nAsia, with its headquarters in Ashgabat. The Centre \nnow works actively on monitoring and analysing \nregional problems. It participates in various measures \nconcerning most important development issues in \nCentral Asia, including at the level of heads of State, \nand helps to craft approaches for resolving those \nissues. Turkmenistan welcomes the involvement of \nvarious States, international organizations, financial \nand economic institutions and experts in United \nNations efforts to draw up constructive models of \ndevelopment for regional processes. \n In formulating our approaches to the problems of \nuniversal security, our view is that the concept is \nintegral and indivisible, both geopolitically and from \nthe standpoint of specific aspects. We are certain that \nsecurity in one country cannot be guaranteed when \nsecurity is lacking in the region, on the continent or in \nthe world. Similarly, political or military security \ncannot be long term and fully fledged without \nguaranteeing economic, energy and food security, \nwithout preventing and mitigating the risks and threats \nof a man-made ecological problem, or without \neffectively combating international terrorism, \norganized crime, proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction or other global challenges. \n From this point of view, one of the most urgent \ncomponents of global security is energy security. First \nand foremost, that is because the current system of \ninternational energy has become a vulnerable link in \nthe world economy. That vulnerability is due to a \nnumber of reasons: political instability in some parts of \nthe planet, a lack of commonly recognized international \nlegal mechanisms, incomplete infrastructure and \npipeline routes that are geographically limited. All of \nthat affects the common atmosphere in the world \nenergy supply market. There is an objective need to \nchange this situation, to overcome inertia of \nstereotypes and to reach a new level of thinking that \ncorresponds to modern demands. \n Today, we talk not about adopting certain \npreventive measures or about local agreements on \nsome aspects of fuel transport, but about the creation of \nprincipally new, universal models of relations in the \nrealm of world energy, models that are based on a \nmultilateral balance of interests, the coinciding of \nopinions and concepts on the global architecture of \nenergy security and an awareness of the long-term \nbenefits and advantages of cooperation. \n It seems logical to begin international discussion \nof the problem of energy supplies as a first step in this \ndirection. The discussion needs to find lines of \ncoincidence of interests, to determine initial positions, \nto generate common language to carry on a dialogue \u2014 \nin other words, to create the basis for substantial and \neffective cooperation. \n Therefore, during the previous session of the \nGeneral Assembly, Turkmenistan announced an \ninitiative to develop universal mechanisms that could \nguarantee reliable and secure functioning of the \ninternational energy supply infrastructure and provide \nfor access to it and its effective use. A first step in that \ndirection was resolution 63/210, entitled \u201cReliable and \nstable transit of energy and its role in ensuring \nsustainable development and international cooperation\u201d, \nwhich was adopted by consensus on 19 December 2008 \non Turkmenistan\u2019s initiative. I would like to take this \nopportunity to express my gratitude to all States for \ntheir support for our initiative and for their responsible \nand constructive position on this issue. \n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n In line with the letter and the spirit of the \nresolution, Turkmenistan proposed the convening, with \nthe support of the United Nations, of a high-level \ninternational conference on the theme \u201cReliable and \nstable transit of energy and its role in securing stable \ndevelopment and international cooperation\u201d. That \nconference took place in Ashgabat in April 2009, and \none of its outcomes was the proposal to request the \nUnited Nations to establish a group of experts to make \nrecommendations on a possible international legal \ndocument on the subject that takes into account \nproposals by interested countries and international \norganizations. Turkmenistan is prepared to fully \nsupport the setting up of such a group in the framework \n  \n \n09-52179 34 \n \nof the United Nations. We call upon all interested \nStates to provide proposals for its programme of work. \nWe believe that the establishment of such a group \ncould be the first step in the process of drafting a \ncomprehensive United Nations document aimed at \nsecuring the effective functioning of the international \nenergy supply system. \n Support for the process of disarmament, reducing \nweapons arsenals \u2014 including, first and foremost, \nweapons of mass destruction \u2014 and preventing \nproliferation continue to be among the most important \nissues on the international agenda. We believe that in \nthe current system of international relations there \nshould be no room for either the legacy of the cold war \nor for the recurrence of bloc confrontation, under \nwhich the quantity and quality of armaments were \nalmost the sole criteria for establishing the influence \nand authority of States. We are convinced that the \nfewer weapons there are in the world, the more stable \nand calm will be its development and the more trust \nand understanding there will be among countries and \npeoples. \n As the Assembly is aware, the Treaty on a \nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia was signed \nin 2006 in the city of Semipalatinsk. All countries of \nthe region have now become parties to the Treaty. This \njoint initiative has proved to be consonant with the \naspirations of the majority of the world\u2019s countries. It \nhas been highly praised by the international community \nand endorsed by the General Assembly. In that regard, \nwe believe that it would be timely to hold an \ninternational conference, during the first half of next \nyear, on the subject of disarmament in the Central \nAsian region and the Caspian Basin. Our country is \nprepared to host such an event. We would also \nwelcome constructive proposals from the international \ncommunity, including from individual States, on how \nto help global disarmament processes and on how to \neffectively address issues pertaining to our \nparticipation in the implementation of such proposals. \n One of the most serious challenges in today\u2019s \nworld is how to effectively combat such phenomena as \ninternational terrorism, illegal drug trafficking and \ncross-border organized crime. For a variety of reasons, \nthose problems are of particular importance for our \nregion. We are convinced that only through joint efforts \nby States working in close cooperation with \ninternational organizations will we be able to \nsuccessfully face those threats. Turkmenistan believes \nthat the United Nations has a special role to play in that \nregard. We believe that it is both necessary and timely \nto reinvigorate the participation of the United Nations \nand its agencies in developing and coordinating \neffective models for international cooperation aimed at \nneutralizing those threats and putting in place \nmechanisms for preventive diplomacy and the \nestablishment of conditions for the post-conflict \nreconstruction of economic and social infrastructure. \n In that connection, we must underscore the \nspecial importance that Turkmenistan attaches to the \nreconstruction of Afghanistan and to the establishment \nof lasting peace on Afghan soil. Our country provides \nassistance to Afghanistan for economic, social and \nhumanitarian projects. That work will continue. We \nwant to see Afghanistan as a peaceful and prosperous \ncountry that is a good neighbour and partner for all \nStates in the region. \n At the same time, we believe that the United \nNations can and should play an important role in \nresolving the issue of Afghanistan. We are convinced \nthat, with its enormous peacemaking experience and \ngreat moral authority, the United Nations is capable of \nproposing new formats and models in the context of \npolitical and diplomatic efforts to resolve \nAfghanistan\u2019s problems and establish peace and \nharmony in that country. That work could today be \ndone more energetically and efficiently, given the \npotential of the United Nations Regional Centre for \nPreventive Diplomacy for Central Asia. We support \nincreased focused involvement by the Regional Centre \nin the international community\u2019s efforts to resolve the \nsituation in Afghanistan. \n The international community\u2019s awareness of \nlong-term development objectives and its readiness to \nwork jointly to achieve them are today prerequisites for \nthe stability of the entire system of international \nrelations. The serious effects of the global financial and \neconomic crisis have once again clearly demonstrated \nthe need to join efforts in developing an international \nsecurity architecture and establishing the conditions for \nequal and fair relations between States and peoples on \nthe basis of recognized international legal norms and \nthe timeless ideals of the United Nations. \n Turkmenistan believes that responsibility, \nmorality and humanism will be the criteria by which \npresent and future generations will assess our work. As \na State and as a member of the world community we \n \n \n35 09-52179 \n \nwill further contribute to strengthening lofty principles \nin international affairs while consistently implementing \nour philosophy of Turkmen neutrality, a fundamental \npart of which includes our strategic cooperation with \nthe United Nations."

        "file_text": "Let me begin, \nMr. President, by warmly congratulating you on your \nelection and extending the best wishes of the Irish \nGovernment and the Irish people for a successful term \nin office. \n It is indeed a very great honour to participate in \nthis general debate and to share this unique global \nplatform. Ireland cherishes its membership in the \nUnited Nations. We believe strongly in the purposes, \nthe principles and the potential of this great global \nOrganization of ours. And we are proud of the role we \nhave ourselves played in developing that potential over \nthe past five decades. We are determined to maintain \nthis role and to remain steadfastly at the service of the \nUnited Nations. \n Rarely have the challenges facing the global \ncommunity been as formidable, or as pressing, as those \nof today. And rarely has the need been greater for \ncollective action and for the facilitating framework that \nis uniquely provided by the United Nations. Our \ndiscussions in New York over the past week have \nhighlighted some of the most urgent issues on the \nOrganization\u2019s agenda at present, including climate \nchange, global poverty and hunger, and nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. \n We are also confronted with the global financial \nand economic crisis \u2014 the most severe in a generation \u2014 \nwhich is leaving its mark on every family and \ncommunity across the world. Governments everywhere \nare facing a daunting task, as they work to mitigate the \neffects of global recession and economic turbulence \nand to limit the impact of the crisis on those in greatest \nneed. Once again, the United Nations provides a \nframework for the development of collective responses \nand solutions. \n The summit of world leaders hosted by Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon in New York last week on \nclimate change displayed the strength of international \ncommitment on this issue. The Secretary-General has \nbeen a powerful advocate of collective action to tackle \nthis major threat to our planet and our future \ngenerations. It now falls to us, the Member States, to \nredouble our efforts to ensure a successful outcome to \nthe Copenhagen Conference in December. \n The promise that the United Nations embodies to \ntackle all these global threats can only be realized \nthrough continuing efforts to make this a stronger and \nmore effective Organization. Ireland has played, and \nwill continue to play, an active role in championing the \nreform agenda at the United Nations. \n In the area of system-wide coherence, the reform \nagenda is already producing good results and helping \nto deliver a more effective and relevant United \nNations. The One United Nations Initiative is \ndelivering improved development performance at the \nindividual country level. Ireland warmly welcomes the \nprogress being made in the General Assembly and, in \nparticular, the recent decision to establish a new gender \nentity to promote gender equality. I encourage early \naction to make the new entity operational during the \nAssembly\u2019s current session. \n The need for greater progress on other parts of \nthe United Nations reform agenda still remains. A \npositive start has been made to the intergovernmental \nnegotiations on Security Council reform. But more \nurgency is required in transforming the Council to \nmake it more representative and reflective of twenty-\nfirst century realities, as well as to improve its \nfunctioning and increase its transparency. \n I would like to devote some time today to \ndiscussing the critical issue \u2014 indeed the scandal \u2014 \nthat is hunger in our world today. Tonight, over one \nbillion people will go to bed hungry and malnourished. \nThat is one in seven people inhabiting the planet today. \nThis scandal represents perhaps the biggest collective \nfailure of mankind. In the last few days \u2014 during the \npast week in the General Assembly \u2014 world leaders \nhave come together to discuss the most complex and \n  \n \n09-52604 4 \n \ndaunting of global challenges, including climate \nchange and non-proliferation. Yet, the simple challenge \nof putting food into the mouths of everybody on the \nplanet still remains beyond us.  \n I speak today as the representative of a country \nthat has experienced famine and hunger and whose \npopulation was decimated by the Great Famine in \nIreland in 1847. A year ago this week I accompanied \nour Prime Minister \u2014 our Taoiseach \u2014 here to the \nUnited Nations Headquarters to present to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban the report of our Hunger Task Force. The \nkey recommendation in that report was a call for global \nleadership to tackle hunger. I was therefore greatly \nencouraged last Saturday to see such leadership by \nSecretary-General Ban and United States Secretary of \nState Clinton aimed at constructing a road map to \ntranslate rhetoric and commitment on hunger into real \naction \u2014 and real action on the ground. The Global \nPartnership for Agriculture and Food Security initiative \nholds the promise of contributing to a world free from \nchronic hunger. \n It is clear what we must do. We must tackle \nhunger in a comprehensive way and address the \nfundamental causes of hunger. We need to invest in \nagriculture and agricultural research and, in particular, \nto support women farmers. We need to invest in rural \ninfrastructure, enhance nutrition and support national \nand regional plans. Ireland has placed food security \nand related sectors as a cornerstone of our aid \nprogramme. By 2012 we will ensure that 20 per cent of \nour aid programme is hunger-focused. We are well on \nour way to meeting this objective. But above all we \nneed, at a global level, to summon the political will to \nend this scandal. Nothing short of the complete \neradication of hunger on the planet should satisfy us.  \n Peacekeeping and the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security have always been \ncentral to the role of the United Nations. Ireland is \ndeeply proud of the long-standing contribution that we \nhave made to United Nations peacekeeping operations \nacross the world. For over half a century, there has \nbeen a continuous tradition of Irish peacekeepers \nserving the cause of peace under the United Nations \nblue flag somewhere in the world. This goes to the \nvery heart of our commitment to the United Nations \nand the values it represents \u2014 a commitment that is, I \nshould say, an integral part of our foreign policy and \nthat helps to define us as a nation. \n It is clear, however, that both the Organization \nand contributing countries are being severely stretched \nin terms of the demands made by a steadily escalating \nnumber of peace support operations around the world. \nThe Secretary-General\u2019s paper, \u201cA New Partnership \nAgenda: Charting a New Horizon for United Nations \nPeacekeeping\u201d, is therefore a very welcome initiative, \nand we look forward to contributing to its early \nconsideration by the General Assembly. \n Regional organizations, such as the European \nUnion and the African Union, play a vital role in \nhelping the United Nations to fulfil its peacekeeping \nresponsibilities. As the Secretary-General acknowledged \nwhen he visited Dublin last July, without the unique \ncontributions of regional organizations such as the \nEuropean Union, United Nations operations would not \nbe able to achieve their goals and could, in fact, fail \nentirely. The successful transition earlier this year from \nthe European Union-led force in Chad and the Central \nAfrican Republic (EUFOR) to the United Nations \nMission there shows how important and effective this \npartnership has become, as does the similarly \nsuccessful transition to the European Union Rule of \nLaw Mission in Kosovo. \n In Ireland we have known the terrible human cost \nof conflict. The Irish Government has been developing \nover the past years a focus on conflict resolution work, \nbuilding on our own practical experiences with the \nNorthern Ireland peace process. \n Complementing the work of others, especially the \nUnited Nations, we hope that we may be able to make \na distinctive contribution to conflict resolution efforts \nin other parts of the world. As one example, we are \nengaging actively in Timor-Leste, using lessons \nderived from our own peace process to help increase \nconfidence in policing and security arrangements in \nthat country. I am also proud that, in relation to \nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), the Irish \nGovernment is sponsoring a major lessons-learned \nexercise involving interactions between women from \nTimor-Leste, Liberia and Northern Ireland. \n Building peace and ending conflict cannot be \naccomplished without also removing the very means of \nconflict. Last year, Ireland was proud to host the \ndiplomatic conference that adopted the Convention on \nCluster Munitions, a historic agreement aimed at \nbanning the production and use of these most \ndestructive of weapons. I warmly welcome the \n \n \n5 09-52604 \n \nconsiderable progress that has been made this year \ntowards the Convention\u2019s entry into force. We now \nneed fewer than 10 further ratifications to achieve this, \nand I urge all Governments that have not yet signed \nand ratified the Convention to do so at the earliest \nopportunity. \n Ireland has always been strongly supportive of \nthe leading role played by the United Nations in \nworking to promote non-proliferation and remove the \nthreat posed by nuclear weapons. Indeed, Ireland was \nthe first country to sign and ratify the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty. Next year\u2019s Review \nConference will be of critical importance for efforts to \nhelp strengthen the international non-proliferation \nsystem, at a time when the threats it faces have perhaps \nnever been greater. We encourage all Member States to \nwork actively and constructively to achieve a \nsuccessful outcome, and Ireland will engage fully in \nthat effort itself. Ireland also applauds and welcomes \nthe renewed focus on nuclear disarmament. We \nencourage the United States and Russia particularly as \nthey work towards a legally binding follow-on \narrangement to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, \nwhich expires at the end of this year. \n Ireland would like to see the active engagement \nof the United Nations in monitoring human rights \nsituations around the world maintained and \nstrengthened. The Human Rights Council and other \nhuman rights mechanisms must be enabled to address \nthe most difficult human rights situations in a timely \nand effective manner. Continued support will also be \nneeded for the International Criminal Court and the \ninternational tribunals in their efforts to promote \njustice and combat impunity. Ireland urges the fullest \ncooperation by all Member States in this regard. \n At the 2005 World Summit, the Assembly \nendorsed the important concept of the responsibility to \nprotect. It is now imperative to take that work forward \nto put this concept into practical effect, based on the \nconsensus resolution at the end of the sixty-third \nsession (resolution 63/308). \n Let me turn now for a moment to the situation in \nthe Middle East. Ireland very much welcomes and \nsupports the renewed international efforts made in \nrecent months to reinvigorate the Middle East peace \nprocess with a view to bringing about a comprehensive \nand lasting peace settlement. Particular praise is due to \nthe United States Administration and to the United \nStates Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, for their \nintensive engagement aimed at achieving the \nresumption of peace negotiations between Israel and \nthe Palestinian Authority, as well as the promotion of \npeace between Israel and all of its neighbours. We are \nof course fortunate in Ireland to have had the benefit of \nfirst-hand experience of George Mitchell\u2019s formidable \nskills, patience and tenacity as a peacemaker, and we \nhope he can bring these unique skills to this particular \nprocess. \n With our European Union (EU) partners, we \nstand ready to work closely with our Israeli and \nPalestinian partners and to support the United States \nand the Quartet in their efforts. It is vitally important \nthat all parties contribute to confidence-building by \nfully honouring their commitments and obligations \nunder the Road Map. This must include real efforts to \nhalt all settlement activities and improve the living \nconditions of civilians on the ground in the Palestinian \nterritories. Ordinary people must see in their daily lives \nthe benefits that will derive from peace and must be \nencouraged to take risks for peace. \n Nowhere is this more urgent than in Gaza. We \nwish to see all border crossings fully and immediately \nopened to normal commercial and humanitarian traffic. \nWe have all been shocked by the violence and \nwidespread civilian casualties that took place during \nthe conflict in Gaza at the start of this year. There must \nbe some form of accountability for the most serious \nviolations of international law that occurred at that \ntime. The Human Rights Council is now addressing \nthis issue in considering the comprehensive report \nprepared by Justice Goldstone and his team \n(A/HRC/12/48). \n Like many others in the international community, \nIreland has followed recent events in Iran with \nmounting concern. We urge Iran to comply fully with \nall of its obligations and commitments in terms of \nprotecting the basic human rights of its own citizens. It \nis equally urgent that Iran respond to the demands of \nthe international community to cease uranium \nenrichment and to answer satisfactorily all questions \nregarding its nuclear activities, particularly in the light \nof the latest revelations regarding the previously \nundisclosed nuclear site at Qom. The international \ncommunity is ready to engage with Iran and has made \ngenerous offers to do so. It is for Iran now to decide \nwhether it wishes to pursue the path of engagement or \nto opt for increasing isolation. We very much hope that \n  \n \n09-52604 6 \n \nthe forthcoming discussions with Iran, to begin on \n1 October, will mark the start of a constructive \nengagement on the major issues of international \nconcern. \n The continuing humanitarian tragedy of Darfur \nhorrifies world opinion and simply cannot be ignored. I \nwant to pay tribute to the United Nations and \ninternational humanitarian staff, who are working \ntirelessly and selflessly under the most difficult of \ncircumstances. I think in particular of Sharon Commins \nand Hilda Kuwuki, two brave and dedicated aid \nworkers with the Irish agency GOAL, who were \nkidnapped in Darfur on 3 July. The Irish Government is \ngrateful for all the assistance we have received from \nthe United Nations and others in our efforts to secure \nthe release of these two women. We fervently hope that \nthe day of their release from captivity is not far off. \nThe people of Darfur and of all Sudan richly deserve \npeace. We must all collectively continue working to \npromote the United Nations-African Union mediation \nin Darfur, to support full implementation of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement and to ensure that \njustice and the defence of human rights prevail \nthroughout Sudan. \n In Burma/Myanmar, Ireland condemns the recent \nconviction of Aung San Suu Kyi and again calls for her \nimmediate release and that of all political prisoners and \nfor the launching of a genuine, inclusive political \ndialogue. International pressure is needed on Burma\u2019s \nleaders, notably from other countries in the region, to \nchange course and move to democracy. \n In Sri Lanka, there remains an urgent need to \nimprove the humanitarian situation of those fleeing the \nrecent violence in the Tamil areas. The Sri Lankan \nGovernment must cooperate fully with the United \nNations to alleviate the plight of those affected. It must \nalso work for a political settlement which meets the \naspirations of all communities in Sri Lanka. \n Let me say in conclusion that, as the international \ncommunity faces a formidable array of challenges, \nthere has never been a greater need for the United \nNations itself. With each new challenge that appears, \nthe value of common action to address it at a global \nlevel becomes ever more apparent. There is a much \nclearer appreciation of this Organization\u2019s potential to \ndeliver an effective response to these challenges. Let us \nseize the moment and work together to ensure that the \nopportunity we have at present is transformed into real \nachievement on the ground. \n We can all be justly proud of the record of the \nUnited Nations over the past half century. The \nchallenge for us, the Member States, is whether we can \nmobilize the political will needed in order to ensure \nthat the United Nations can deliver even more in the \nfuture. Ireland, for its part, commits itself to doing \neverything in its power to realize the full potential of \nthe United Nations, this unique voice of the \ninternational community, in the pursuit of a much \nbetter and a much safer world.

        "file_text": "The \ndelegation of the Niger \u2014 which I have the honour to \nlead and which brings the message of His Excellency \nMamadou Tandja, President of the Republic \u2014 is more \nthan pleased to see you, Mr. President, presiding over \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Your \nelection, which the Niger welcomes with pride, is \nwithout a doubt both recognition and endorsement of \nyour exceptional abilities as a seasoned diplomat, \nwhich you have demonstrated throughout your \ndistinguished career. We in the Niger are well placed to \nattest to your commitment to the cause of Africa and of \nour common subregion, specifically through the \nCommunity of Sahel-Saharan States, that other forum \nin which our countries work together for the same \ngoals that are enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations. Thus we consider ourselves to be in your good \nhands, ready to advance the work of the Organization \nin this time of formidable challenges. \n I should like to renew our congratulations to the \noutgoing President, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, \non his active and very full presidency, and to state that \nthe Niger was honoured to serve alongside him in its \ncapacity as Vice-President at the sixty-third session. \n On behalf of the Niger, I should like to reiterate \nour profound gratitude to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his unflagging efforts to make the United \nNations a more just and effective Organization, able to \nmeet the expectations of its Members. \n My delegation welcomes your decision, Sir, to \ndeclare as the very apt theme for the Assembly\u2019s \ncurrent session the strengthening of multilateralism and \ndialogue among civilizations for international peace, \nsecurity and development. In our view, this theme has \nthe potential to spur Member States to greater initiative \nin realizing the goals that we are pursuing, namely, \nthose of preserving international peace and security. \nWe are pleased, in this regard, by the renewed \ndynamism in cooperation between the Security Council \nand regional organizations, in particular the African \nUnion. We believe that this direction has the potential \n \n \n27 09-52598 \n \nto lead to lasting solutions to the problems of peace \nand security in Africa. \n We are convinced that such cooperation will yield \nresults even on the most delicate issues, such as the \nimplementation of the political-legal concept of the \nprinciple of universal jurisdiction. While my delegation \nwelcomes the inclusion of this topic in the agenda of \nthe General Assembly, we should like once again to \nendorse the concerns already expressed by the African \nUnion and to urge Member States to avoid using this \nprinciple inappropriately. We hope that our debate in \nthis common forum will make possible a better \nunderstanding of this concept and a better definition of \nthe framework governing its eventual application. \n We note the progress that is being made in \nvarious areas in the prevention and management of \nconflicts, both in Africa and elsewhere. And we \nwelcome the commitment and goodwill of all parties \ncarrying out concerted actions to ensure international \npeace and security. \n The recommendations of the special summit on \nconflict prevention and management held in Tripoli \nreflect the will of African leaders to take on issues that \nhave always slowed our continent in its march towards \nprogress and prosperity. It is at this level that the theme \nof multilateralism \u2014 which you, Mr. President, have \nselected for the sixty-fourth session \u2014 takes on all its \nmeaning. Indeed, the United Nations, as the common \nframework enjoying the highest level of participation \nby countries and other actors in the world, should serve \nas a laboratory in which we work towards the goal of a \nmore balanced international community. \n Governed as it is by the laws of globalization, the \ncurrent international scene is, as we know, much more \ncomplex today than in the past. We must address and \nmanage the consequences of the international financial \ncrisis and, for countries in the Sahel such as the Niger, \nthe recurrent effects of food insecurity. We must \naddress climate change in a concerted and coordinated \nmanner, and we must constantly question the current \nformulas for preventing conflict and maintaining \ninternational peace and security.  \n My delegation supports such initiatives, which \nmust be inclusive, because they must benefit from the \ncontributions and perspectives of everyone, including \nthe most vulnerable countries. In particular, we support \nthe various discussions under way on this subject, \nwhether in the General Assembly, the Economic and \nSocial Council or the Security Council, or even in the \ncontext of specific initiatives such as the discussions \nbeing held by Canada on peacekeeping operations. \n We in the Niger have made undeniable progress \nin the area of combating poverty and promoting basic \ndevelopment, thanks to the bold actions of the \nPresident. Through projects designed specifically to \nmeet the needs of Niger\u2019s people, he has enabled our \ncountry to finally give meaning to development. Today, \ndevelopment is palpable in every corner of the Niger \nbecause of proactive and systematic efforts to build \nclassrooms and health clinics, dig wells, build local \ndrinking water systems and promote a microcredit \nsystem designed specifically for the most vulnerable \nrural women. The head of State is doing this to \nimprove the living conditions of our people, who \nsuffered from the political instability that characterized \nour country during the 1990s, which one could \ndescribe as a lost decade for Niger\u2019s development. In \nlate August, a meeting was held in Niamey for the \nsecond 2009 review by the Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth Facility of the International Monetary Fund. \nThe Niger\u2019s performance in those areas was \nacknowledged and commended at the meeting, which \nbrought together representatives of the World Bank and \nof our country\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Finance. \n I recall these aspects of the situation in Niger \nbecause, as members are aware, a referendum was held \nin our country on 4 August 2009 to adopt a new \nconstitution. It formalizes the return to a presidential \nAdministration more suited to the realities of our \ncountry and introduces new provisions such as that \nestablishing two chambers, Parliament and the Senate. \nThe referendum, held in an atmosphere of calm and \ntransparency by the National Independent Electoral \nCommission, enabled us to adopt the new constitution, \nwhich formalizes the arrival of the sixth Republic.  \n Therefore, I wish to take this opportunity to \nreassure the international community, development \npartners, civil society and other actors and entities that \nmay be justifiably concerned about the political \nsituation in the Niger that the country is not in a \nsituation of lawlessness or insurrection, as some would \nhave one believe, but rather is a place where all people \nfreely express their opinions within the framework of \nthe democratic process, to which we are deeply \ncommitted. \n  \n \n09-52598 28 \n \n The sovereign people of the Niger have chosen to \nrefashion the Republic around certain values with \nwhich they identify. In this new endeavour, President \nMamadou Tandja has solemnly pledged that no group \nor structure will be overlooked. Following the \nreferendum, the President recalled his willingness to \nwork with all citizens of the Niger in the interest of the \ncountry and its people. The forthcoming legislative \nelections, to be held on 20 October, and the municipal \nelections in December 2009 will be opportunities for \nlarge-scale mobilization to ensure better representation \nfor the people in the conduct of State affairs. It is this \nreality of a Niger marching towards development, \nresolutely committed to building its future and more \ndetermined than ever to lift its people out of poverty, \nthat we must bear in mind. \n We fully support any joint action that can \ncontribute to general and complete disarmament. We \nhave been at the forefront in fulfilling our \ncommitments in this area, and we are resolved to \ncontinue to work in that regard within our modest \nmeans. Our most recent initiative was to ratify the \nConvention on Cluster Munitions on 14 May 2009 \u2014 a \nformality that made the Niger one of the very first \ncountries to do so and accelerated its entry into force. \nWe believe that this gesture, although it may seem \nminor, assumes its full meaning in the context of the \ndifficult path towards complete disarmament. For us, \nthis initiative, together with our country\u2019s ratification \nof the Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons, \nTheir Ammunition and Other Related Materials, \nadopted by the Economic Community of West African \nStates, is a significant contribution to disarmament at \nour level. \n We are following the various processes carried \nout at various levels to reform the United Nations \nsystem. This includes reform of the Security Council, \nwith regard to which we call for greater recognition of \nAfrica\u2019s role through the Ezulwini Consensus; the \nongoing preparations to ensure the success of the \nUnited Nations climate change conference in \nCopenhagen; and the summit convened by the \nSecretary-General and just concluded here in New \nYork, which benefited from the valuable guidance of \nheads of State and Government. In addition, there is \nUnited Nations system-wide coherence; the definition \nof the new concept of the responsibility to protect, \nwhich needs to be clearly defined and set out, as in the \nConstitutive Act of the African Union; and, finally, the \nfollow-up to the outcome document of the Conference \non the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its \nImpact on Development, which the previous President \nof the General Assembly wished to begin by appointing \nfacilitators. \n With regard to all those issues and many other \nimportant concerns, such as those referred to in the \noutcome document of the Follow-up International \nConference on Financing for Development to Review \nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, held \nat Doha at the end of 2008, we wish to express once \nagain our ongoing concern that we should develop an \ninclusive and transparent approach at all levels that \ntakes into account the concerns of both large and small \ncountries.  \n We are following with great interest, and often \nconcern, the progress of the commitments made within \nthe framework of the Millennium Development Goals, \nand we note that it remains mixed. At the same time, \nadverse phenomena are placing constraints on both \ndeveloped and developing countries, such as the world \neconomic and financial crisis. These problems now \nrequire that all of us redouble our efforts to keep our \ncommitments. In that regard, we will closely follow the \npreparations for the 2010 mid-term review conference, \nwhich, we hope, will result in efforts to accelerate the \nattainment of the agreed objectives. We also take this \nopportunity to reaffirm the irreplaceable nature of the \nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development as a \nrelevant African initiative that must enjoy the support \nof the United Nations and of the international \ncommunity as a whole.  \n We welcome the decision to convene the Fourth \nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \nCountries, and we salute the host country, Turkey, for \nits generous initiative vis-\u00e0-vis our group of countries. \nWe also thank other countries and partner organizations \nwhich have always remained sensitive to the many \nconstraints and concerns of our countries. We also \nknow that, if significant progress has been made in \n10 years in recognizing our difficult conditions and \nestablishing useful partnerships in that regard, it is \nthanks to the coordination of the Office of the High \nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \nDeveloping States. We thank him for his initiatives, \nwhich remain essential for least developed and \nlandlocked countries in the Sahel, such as the Niger.  \n \n \n29 09-52598 \n \n I should also like to express my Government\u2019s \nappreciation to the President of the General Assembly \nfor his decision to devote part of this session to the \nsubject of the dialogue among cultures and \ncivilizations. We believe that that issue is worthy of \nmuch attention and of action throughout the sixty-\nfourth session. Indeed, we must maintain the \nmomentum begun by eminent Member States through \nthe Third Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue \nand Cooperation for Peace, held in 2008; the High-\nLevel Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace; and the \ninternational conference on dialogue among \ncivilizations and cultural diversity, held from 2 to  \n4 June 2009 in Kairouan, Tunisia. We must develop \nthese initiatives, for which my delegation reiterates its \ncongratulations to the Governments of the countries \nconcerned.  \n Along the same lines, my delegation applauds the \nGovernment of the Philippines, which has decided to \norganize a special meeting at the ministerial level for \nthe countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, under the \ntheme \u201cInterreligious Dialogue and Cooperation for \nPeace and Development\u201d, from 1 to 3 December 2009 \nin Manila. That shows that the theme continues to draw \nthe interest of many States and that you, Mr. President, \nwere aptly inspired in identifying it as a topic of \ninterest for the international community. \n I would like to conclude my statement by \nrenewing my delegation\u2019s delight at the direction that \nyou, Sir, have suggested for the current Assembly \nsession and by reiterating our full confidence in your \nleadership, which promises a very fruitful and dynamic \nterm in the pursuit of common objectives of the \ninternational community. As always, you can count on \nthe unflagging support and readiness of the \nGovernment of the Niger throughout your term. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of my \ndelegation, and in my own name, I extend to the \nPresident our warmest congratulations on his well-\ndeserved election to preside over the sixty-fourth \nsession of the Assembly. I also commend the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless \nefforts at the helm of our Organization in the cause of \ninternational peace and security. \n In this globalized world, nations will increasingly \nface unconventional, emerging threats to their security. \nThe recent rapid spread of the A (H1N1) virus is a case \nin point. The commitment of the entire membership of \nour Organization is required to forge a consensus to \ndeal with the uncertainties of the times ahead. More \nthan ever before, multilateralism will be the way \nforward. \n  \n \n09-52463 40 \n \n As we confronted the severe food and energy \ncrises of a year ago, little did we realize that the world \nwas about to be engulfed in an unprecedented \neconomic crisis. The most severe meltdown since the \nGreat Depression has spared no country, precisely \nbecause we live in an interconnected world. Millions of \npeople all over the world have lost their jobs, their \nincomes and their savings. It is estimated that an \nadditional 50 million people have already been driven \ninto extreme poverty. Whatever modest progress \ndeveloping countries had achieved has been severely \nset back. \n The world may be witnessing the early signs of a \nslow recovery. However, the aftershocks of the crisis \nwill continue to be felt for much longer. Developing \ncountries have experienced declining capital flows, \nstagnating foreign aid and a fall in remittances and \nexport revenues. \n Mauritius, with a small open economy, has been \nexceptionally exposed to the adverse effects of the \ncrisis. Although both our manufacturing sector and our \ntourism industry have been negatively impacted, we \nhave registered positive economic growth. This is due \nto the reforms my Government has implemented since \n2005. Bold reforms have succeeded in making our \neconomy more resilient. In 2008, our gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) grew by 5.3 per cent and the \nunemployment rate dropped to 7.2 per cent. Mauritius \nattracted foreign direct investment amounting to almost \n5 per cent of GDP, and achieved the highest level of \njob creation in more than a decade. \n However, the global crisis has been a severe \nblow. Growth has been slowed; we expect growth of \naround 2.7 per cent this year. But our economy is now \nstructurally more sound, more competitive and \nresilient. We are concerned that a prolonged crisis \ncould drive our export-oriented economy into reverse \ngear, with further declines in trade and capital flows, \nexchange rate volatility, and further falls in tourist \narrivals. \n To mitigate the damage to our economy, we \nreacted as soon as the first signs of the subprime crisis \nstarted in the United States. We introduced an \nexpansionary budget with emphasis on infrastructural \nprojects, and as the crisis spread into a worldwide \nfinancial and economic crisis we put in place a \nstimulus package to save jobs, protect people and \nprepare for the recovery. We have, in other words, been \nahead of the curve. In this uncertain economic \nsituation, the priority of Mauritius is to safeguard the \nhard-earned gains from past reforms. \n We have been collateral victims of financial \nimbalances, over-leveraged financial institutions, \ninadequate regulation and deficient supervision. \nDeveloping countries benefit little from periods of \nboom, and pay an inordinately high price for the busts \nthat often follow. We hope that strengthening \nregulations and supervision will prevent the \naccumulation of high-risk, toxic assets that led to the \ncrisis in the first place. \n The crisis has also made it clear that the Bretton \nWoods institutions stand in need of fundamental \nreform. However, reforms will be effective only if they \ntake into account the long-term stability and \nsustainability of the global economy. Institutions that \nmake global decisions must reflect the changing nature \nof the global economic environment. \n For too long we have condoned a clear \ndemocratic deficit in global economic governance. We \nneed to reshape the global economy into a more \nequitable system, responsive to the needs of all \ncountries and reflecting the realities of the day. In this \nregard, we appreciate the convening of the United \nNations Conference on the World Financial and \nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, held \nlast June. The Conference provided a uniquely \ninclusive platform to address the urgent concerns of all \nnations. It has allowed the formulation of proposals to \nlessen the impact of the crisis, especially on vulnerable \npopulations. \n The implementation of the Conference\u2019s \nrecommendations should avoid a further deterioration \nin the conditions of the world\u2019s poor. And we look \nforward to the recommendations of the Group of 20 \n(G20) Summit, which starts today in Pittsburgh. \n In coping with the effects of the crisis, we have to \nresist the temptation to resort to trade protectionism. \nWe should not forget that international trade has been a \npowerful engine for development and has generated \nsubstantial economic growth. From our perspective as \na vulnerable small island developing State, it is vital \nthat markets remain open and that international trade \nflows are not impeded. \n It is essential that the Doha Round, with \ndevelopment at its core, be successfully concluded, \n \n \n41 09-52463 \n \nwithout, however, any unravelling of the July 2008 \nconvergence package. We look forward to significant \nprogress at the seventh session of the World Trade \nOrganization Ministerial Conference, scheduled for \nDecember in Geneva. \n The negative impact of the economic crisis on the \nmost vulnerable populations causes us great concern. \nThe global economic slowdown has further delayed the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). Confronted with this grave setback, the \ndeveloping world looks for a strong demonstration of \nsolidarity. \n We hope that the donor community will do more \nthan just honour its previous commitments. The \nMillennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus and \nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development \nhave been overtaken by the events of the past year. \n But I strongly believe that what we need now is a \nchange in our approach in the developing economies. \nWe need to urgently apply ourselves to making \npro-business policy reforms instead of just relying on \naid. That is the way to create wealth and prosperity. \nCharity is a noble endeavour, but relying on charity \nalone is not the answer to future prosperity and \nopportunity for all. \n We need to unleash the entrepreneurial drive of \nour people. That is the ultimate answer to the \neradication of poverty. We all know that it is better to \nshow a man how to fish than to give him a fish every \nday. And we need to coordinate our actions to bring \ndown trade barriers. In fact, what the developing \ncountries need is a Marshall Plan, with a single \ncoordinated programme. To qualify, countries need to \nmeet benchmarks for good governance, respect for \nhuman rights, accessible health care and education and \npredictable economic policies. \n Such a plan was successful in uplifting the \neconomies of Europe after the Second World War. I \nhave no doubt that it can be adapted to meet the same \nmeasure of success for developing countries. \n At the national level, my Government is \nmobilizing considerable resources to meet the \nMillennium Development Goals. In a relentless drive \nto fight poverty, we have introduced an eradication of \nabsolute poverty programme, which aims to break the \nvicious circle of poverty begetting poverty. And, to \nshow our commitment to eradicating poverty in our \nregion, Mauritius took the initiative to host the \nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) \nInternational Consultative Conference on Poverty and \nDevelopment last year so that we can develop a \ncommon pragmatic approach. We are committed to the \nattainment of the MDGs on schedule, and look forward \nto the high-level review meeting next year. \n Ensuring the fulfilment of the MDGs demands a \nstronger commitment by national Governments in the \nfight against HIV/AIDS. We are heartened in this \ninstance by the response of the international \ncommunity, which has been timely, generous and \neffective. Each and every nation must be fully engaged \nin this fight. \n In Mauritius, we treat HIV/AIDS as a national \npriority. I have set up a National AIDS Committee, \nwhich I chair. We have put in place a multisectoral \nstrategy to protect the population at large, with special \nemphasis on vulnerable groups. And yesterday I was \ndelighted to learn about the breakthrough of an \nHIV/AIDS vaccine which could be available in the not \ntoo distant future. \n Recently, the A (H1N1) pandemic has rapidly \ntaken on alarming proportions. Although we have taken \nall possible steps to effectively deal with this new \ninfluenza virus, the escalation of the outbreak could \nstretch our health resources and infrastructure. In this \nconnection, developing countries require early access \nto the vaccines that are in the pipeline, once their \nsafety is assured. \n Food security should have been an absolute \npriority of development strategies. It has for far too \nlong been neglected. Many countries struggle to \nguarantee adequate food for their people. The present \neconomic recession compounds an already difficult \nsituation. Over a billion people, mostly in developing \ncountries, do not have sufficient food to meet their \ndaily basic nutritional needs. One in six of the human \nfamily goes to bed hungry and angry. \n The present relative decline in food prices must \nnot make us lose sight of the structural long-term \ndeficit the world faces. This age-old problem is \ncomplicated by uncertainties linked to climate change \nand the diversion of food crops for bio-fuel production. \n We must strengthen measures to improve food \nsecurity globally. Existing funding mechanisms must \n  \n \n09-52463 42 \n \nbe improved to assist the World Food Programme to \neffectively avoid recurrent outbreaks of famine. \n Mauritius welcomes the initiative of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \nto convene the World Summit on Food Security in \nRome in November. It is our earnest hope that it will \nnot be just another conference, but will propose \npractical measures to alleviate hunger and malnutrition. \n In Mauritius, we have adopted a comprehensive \nstrategy to achieve a reasonable level of food self-\nsufficiency. We are mobilizing technological, financial \nand human resources to produce locally as much food \nas is practically possible. To this end, we have set up a \none-billion-rupee Food Security Fund to optimize \nefficiency and boost agricultural production. \n To benefit from economies of scale, we are \nencouraging production in surplus of local \nconsumption for export. We are establishing \npartnerships regionally to jointly produce food crops, \nlivestock and marine products. The effective \nimplementation of this strategy will contribute to \nimproving our national food security. \n We are currently working with Mozambique on a \nrice production project which will contribute to \nimproving food availability in both countries, and \nprobably in the region. \n Climate change poses an existential challenge to \nmankind. Our profligacy puts at stake the very future \nof our planet and the forms of life it supports. This is \nan environmental threat with far-reaching social and \neconomic implications that we have yet to mainstream \ninto our national planning and decision-making \nprocesses. \n We cannot with impunity treat our home planet \nwith contempt. We can yet forestall bringing upon \nourselves the full wrath of nature. But time is running \nout. Divergences must be resolved at all costs, and \nquickly, at Copenhagen. To move forward in a \npragmatic manner, we need to break away from the \nfinger-pointing, recrimination and brinkmanship of the \npast. \n In Copenhagen, it is imperative that we agree to a \ntargeted reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that \nwill restrict global temperature rise to no more than \n1.5\u00b0 C. But any action, to be fair, must be proportional. \nThose who have polluted the most should bear most of \nthe burden. Developing countries need extra help so \nthat their growth path is not thwarted. \n We must create a financial mechanism to assist \ndeveloping countries to adapt to and mitigate the \neffects of climate change. This mechanism has to be \ncredible and sustainable, and be managed according to \nthe principles of good governance. It should also be a \nchannel for the transfer of technology. \n I therefore make a strong appeal that we unite to \nact collectively and quickly in our own interest and \nthat of future generations. \n For its part, Mauritius is implementing the \n\u201cMaurice \u00eele durable\u201d project to respond to climate \nchange and the energy crisis. This is an ambitious \nprogramme focusing on the use of renewable energy \nand the emergence of small power producers. Its \nimplementation will reduce our dependence on fossil \nfuels considerably and facilitate the transition to a \nclean, energy-efficient economy. \n We have mobilized appropriate resources, with \nthe collaboration of the private sector and development \npartners, to build a green and ecological future for \nMauritius. We are doing our utmost to contribute, in \nfull measure, to the global effort required. \n The inherent constraints faced by small island \ndeveloping States (SIDS) \u2014 in particular limited \nresources, remoteness, small domestic markets and \nvulnerability to natural disasters \u2014 cannot be ignored. \nWe share a common future, and the welfare of one is \nunsustainable without the welfare of all. \n We appeal to the international community to be \nmore forthcoming in assisting SIDS in their efforts to \nbecome integrated into the global economy. A one-size-\nfits-all approach to development threatens to further \nmarginalize SIDS in an increasingly globalized world. \nIt is patently obvious that SIDS deserve special \ntreatment and need to be recognized as a group of \ncountries having specificities of their own. \n The promotion and protection of human rights is \na key priority of my Government. I wish to extend our \nappreciation to the United Nations membership for the \nre-election of Mauritius to the Human Rights Council. \nWe will continue to work with other members of the \nCouncil in a spirit of dialogue, cooperation and \nobjectivity to ensure that human rights violations are \neffectively addressed. \n \n \n43 09-52463 \n \n In line with our commitment to see that \nperpetrators of grave human rights violations are \nbrought to justice, we wish to reaffirm our unflinching \nsupport for the International Criminal Court (ICC). \n At the national level, we have adopted legislation \nsuch as the Equal Opportunities Act and the Truth and \nJustice Commission Act to further entrench human \nrights. Our achievements in the field of human rights \nwere widely acknowledged during the Universal \nPeriodic Review conducted earlier this year by the \nHuman Rights Council. We were gratified by the \nunique opportunity provided to us by the Review to \nmake a critical self-assessment of the situation in \nMauritius. \n When I addressed the Assembly in September \n2007 I called on the international community to do \nmore than just stand by the people of Burma. This \nappeal is more than ever relevant. We cannot condone \nthe condemnation of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi by a \nkangaroo court. We reaffirm our solidarity with and \nsupport for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, an emblematic lady \nwho personifies the courage and dignity of her people, \na people battered and bruised but unbowed.  \n It is imperative that we convey a clear and strong \nsignal to the military junta that the international \ncommunity will not tolerate its confiscation of the \nBurmese people\u2019s sovereignty. In this respect, I \nwelcome the recent decision of the EU to extend the \nsanctions imposed on Burma. \n For its part, Mauritius will continue to implement \nthe decision I took in 1997 to suspend importations of \nrice from Burma. This decision has a cost, but it is a \nprice we are prepared to pay in defence of principles \nwe hold dear. We must show the world that there will \nbe no double standards in our approach. I urge those \ncountries that give comfort and sustenance to the \nregime not to let their short-term, mercantile interests \nperpetuate the misery of this long-suffering people. \n The Arab-Israeli conflict, with the question of \nPalestine at its core, remains an issue of deep concern \nnot only to the region, but also to the world at large. \nWe take heart in the efforts of the Administration of \nPresident Obama to impart new impetus to the Middle \nEast peace process. And we could not agree more with \nPresident Obama that continuing to build new \nsettlements flies in the face of logic if lasting peace is \nto be achieved. \n As a long-time proponent of a two-State solution, \nMauritius welcomes the Quartet\u2019s commitment, \nrenewed in Trieste in June, to actively and vigorously \nwork for a comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli \nconflict. \n The Arab League\u2019s commitment to peace with \nIsrael and the Arab Peace Initiative have been \nencouraging developments. We hope that those most \ndirectly concerned will display the courage and \nmaturity to engage in meaningful dialogue in earnest. \n The United Nations is, more than ever, the \nultimate guardian of mankind\u2019s aspiration to global \npeace and security. I salute its unceasing effort in \nresolving conflicts around the world, in particular on \nthe African continent. Conflicts and insecurity in \nAfrica have been a major cause of the continent\u2019s \nunderdevelopment. A study carried out by Oxfam last \nyear indicates that between 1990 and 2005 conflict cost \nthe continent $300 billion, which is almost equivalent \nto all the international aid received by sub-Saharan \nAfrica during that period. \n The African Union has moved ahead with the \ncreation of an African Standby Force. Once fully \nestablished, the Force will, hopefully, help in the \nadvancement of peace and security at the continental \nlevel. The creation of the Mechanism for Conflict \nPrevention, Management and Resolution is also a \npositive step in improving the peace and security \narchitecture of Africa. \n I take this opportunity to commend the United \nNations and the European Union for helping Africa \nenhance its capacity to respond adequately and in a \ntimely manner to security threats on the continent. The \nEuropean Union deserves our appreciation for its \ncontribution, to the tune of \u20ac500 million under the \n10th European Development Fund, for the implementation \nof the Africa Peace Facility. \n Allow me also to highlight some of the progress \nthat has been achieved on the continent this year, \nincluding the formation of an all-inclusive Government \nin Zimbabwe and the holding of presidential elections \nin Mauritania. \n We welcome the Agreement of Goodwill and \nConfidence-Building for the Settlement of the Problem \nin Darfur reached in February by Sudan\u2019s Government \nof National Unity and the Justice and Equality \nMovement.  \n  \n \n09-52463 44 \n \n We commend the role played by the African \nUnion-United Nations joint mediation team and \nparticularly the Government of Qatar, which has done \nso much to drive the process. We call on all the parties \nto the conflict to join in the search for peace in Darfur. \nWe hope that conditions will speedily be created for \nthe return of refugees and internally displaced persons. \n We have high expectations that the preliminary \nagreement reached in Maputo will provide the political \nframework for resolution of the troubled situation in \nMadagascar. We are heartened by the active \ninvolvement and solicitude of various international \nbodies in trying to return the country to constitutional \norder. We cannot and should not condone \nunconstitutional Governments anywhere, be it in \nHonduras or Madagascar. \n Somalia reminds us that we cannot with impunity \nwash our hands of any country, however remote it may \nbe or however unimportant it may seem. The \ninternational community\u2019s neglect of the country and \nits indifference to the suffering of the Somali people \nhave resulted in a quintessential failed State. That \nneglect and indifference have come back to haunt us in \nthe form of piracy. Armed bands led by warlords have \nfilled the political vacuum left by the deliquescence of \nthe Somali State. Today the territory of Somalia \nprovides not only a haven for pirates, but also a base \nfor terrorist groups. The Transitional Federal \nGovernment has to be assisted to regain control of the \ncountry, to put an end to the suffering of the Somali \npeople and to deal with the problem of piracy. \n Terrorism is an insidious, tentacular \nmalignancy \u2014 a bane of our times. It is not only a \nsecurity threat. It is a moral challenge, the negation of \nthe fundamental values of civilization: the sanctity of \nhuman life and the intrinsic worth of the human \nperson. \n Every terrorist attack causes us pain, anguish and \nrevulsion. But the one in Mumbai last November took \non a special poignancy for the people of Mauritius. In \nthe blind and mindless carnage unleashed by the \nterrorists on that city, one of the victims was a \ncompatriot of ours. We have condemned in no \nuncertain terms this dastardly, cowardly act, and we \nexpect that everything will be done to ensure that the \nterrorist organization behind it is brought to justice. \nMy Government unreservedly supports all campaigns \nand initiatives against terrorism. \n Mauritius nurtures the hope of the complete \nelimination of all nuclear weapons one day. Pending its \nultimate realization, we support all measures aimed at \nhalting the further spread of such weapons. In this \nregard, we welcome the comprehensive agenda of \nPresident Obama to achieve the goal of a world \nwithout nuclear weapons. \n Multilateralism is the cornerstone of the United \nNations, and should be strengthened in the face of the \ncurrent global challenges. Global challenges need a \nglobal response. \n We follow with keen interest the process under \nway to revitalize the General Assembly and improve its \nworking methods, to bring more coherence to the \nUnited Nation system, and to reform the Security \nCouncil. \n We are particularly satisfied by the start of the \nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \nreform earlier this year in an informal plenary session \nof the General Assembly. The comity of nations should \nwork together, in a spirit of solidarity, to reach a \nunified position on the reform of this important body. \nThe reform of the Council should cover the categories \nof both permanent and non-permanent members, with a \nrevised set of working methods. \n We fully support India\u2019s having a permanent seat \nin a reformed Security Council. And we once again \nexpress our unequivocal support for the Common \nAfrican Position. We also support permanent \nmembership of a Latin American and Caribbean \ncountry in a reformed Security Council. \n I take this opportunity to reaffirm the sovereignty \nof Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago, including \nDiego Garcia, which was detached by the United \nKingdom from the territory of Mauritius prior to our \nindependence. The dismemberment of the territory of \nMauritius was in total disregard of General Assembly \nresolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 2066 \n(XX) of 16 December 1965. \n As President Obama said two days ago from this \nvery rostrum, we must \u201cdemonstrate that international \nlaw is not an empty promise\u201d (). We must all \nabide by it. \n We have consistently urged the United Kingdom \nto engage in a meaningful dialogue with Mauritius for \nthe early return of the Chagos Archipelago. We are \npleased to inform the Assembly that two rounds of \n \n \n45 09-52463 \n \ntalks have been held with the United Kingdom this \nyear. We look forward to those discussions coming to \nfruition, and hope that Mauritius will be able to \nexercise its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, \nincluding Diego Garcia, in the near future. \n My Government and the French authorities are \nalso in the process of addressing the issue of Tromelin. \nWe are discussing the modalities of co-management of \nthe island in a spirit of friendship and trust, pending the \nsettlement of the sovereignty issue, which has to be \nresolved and not left on the back burner. \n(spoke in French) \n Nobody can deny the key role that the United \nNations is called upon to play in the concert of nations. \nAt the same time, we agree that the Organization needs \nto be reformed. The attendance at this session of the \nAssembly, where each year a number of points of view \nand perceptions converge, emphasizes our desire to act \nand build together.  \n The concerns and aspirations of our peoples are \nechoed and thus take on universal resonance. We are \nindeed becoming aware that, whatever latitude we \ndevelop in, we have a common destiny. \n I am one of a people steeped in several cultures, \nwhose men and women worship Shiva, Jesus, Allah \nand Buddha, in diverse languages. The history of the  \npopulating of our island and its geographical position \nhave made our country a true crossroads of cultures. \nWe have made the right to difference on the one hand \nand the right to equality on the other our watchwords. I \nam happy to remind my multi-ethnic people that each \nindividual shares with all other humans 99.9 per cent \nof the same genetic code. \n Those of us gathered here have much to learn \nfrom each other. Exchanging our experiences and \nknowledge enriches us and makes us stronger. \n The respect for plurality that this forum demands \nmust neither make us forget our differences nor \ncontribute to the emergence of a dominant discourse.  \n I commend the topic that the President has chosen \nfor this year. If the Assembly manages to foster cross-\npollenization of cultures and to highlight what human \nbeings have in common, we shall, to a large extent, \nhave achieved our goal."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to return to \nthis chamber of hope, peace and cooperation. I wish to \nconvey the warm greetings of the people of Pakistan. \nWe are delighted to see you, Mr. President, presiding \nover the General Assembly. The high ideals of the \nUnited Nations have inspired our vision of a global \nsociety that is based on peace and justice, freedom and \nhuman rights, equality and equal opportunity, freedom \nfrom want and hunger, tolerance and harmony \u2014 a \nglobal society that believes in the sovereign equality of \nnations large and small, and that promotes truth and \nreconciliation. \n On behalf of the people of Pakistan, I assure you, \nMr. President, of our cooperation in fashioning a safer \nand better world in which all children \u2014 yours and \nmine \u2014 shall live in peace and harmony. This is a \nworld in which we shall all depend on one another. It \ndemands a return to the path of the United Nations. It \ncalls for reforming the United Nations on the principles \nof equality and consensus building. \n In Pakistan, the will of the people has prevailed. \nOur people have witnessed a profound democratic \ntransformation. We have entered a new era of \ndemocracy, the rule of law and human rights. \nDemocracy in Pakistan is of great importance not only \nto our country, but also to our region and the world. \nPakistan has struggled hard for democracy. My late \nwife, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, led the fight \nfor democracy and laid down her life for it. Following \nin the footsteps of her great father, Shaheed Zulfikar \nAli Bhutto, she made the ultimate sacrifice so that our \nnation might live in democracy. We are now following \nin her footsteps. I, my party, my people and Pakistan\u2019s \ndemocracy are grateful to the international community \nand to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for constituting \nan international commission of investigation into her \nassassination. We are confident that the commission \nwill bring out all the dimensions of her life, work and \ntragic assassination. \n The world supports our struggle for democracy, \nand we are grateful for that support. Democracy in \nPakistan is beginning to achieve successes in the fight \nagainst militancy. The real challenge now is to make \ndemocracy sustainable, and indeed irreversible. This \nrequires that democracy should be able to deliver. It \nshould meet the aspirations of our people to progress \nand prosperity. It must give our people peace and \nstability. \n Unfortunately, our neighbourhood has witnessed \ndecades of conflict. Pakistan has suffered greatly from \n \n \n29 09-52463 \n \nterrorism and religious extremism. Terrorism and \nextremism were not previously known to our society \nand culture. Religious extremism entered our society \nand the region when we all in the free world decided to \nconfront a rival ideology. The policy was based on the \nexploitation of religion to motivate Muslims around the \nworld to wage jihad. It was a policy whereby jihadi \nleaders were referred to as the moral equivalents of \nGeorge Washington. It was a policy that allowed \nwarlords and criminals to destroy civilizations to come. \nThe virus multiplied and has affected the world.  \n To eliminate militancy we must strike at its roots. \nSurgery alone will not be enough. We need to address \nthe causes of deprivation, poverty and illiteracy. We \nneed to adopt dialogue, development and a wise use of \nforce as our strategy. \n Pakistan has firmly responded to the challenges \nof extremism and militancy. Democracy has given our \npeople ownership of the fight against terrorism. Today, \nour nation stands fully united in this struggle. Our law \nenforcement agencies have, within a short span of \ntime, cleared a large area in Malakand of militants. Of \nthe more than 2.5 million civilians who were forced to \nleave their homes, about 2 million were hosted by their \nrelatives and friends. I salute the host families. \nDemocracy and political ownership of the war have \nproved to be the chief weapons in the fight against \nmilitancy. In the short span of 10 weeks, most of the \ninternally dislocated have returned to their homes. We \nare now engaged in rebuilding their lives.  \n Pakistan appreciates the international community\u2019s \nsupport and understanding of our efforts. We urge the \ninternational community to further reinforce this \nsupport. We are determined to eliminate terrorism and \nextremism from our territory. To that end, the early \nreturn of peace and stability in Afghanistan is critical. \nThe flow of weapons across the region must stop. The \nfunding and support to militants by drug barons and \nother elements must stop.  \n We also believe that regional cooperation against \nterrorism and extremism holds great promise. We \nemphasize regional efforts for peace and stability. \nPakistan will continue to work with Afghanistan and \nthe international community for the early restoration of \npeace and stability in that country. Pakistan has hosted \nalmost 3 million Afghan refugees for the past three \ndecades. We have been providing for them on our own. \nWe call upon the world to help in the safe return of the \nrefugees to their homes.  \n Pakistan\u2019s democracy has begun to deliver. We \nare doing more in self-interest. We urge the world\u2019s \ndemocracies to do more for the peace and development \nof the people affected by militancy and terror. We need \nto create economic opportunities for our people. We \nurge our friends and partners to help Pakistan by \nproviding market access for the economic revival and \nwell-being of their own people.  \n Pakistan desires friendly relations with India. We \nbelieve that dialogue is the only way forward. The \nabsence of dialogue leads to tensions that must be \navoided. We look forward to the resumption of the \ncomposite dialogue process. We seek a peaceful \nresolution of all outstanding issues with India. \nMeaningful progress towards a resolution of the \nKashmir dispute is necessary for durable peace and \nstability in South Asia. \n Pakistan also supports the rights of the \nPalestinian people as guaranteed in several United \nNations resolutions. Durable peace in the Middle East \nrequires that the issue of Palestine be addressed \nmeaningfully.  \n We also call for the immediate release of Aung \nSan Suu Kyi. \n All nations seek security. Peace and security are \nclosely linked. Equal security for all is important. We \nsupport all efforts for arms control, disarmament and \nnon-proliferation. The principle of equal security is of \nfundamental importance for achieving those objectives. \nImbalances in security, especially at the regional level, \nneed to be redressed. Pakistan will continue to play a \nconstructive role in promoting conflict resolution and \nrestraint in South Asia and in promoting initiatives on \nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation on the basis \nof non-discrimination. \n Pakistan\u2019s priority is economic development. We \nwish to build on our internal strengths. In this effort we \nseek partnerships. We seek to develop a win-win \nsituation. We are engaged in economic revival by \ndeveloping our agriculture, building mega-hydro \nprojects, initiating water conservation projects, \nundertaking infrastructure projects, promoting regional \ntrade and cooperation and encouraging, beyond \nGovernment, the corporate sector in development. We \n  \n \n09-52463 30 \n \nneed to develop a framework for cooperation that will \ndeliver quickly. \n In overcoming the challenges faced by the world, \nthe United Nations has a central role to play. Guided by \nits principles and the high ideals in its Charter, the \nUnited Nations is destined to succeed. A democratic \nPakistan will continue to uphold the ideals and values \nof the United Nations. Together we shall succeed. In \nthe words of my leader and martyred wife Shaheed \nMohtarma Benazir Bhutto, \u201ctime, justice and the forces \nof history are on our side\u201d. "

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nSir, it is a pleasure for Mali to congratulate you on \nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-fourth session and on your outstanding \nmanagement of our work. The trust placed in you does \nhonour to the whole of Africa and is a brilliant tribute \nto the great Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and its leader, \nwhose commitment to African unity and just causes is \nacknowledged by all. I assure you of our full support in \nyour new responsibilities and congratulate your \npredecessor, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann of \nNicaragua, on his excellent work throughout his \nmandate. \n I also congratulate Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon on his strenuous efforts to strengthen the role \nof our Organization, and reaffirm our desire for his \nsuccess in his assigned missions.  \n The current general debate is a timely opportunity \nfor us to consider together the urgent problems facing \nthe international community, to share our worries and \nconcerns about the challenges that affect the world, and \nto find sustainable solutions pursuant to the heartfelt \naspirations of our peoples.  \n While the financial and economic crisis that burst \nonto the scene last year has spared no country, it \nundoubtedly weakened the economies of the \ndeveloping countries, especially in Africa, a continent \nthat has long been marginalized. Fluctuations in food \nand oil prices have decreased revenues and exacerbated \ninflation in many developing countries. \n The current multifaceted crises in the realms of \nfinance, food, energy and the environment have \nplunged hundreds of millions of people into poverty \nand aggravated circumstances already straitened by \nunemployment and the high cost of access to basic \nservices. The plight of the most vulnerable strata of \nsociety in developing countries, especially women and \nchildren, calls for action by the international \ncommunity and should be at the heart of international \nconcerns. \n Even as this year we celebrate the twentieth \nanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the \nChild, hundreds of millions of children still live at risk \nand in extreme poverty. More than 26,000 children \nunder the age of five die each day in developing \ncountries of diseases that for the most part could have \nbeen avoided if adequate resources had been mobilized \nand effective measures put in place to respond to \nimmediate needs.  \n The breadth and complexity of the challenges that \nmust be met cannot distract the international \ncommunity from its responsibilities. It goes without \nsaying that the resolution of the world financial and \neconomic crisis requires a democratization of the \ninternational monetary system, notably the institution \nof a new international financial architecture based on \nthe genuine participation of all nations, including \ndeveloping countries. Only a global and cooperative \neffort will succeed in laying the groundwork for a \nlasting recovery. It is also essential to strengthen global \ndevelopment partnerships in order to create conditions \nfavourable for the reduction of poverty, the \nimprovement of health and education, gender equality \nand environmental protection, as set out in the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n In this regard, the Government of Mali has \nlaunched an innovative project to focus the MDGs on \nthe 166 Malian municipal districts most vulnerable to \nfood shortages. That initiative, inspired by the \nMillennium Village approach, is part of the economic \nand social development project instituted by the \nPresident of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Amadou \nToumani Tour\u00e9. The project\u2019s principal aim is \n \u201cto assure robust and sustainable growth that \nproduces opportunities and prosperity for all \ncitizens; to open the way to the achievement of \nthe MDGs by 2015, thus allowing all Malians to \nenjoy the fundamental rights of all human beings \nto have enough to eat, to have access to potable \nwater, to enjoy basic services within a radius of \nfive kilometres and to send their children, both \nboys and girls, to primary school; and to create \ngood working conditions for the majority of the \ncountry\u2019s young people\u201d. \n As part of that initiative, the Forum on Initiative \n166, organized by the Malian Government in the \n \n \n39 09-53165 \n \nmargins of this session of the General Assembly, has \nincreased awareness among development partners and \ndonors alike of the need to support the efforts of the \nmore than 2.5 million people living in nearly 3,000 \nvillages in the 166 districts to raise themselves out of \nextreme poverty and launch their own social and \neconomic development process. \n Despite the progress made in developing \ncountries with regard to the MDGs, the 2015 deadline \nlooms on the horizon and much remains to do. We dare \nbelieve that the pledges made by the industrialized \ncountries, notably at the Group of 20 summits held in \nWashington, D.C., London and Pittsburgh, will be \nhonoured.  \n We also urge donor nations, international \nfinancial institutions and development organizations to \ngive full attention to the special circumstances of the \ngroup of landlocked developing nations. Given their \nlack of access to oceans, their isolation and their \nremoval from international markets, those countries \nface great difficulties in their endeavours to ensure \ntheir economic growth and social well-being and to \nparticipate in the global economy and international \ncommerce. We remain convinced that pushing forward \nthe implementation of the Almaty Programme of \nAction for landlocked countries will greatly contribute \nto the realization of the goals identified. \n Climate change remains one of the greatest \nchallenges of the day. We welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s initiative to convene a summit devoted \nexclusively to climate change and environmental \ndegradation. We believe that the international \ncommunity must intensify its efforts to reach an \ninternational accord at the Conference in Copenhagen \nthis December. \n The maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity is a prerequisite for all development. That is \nwhy Mali remains firmly devoted to the ideals of peace \nand stability both inside and outside its borders. In that \nspirit and at the initiative of the President of Mali, a \nregional conference will shortly be convened in \nBamako on peace, security and development in the \nSahelo-Saharan region. Our most ardent wish is to \ntransform that area into a haven of peace, stability and \nprosperity. \n Mali welcomes the progress made in Africa in \nrestoring peace, stability and post-conflict \nreconciliation under the auspices of the African Union \nand the United Nations. We reaffirm our active \nsolidarity with the peoples of the Middle East and will \ncontinue to support the relevant United Nations \nresolutions on the Middle East and the Palestinian \nquestion.  \n International terrorism is yet another serious \nthreat to international peace and security. Mali \ntherefore firmly and unequivocally condemns terrorism \nin all its forms and manifestations, and applauds the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s adoption of the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), as promoted by \nour heads of State and Government at the 2005 World \nSummit. \n Today more than ever, our nations must \ncoordinate their efforts to overcome together the great \nchallenges faced by humanity. The strengthening of \ninternational cooperation demands greater solidarity. \nThat is in the interest of us all, because humanity needs \nto harness all of its potential if it is to achieve \nharmonious and sustainable development in an \nenvironment of peace and security.

        "file_text": "In \nspeaking to the General Assembly in France\u2019s name \ntoday, I am well aware that we all have a historic \nresponsibility in the current circumstances. \n In the midst of a financial, economic and social \ncrisis that has no precedent in the history of the United \nNations, and faced with the threat a global ecological \ndisaster, we must now invent a new world where the \nfollies of yesterday are no longer possible. That is our \nresponsibility. Now we all know towards what \ncatastrophes our obstinate attempts to solve the \nproblems of the twenty-first century with twentieth-\ncentury ideas and instruments may lead us. No one \namong us can claim any longer that he did not know. \nThere is a universal awareness that the path that \nthe world has taken over the past few decades is a dead \nend. This awareness is born of sorrow, suffering and \nfear. We are politically and morally accountable for the \nsuffering on our planet. Tens of millions of men and \nwomen have lost their jobs and their homes. A billion \nhuman beings are suffering from hunger, and hundreds \nof millions have no access to water, energy or minimal \nhealth care. \n To those hundreds of millions of people, we, the \nheads of State and Government, and no one else, must \nrestore hope. Those who are paying the price of the \ncrisis had no role in bringing it about. We owe an \nanswer to the people who are outraged by the \nbehaviour of those in the financial world who led us to \nthe brink of chaos and continue to seek to enrich \nthemselves indecently. We owe an answer to those who \nare still dying in absurd wars from another age, while \nhumankind has so many challenges to face.  \n France\u2019s answer is unambiguous. Things cannot \ngo on as they were. We must change. We cannot allow \nit to start all over again, leading to another disaster \ntomorrow. After such a strong disavowal of our usual \nthinking and our deep-rooted prejudices, the task \nbefore us is precisely the same as that faced by men of \ngood will who sought here to build a new political, \neconomic and monetary world order after the Second \nWorld War. The generation that preceded us was equal \nto its responsibilities. The question today is: Will we be \nequal to that same responsibility? \n The world will change. It cannot be otherwise. \nThe only question is: Will the world change because \nwe are able to act with wisdom, intelligence and \ncourage, or because fresh crises will arise if we are not \nwise enough to take the path of radical change? \n The truth is that we have already waited too long \nto regulate globalization, fight global warming and \ncurb nuclear proliferation. And I should like solemnly \nto tell the leaders of Iranian that they would be making \na tragic mistake in relying on the passive response of \nthe international community in order to pursue their \nmilitary nuclear programme.  \n We have waited too long to re-establish peace in \nthe Middle East by giving the Palestinian people the \nState to which they are entitled in the name of law and \nin the name of justice. And we have waited too long to \nguarantee the people of Israel the right to live in \nsecurity, which the tragedies of history have made so \nnecessary for them. \n We know what we need to do now: increase the \nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members of \nthe Security Council. I say in the name of France, it is \nunacceptable that the African continent does not have a \nsingle permanent member on the Security Council \u2014 it \nis unacceptable because it is unjust. It is unacceptable \nthat the South American continent, with such a great \npower as Brazil, or India with its population of one \nbillion, or Japan or Germany, should be excluded from \namong the permanent members of the Council. It is \nunacceptable, and I say here that the legitimacy of the \nUnited Nations is riding on this reform. Either the \nUnited Nations reforms and its legitimacy will grow, or \n  \n \n09-52179 46 \n \nthe reform fails and then decisions will be taken \noutside the United Nations.  \n We must reform the International Monetary Fund \nand the World Bank; that is indispensable. Voting \nrights need to be more equitably distributed. The \nmissions of both the Fund and the Bank need to be \nredefined. To maintain the Fund as the guardian of an \northodoxy that has been so severely shaken by the \ncrisis would be a tragic mistake.  \n The international system has to be reformed. We \ncannot have a politically multipolar world with a single \ncurrency. That is not acceptable; it is not possible. We \nhave to re-engineer the financial capitalism system. If \nwe have a system in which the real price of risk or the \nreal price of rare resources is not being paid, that is a \nsuicidal system.  \n We need to eliminate tax havens, for we must not \ntolerate places where money derived from speculation, \ncrime and fraud is stashed. It is up to us. No one in the \nworld would understand if we were to fail to live up to \nthis objective.  \n We need to curb the price swings of commodities \nthat are subject to excessive speculation, starting with \noil, since this instability is unsustainable. The countries \nthat have commodities must be paid a fair price for \ntheir resources. We must not accept the speculation that \ndestabilizes the world over the costs of commodities. \n In Copenhagen, we need to commit to \nquantitative targets for greenhouse gas emissions. We \ncan no longer put off the moment of choice. We need to \nset up a world environment organization. We need to \nacknowledge the legitimacy of the principle of a \ncarbon tax border adjustment mechanism so that \nnobody can profit from environmental dumping.  \n We cannot let the law of trade be the only law. I \nbelieve in free trade, but there are fundamental \nstandards. We are members of the World Health \nOrganization. How can we impair the right to health of \nthose who have nothing? We are members of the \nInternational Labour Organization, which has defined \nthe fundamental standards in this field. How can we \naccept that those standards be flouted? The right to \nhealth, the right to a minimum respect for one\u2019s social \nrights and the right to protection of the planet are just \nas important as the right to trade. There is no single \nright that is more important than the others. \n We cannot ask developing countries and poor \ncountries to comply with these standards if we, the \nrich, do not help them in their efforts. We all belong to \nthe same human race. We all live on the same planet. \nWe are all facing the same challenges.  \n So yes, we need to be able to share our \ntechnology. France is ready to do so, and so are the \nother wealthy countries of the world. Yes, we will need \nto come up with further resources for development \nassistance and for meeting the ecological challenge \ntogether. I do not hesitate to say that we will find these \nresources by taxing excessive gains from speculation \nand profits. We do not have to look far for resources; \nthey are right there. I would like to appeal to all States, \nto all international organizations, that the \nrecommendations made by the commission chaired by \nJoseph Stiglitz be disseminated broadly. Let us make \nno mistake about the way we measure economic \ngrowth.  \n The task is a huge one, and it is only just \nbeginning. That is all the more reason for starting now \nand starting quickly. We have little time remaining. \nEach of us needs to realize what would happen if we \nhad to go home and explain to our fellow citizens that \nwe have been incapable of reaching an agreement, of \nfinding new solutions at a time when they are suffering \nso grievously from the consequences of the crisis. I \nwish to say very clearly that nothing would be worse \nthat a mediocre compromise in Pittsburgh and in \nCopenhagen. World opinion and the current \ncircumstances demand that we find a real solution to \nthe problems and not just to pretend. \n If we do nothing, the threat of the worst crisis is \nnot behind us but ahead of us. We are at one of those \nmoments in history when political decisions will have \na profound and lasting impact on the future. We have \nno choice; we must take risks, since the greatest risk \ntoday would be to do nothing, to let ourselves be \ncarried along by the force of habit, to think that we still \nhave time. France has come to tell you that we have no \nmore time.  \n I hope that this year, 2009, is when a new world \norder \u2014 a more fair, more efficient world order \u2014 will \nbe established, one that each of us will be comfortable \nwith."

        "file_text": "It \nis an honour to take the floor at the sixty-fourth session \nof the General Assembly.  \n At the outset, on behalf of His Excellency \nMr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic of \nBurundi, and our entire delegation, we join preceding \nspeakers in warmly congratulating you, Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, on your election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. \nYour election is a tribute to you and to your country. \nMy delegation and I personally wish you every success \nin your noble mission. Our congratulations go also to \nthe other members of the Bureau. We also take this \nopportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to your \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, for his commitment and for the quality of \nthe work accomplished during his mandate.  \n Here, we wish to reaffirm our support for His \nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Once \nagain, we wish him every success and assure him of \nthe full cooperation of the Republic of Burundi in \nseeking peaceful and courageous solutions to the \nproblems facing today\u2019s world. We hail him in \nparticular for his devotion to the cause of peace and \ndevelopment, which he has continued to demonstrate \nfor the world in general and for Burundi in particular.  \n Finally, our gratitude goes to the international \ncommunity, the Peacebuilding Commission, the United \nNations Integrated Office in Burundi, the European \nUnion, the Regional Initiative for Burundi and the \nRepublic of South Africa for their efforts to restore \npeace, which is now a reality and which we hope will \nbe irreversible in Burundi. We urge all States in the \nGreat Lakes region to continue to engage in dialogue \nand cooperation to ensure comprehensive political \nstability and development in the region. We take this \nopportunity to request that consultative status in the \nGeneral Assembly be granted at this session to the \nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region. \n The present session of the General Assembly is \ntaking place at a time when the Burundian people are \nwelcoming the progress made on the path of peace. \nIndeed, the war in Burundi is now over. The last rebel \n  \n \n09-52586 2 \n \nmovement, the Forces nationales de liberation, has laid \ndown its weapons and has become a political party that \nis actively participating in the country\u2019s democratic \nlife. The movement\u2019s top leaders have been appointed \nto posts in the area of public administration. Some \nformer combatants have joined the army or the police, \nand the others have been demobilized and are \nbenefiting from the process of reintegrating into \nnormal socio-economic life. We wish to thank all our \npartners for their support for Burundi\u2019s considerable \npeacebuilding and democratization efforts.  \n With the return of peace and democratically \nelected institutions, the Burundian people are \nbeginning to regain confidence in the institutions of the \nRepublic. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are \nreturning to their former villages, and Burundian \nrefugees who were in neighbouring countries have \nreturned. However, the reintegration of former \ncombatants, IDPs and refugees is not taking place \nwithout difficulties or constraints.  \n Indeed, Burundi, as an African country with one \nof the highest population growth rates, has an acute \nland-shortage problem, which has given rise to \nproperty disputes. In order to preserve social harmony, \na commission for land and other assets has been \nestablished to resolve all disputes arising between \nrepatriated persons and their fellow citizens who have \nremained in the hills, where land is considered a \nunique treasure. \n Burundi is facing the problem of financing the \nprofessional reintegration of thousands of men, women \nand even children who have served as combatants. The \ninternational community\u2019s support is thus essential to \nassist us in the process of socially reintegrating those \nsectors of the needy population so that the gains of \npeacebuilding will not be undermined.  \n Furthermore, the Burundian Government \nrecognizes that illegal firearms in the hands of the \ncivilian population constitute a serious threat to peace. \nIn order to address that problem, the Government has \nestablished a commission to encourage people to \nvoluntarily turn in their weapons. As the commission \nhas a time-bound mandate, the Government has \nlaunched a large-scale programme to recover all \nweapons and clamp down on crime linked to firearm \nuse. A decree regulating legal firearms possession has \njust been signed by the President.  \n Judicial reform is being carried out to ensure \nequitable justice and combat impunity. The \nGovernment welcomes the support of the international \ncommunity in this area. To further consolidate the \npeace dividend, we must meet the challenges of \nknowing the truth so that we can achieve national \nreconciliation. It is imperative that the Burundian \npeople succeed in the transitional justice process. That \nwill enable them to bury the hatchet of war and build \ntheir future on a solid foundation of peace and mutual \ntrust. \n Mindful of the fact that it would not enjoy peace \nfor long in a troubled Africa, our country has \nresponded positively to the international community\u2019s \nappeal to contribute to peacekeeping in countries at \nwar. Thus, Burundi is participating in the United \nNations Operation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, to restore peace to \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire; the United Nations Peacebuilding \nSupport Office in the Central African Republic, in \nChad and the Central African Republic; and the African \nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, in \nDarfur and Somalia. Unfortunately, our contingent \ndeployed in Somalia as part of the African Union \nMission in Somalia (AMISOM) has, over a two-year \nperiod, been the target of three suicide attacks that \nhave claimed the lives of 25 soldiers and left 35 others \nwounded. To that grisly toll, we must add three victims \nof the crash of an Ilyushin aircraft into Lake Victoria in \nMarch this year. \n Those facts show that Burundi is paying a heavy \nprice in the international mission to contribute to the \nquest for peace in Somalia. Because of this loss of life, \nsome in Burundi are calling for a troop withdrawal. We \nbelieve that, in its current configuration, the Mission \ncan continue and be completed only with considerable \nefforts by the international community.  \n To that end, the Government of Burundi believes \nthat AMISOM\u2019s mandate should be changed to allow \ncontingents to protect themselves against deadly \nattacks and to take the offensive or pursue aggressors, \nif necessary, in accordance with Chapter VII of the \nCharter. We believe that contingents must be equipped \nwith sufficient resources in terms of quality and \nquantity. We believe that strike helicopters and funds \nfor information-gathering on the ground must be \nprovided. We also believe that additional troops should \nbe deployed without delay in order to make the \nMission truly continental in character. And we believe \nthat the long-promised sanctions against countries, \n \n \n3 09-52586 \n \norganizations and individuals who support Islamist \ngroups should at last become a reality.  \n The Government of Burundi remains steadfast to \nits commitments vis-\u00e0-vis AMISOM. However, we \nwould like to see the international community respond \nas soon as possible to the concerns that I have \nexpressed here, which are well-known to all partners \nwho wish to see the return of peace in the Horn of \nAfrica.  \n This meeting is taking place a few months before \nthe holding of general elections in my country aimed at \nreinvigorating institutions at every level. I would like \nto underscore here that the Government is committed \nto making sure that those elections are transparent and \nthat they are held in an atmosphere of calm. An \nindependent national electoral commission has already \nbeen put in place, based on a political compromise \nbetween the various parties. In addition, a new \nelectoral law has just been promulgated. The Ministry \nof the Interior has also been strengthened in order to \nsupport the commission. The partnership between the \nelectoral commission, the Government and donors has \njust been formalized through an agreement between the \nUnited Nations Development Programme and the \nGovernment of Burundi on a project to provide support \nfor the elections.  \n In that regard, the Government will provide the \nindependent national electoral commission a $7 million \npackage for the entire endeavour. We are counting on \nthe varied support of the international community to \nmobilize all the necessary resources to make the \nelectoral process a success. We welcome the \nwillingness expressed by the Secretary-General to \nbring BINUB\u2019s mandate in line with the electoral \nenvironment. I need not recall that BINUB\u2019s mandate \nshould be agreed between now and the end of \nDecember of this year. A successful outcome to the \nelections will enable us, in coordination with the \nSecretary-General, to redefine the mission of the \nUnited Nations in Burundi by focusing major attention \non programmes aimed at lasting development. \n Burundi must make a success of its electoral \nprocess if it is to be able to pursue its economic \ndevelopment. Our strategic framework to combat \npoverty, which is the point of reference for all efforts \nin that regard, has been in the process of \nimplementation since 2007. An assessment of that \neffort over the past two years reveals satisfactory \nresults overall, despite the fact that the performance \nindicators we wanted to achieve with regard to certain \nmacroeconomic policies have not yet been realized. \n In an effort to improve the effectiveness of the \nassistance provided to Burundi, the Government, \nworking in partnership with donors, has put in place a \npartners\u2019 coordination group that provides a forum for \ndiscussion in which development partners are \nconsulted on all technical and policy issues in \nconnection with the implementation of our national \nstrategy on development and peacebuilding. Today, \ngenuine dialogue and active partnership take place \nthroughout the process, from the planning to the results \nassessment stages. \n With the support of the World Bank, Burundi \nhopes to hold a meeting of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group \non Burundi next month in Paris, with a view to \nmobilizing funds destined for sectors that have been \nidentified as having the potential for quickly \ncontributing to economic growth and playing a \ncatalysing role \u2014 namely, those of the energy, \nagricultural, private sector, tourism, information \ntechnology and communication infrastructure sectors. \nWe count on the existing partnership to provide the \nnecessary financing. \n The Government has come to understand that, in \norder to fully restart economic growth, it needs to \npromote good governance in the management of public \naffairs and further improve the business environment. \nTo that end, the Government, with the support of its \npartners, has begun a series of reforms aimed at \nimproving public finance management and facilitating \nprivate domestic and foreign investment in our country. \nA new investment law has therefore been promulgated, \nwhich the Government has adapted to bring it in line \nwith the East African Community\u2019s model. A value \nadded tax is already in place and an agency to promote \ninvestment will soon become operational.  \n Burundi aims to meet the challenge set at the \ninternational level to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, as underscored in the Outcome \nadopted at the September 2005 World Summit of heads \nof State or Government (resolution 60/1). We are \npleased to inform the Assembly that, thanks to our \npolicy of free primary education and health care for \nchildren under the age of five and pregnant women, \nBurundi is achieving results that merit support. For \ninstance, thanks to that policy, the number of pregnant \n  \n \n09-52586 4 \n \nwomen giving birth in hospitals or health centres \nincreased from 22.9 per cent in 2005 to 56.3 per cent in \n2008. \n In July 2009, the Government of Burundi decided \nto provide free malaria treatment and mosquito nets for \nits entire population. The Government has also decided \nto take responsibility for the medical treatment and \nfollow-up for women beginning in the first month of \npregnancy, with a view to better protecting the health \nof mothers and children. That policy includes an \ninformation campaign aimed at curbing the number of \nbirths. A national body will soon be established that \nwill be responsible for providing health insurance for \npeople living in rural areas or working in the informal \nsector.  \n Education for all is another of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals that the people of Burundi are \nworking to achieve. Thanks to community development \nefforts, our people built more than 700 schools and \nhealth centres in the course of 2008, so as to allow all \nschool-age children to benefit from free primary \neducation, as decided in 2005 by our country\u2019s \nPresident. However, we still face the ongoing problem \nof providing the necessary financial resources to equip \nthose schools and health centres, provide them with \ndrinking water and pay their staff. I need not point out \nthat these exceptional steps have been taken to \ncontribute to our country\u2019s progress in the run-up to \n2015. \n Moreover, the Government would like donors to \nmobilize additional resources to ensure the \nsustainability of our achievements. We would like to \ntake this opportunity to heartily thank partners that \nhave already supported the implementation of our \npolicy to provide free primary education and health \nservices for pregnant women and children under the \nage of five. We appeal to those who are still hesitant to \ncome to our assistance in order to help us to overcome \nthe numerous challenges to which I have referred here. \n The global financial crisis has not spared \nBurundi. While the cost of raw materials has dropped \nin general, the decrease has been especially sharp in \nthe price of coffee, which is our main export product. \nThe Assembly will of course understand that, when our \ngross domestic product and our economy\u2019s \nmacroeconomic indicators perform poorly, they \nundermine the social protection efforts undertaken by \nthe Government.  \n The volatile market for petroleum products also \nhas a destabilizing impact on Burundi\u2019s economy, as it \nproduces external shocks that are difficult to bear. \nDespite the economic policy interventions that have \nbeen taken to counteract the negative effects of \ndisturbances in international markets, the economies of \ndeveloping countries must nevertheless reiterate the \nappeal for restoring order with regard to such current \nissues as those pertaining to the stability of \ninternational financial markets, the implementation of \ntrade agreements, technology transfers and the need to \nincrease assistance and investment in Africa.  \n Given the situation, we would like once again to \ninvite developed countries and the Group of Eight in \nparticular to translate into action the commitment they \nundertook to raise official development assistance \ncontributions to 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2015, as well \nas to honour the promise made in Scotland to increase \ndevelopment aid by $50 billion per year starting in \n2010, with half of this sum allocated to Africa. \n Climate change constitutes a threat to peace and \nfood security in Africa and around the world. We \ntherefore call for the adoption of courageous measures \nto limit the production of greenhouse gases and for \nincentives to encourage reforestation policies, the \nprotection of equatorial forests, the responsible \nmanagement of water and energy resources, and the \nuse of clean and renewable energies. Burundi endorses \nthe common African Union position that was set out by \nthe Prime Minister of Ethiopia and will be reaffirmed \nat the Copenhagen Conference. We welcome measures \nannounced by President Barack Obama, the European \nUnion and Japan to considerably reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions, manage toxic waste responsibly and \nprovide financial and technological resources to least-\ndeveloped and landlocked countries. \n Burundi renews its pledge to the United Nations \nto continue working to ensure that the peoples of the \nentire world cooperate in peace and defend the values \nof freedom, solidarity and tolerance. These values must \nguide the international community in resolving the \nbloody conflicts that threaten some parts of Africa, the \nMiddle East, Iraq and Afghanistan, and will help us to \nfight terrorism and other forms of transnational crime \neffectively.  \n I cannot conclude my address without reaffirming \nthe commitment of my country to multilateralism, \n \n \n5 09-52586 \n \nwhich represents our single best hope for responding to \nall threats to peace and security in the world."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Vietnamese delegation, I \nwish to congratulate you, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, on \nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-fourth session. I believe that with your rich \nexperience, you will lead the Assembly at this session \nto great success. Viet Nam commends you, Sir, for the \ntheme you proposed for this high-level general debate, \nnamely, effective responses to global crises \u2014 \nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \ncivilizations for international peace, security and \ndevelopment. \n I further wish to express our high appreciation to \nHis Excellency Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for \nhis contributions to the work of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-third session. \n The year since the Assembly\u2019s sixty-third session \nhas not been a long span of time, yet it has been \ncharacterized by the many challenges it brought to the \nentire international community. Every part of the world \nhas suffered from the negative and far-reaching \nimpacts of the global financial crisis and economic \ndownturn. That further aggravates the challenges in \nterms of food security, energy security and climate \nchange facing developing countries in particular. In the \nmeantime, tension and conflicts persist in various \nregions, and the threats of the proliferation of weapons \n \n \n17 09-52470 \n \nof mass destruction and of international terrorism \ncontinue to demand effective responses. \n Because of all this, the past year has also \nwitnessed enormous efforts on the part of the \ninternational community, both in thinking and in \naction, not only to address the immediate problems but \nalso to create a more sustainable foundation for \ncommon peace and prosperity. In due course, nations \nhave been able to draw valuable lessons on governance \nover domestic development and to gain a fuller \nunderstanding of the meaning of multilateral \ncooperation. It is evident that no single country could \nrespond to the financial and economic crisis and to the \nseries of current global challenges. It is equally evident \nthat policies and measures of imposition and unilateral \nuse of force to address international security and \npolitical issues would only result in more tension, \nconfrontation and impasse. \n Given the many difficulties at the present time, \nwe are encouraged by recent positive \u2014 although not \nsolid \u2014 signals from the world economy. The first \nsummit of the Security Council on nuclear \nnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament has \nhighlighted the question of disarmament on the \ninternational agenda. Viet Nam recognizes the active \ncontributions of the United Nations and the Secretary-\nGeneral in the furtherance of discussions on and direct \nsupport for the implementation of concrete measures in \nrelation to issues of international concern. In this \nconnection, Viet Nam hopes that this Assembly will \nfocus its deliberations on the following issues. \n Respect for the fundamental principles of \ninternational law and the United Nations Charter in \ninternational relations is the determining factor for \npeace and security and a prerequisite for all the \nactivities undertaken by the international community. \nOn that basis, the United Nations should continue to \nmake active contributions to easing tension and \npeacefully resolving outstanding disputes and conflicts, \nincluding those relating to the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea and Iran.  \n It is Viet Nam\u2019s hope that early progress will be \nmade in the negotiations for a peaceful, \ncomprehensive, just and lasting solution in the Middle \nEast on the basis of ensuring the fundamental national \nrights of the Palestinian people and the legitimate \ninterests of all parties concerned. We fully support the \nnational reconciliation and reconstruction process in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and strongly condemn terrorist \nacts against civilians in those countries and in other \nplaces in the world. We oppose the unilateral use of \neconomic sanctions against developing countries and \nsupport the General Assembly resolutions on the \nnecessity of immediately ending the economic, \ncommercial and financial embargo imposed against \nCuba. \n An effective and comprehensive response to \ntoday\u2019s economic and financial crisis is the top concern \nof the international community. In the immediate term, \nthat includes urgent measures to curb the pace of the \ndownturn, encourage an early recovery of the world \neconomy and minimize the negative impacts of the \ncrisis, particularly on the realization of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in developing countries.  \n In the long run, the response will embrace \nconsiderations of development paradigms suitable for \nindividual nations and reforms of the international \nsystem of economic relations, which has for quite a \nwhile shown many irrationalities. It is also imperative \nto promote the role of the United Nations in designing \ninternational strategies and mechanisms to address the \nenergy and food crisis, pandemics and climate change, \nincluding issues to be discussed at the Climate Change \nConference in Copenhagen this December. \n The United Nations reform process should also \ncontinue to meet the emerging, complex requirements. \nViet Nam shares the common view that reform should \nbe undertaken in all United Nations agencies, with \nSecurity Council reform conducted in such a way as to \nbroaden its representation and render its operational \nmethodology more democratic and transparent. Efforts \nto reform the machinery should go hand in hand with \nefforts to renew content and to pay due attention to the \nbalance among the fields of activity of the United \nNations. United Nations operations should also be \nprovided with sufficient resources. \n Next year, Member States will commemorate the \nsixty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, while \nalso reviewing the Organization\u2019s activities and the \n10-year implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). To prepare the ground \nfor recommendations to be submitted to the leaders of \nMember States at the sixty-fifth session, we need to \ndiscuss what lessons can be drawn from United \nNations activities in all spheres, what activities should \nbe prioritized and what conditions are necessary for the \n  \n \n09-52470 18 \n \nOrganization fully to carry out its mandates and \nfunctions in the interest of all nations. \n In the recent past, Viet Nam has continued to \nrecord major achievements in the process of renewal, \nin general, and initial positive gains in response to the \nimpact of the global economic and financial crisis, in \nparticular. We have also been successful in our foreign \npolicy, which is based on openness and strives to \ndiversify and ensure the multilateral character of our \nexternal relations in the spirit of being a friend and \nreliable partner of all nations and an active, \nconstructive, cooperative and responsible member of \nthe international community. \n As a non-permanent member of the Security \nCouncil, we have been an active participant in and an \neffective and responsible contributor to the \nmaintenance of world peace and security. As a peace-\nloving nation, Viet Nam always strongly supports and \ncontributes to the peaceful settlement of international \ndisputes and conflicts, the fight against transnational \ncrime and international terrorism, and the promotion of \ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. As a country that experienced \ndecades of war with devastating consequences, \nincluding the long-term effects of the Agent Orange \ntoxic chemical, and as a country that has made \nimportant achievements in development, Viet Nam has \nalways striven towards the effective Security Council \naction in supporting reconstruction efforts in countries \nemerging from conflict. \n In its work, Viet Nam sets high store by \nconsultation and cooperation with other members of \nthe Security Council and the United Nations, as shown \nby our initiative to consult Member States on the latest \nannual report of the Security Council. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude \nand appreciation to all Member States for their \ncooperation, without which Viet Nam would not have \naccomplished this undertaking. \n In the future, Viet Nam will continue to work \nactively for world peace, stability, cooperation and \ndevelopment, thus contributing to efforts of the United \nNations and the international community in \naccelerating the resolution of social issues and global \nchallenges, as well as the implementation of \ndevelopment programmes and the Delivering as One \ninitiative. \n This session of the General Assembly is taking \nplace at a crucial juncture. During 2009, the world has \nwitnessed many significant changes, which have \ndemanded corresponding policy decisions from us. I \nbelieve that only by standing shoulder to shoulder to \nenhance multilateral cooperation can we, as \nresponsible leaders, meet the expectations and \naspirations of our peoples and map out a path for the \nlong-term development of the United Nations. Viet \nNam will always be a supportive, active and \nresponsible participant in this noble mission."

I am \nconfident that under his able stewardship this session \nwill mark an important milestone in meeting the \nformidable challenges of our times. \n And the challenges we face as a human family \nare unprecedented indeed. No nation, no country is \nimmune to the ruthless grip of the multitude of global \ncrises: economy and finance, fuel and food, flu \npandemics and climate change. These and other global \nchallenges require global solutions underpinned by a \nnew multilateralism. Multilateralism that is effective, \nproactive and commensurate with today\u2019s demands. \nNever has the world needed an effective \nmultilateralism as much as we do now; as the \nSecretary-General has rightly put it, \u201cThis is the \nultimate multilateral moment\u201d (A/64/1, para. 4). \n Mongolia highly commends the strong leadership \nof Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in the effort to \nmake this Organization the centre of the new \nmultilateralism. We also applaud his unwavering \ncommitment to mobilizing broad political support to \naddress today\u2019s pressing challenges. Thanks to his \ninitiative, on the 22nd of this month we witnessed an \nunprecedented gathering of world leaders. That has \nprovided the necessary political impetus for \nCopenhagen, and I was both humbled and honoured to \n  \n \n09-52470 12 \n \nserve as one of the co-chairs of the round tables. As a \nresult, we have all agreed that in Copenhagen we must \nreach the long-awaited agreement. The political will \nwas clearly displayed. The deal must be within our \ngrasp. \n Climate change poses a truly existential threat to \nhumanity. As a country intimately affected by climate \nchange, Mongolia deems it important to complement \nglobal efforts with those at regional and subregional \nlevels. With that in mind, we have proposed a \nNorth-east Asia Summit on Climate Change. A series \nof preparatory meetings have been held over the last \ntwo years, including meetings with experts and young \npeople, and with senior officials and ministers, in \nMarch and May respectively. \n It has become increasingly evident that extensive \neffects of climate change have already appeared in \nmost parts of the subregion, which has become more \nexposed to drought; desertification; reduced water \nresources; land degradation; increased occurrence of \nnatural disasters and melting of permafrost, glaciers \nand snow cover. The resulting poverty, food shortages \nand spread of infectious disease will have an increasing \neffect on the sustainable development of the countries \nin the region. Hence the urgent need for joint efforts to \nredress the situation, mitigate risks and enhance those \ncountries\u2019 adaptive capacity. We remain hopeful that \nthey will continue their active engagement in the \npreparations for the Summit next year. \n Allow me to share briefly our views on issues we \ndeem important as we collectively seek to identify \neffective responses to the global crises. First, my \ndelegation believes that the multiple nature of the \ncrises has to be taken into account in order to find an \nadequate response at the global level. This in itself is a \ndaunting task, requiring of us the courage to rise \nbeyond mere national or group interests in order to \nsurvive collectively in our one \u2014 global \u2014 human \nvillage. \n Secondly, in all our policies and actions we need \nto focus on people \u2014 on the human costs of \novercoming the dire consequences of multiple crises. \nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s latest report, released \nlast week, the ongoing global economic, financial and \nfood crises have plunged hundreds of millions more \npeople into the iron grip of poverty, hunger, \nunemployment, illiteracy and ill-health. \n Despite this grim situation we are nonetheless \nencouraged by a broadly shared recognition that the \nvulnerable countries, including landlocked developing \ncountries (LLDCs) ought to be assisted to withstand \nthe harsh impact of the crises. In this regard, we look \nforward to the Group of 20 meeting in Pittsburgh to \nsubstantially increase support and assistance to \nvulnerable and low-income countries. \n Every sixth Member of the United Nations is a \nlandlocked developing country with inherent \ndevelopment handicaps. Indeed, lack of territorial \naccess to the sea, remoteness from world markets and \nthe consequent high transportation costs and undue \ndelays are major impediments for LLDCs. Hence, \nMongolia, together with other like-minded countries, \nhas endeavoured to promote the common position and \ninterests of the Group of LLDCs at both the United \nNations and the World Trade Organization. The recent \nestablishment of an international think tank for LLDCs \nin Ulaanbaatar will, in our view, enhance our \ncoordinated efforts for the effective implementation of \nthe Almaty Programme of Action and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \n Thirdly, the marginalization and inadequate \nrepresentation of the developing world in global \ndecision-making constitute another drawback to the \nstrength of the new multilateralism. Hence the need for \na reformed global governance structure. Mongolia \nbelieves that, with its impartiality and universal \nlegitimacy, the United Nations is uniquely placed to \nserve as the centre of the new multilateralism. Our \nworld Organization has embarked on a process of \nreform in order to better respond to multifaceted \nchallenges. Important progress has been made in \nseveral reform areas, yet more efforts are needed to \nadapt the United Nations to the realities of the twenty-\nfirst century. \n We expect the General Assembly negotiations on \nSecurity Council reform to make meaningful progress \nat this session by meeting the demand of the \noverwhelming majority of Member States to expand \nthe Council in both the permanent and the \nnon-permanent categories. A revitalized General \nAssembly, a greater role for the Economic and Social \nCouncil in global economic governance and enhanced \nUnited Nations capacity in building democracy and \npeacebuilding are also needed. Mongolia fully supports \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s efforts to improve \n \n \n13 09-52470 \n \nthe management, efficiency and internal cohesion of \nthe United Nations system.  \n With a view to making our humble contribution \nto promoting effective international cooperation in the \neconomic, social and related fields, Mongolia has \nproposed its candidature for consideration at the \nelection next month for membership of the Economic \nand Social Council for 2010-2012. We are deeply \ngrateful to our fellow members of the Asian Group for \ntheir endorsement of our candidature and look forward \nto the kind support of the broader membership of the \nUnited Nations. \n Fourthly, in order to find effective solutions to \nglobal crises we need to do away with the triple \ndeficit \u2014 a deficit of political will and commitment; a \ndeficit of implementation; and a deficit of resources \u2014 \nthat all too often has impeded the pursuit of our \ncommon efforts. Those are some of the issues that in \nour view warrant the consideration of the international \ncommunity in order to formulate our collective \napproach to the pressing challenges at hand. \n Mongolia has continuously based its foreign \npolicy on active participation in multilateral \ncooperation through the United Nations. Our \nengagement has ranged from non-proliferation and \ndisarmament to promoting democracy and literacy and \nfrom addressing the special needs of LLDCs to \nresponding to climate change and contributing to \npeacekeeping operations, programmes and funds. \n As a North-East Asian nation with an \ninternationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free status, \nMongolia stands for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean \npeninsula. Achieving a comprehensive solution to the \nnuclear issue through dialogue is of utmost importance. \nWe hope that all countries concerned will look to the \nfuture in the interest of peace and stability in the \nregion. We stand ready to contribute to this effort. \n Yesterday the international community witnessed \nanother strong signal of strengthened multilateralism, \nparticularly in the area of nuclear disarmament and \nnon-proliferation. The Security Council summit \nchaired by President Obama (see S/PV.6191) \nconfirmed the path towards a world free of nuclear \nweapons by adopting the historic resolution \n1887 (2009). \n Next year will mark the tenth anniversary of the \nrenowned Brahimi report (A/55/305), which charted a \nrenewed vision for United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. We are proud that Mongolia has joined the \nranks of active members of the United Nations \npeacekeeping family. With its latest deployment of a \nbattalion to the United Nations Mission in the Central \nAfrican Republic and Chad, we have become one of \nthe top 20 troop contributors. Mongolia stands \ncommitted to enhancing its contribution, including \nthrough hosting training for civil police and medical \npersonnel at its peacekeeping operations training \ncentre. \n Later this year we will observe the twentieth \nanniversary of the start of the democratic evolution in \nmy home country. Mongolia is proud of its successful \ndemocratic transition and major gains in the political, \neconomic, social and spiritual areas of the life of our \nsociety. Yet, as a young democracy, my country is also \nintimately aware of the complex challenges faced by \ncountries in transition. Democracy and respect for \nhuman rights are, in our view, inherently woven into \nthe MDGs. Proceeding from this premise, Mongolia \nwas the first country to adopt, in 2005, its own ninth \nMDG, on strengthening human rights, fostering \ndemocratic governance and zero tolerance to \ncorruption. \n We believe in international cooperation and \nsupport for democratization efforts. In this regard, \nMongolia applauds the increased role of the United \nNations in fostering democracy and good governance. \nThe United Nations Democracy Fund is a notable \nexample and Mongolia is proud to serve on its \nAdvisory Board. The United Nations has also been an \nimportant stakeholder in the success of the new or \nrestored democracies process. \n Over the past nearly five decades of Mongolia\u2019s \nmembership in the United Nations, our multifaceted \ncooperation has made a valuable contribution to our \ndevelopment. I am pleased to underscore that this \nreceived a considerable boost from the official visit to \nMongolia of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last July. \nWe will closely work with the United Nations to ensure \neffective follow-up to the visit. \n In conclusion, I reiterate Mongolia\u2019s strong \nresolve to continue its active participation in \nmultilateral cooperation. We will spare no effort to \nensure that the world Organization remains a centre for \ncoordination of the efforts of the community of nations \ntowards peace and development in the years to come."

        "file_text": "Allow \nme at the outset, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, to \ncongratulate you and your fraternal country, the Great \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session. We are confident that your \nexperience and knowledge of the role and influence of \nthe United Nations in international relations will play a \ngreat part in the success of the work of this session. I \nalso take this opportunity to express our thanks to your \npredecessor, His Excellency Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann of friendly Nicaragua, for his excellent \nefforts in guiding the work of the previous session. I \nwish also to express our appreciation to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts to enhance \nthe effectiveness of the Organization\u2019s machinery. We \nwish him every success. \n There is no doubt that the United Nations has \nachieved much during its more than 60 years of joint \ninternational action. Its achievements have made a \npositive contribution to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. The Organization has \nprovided technical assistance to developing countries \nin their socio-economic development projects, and has \nhelped to reach consensus on many political issues and \nconflicts, contributing to the development of \ninternational peacekeeping mechanisms. \n And yet the Palestinian issue remains unresolved \ndespite all the efforts of Arab countries and the \ninternational community. We believe that the Arab \nPeace Initiative and international peace efforts are the \nmost appropriate way to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict \non the basis of an end to occupation, the return of Arab \nlands occupied since 1967, the establishment of an \nindependent Palestinian State on the West Bank and \nGaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital and the \nremoval of all the illegal and illegitimate Israeli \nsettlements. This would indeed help to achieve \npeaceful coexistence and positive cooperation between \nArab States and Israel, and would contribute greatly to \nopening new horizons of cooperation, progress and \ndevelopment in the region and the world at large. Peace \nbased on those principles would be one of the most \nimportant achievements of the people of the region and \nwould pave the way towards ending regional crises and \neradicating the root causes of terrorism. \n We thus call on Israel to seize the historic \nInitiative and join the efforts to establish a just and \ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East, one that \nwould bring security and peaceful coexistence to all \nthe States and peoples of the region. Squandering this \nhistoric opportunity would constitute a grave loss for \nthe Israeli people, and we would all regret it. \n We welcome the recent positive developments in \nIraq. We hope that such developments will continue in \norder to achieve security and stability in that country, \ncontribute to the success of the comprehensive national \nreconciliation efforts and help establish positive, \ncooperative relations with neighbouring countries, \nallowing Iraq to resume its distinct positive role in the \nregion at all levels. \n We look forward to positive results from the \nDarfur peace talks, to be held in Doha, Qatar, between \nthe Sudanese Government and the Darfur opposition. \nWe hope that the parties concerned can build a \nframework for a political agreement that would help \nrealize security, stability and development in Darfur. \nWe also welcome the policies of Sheikh Sharif Sheikh \nAhmed, President of the Transitional Federal \nGovernment of brotherly Somalia, and his efforts to \nachieve peace in his country. We urge all of our \nbrethren and all factions in Somalia to renounce \nviolence and embrace dialogue. We support international \nefforts to combat piracy and armed robbery against \ncommercial ships off the coast of the Horn of Africa. \n \n \n37 09-52598 \n \n We welcome the continued cooperation between \nthe friendly Islamic Republic of Iran, the international \ncommunity and the International Atomic Energy \nAgency. In this respect, we see some positive signs that \ncould lead to a sound diplomatic solution. \n There is no doubt that the efforts exerted by the \nrich industrialized nations to restore stability and \nbalance to the international capital markets have begun \nto bear fruit. This could lead to the recovery of the \nworld economy. We believe more international effort is \nneeded to reach consensus in the Doha Round of trade \nnegotiations, taking into account the interests of all \nStates, including the developing countries. In light of \nthe serious shortages of food, water and medicine from \nwhich many countries are suffering, we urge the rich \nindustrialized countries to increase investment in \nagriculture research, food security and the supply of \nwater and medicine, for these have a direct impact on \nhumankind.  \n It is also our hope that the Climate Change \nConference to be held in Copenhagen at the end of the \nyear will adopt a long-term plan to protect the \nenvironment and reduce harmful carbon dioxide \nemissions. \n In conclusion, I would like to express our deep \nthanks and gratitude to the President of the General \nAssembly for his efforts in leading the work of this \nsession. We urge all Member States to take the \nnecessary practical measures to help us reach \nconsensus on all the issues on our agenda. "

        "file_text": "It is indeed a great \npleasure for me to extend my warmest congratulations \nto Mr. Ali Treki on his election to preside over the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. \n Permit me also to express my appreciation to the \noutgoing President for his effective leadership during \nthe course of the previous session of the General \nAssembly. \n We are grateful to our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, for the tireless efforts that he exerts to ensure \nthat the United Nations fulfils its purpose during this \ncomplex and crucial period in our collective history. I \nwish to thank him, in particular, for the initiative he \ntook to convene the special Summit on Climate Change \nthis past week. \n It has now been 18 years since we, Ethiopians, \nmanaged to remove a military dictatorship of \n  \n \n09-52592 38 \n \nunprecedented cruelty. The consequences of lack of \ndemocracy within the context of great diversity are all \ntoo apparent. Ethiopia\u2019s diversity leaves no room for \nautocracy, dictatorship, military \u2014 of whatever \nvariety \u2014 cannot mix with the sociological make-up of \nthe country. That was the explanation why Ethiopia \nwas at the edge of the cliff during the last years of the \nmilitary Government. \n The last 18 years have not been easy for \nEthiopians. We had to begin again in every aspect of \nour lives, without exception. There was hardly any \neconomic development throughout the entire 17 years \nof military dictatorship. Even prior to military rule, \nEthiopia faced not just the lack of democracy, but also \na stagnant economy and lack of development. \n However, the challenges of the last 18 years have \nnot been limited to the weight of the past, to our \nlegacy, in both the political and economic areas. We \nalso had to face other challenges which have not been \ninconsequential in terms of affecting the tempo of our \ndemocratization and development. These challenges, \nhowever daunting they are, do not undermine our \nachievements, over the last 18 years, to democratize \nour country and lay the basis for rapid economic \ndevelopment. \n In both areas, the historic trajectory of the \ncountry has shifted. No matter what detractors might \nsay, Ethiopia is now a country with a future and great \nhope. During the entire long history of the country, we \nhave never witnessed two-digit economic growth, yet \nwe are slated to register that rate of growth this year. \nThat would constitute our sixth consecutive year of \nsuch a level of achievement, and it has been attained \ndespite pressures coming from the global economic \ncrisis. \n In democratic governance, the new Ethiopia has \nirrevocably split from the old Ethiopia in terms of both \nindividual and group rights. With respect to the latter \ncategory of rights, Ethiopia, as has so emphatically \nbeen asserted in our Constitution, is no longer a prison \nof nations and nationalities. In terms of respect for \nindividual political and human rights, if hard facts \u2014 \nand not an extraneous political agenda \u2014 are the \nmeasure, Ethiopia is now, all things considered, not at \nthe tail end of countries, but in the vanguard, for its \ncommitment to this value as well as in practice. \n However, over the last 18 years we have had \nmany challenges whose negative effects cannot be \noverlooked. I would like to say a few words about each \nof the challenges that we have had, and continue, to \nface. \n The first is in the area of peace and security. \nObviously, Ethiopia is part of the Horn of Africa. As a \nneighbour sharing a longer border with Somalia than \nany other country and with a large population of \nEthiopian Somalis, we have been affected by what goes \non in that sisterly country; indeed, it would be a \nmiracle if that were not the case.  \n Now, speaking of Somalia, it is time that we \nabandon the fiction that the war there is just among \nSomalis. It is not. Somalia is being hijacked by foreign \nfighters who uninhibitedly proclaim that their agenda \nhas nothing to do with Somalia. Theirs is an ambition \nthat goes well beyond Somalia, and they say that loud \nand clear. Those who advise them not to be so blunt \nhave not succeeded. \n The Somali crisis has been with us as long as the \nnew Ethiopian Government has been around. It is not \njust that we lost a partner because of the absence of a \nfunctioning Government in Mogadishu. We have also \nbeen directly affected by the crisis \u2014 a crisis, let us \nnot forget, that is assisted and abetted by others, \nincluding by States whose authorities move with ease \nin and rub shoulders with members of civilized circles. \nIt is not only rogue States, but also States that are \nostensibly decent that continue to fuel extremism in \nSomalia and to fund its activities. \n Let us call a spade a spade. Today in Somalia, \nthere is greater coordination and cooperation among \nthose who assist the extremists than among those who \nprofess support for the Transitional Federal \nGovernment (TFG) of Somalia. The consequences are \nobvious. As the latest horrific suicide attack on the \nAfrican Union Mission in Somalia has shown, those \ndestroying Somalia are being emboldened and their \nsupporters rewarded. \n Conversely, the TFG authorities continue to lose \nconfidence, as pledged support continues to dwindle in \npractice. The international community is being stingy \neven with the symbolic steps of showing resolve \nagainst extremists and spoilers in Somalia. The \ncountries of the Intergovernmental Authority on \nDevelopment (IGAD) spoke with one voice and \nappealed to the United Nations Security Council. \nAfrican heads of State and Government endorsed \nunanimously the IGAD call for the Security Council to \n \n \n39 09-52592 \n \nstand up and be counted in support of the fight against \nextremism in Somalia. However, it appears that the \nCouncil does not consider Somalia to be a priority. \n In the meantime, those supporting extremism \nhave made Somalia a priority. It is critical that the \ninternational community wake up before the hijacking \nof Somalia by extremism is fully consummated. It is \ntherefore unlikely that the Horn of Africa will soon rid \nitself of the crisis in Somalia, and there will be \nconsequences for the work we have to do in our \ncountry in terms of development, fighting poverty and \nspeeding up the process of democratization. \n That is why the peace process in the Sudan, and \nin particular the effective implementation of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement, is so critical for us. \nThe Horn of Africa cannot afford the consequences of \nfailure in the Sudan peace process. We are very close \nto both parties in the Sudan, and that is an asset that we \nwant to use wisely. \n It would be na\u00efve to believe that the conditions of \npeace and stability in our region have no influence over \nour domestic agenda. They do. Open societies are \nmanifestly vulnerable to the kind of situation \nprevailing in the Horn of Africa. The mix of extremist \nforces and rogue States is not conducive to the growth \nof democracy in close proximity. \n We have other challenges as well. One has to do \nwith climate change. It is gratifying to us Ethiopians \nthat this challenge is drawing the attention of the world \nmore than ever before. I wish to reiterate our \nappreciation of the effort deployed by the Secretary-\nGeneral in this regard. We look forward to the \ninternational community\u2019s taking resolute action in \nCopenhagen on the basis of the principle of common \nbut differentiated responsibilities. \n We in Ethiopia have been affected by climate \nchange in the most difficult and complex ways. The \neffect on our agriculture and on our plan for food \nsecurity has been enormous. It is no longer every \ndecade or so that we face drought, but rather every \nthree to four years. If not drought, then we face floods. \nEither way, the consequences have been enormously \ndamaging to our plan to ensure food security. \n Let me take this opportunity to thank all those \npartners who have stood with us to address and \nmitigate the adverse effects of climate change on our \nagricultural activities. I wish to thank in particular \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton for organizing a \nmeeting on partnering for food security on this very \nday. \n As for the Copenhagen climate change summit, it \nis indeed gratifying that we in Africa have decided to \nbe innovative with respect to our representation and in \nconnection with our approach to negotiation. Africa \nhas decided to be represented by a single team of \ndelegates which will negotiate on the basis of a \ncommon African position. It is an honour for Ethiopia, \nin the person of its Prime Minister, to lead the African \nnegotiating team. We expect much from Copenhagen. \n We have had yet another challenge to our \ndevelopment and to the effort we have been making to \ndeepen the progress of democratization in our country \nover the past 18 years. This has to do with the less-\nthan-conducive international economic \u2014 and, I might \nadd, political \u2014 environment within which we have to \noperate. What we have faced on both scores, economic \nand political, has been a lack of tolerance for diversity, \npolicy-space experimentation and independent \nthinking. Unjustified conditionalities have abounded, \nboth for economic and political reasons \u2014 on the one \nhand because of strategies derived from market \nfundamentalism and on the other because we dared \ndefend ourselves against unjustified aggression. \nEthiopia\u2019s first real attempt at economic development \ncoincided with the period when market orthodoxy \nmade the role of the State anathema. Perhaps times \nhave changed. \n We could have achieved more over the past \n18 years, but what we have indeed achieved in the \ndemocratization of our society and in economic and \nsocial development is not insignificant. In fact, as I \nhave already stated, what we have witnessed in \nEthiopia over the past decade and a half is no less than \na change in the trajectory of the country\u2019s \ndevelopment. Moreover, we have also continued to \ndischarge our multilateral responsibilities in our own \nsubregion, on our continent as members of the African \nUnion, and in the world beyond in connection with our \nobligations to the United Nations. \n In our own region, along with other members of \nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development, we \nhave done whatever is necessary and within the limits \nof our capacity to help Somalia achieve peace and to \nshield it from the onslaught of extremist forces. As part \nof the African Union, we continue to discharge our \n  \n \n09-52592 40 \n \nresponsibilities to maintain the pan-Africanist \ntradition, to contribute to the peace and security of the \ncontinent, and to accelerate the integration process of \nthe continent brick by brick. \n The United Nations is an Organization which we \ncannot live without. We benefit from the Organization \nin more ways than one. We also take our obligation to \nit very seriously. It is in that spirit that we continue to \nstrengthen our contribution to the United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts. In this we shall continue without \nfail. It is for that reason that I wish to conclude by \nreiterating Ethiopia\u2019s commitment to the United \nNations and by affirming our commitment to all efforts \nat reforming the Organization, including the Security \nCouncil."

        "file_text": "We convey our warmest congratulations to the \nrenowned Libyan diplomat Mr. Ali Treki on his recent \nelection to preside over the General Assembly at this \nsixty-fourth session, as well as for his call for a \ndialogue among civilizations, for interreligious \nunderstanding, for the promotion for peace and \nsecurity and for closing the divide between rich and \npoor. \n Exactly one year ago, when we were taking stock \nof progress made towards meeting the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals at the midterm point, something \nunexpected occurred: the collapse of some of the most \nemblematic investment banks, and with that the \nworsening of the global financial crisis.  \n Before this crisis occurred, however, the world, in \nparticular the developing countries, was already \naffected by the impact of two other crises that had \nbegun simultaneously: the crisis involving oil prices \nand that involving food prices. \n As a result of the first of these crises, that is, the \noil crisis, vigorous and intense social protest broke out \nin various parts of the world. Suddenly, all products \nbecame more expensive. Governments were forced to \nuse their currency reserves to pay their oil bills and \nwere forced to allocate subsidies for the sake of \nmaintaining civic peace and democratic governance.  \n When it comes to the second crisis, the food \ncrisis, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations established that as a result of the food \ncrisis, the number of people suffering from hunger \nworldwide rose by 150 million, which meant that for \nthe first time in human history the total figure \nexceeded the number of 1 billion human beings.  \n Before these two crises broke out, the World \nBank had already indicated that in order to meet the \nMillennium Development Goals in the remaining seven \nyears \u2014 that is, between 2008 and 2015 \u2014 \n$250 billion were still needed, or $50 billion every \nyear. Obviously, with the outbreak of these crises, \nwhich gravely affected the economies of developing \ncountries, the resources needed to meet the objectives \nthat had been set to cut by half the level of poverty \nworldwide would have to be increased significantly \nabove the projected figures established by the World \nBank. \n As one can see, the situation last year was already \nbleak at the time of submitting for analysis and \nevaluation the achievements that had been made and \nfuture challenges to meet in order to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. In spite of the dark \nclouds that were gathering on the global economic \nhorizon, we still felt optimistic; we held the illusion \nthat we might meet our targets. After all, we had made \ncontinuous progress towards meeting some of the \nGoals. But from then on, we witnessed the deluge of \nthe global financial crisis. Since then, the storm has \nbeen so intense that it has created a widespread state of \nanxiety and fear at a global scale the likes of which has \nnot been seen in many decades.  \n According to the Director-General of the World \nHealth Organization, Dr. Margaret Chan, 400,000 more \nchildren and tens of thousands of women will die every \nyear as a direct consequence of the global financial \ncrisis. Today, while the meetings of the General \nAssembly of the most important global organization \nare being held, 25,000 children will die in various parts \nof the world. That is the equivalent of saying that a \nchild will die every three seconds, or 18 children every \nminute.  \n By the time I conclude my statement this \nafternoon \u2014 my 15 minute statement \u2014 worldwide \n270 children will have died, whose early deaths could \nhave been avoided. Throughout the course of this year, \n9 million children, which is equivalent to the entire \npopulation of my country, the Dominican Republic, \nwill have lost their lives for no reason or justification. \nThis represents a human tragedy of epic proportions, a \ntrue catastrophe. It is morally and politically \nunacceptable. For that reason, it is important to call \nupon the General Assembly to declare a state of \nemergency with regard to compliance with the \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n When facing the challenges to our efforts to meet \nthe eight goals established in the year 2000 for \nimproving the human dignity and living conditions of \nmillions of people worldwide, it is possible to adopt \ndifferent attitudes. We might consider that we have \nfailed and that these goals can never be met; that they \nrepresent a new utopia and therefore the only path \n \n \n31 09-52228 \n \nremaining is to abandon any effort to meet those goals. \nClearly that would be a cowardly and irresponsible \nattitude \u2014 the worst possible decision. It would mean \nleaving all those in need of human solidarity and \ncompassion out in the cold. A second attitude would be \nto reconsider the goals and then extend the timetable to \nfulfil them; that would seem logical and reasonable. \nHowever, that reasoning encounters one obstacle \u2014 the \nfact that children, the poor and the women of the world \ncannot wait. \n The only real way to ensure fulfilment of the \nMillennium Development Goals by the planned 2015 \ndate, is for the General Assembly to work towards \npromoting true commitment among nations and \ngovernmental and non-governmental institutions to \nurgently assume their task to achieve economic and \nsocial development for all people affected by poverty, \nhunger, disease and illiteracy. \n It cannot be argued that the resources available to \naddress this urgent task are insufficient. We have seen \nin the diligent manner used to address the collapse of \nthe international financial system that \u2014 as the saying \ngoes \u2014 where there is the will there is a way. \n Looking ahead, the first thing to be considered is \nthat with the forecasted end of the global economic \nrecession and the resulting gradual recovery of \neconomic growth, we must ensure that we never again \nwitness such a sudden and abrupt increase in oil and \nfood prices as a result of excessive speculation and the \ntransactions of the futures market. We issue this \nwarning because we have been observing with concern, \nan increase in milk prices over the past three weeks on \nthe international market that have risen by more than \n$1,000 per ton without any valid justification.  \n We must set aside all individual interests, \nresistance and obstacles that stand in the way of the \nreform of the global financial system and the stock \nmarkets, in order to establish new mechanisms for \nregulation and supervision that will guarantee that no \ncrisis such as this one will ever occur again. \n Because of the lack of compliance to date by the \nmajority of developed countries with their \ncommitments made during the Copenhagen World \nSummit for Social Development to contribute to the \ndevelopment of the poorest and most vulnerable \nnations and due to the prevailing situation of the global \nrecession, we draw the attention of the General \nAssembly to the possibility of finding new sources of \nfinancing for the Millennium Development Goals.  \n In that regard, we suggest the creation of a \nworking group to carry out professional, high-quality \nresearch and submit a report containing \nrecommendations and a plan of action geared towards \nestablishing a fine to benefit development on capital \ndeposited in fiscal havens, offshore banks and \ninternational financial centres. Placing financial \nresources in such fiscal havens means that every year \nwe witness tax evasion in a sum equivalent to \n$250 billion \u2014 a figure \u2014 according to the World \nBank \u2014 equal to the total sum of external aid \nnecessary to meet the Millennium Development Goals.  \n According to the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development (OECD), some \n$7 trillion is currently deposited in tax havens which \ndo not contribute one single cent towards fiscal \nincome. OXFAM has indicated that more than \n$50 billion in fiscal income slips through the fingers of \ndeveloping countries each year as a result of offshore \nbanks and tax havens. The organization Christian Aid \nhas also affirmed bleakly that tax evasion is \nresponsible for the deaths of more than 5 million \nchildren between the year 2000 and 2015 \u2014 the years \nwe set to meet the Millennium Development Goals. \n There are abundant resources in the world and \nwhat is happening is that they are unfairly and \nunequally distributed due, inter alia, to an existing \nglobal financial architecture marked by the lack of \ntransparency, secrecy, money-laundering, evasion and \nfraud. Our only hope of changing the current situation \nof economic decline and social deterioration and the \nmoral crisis that is shaking up the world lies in \nadopting brave, wise and timely decisions in this \nprestigious global forum. \n The peoples of the world are waiting for these \ndecisions. They are aware that their right to a dignified, \nhonourable and happy life depends upon that. We \ncannot let them down. We must act with justice \ncourage, a sense of history and with a vision of the \nfuture. \n I cannot conclude this statement without touching \nupon the current prevailing situation in Honduras. The \nUnited Nations passed a resolution condemning the \ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat which took place in this Central American \nnation in June of this year and called for the return of \ndemocratic order. The same attitude was adopted by the \n  \n \n09-52228 32 \n \nOrganization of American States, the European Union, \nthe African Union and by the League of Arab States. \nDespite the entire world\u2019s condemnation of that assault \non democracy, the de facto Government of Honduras \nhas remained in power, thereby underscoring the \nweaknesses of the international community to take \naction.  \n President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya \u2014 the sole \nlegitimate President of Honduras, who was scheduled \nas the sixth speaker to take the floor in the General \nAssembly this afternoon \u2014 has, in a great display of \npersonal courage and daring, preferred to return to his \ncountry. It is now to be hoped that we the \nrepresentatives of the peoples gathered here at this \nworld forum will be able to act with the same dignity, \nsense of responsibility and level of commitment when \nit comes to the supremacy of democracy, freedom and \njustice."

        "file_text": "In the \nname of the African Union, I would like to greet the \nmembers of the General Assembly of the United \nNations, and I hope that this meeting will be among the \nmost historic in the history of the world. \n In the name of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfourth session, presided over by Libya, of the African \nUnion, of one thousand traditional African kingdoms \nand in my own name, I would like to take this \nopportunity, as President of the African Union, to \ncongratulate our son Obama because he is attending the \nGeneral Assembly, and we welcome him as his country \nis hosting this meeting. \n This session is taking place in the midst of so \nmany challenges facing us, and the whole world should \ncome together and unite its efforts to defeat the \nchallenges that are our principal common enemy \u2014 \nthose of climate change and international crises such as \nthe capitalist economic decline, the food and water \ncrises, desertification, terrorism, immigration, piracy, \nman-made and natural epidemics and nuclear \nproliferation. Perhaps influenza H1N1 was a virus \ncreated in a laboratory that got out of control, \noriginally being meant as a military weapon. Such \nchallenges also include hypocrisy, poverty, fear, \nmaterialism and immorality.  \n As is known, the United Nations was founded by \nthree or four countries against Germany at the time. \nThe United Nations was formed by the nations that \njoined together against Germany in the Second World \nWar. Those countries formed a body called the Security \nCouncil, made its own countries permanent members \nand granted them the power of veto. We were not \npresent at that time. The United Nations was shaped in \nline with those three countries and wanted us to step \ninto shoes originally designed against Germany. That is \nthe real substance of the United Nations when it was \nfounded over 60 years ago. \n That happened in the absence of some 165 \ncountries, at a ratio of one to eight; that is, one was \npresent and eight were absent. They created the \nCharter, of which I have a copy. If one reads the \nCharter of the United Nations, one finds that the \nPreamble of the Charter differs from its Articles. How \ndid it come into existence? All those who attended the \nSan Francisco Conference in 1945 participated in \ncreating the Preamble, but they left the Articles and \ninternal rules of procedures of the so-called Security \n  \n \n09-52179 16 \n \nCouncil to experts, specialists and interested countries, \nwhich were those countries that had established the \nSecurity Council and had united against Germany.  \n The Preamble is very appealing, and no one \nobjects to it, but all the provisions that follow it \ncompletely contradict the Preamble. We reject such \nprovisions, and we will never uphold them; they ended \nwith the Second World War. The Preamble says that all \nnations, small or large, are equal. Are we equal when it \ncomes to the permanent seats? No, we are not equal. \nThe Preamble states in writing that all nations are \nequal whether they are small or large. Do we have the \nright of veto? Are we equal? The Preamble says that \nwe have equal rights, whether we are large or small. \nThat is what is stated and what we agreed in the \nPreamble. So the veto contradicts the Charter. The \npermanent seats contradict the Charter. We neither \naccept nor recognize the veto.  \n The Preamble of the Charter states that armed \nforce shall not be used, save in the common interest. \nThat is the Preamble that we agreed to and signed, and \nwe joined the United Nations because we wanted the \nCharter to reflect that. It says that armed force shall \nonly be used in the common interest of all nations, but \nwhat has happened since then? Sixty-five wars have \nbroken out since the establishment of the United \nNations and the Security Council \u2014 65 since their \ncreation, with millions more victims than in the Second \nWorld War. Are those wars, and the aggression and \nforce that were used in those 65 wars, in the common \ninterest of us all? No, they were in the interest of one \nor three or four countries, but not of all nations.  \n We will talk about whether those wars were in the \ninterest of one country or of all nations. That flagrantly \ncontradicts the Charter of the United Nations that we \nsigned, and unless we act in accordance with the \nCharter of the United Nations to which we agreed, we \nwill reject it and not be afraid not to speak \ndiplomatically to anyone. Now we are talking about the \nfuture of the United Nations. There should be no \nhypocrisy or diplomacy because it concerns the \nimportant and vital issue of the future of the world. It \nwas hypocrisy that brought about the 65 wars since the \nestablishment of the United Nations. \n The Preamble also states that if armed force is \nused, it must be a United Nations force \u2014 thus, \nmilitary intervention by the United Nations, with the \njoint agreement of the United Nations, not one or two \nor three countries using armed force. The entire United \nNations will decide to go to war to maintain \ninternational peace and security. Since the \nestablishment of the United Nations in 1945, if there is \nan act of aggression by one country against another, the \nentire United Nations should deter and stop that act.  \n If a country, Libya for instance, were to exhibit \naggression against France, then the entire Organization \nwould respond because France is a sovereign State \nMember of the United Nations and we all share the \ncollective responsibility to protect the sovereignty of \nall nations. However, 65 aggressive wars have taken \nplace without any United Nations action to prevent \nthem. Eight other massive, fierce wars, whose victims \nnumber some 2 million, have been waged by Member \nStates that enjoy veto powers. Those countries that \nwould have us believe they seek to maintain the \nsovereignty and independence of peoples actually use \naggressive force against peoples. While we would like \nto believe that these countries want to work for peace \nand security in the world and protect peoples, they \nhave instead resorted to aggressive wars and hostile \nbehaviour. Enjoying the veto they granted themselves \nas permanent members of the Security Council, they \nhave initiated wars that have claimed millions of \nvictims. \n The principle of non-interference in the internal \naffairs of States is enshrined in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. No country, therefore, has the right to \ninterfere in the affairs of any Government, be it \ndemocratic or dictatorial, socialist or capitalist, \nreactionary or progressive. This is the responsibility of \neach society; it is an internal matter for the people of \nthe country concerned. The senators of Rome once \nappointed their leader, Julius Caesar, as dictator \nbecause it was good for Rome at that time. No one can \nsay of Rome at that time that it gave Caesar the veto. \nThe veto is not mentioned in the Charter.  \n We joined the United Nations because we thought \nwe were equals, only to find that one country can \nobject to all the decisions we make. Who gave the \npermanent members their status in the Security \nCouncil? Four of them granted this status to \nthemselves. The only country that we in this Assembly \nelected to permanent member status in the Security \nCouncil is China. This was done democratically, but \nthe other seats were imposed upon us undemocratically \nthrough a dictatorial procedure carried out against our \nwill, and we should not accept it. \n \n \n17 09-52179 \n \n The Security Council reform we need is not an \nincrease in the number of members, which would only \nmake things worse. To use a common expression, if \nyou add more water, you get more mud. It would add \ninsult to injury. It would make things worse simply by \nadding more large countries to those that already enjoy \nmembership of the Council. It would merely perpetuate \nthe proliferation of super-Powers. We therefore reject \nthe addition of any more permanent seats. The solution \nis not to have more permanent seats, which would be \nvery dangerous. Adding more super-Powers would \ncrush the peoples of small, vulnerable and third world \ncountries, which are coming together in what has been \ncalled the Group of 100 \u2014 100 small countries banding \ntogether in a forum that one member has called the \nForum of Small States.  \n These countries would be crushed by super-\nPowers were additional large countries to be granted \nmembership in the Security Council. This door must be \nclosed; we reject it strongly and categorically. Adding \nmore seats to the Security Council would increase \npoverty, injustice and tension at the world level, as \nwell as great competition between certain countries \nsuch as Italy, Germany, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, the \nPhilippines, Japan, Brazil, Nigeria, Argentina, Algeria, \nLibya, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nSouth Africa, Tanzania, Turkey, Iran, Greece and \nUkraine. All these countries would seek a seat on the \nSecurity Council, making its membership almost as \nlarge as that of the General Assembly and resulting in \nan impractical competition. \n What solution can there be? The solution is for \nthe General Assembly to adopt a binding resolution \nunder the leadership of Mr. Treki based on the majority \nwill of Assembly members and taking into account the \nconsiderations of no other body. The solution is to \nclose Security Council membership to the admission of \nfurther States. This item is on the agenda of the \nGeneral Assembly during the present session presided \nover by Mr. Treki. Membership through unions and the \ntransference of mandates should supersede other \nproposals. \n We should focus on the achievement of \ndemocracy based on the equality of Member States. \nThere should be equality among Member States and the \npowers and mandates of the Security Council should be \ntransferred to the General Assembly. Membership \nshould be for unions, not for States. Increasing the \nnumber of States Members would give the right to all \ncountries to a seat, in accordance with the spirit of the \nPreamble of the Charter.  \n No country could deny a seat in the Council to \nItaly, for instance, if a seat were given to Germany. For \nthe sake of argument, Italy might say that Germany \nwas an aggressive country and was defeated in the \nSecond World War. If we gave India a seat, Pakistan \nwould say that it, too, is a nuclear country and deserves \na seat, and those two countries are at war. This would \nbe a dangerous situation. If we gave a seat to Japan, \nthen we should have to give one to Indonesia, the \nlargest Muslim country in the world. Then Turkey, Iran \nand Ukraine would make the same claim. What could \nwe say to Argentina or Brazil? Libya deserves a seat \nfor its efforts in the service of world security by \ndiscarding its weapons of mass destruction programme. \nThen South Africa, Tanzania and Ukraine would \ndemand the same. All of these countries are important. \nThe door to Security Council membership should be \nclosed. \n This approach is a falsehood, a trick that has been \nexposed. If we want to reform the United Nations, \nbringing in more super-Powers is not the way. The \nsolution is to foster democracy at the level of the \ngeneral congress of the world, the General Assembly, \nto which the powers of the Security Council should be \ntransferred. The Security Council would become \nmerely an instrument for implementing the decisions \ntaken by the General Assembly, which would be the \nparliament, the legislative assembly, of the world.  \n This Assembly is our democratic forum and the \nSecurity Council should be responsible before it; we \nshould not accept the current situation. These are the \nlegislators of the Members of the United Nations, and \ntheir resolutions should be binding. It is said that the \nGeneral Assembly should do whatever the Security \nCouncil recommends. On the contrary, the Security \nCouncil should do whatever the General Assembly \ndecides. This is the United Nations, the Assembly that \nincludes 192 countries. It is not the Security Council, \nwhich includes only 15 of the Member States. \n How can we be happy about global peace and \nsecurity if the whole world is controlled by only five \ncountries? We are 192 nations and countries, and we \nare like Speakers\u2019 Corner in London\u2019s Hyde Park. We \njust speak and nobody implements our decisions. We \nare mere decoration, without any real substance. We \nare Speakers\u2019 Corner, no more, no less. We just make \n  \n \n09-52179 18 \n \nspeeches and then disappear. This is who you are right \nnow. \n Once the Security Council becomes only an \nexecutive body for resolutions adopted by the General \nAssembly, there will be no competition for \nmembership of the Council. Once the Security Council \nbecomes a tool to implement General Assembly \nresolutions, there will be no need for any competition. \nThe Security Council should, quite simply, represent \nall nations. In accordance with the proposal submitted \nto the General Assembly, there would be permanent \nseats on the Security Council for all unions and groups \nof countries. \n The 27 countries of the European Union should \nhave a permanent seat on the Security Council. The \ncountries of the African Union should have a \npermanent seat on the Security Council. The Latin \nAmerican and ASEAN countries should have \npermanent seats. The Russian Federation and the \nUnited States of America are already permanent \nmembers of the Security Council. The Southern \nAfrican Development Community (SADC), once it is \nfully established, should have a permanent seat. The 22 \ncountries of the Arab League should have a permanent \nseat. The 57 countries of the Islamic Conference \nshould have a permanent seat. The 118 countries of the \nNon-Aligned Movement should have a permanent seat. \n Then there is the G-100; perhaps the small \ncountries should also have a permanent seat. Countries \nnot included in the unions that I have mentioned could \nperhaps be assigned a permanent seat, to be occupied \nby them in rotation every six or twelve months. I am \nthinking of countries like Japan and Australia that are \noutside such organizations as ASEAN or like the \nRussian Federation that is not a member of the \nEuropean or Latin American or African unions. This \nwould be a solution for them if the General Assembly \nvotes in favour of it. \n The issue is a vitally important one. As has \nalready been mentioned, the General Assembly is the \nCongress and Parliament of the world, the leader of the \nworld. We are the nations, and anyone outside this \nGeneral Assembly will not be recognized. The \nPresident of the Assembly, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \nand Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will produce the \nlegal draft and set up the necessary committees to \nsubmit this proposal to a vote: that from now on, the \nSecurity Council will be made up of unions of nations. \nIn this way, we will have justice and democracy, and \nwe will no longer have a Security Council consisting of \ncountries which have been chosen because they have \nnuclear weapons, large economies or advanced \ntechnology. That is terrorism. We cannot allow the \nSecurity Council to be run by super-Powers; that is \nterrorism in and of itself. \n If we want a world that is united, safe and \npeaceful, this is what we should do. If we want to \nremain in a world at war, that is up to you. We will \ncontinue to have conflict and to fight until doomsday \nor the end of the world. All Security Council members \nshould have the right to exercise the veto, or else we \nshould eliminate the whole concept of the veto with \nthis new formation of the Council. This would be a real \nSecurity Council. According to the new proposals \nsubmitted to the General Assembly, it will be an \nexecutive council under the control of the General \nAssembly, which will have the real power and make all \nthe rules. \n In this way, all countries will be on an equal \nfooting in the Security Council just as they are in the \nGeneral Assembly. In the General Assembly we are all \ntreated equally when it comes to membership and \nvoting. It should be the same in the Security Council. \nCurrently, one country has a veto; another country does \nnot have a veto; one country has a permanent seat; \nanother country does not have a permanent seat. We \nshould not accept this, nor should we accept any \nresolution adopted by the Security Council in its \ncurrent composition. We were under trusteeship; we \nwere colonized; and now we are independent. We are \nhere today to decide the future of the world in a \ndemocratic way that will maintain the peace and \nsecurity of all nations, large and small, as equals. \nOtherwise, it is terrorism, for terrorism is not just \nAl-Qaida but can also take other forms. \n We should be guided by the majority of the votes \nin the General Assembly alone. If the General \nAssembly takes a decision by voting, then its wishes \nshould be obeyed and its decision should be enforced. \nNo one is above the General Assembly; anyone who \nsays he is above the Assembly should leave the United \nNations and be on his own. Democracy is not for the \nrich or the most powerful or for those who practise \nterrorism. All nations should be and should be seen to \nbe on an equal footing. \n \n \n19 09-52179 \n \n At present, the Security Council is security \nfeudalism, political feudalism for those with permanent \nseats, protected by them and used against us. It should \nbe called, not the Security Council, but the Terror \nCouncil. In our political life, if they need to use the \nSecurity Council against us, they turn to the Security \nCouncil. If they have no need to use it against us, they \nignore the Security Council. If they have an interest to \npromote, an axe to grind, they respect and glorify the \nCharter of the United Nations; they turn to Chapter VII \nof the Charter and use it against poor nations. If, \nhowever, they wished to violate the Charter, they \nwould ignore it as if it did not exist at all. \n If the veto of the permanent members of the \nSecurity Council is given to those who have the power, \nthis is injustice and terrorism and should not be \ntoloerated by us. We should not live in the shadow of \nthis injustice and terror. \n Super-Powers have complicated global interests, \nand they use the veto to protect those interests. For \nexample, in the Security Council, they use the power of \nthe United Nations to protect their interests and to \nterrorize and intimidate the Third World, causing it to \nlive under the shadow of terror. \n From the beginning, since it was established in \n1945, the Security Council has failed to provide \nsecurity. On the contrary, it has provided terror and \nsanctions. It is only used against us. For this reason, we \nwill no longer be committed to implementing Security \nCouncil resolutions after this speech, which marks the \n40th anniversary. \n Sixty-five wars have broken out: either fighting \namong small countries or wars of aggression waged \nagainst us by super-Powers. The Security Council, in \nclear violation of the Charter of the United Nations, \nfailed to take action to stop these wars or acts of \naggressions against small nations and peoples. \n The General Assembly will vote on a number of \nhistoric proposals. Either we act as one or we will \nfragment. If each nation were to have its own version \nof the General Assembly, the Security Council and the \nvarious instruments and each were to have an equal \nfooting, the Powers that currently fill the permanent \nseats would be confinded to use of their own soverign \nbodies, whether there be three or four of them, and \nwould have to exercise their rights against themselves. \nThis is of no concern to us. \n If they want to keep their permanent seats, that is \nfine; permanent seats will be of no concern to us. We \nshall never submit to their control or to their exercise \nof the veto that was given to them. We are not so \nfoolish as to give the right of veto to the super-Powers \nto use so they can treat us as second-class citizens and \nas outcast nations. It is not we who decided that those \ncountries are the super-Powers and respected nations \nwith the power to act on behalf of 192 countries. \n You should be fully aware that we are ignoring \nthe Security Council resolutions because those \nresolutions are used solely against us and not against \nthe super-Powers which have the permanent seats and \nthe right of veto. Those Powers never use any \nresolutions against themselves. \n They are, however, used against us. Such use has \nturned the United Nations into a travesty of itself and \nhas generated wars and violations of the sovereignty of \nindependent States. It has led to war crimes and \ngenocides. All of this is in violation of the Charter of \nthe United Nations. \n Since no one pays attention to the Security \nCouncil of the United Nations, each country and \ncommunity has established its own security council, \nand the Security Council here has become isolated. \n The African Union has already established its \nown Peace and Security Council, the European Union \nhas already established a security council, and Asian \ncountries have already established their own security \ncouncil. Soon, Latin America will have its own \nSecurity Counci,l as will the 120 non-aligned nations. \n This means that we have already lost confidence \nin the United Nations Security Council, which has not \nprovided us with security, and that is why we now are \ncreating new regional security councils. \n We are not committed to obeying the rules or the \nresolutions of the United Nations Security Council in \nits present form because it is undemocratic, dictatorial \nand unjust. No one can force us to join the Security \nCouncil or to obey or comply with resolutions or \norders given by the Security Council in its present \ncomposition. \n Furthermore, there is no respect for the United \nNations and no regard for the General Assembly, which \nis actually the true United Nations, but whose \nresolutions are non-binding. The decisions of the \nInternational Court of Justice, the international judicial \n  \n \n09-52179 20 \n \nbody, take aim only at small countries and Third World \nnations. Powerful countries escape the notice of the \nCourt. Or, if judicial decisions are taken against these \npowerful countries, they are not enforced. \n The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \nis an important agency within the United Nations. \nPowerful countries, however, are not accountable to it \nor under its jurisdiction. We have discovered that the \nIAEA is used only against us. We are told that it is an \ninternational organization, but, if that is the case, then \nall the countries of the world should be under its \njurisdiction. If it is not truly international, then right \nafter this speech we should no longer accept it and \nshould close it down. \n Mr. Treki, in his capacity as President of the \nGeneral Assembly, should talk to the Director General \nof the IAEA, Mr. ElBaradei, and should ask him if he \nis prepared to verify nuclear energy storage in all \ncountries and inspect all suspected increases. If he says \nyes, then we accept the Agency\u2019s jurisdiction. But if he \nsays that he cannot go into certain countries that have \nnuclear power and that he does not have any \njurisdiction over them, then we should close the \nAgency down and not submit to its jurisdiction. \n For your information, I called Mr. ElBaradei \nwhen we had the problem of the Libyan nuclear bomb. \nI called Mr. ElBaradei and asked him if the agreements \nby the super-Powers to reduce nuclear supplies were \nsubject to Agency control and under inspection, and \nwhether he was aware of any increases in their activity. \nHe told me that he was not in a position to ask the \nsuper-Powers to be inspected. \n So, is the Agency only inspecting us? If so, it \ndoes not qualify as an international organization since \nit is selective, just like the Security Council and the \nInternational Court of Justice. This is not equitable nor \nis it the United Nations. We totally reject this situation. \n Regarding Africa, Mr. President, whether the \nUnited Nations is reformed or not, and even before a \nvote is taken on any proposals of a historic nature, \nAfrica should be given a permanent seat on the \nSecurity Council now, having already waited too long. \n Leaving aside United Nations reform, we can \ncertainly say that Africa was colonized, isolated and \npersecuted and its rights usurped. Its people were \nenslaved and treated like animals, and its territory was \ncolonized and placed under trusteeship. The countries \nof the African Union deserve a permanent seat. This is \na debt from the past that has to be paid and has nothing \nto do with United Nations reform. It is a priority matter \nand is high on the agenda of the General Assembly. No \none can say that the African Union does not deserve a \npermanent seat. \n Who can argue with this proposal? I challenge \nanyone to make a case against it. Where is the proof \nthat the African Union or the African continent does \nnot deserve a permanent seat? No one can possibly \ndeny this. \n Another matter that should be voted on in the \nGeneral Assembly is that of compensation for countries \nthat were colonized, so as to prevent the colonization \nof a continent, the usurpation of its rights and the \npillaging of its wealth from happening again. \n Why are Africans going to Europe? Why are \nAsians going to Europe? Why are Latin Americans \ngoing to Europe? It is because Europe colonized those \npeoples and stole the material and human resources of \nAfrica, Asia and Latin America \u2014 the oil, minerals, \nuranium, gold and diamonds, the fruit, vegetables and \nlivestock and the people \u2014 and used them. Now, new \ngenerations of Asians, Latin Americans and Africans \nare seeking to reclaim that stolen wealth, as they have \nthe right to do. \n At the Libyan border, I recently stopped 1,000 \nAfrican migrants headed for Europe. I asked them why \nthey were going there. They told me it was to take back \ntheir stolen wealth \u2014 that they would not be leaving \notherwise. Who can restore the wealth that was taken \nfrom us? If you decide to restore all of this wealth, \nthere will be no more immigration from the \nPhilippines, Latin America, Mauritius and India. Let us \nhave the wealth that was stolen from us. Africa \ndeserves $777 trillion in compensation from the \ncountries that colonized it. Africans will demand that \namount, and if you do not give it to them, they will go \nto where you have taken those trillions of dollars. They \nhave the right to do so. They have to follow that money \nand to bring it back. \n Why is there no Libyan immigration to Italy, \neven though Libya is so close by? Italy owed \ncompensation to the Libyan people. It accepted that \nfact and signed an agreement with Libya, which was \nadopted by both the Italian and Libyan Parliaments. \nItaly admitted that its colonization of Libya was wrong \nand should never be repeated, and it promised not to \n \n \n21 09-52179 \n \nattack the Libyan people by land, air or sea. Italy also \nagreed to provide Libya with $250 million a year in \ncompensation over the next 20 years and to build a \nhospital for Libyans maimed as a result of the mines \nplanted in Libyan territory during the Second World \nWar. Italy apologized and promised that it would never \nagain occupy the territory of another country. Italy, \nwhich was a kingdom during the Fascist regime and \nhas made rich contributions to civilization, should be \ncommended for this achievement, together with Prime \nMinister Berlusconi and his predecessor, who made \ntheir own contributions in that regard. \n Why is the Third World demanding \ncompensation? So that there will be no more \ncolonization \u2014 so that large and powerful countries \nwill not colonize, knowing that they will have to pay \ncompensation. Colonization should be punished. The \ncountries that harmed other peoples during the colonial \nera should pay compensation for the damage and \nsuffering inflicted under their colonial rule. \n There is another point that I would like to make. \nHowever, before doing so \u2014 and addressing a \nsomewhat sensitive issue \u2014 I should like to make an \naside. We Africans are happy and proud indeed that a \nson of Africa is now President of the United States of \nAmerica. That is a historic event. Now, in a country \nwhere blacks once could not mingle with whites, in \ncaf\u00e9s or restaurants, or sit next to them on a bus, the \nAmerican people have elected as their President a \nyoung black man, Mr. Obama, of Kenyan heritage. \nThat is a wonderful thing, and we are proud. It marks \nthe beginning of a change. However, as far as I am \nconcerned, Obama is a temporary relief for the next \nfour or eight years. I am afraid that we may then go \nback to square one. No one can guarantee how America \nwill be governed after Obama. \n We would be content if Obama could remain \nPresident of the United States of America for ever. The \nstatement that he just made shows that he is completely \ndifferent from any American President that we have \nseen. American Presidents used to threaten us with all \nmanner of weapons, saying that they would send us \nDesert Storm, Grapes of Wrath, Rolling Thunder and \npoisonous roses for Libyan children. That was their \napproach. American Presidents used to threaten us with \noperations such as Rolling Thunder, sent to Viet Nam; \nDesert Storm, sent to Iraq; Musketeer, sent to Egypt in \n1956, even though America opposed it; and the \npoisonous roses visited upon Libyan children by \nReagan. Can you imagine? One would have thought \nthat Presidents of a large country with a permanent seat \non the Security Council and the right of veto would \nhave protected us and sent us peace. And what did we \nget instead? Laser-guided bombs carried to us on F-111 \naircraft. This was their approach: we will lead the \nworld, whether you like it or not, and will punish \nanyone who opposes us. \n What our son Obama said today is completely \ndifferent. He made a serious appeal for nuclear \ndisarmament, which we applaud. He also said that \nAmerica alone could not solve the problems facing us \nand that the entire world should come together to do \nso. He said that we must do more than we are doing \nnow, which is making speeches. We agree with that and \napplaud it. He said that we had come to the United \nNations to talk against one another. It is true that when \nwe come here, we should communicate with one \nanother on an equal footing. And he said that \ndemocracy should not be imposed from outside. Until \nrecently, American Presidents have said that democracy \nshould be imposed on Iraq and other countries. He said \nthat this was an internal affair. He spoke truly when he \nsaid that democracy cannot be imposed from outside. \n So we have to be cautious. Before I make these \nsensitive remarks I note that the whole world has so \nmany polarities. Listen: should we have a world of so \nmany polarities? Can we not have nations on an equal \nfooting? Let us have an answer. Does anyone have an \nanswer as to whether it is better to have a world of so \nmany polarities? Why can we not have equal standing? \nShould we have patriarchs? Should we have popes? \nShould we have gods? \n Why should we have a world of so many \npolarities? We reject such a world and call for a world \nwhere big and small are equal.  \n The other sensitive point is the Headquarters of \nthe United Nations. Can I have your attention, please? \nAll of you came across the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific \nOcean, crossing the Asian continent or the African \ncontinent to reach this place. Why? Is this Jerusalem? \nIs this the Vatican? Is this Mecca? All of you are tired, \nhave jet lag, have sleepless nights. You are very tired, \nvery low, physically. Somebody just arrived now, \nflying 20 hours. Then we want him to make a speech \nand talk about this. \n All of you are asleep, all of you are tired. It is \nclear that all of you are lacking energy because of \n  \n \n09-52179 22 \n \nhaving to make a long journey. Why do we do that? \nSome of our countries are in nighttime and people are \nasleep. Now you should be asleep, because your \nbiological clock, your biological mind is accustomed to \nbe asleep at this time. I wake up at 4 o\u2019clock New York \ntime, before dawn, because in Libya it is 11 in the \nmorning. When I wake up at 11 o\u2019clock it is supposed \nto be daytime; at 4 o\u2019clock I am awake. \n Why? Think about it. If this was decided in 1945, \nshould we still retain it? Why can we not think about a \nplace that is in the middle, that is comfortable? \n Another important point is that America, the host \ncountry, bears the expenses and looks after the \nHeadquarters and diplomatic missions and looks after \nthe peace and security of the heads of State who come \nhere. They are very strict; they spend a lot of money, \nNew York and all of America being very tight.  \n I want to relieve America of this hardship. We \nshould thank America; we say to America, thank you \nfor all the trouble that you have taken on yourself. We \nsay thank you to America. We want to help reassure \nAmerica and New York and keep them calm. They \nshould not have the responsibility of looking after \nsecurity. Perhaps some day a terrorist could cause an \nexplosion or bomb a president. This place is targeted \nby Al-Qaida, this very building. Why was it not hit on \n11 September? It was beyond their power. The next \ntarget would be this place. I am not saying this in an \noffhand manner. We have tens of members of Al-Qaida \ndetained in Libyan prisons. Their confessions are very \nscary. That makes America live under tension. One \nnever knows what will happen. Perhaps America or this \nplace will be targeted again by a rocket. Perhaps tens \nof heads of State will die. We want to relieve America \nfrom this worry. We shall take the place to where it is \nnot targeted. \n Now after 50 years United Nations Headquarters \nshould be taken to another part of the hemisphere. \nAfter 50 years in the western hemisphere, for the next \n50 years it should be in the eastern hemisphere or in \nthe middle hemisphere, by rotation. Now, with 64 years \nwe have an extra 14 years over the 50 that \nHeadquarters should have been moved to somewhere \nelse. \n This is not an insult to America; it is a service to \nAmerica. We should thank America. This was possible \nin 1945, but we should not accept it now. Of course \nthis should be put to the vote in the General Assembly \n\u2014 only in the Assembly, because in section 23 of the \nHeadquarters Agreement it says that the United \nNations Headquarters can be moved to another location \nonly by a resolution of the General Assembly. If 51 per \ncent of the Assembly approve relocation of \nHeadquarters, then it can be moved. \n America has the right to make security tight \nbecause it is targeted by terrorists and by Al-Qaida. \nAmerica has the right to take all security measures; we \nare not blaming America for that. However, we do not \ntolerate these measures. We do not have to come to \nNew York and be subjected to all these measures. One \npresident told me that he was told that his co-pilot \nshould not come to America because there are \nrestrictions. He asked how he could cross the Atlantic \nwithout a co-pilot. Why? He does not have to come \nhere. Another president complained that his honour \nguard could not come because there was some \nmisunderstanding regarding his name when it came to \ngranting a visa. Another president said his own doctor \ncould not get a visa and could not come to America. \n The security measures are very strict. If a country \nhas any problem with America, they will set up \nrestrictions on the movements of member delegations, \nas if one is in Guantanamo. Is this a Member State of \nthe United Nations, or is it a prisoner in the \nGuantanamo camp that cannot be allowed free \nmovement? \n This is what is submitted to the General \nAssembly for a vote \u2014 moving the Headquarters. If \n51 per cent agree, then we come to the second vote: to \nthe middle of the globe, or to the eastern part. If we say \nthat we must move the Headquarters to the middle of \nthe hemisphere, why do we not move to Sirte or \nVienna? One can come even without a visa. Once you \ncome as a president, Libya is a secure country. We are \nnot going to restrict you to 100 or 500 metres. Libya \nhas no hostile actions against anybody. I think the same \nholds true of Vienna. \n If the vote says we should move Headquarters to \nthe eastern part, then it will be Delhi or Beijing, the \ncapital of China or the capital of India. \n That is logical, my brothers. I do not think there \nwill be any objection to that. Then you will thank me \nfor this proposal, for eliminating the suffering and the \ntrouble of flying 14, 15 or 20 hours to come here. No \none can blame America or say that America will reduce \nits contributions to the United Nations. No one should \n \n \n23 09-52179 \n \nhave that bad thought. America, I am sure, is \ncommitted to its international obligations. America will \nnot be angry; it will thank you for alleviating its \nhardship, for taking on all that hardship and all the \nrestrictions, even though this place is targeted by \nterrorists.  \n We come now to the issues that will be \nconsidered by the General Assembly. We are about to \nput the United Nations on trial; the old organization \nwill be finished and a new one will emerge. This is not \na normal gathering. Even son Obama said that this is \nnot a normal gathering. It is a historic meeting. \n The wars that took place after the establishment \nof the United Nations \u2014 why did they occur? Where \nwas the Security Council, where was the Charter, \nwhere was the United Nations? There should be \ninvestigations and judicial intervention. Why have \nthere been massacres? We can start with the Korean \nWar because it took place after the establishment of the \nUnited Nations. How did a war break out and cause \nmillions of victims? Nuclear weapons could have been \nused in that war. Those who are responsible for causing \nthe war should be tried and should pay compensation \nand damages. \n Then we come to the Suez Canal war of 1956. \nThat file should be opened wide. Three countries with \npermanent seats on the Security Council and with the \nright of veto in the Council attacked a member State of \nthis General Assembly. A country that was a sovereign \nState \u2014 Egypt \u2014 was attacked, its army was \ndestroyed, thousands of Egyptians were killed and \nmany Egyptian towns and entities were destroyed, all \nbecause Egypt wanted to nationalize the Suez Canal. \nHow could such a thing have happened during the era \nof the United Nations and its Charter? How is it \npossible to guarantee that such a thing will not be \nrepeated unless we make amends for past wrongs? \nThose were dangerous events and the Suez Canal and \nKorean war files should be re-opened. \n Next we come to the Viet Nam war. There were \n3 million victims of that war. During 12 days, more \nbombs were dropped than during four years of the \nSecond World War. It was a fiercer war, and it took \nplace after the establishment of the United Nations and \nafter we had decided that there would be no more wars. \n The future of humankind is at stake. We cannot \nstay silent. How can we feel safe? How can we be \ncomplacent? This is the future of the world, and we \nwho are in the General Assembly of the United Nations \nmust make sure that such wars are not repeated in the \nfuture. \n Then Panama was attacked, even though it was an \nindependent member State of the General Assembly. \nFour thousand people were killed, and the President of \nthat country was taken prisoner and put in prison. \nNoriega should be released \u2014 we should open that file. \nHow can we entitle a country that is a United Nations \nMember State to wage war against another country and \ncapture its president, treat him as a criminal and put \nhim in prison? Who would accept that? It could be \nrepeated. We should not stay quiet. We should have an \ninvestigation. Any one of us Member States could face \nthe same situation, especially if such aggression is by a \nMember State with a permanent seat on the Security \nCouncil and with the responsibility to maintain peace \nand security worldwide. \n Then there was the war in Grenada. That country \nwas invaded even though it was a Member State. It was \nattacked by 5,000 war ships, 7,000 troops and dozens \nof military aircraft, and it is the smallest country in the \nworld. This occurred after the establishment of the \nUnited Nations and of the Security Council and its \nveto. And the President of Grenada, Mr. Maurice \nBishop, was assassinated. How could that have \nhappened with impunity? It is a tragedy. How can we \nguarantee that the United Nations is good or not, that a \ncertain country is good or not? Can we be safe or \nhappy about our future or not? Can we trust the \nSecurity Council or not? Can we trust the United \nNations or not? \n We must look into and investigate the bombing of \nSomalia. Somalia is a United Nations Member State. It \nis an independent country under the rule of Aidid. We \nwant an investigation. Why did that happen? Who \nallowed it to happen? Who gave the green light for that \ncountry to be attacked? \n Then there is the former Yugoslavia. No country \nwas as peaceful as Yugoslavia, constructed step by step \nand piece by piece after being destroyed by Hitler. We \ndestroyed it, as if we were doing the same job as Hitler. \nTito built that peaceful country step by step and brick \nby brick and then we arrived and broke it apart for \nimperialistic, personal interests. How can we be \ncomplacent about that? Why can we not be satisfied? If \na peaceful country like Yugoslavia faced such a \ntragedy, the General Assembly should have an \n  \n \n09-52179 24 \n \ninvestigation and should decide who should be tried \nbefore the International Criminal Court. \n Then we have the war in Iraq \u2014 the mother of all \nevils. The United Nations should also investigate that. \nThe General Assembly, presided over by Mr. Treki, \nshould investigate that. The invasion of Iraq was a \nviolation of the United Nations Charter. It was done \nwithout any justification by super-Powers with \npermanent seats on the Security Council. Iraq is an \nindependent country and a member State of the General \nAssembly. How could those countries attack Iraq? As \nprovided for in the Charter, the United Nations should \nhave intervened and stopped the attack. \n We spoke in the General Assembly and urged it to \nuse the Charter to stop that attack. We were against the \ninvasion of Kuwait, and the Arab countries fought Iraq \nalongside foreign countries in the name of the United \nNations Charter. \n In the first instance, the Charter was respected, \nThe second time when we wanted to use the Charter to \nstop the war against Iraq, no one used it and that \ndocument was ignored. Why did that occur? Mr. Treki \nand the General Assembly should investigate to \ndetermine whether there was any reason at all to invade \nIraq. Because the reasons for that attack remain \nmysterious and ambiguous, and we might face the \nsame destiny. \n Why was Iraq invaded? The invasion itself was a \nserious violation of the United Nations Charter, and it \nwas wrong. There was also a total massacre or \ngenocide. More than 1.5 million Iraqis were killed. We \nwant to bring the Iraqi file before the International \nCriminal Court (ICC), and we want those who \ncommitted mass murder against the Iraqi people to be \ntried. \n It is easy for Charles Taylor to be tried, or for \nBashir to be tried, or for Noriega to be tried. That is an \neasy job. Yes, but what about those who have \ncommitted mass murder against the Iraqis? They \ncannot be tried? They cannot go before the ICC? If the \nCourt is unable to accommodate us, then we should not \naccept it. Either it is meant for all of us, large or small, \nor we should not accept it and should reject it. \n Anyone who commits a war crime can be tried, \nbut we are not livestock or animals like those that are \nslaughtered for the Eid. We have the right to live, and \nwe are ready to fight and to defend ourselves. We have \nthe right to live in dignity, under the sun and on earth; \nthey have already tested us and we have withstood the \ntest. \n There are other things as well. Why is it that Iraqi \nprisoners of war can be sentenced to death? When Iraq \nwas invaded and the President of Iraq was taken he was \na prisoner of war. He should not have been tried; he \nshould not have been hanged. When the war was over, \nhe should have been released. We want to know why a \nprisoner of war should have been tried. Who sentenced \nthe President of Iraq to death? Is there an answer to \nthat question? We know the identity of the judge who \ntried him. As to who tied the noose around the \nPresident\u2019s neck on the day of sacrifice and hanged \nhim, those people wore masks. \n How could this have happened in a civilized \nworld? These were prisoners of war of civilized \ncountries under international law. How could \nGovernment ministers and a head of State be sentenced \nto death and hanged? Were those who tried them \nlawyers or members of a judicial system? \n Do you know what people are saying? They are \nsaying that the faces behind the masks were those of \nthe President of the United States and the Prime \nMinister of the United Kingdom and that it was they \nwho put the President of Iraq to death. \n Why do the executioners not unmask their faces? \nWhy do we not know their ranks? Why do we not \nknow whether they were officers, judges, soldiers or \ndoctors? How does it come about that the President of \na State Member of the United Nations was sentenced to \ndeath and killed? We do not know the identity of the \nexecutioners. The United Nations is duty-bound to \nanswer these questions: who carried out the death \nsentence? They must have legal status and official \nresponsibilities; we should know their identities and we \nshould know about the presence of a physician and the \nnature of all the legal proceedings. That would be true \nfor an ordinary citizen, let alone for the President of a \nState Member of the United Nations who was put to \ndeath in that manner. \n My third point on the Iraq war relates to Abu \nGhraib. This was a disgrace to humankind. I know that \nthe United States authorities will investigate this \nscandal, but the United Nations must not ignore it \neither. The General Assembly should investigate this \nmatter. Prisoners of war held in Abu Ghraib prison \nwere torturers; dogs were set on them; men were raped. \n \n \n25 09-52179 \n \nThis is unprecedented in the history of war. It was \nsodomy, and it was an unprecedented sin, never before \ncommitted by past aggressors or invaders. Prisoners of \nwar are soldiers, but these were raped in prison by a \nState, a permanent member of the Security Council. \nThis goes against civilization and humankind. We must \nnot keep silent; we must know the facts. Even today, a \nquarter of a million Iraqi prisoners, men and women \nalike, remain in Abu Ghraib. They are being \nmaltreated, persecuted and raped. There must be an \ninvestigation. \n Turning to the war in Afghanistan, this too must \nbe investigated. Why are we against the Taliban? Why \nare we against Afghanistan? Who are the Taliban? If \nthe Taliban want a religious State, that is fine. Think of \nthe Vatican. Does the Vatican pose a threat to us? No. It \nis a religious, very peaceful State. If the Taliban want \nto create an Islamic Amirate, who says that this makes \nthem an enemy? Is anyone claiming that Bin Laden is \nof the Taliban or that he is Afghan? Is Bin Laden of the \nTaliban? No; he is not of the Taliban and he is not \nAfghan. Were the terrorists who hit New York City of \nthe Taliban? Were they from Afghanistan? They were \nneither Taliban nor Afghan. Then, what was the reason \nfor the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan? \n If I truly wanted to deceive my American and \nBritish friends, I would encourage them to send more \ntroops and I would encourage them to persist in this \nbloodbath. But they will never succeed in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. Look what happened to them in Iraq, \nwhich is a desert. It is even worse in mountainous \nAfghanistan. If I wanted to deceive them I would tell \nthem to continue the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But \nno, I want to save the citizens of the United States, the \nUnited Kingdom and other countries who are fighting \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. So I tell them: leave \nAfghanistan to the Afghans; leave Iraq to the Iraqis. If \nthey want to fight each other, they are free to do so. \n America had its Civil War, and no one interfered \nin it. There were civil wars in Spain, China and \ncountries all over the world \u2014 no place on Earth has \nbeen free of civil wars. Let there be a civil war in Iraq. \nIf the Iraqis want to have a civil war and fight each \nother, that is fine. Who says that if the Taliban form a \nGovernment they would possess intercontinental \nmissiles or the kind of aeroplanes that hit New York? \nDid those aeroplanes take off from Afghanistan or \nIraq? No; they took off from American airports. So \nwhy is Afghanistan being struck? The terrorists were \nnot Afghans or Taliban or Iraqis. \n Why are we silent? We must never be war devils: \nanyone who does not speak the truth is a silent devil. \nWe are committed to international peace and security. \nWe do not wish to scorn or ridicule humankind. We \nwant to save humanity. \n As President of the General Assembly, Mr. Ali \nTreki should open an investigation of the \nassassinations file \u2014 in addition to the war files. Who \nkilled Patrice Lumumba, and why? We merely want to \nrecord it in the annals of African history; we want to \nknow how an African leader, a liberator, came to be \nassassinated. Who killed him? We want our sons to be \nable to read the history of how Patrice Lumumba, the \nhero of Congo\u2019s liberation struggle, was assassinated. \nWe want to know the facts, even 50 years on. That is \none file that should be reopened. \n And who killed Secretary-General Hammarskj\u00f6ld? \nWho fired on his aeroplane in 1961, and why? \n Then, there is the assassination of United States \nPresident Kennedy in 1963. We want to know who \nkilled him and why. There was somebody called \nLee Harvey Oswald, who was then killed by one \nJack Ruby. Why did he kill him? Jack Ruby, an Israeli, \nkilled Lee Harvey Oswald, who killed Kennedy. Why \ndid this Israeli kill Kennedy\u2019s killer? Then Jack Ruby, \nthe killer of the killer of Kennedy, died in mysterious \ncircumstances before he could be tried. We must open \nthe files. The whole world knows that Kennedy wanted \nto investigate the Israeli Dimona nuclear reactor. This \ninvolves international peace and security and weapons \nof mass destrucion. That is why we should open this \nfile. \n Then there is the assassination of Martin Luther \nKing, the black reverend and human rights activist. His \nassassination was a plot, and we should know why he \nwas killed and who killed him. \n Then Khalil Wazir, or Abu Jihad, a Palestinian, \nwas attacked. He was living peacefully in Tunisia, a \nMember State, and that country\u2019s sovereignty was not \nrespected. We cannot keep silent. Even though \nsubmarines and ships were detected along the coast of \nTunisia, where he was killed, no one was accused or \ntried. Abu Iyad was also killed, and we should know \nhow he was killed. He was killed in ambiguous \ncircumstances. In Operation Spring of Youth, Kamal \n  \n \n09-52179 26 \n \nNasser, a poet, Kamal Adwan and Abu Youssef \nal-Najjar, three Palestinians, were killed in Lebanon, a \ncountry that is a free, sovereign State member of the \nGeneral Assembly. They were attacked and killed while \nsleeping peacefully. We should know who killed them, \nand he should be tried so that those crimes against \nhumanity are not repeated. \n We have already talked about the size of the force \nused in the invasion of Grenada \u2014 7,000 troops, 15 \nbattleships and dozens of bombers \u2014 and President \nBishop was killed even though Grenada was a Member \nState. Those are crimes, and we cannot keep silent. \nOtherwise, we will look like sacrificial beasts. We are \nnot animals. Year after year, we are attacked. We \ndefend ourselves, our sons and our children, and we are \nnot afraid. We have the right to live, and the Earth is \nnot destined for violence, but for us all. We can never \nlive on this Earth in such humiliation. So those are the \nwars. \n The last file is that of the massacres. In the Sabra \nand Shatila massacre, 3,000 people were killed. That \narea, under the protection of the occupying Israeli \narmy, was the site of a huge and calamitous massacre \nin which 3,000 Palestinian men, women and children \nwere killed. How can we keep quiet? Lebanon is a \nsovereign State; a member of the General Assembly \nwas occupied, Sabra and Shatila were under Israeli \ncontrol, and then the massacre took place. \n Then there was the 2008 massacre in Gaza. There \nwere 1,000 women and 2,200 children among the \nvictims killed in the massacre in Gaza in 2008. Sixty \nUnited Nations facilities and another 30 belonging to \nnon-governmental organizations were damaged. Fifty \nclinics were destroyed. Forty doctors and nurses were \nkilled while carrying out humanitarian activities. This \ntook place in Gaza in December 2008. \n The perpetrators are still alive, and they should \nbe tried by the International Criminal Court (ICC). \nShould we try only the underdogs, the weak and the \npoor of third-world countries, and not important and \nprotected figures? Under international law, they should \nall face trial for the consequences of the crimes that \nthey have committed. Otherwise, the role of the ICC \nwill never be recognized. If the decisions of the ICC \nare not respected or implemented, if the General \nAssembly and the Security Council mean nothing, and \nif the International Atomic Energy Agency serves only \ncertain countries and organizations, then what is the \nUnited Nations? It would mean that the United Nations \nis nothing and is insignificant. Where is it? There is no \nUnited Nations. \n Then, while piracy may be a phenomenon of the \nhigh seas, a form of terrorism, we talk about the piracy \nin Somalia. Somalis are not pirates. We are the pirates. \nWe went there and usurped their economic zones, their \nfish and their wealth. Libya, India, Japan and \nAmerica \u2014 any country in the world \u2014 we are all \npirates. We all entered the territorial waters and \neconomic zones of Somalia and stole. The Somalis are \nprotecting their own fish, their sustenance. They have \nbecome pirates because they are defending their \nchildren\u2019s food. Now, we seek to address that matter in \nthe wrong way. Should we send warships to Somalia? \nWe should send warships to the pirates who have \nattacked and seized the economic zones and wealth of \nthe Somalis and the food of their children. \n I met the pirates, and I told them that I would \nnegotiate an agreement between them and the \ninternational community that respects the 200-mile \nexclusive economic zone under the law of the sea, that \nprotects all marine resources belonging to the Somali \npeople, and that stops all countries from disposing of \ntoxic waste along the Somali coast. In return, the \nSomalis would no longer attack ships. We will propose \nand draft such an international treaty and submit it to \nthe General Assembly. That is the solution. The \nsolution does not lie in sending more military ships to \nfight the Somalis. That is not the solution.  \n We are addressing the phenomena of piracy and \nterrorism in the wrong way. Today there is swine flu. \nPerhaps tomorrow there will be fish flu, because \nsometimes we produce viruses by controlling them. It \nis a commercial business. Capitalist companies \nproduce viruses so that they can generate and sell \nvaccinations. That is very shameful and poor ethics. \nVaccinations and medicine should not be sold. In The \nGreen Book, I maintain that medicines should not be \nsold or subject to commercialization. Medicines should \nbe free of charge and vaccinations given free to \nchildren, but capitalist companies produce the viruses \nand vaccinations and want to make a profit. Why are \nthey not free of charge? We should give them free of \ncharge, and not sell them. The entire world should \nstrive to protect our people, create and manufacture \nvaccinations and give them free to children and \nwomen, and not profit by them. All those items are on \n \n \n27 09-52179 \n \nthe agenda of the General Assembly, which has only to \nexercise that duty. \n The Ottawa Convention on Landmines forbids the \nproduction of landmines. That is wrong. Landmines are \ndefensive weapons. If I place them along the border of \nmy country and someone wants to invade me, they may \nbe killed. That is all right, because they are invading \nme. The Convention should be reconsidered. I am not \ntaking that defensive weapon to another country. The \nenemy is coming to me. On the Al-Qadhafi website, I \ncall for that treaty to be modified or annulled. This \ntreaty should be modified or annulled. I want to use \nanti-personnel mines to defend my home against \ninvasion. Eliminate weapons of mass destruction, not \nlandmines, which are defensive weapons. \n With regard to the Palestinian situation, the two-\nState solution is impossible; it is not practical. \nCurrently, these two States completely overlap. \nPartition is doomed to failure. These two States are not \nneighbours; they are coextensive, in terms of both \npopulation and geography. A buffer zone cannot be \ncreated between the two States because there are half a \nmillion Israeli settlers in the West Bank and a million \nArab Palestinians in the territory known as Israel. \n The solution is therefore a democratic State \nwithout religious fanaticism or ethnicity. The \ngeneration of Sharon and Arafat is over. We need a new \ngeneration, in which everyone can live in peace. Look \nat Palestinian and Israeli youth; they both want peace \nand democracy, and they want to live under one State. \nThis conflict poisons the world. \n The White Book actually has the solution; I hold it \nhere. The solution is Isratine. Arabs have no hostility \nor animosity towards Israel. We are cousins and of the \nsame race. We want to live in peace. The refugees \nshould go back. \n You are the ones who brought the Holocaust upon \nthe Jews. You, not we, are the ones who burned them. \nWe gave them refuge. We gave them safe haven during \nthe Roman era and the Arab reign in Andalusia and \nduring the rule of Hitler. You are the ones who \npoisoned them; you are the ones who annihilated them. \nWe provided them with protection. You expelled them. \nLet us see the truth. We are not hostile; we are not \nenemies of the Jews. And one day the Jews will need \nthe Arabs. At that point, Arabs will be the ones to give \nthem protection, to save them, as we have done in the \npast. Look at what everybody else did to the Jews. \nHitler is an example. You are the ones who hate the \nJews, not us. \n In brief, Kashmir should be an independent State, \nneither Indian nor Pakistani. We must end that conflict. \nKashmir should be a buffer State between India and \nPakistan. \n With regard to Darfur, I truly hope that the \nassistance provided by international organizations can \nbe used for development projects, for agriculture, for \nindustry and for irrigation. You are the ones who made \nit a crisis; you put it on the altar; you wanted to \nsacrifice Darfur so that you could interfere in its \ninternal affairs. \n You have turned the Hariri problem into a United \nNations problem. You are selling Hariri\u2019s corpse. You \njust want to settle scores with Syria. Lebanon is an \nindependent State; it has laws, courts, a judiciary and \npolice. At this stage, it is no longer the perpetrators that \nare being sought; the real wish is to settle scores with \nSyria, not ensure justice for Hariri. The cases of Khalil \nal-Wazir, Lumumba, Kennedy, and Hammarskj\u00f6ld \nshould also have been turned over to the United \nNations, if the Hariri case merits such attention. \n The General Assembly is now under the \npresidency of Libya. This is our right. Libya hopes that \nyou will assist in making the transition from a world \nfraught with crises and tension to a world in which \nhumanity, peace and tolerance prevail. I will personally \nfollow up on this issue with the General Assembly, \nPresident Treki and the Secretary-General. It is not our \nhabit to compromise when it comes to the destiny of \nhumanity and the struggles of the third world and the \n100 small nations, which should live in peace always."

        "file_text": "The General \nAssembly has been and must continue to be the great \nforum for general debate concerning humankind\u2019s \nmajor problems. \n I wish to discuss three crucial issues which I \nbelieve to be interconnected. Three perils that haunt \nour planet are the ongoing economic crisis, the lack of \nstable, democratic world governance and the threat \nposed by climate change to all of our lives. \n Exactly one year ago, at the outset of the \neconomic crisis that overtook the world economy, I \nsaid from this rostrum that history would never forgive \nus for the serious blunder of dealing only with the \nimpact of the crisis rather than its causes. More than a \ncrisis of big banks, this is a crisis of big dogmas. An \neconomic, political and social outlook held to be \nunquestionable has simply fallen apart. A senseless \nway of thinking and acting which dominated the world \nfor decades has proven itself bankrupt. \n I refer to the absurd doctrine that markets could \nregulate themselves with no need for so-called \nintrusive State intervention. And I refer to the thesis of \nabsolute freedom for financial capital, with no rules or \ntransparency, beyond the control of people and \ninstitutions. It was an iniquitous defence of a minimal, \ncrippled, weakened state, unable to promote \ndevelopment or to fight poverty and inequities. \n It included the demonization of social policies, an \nobsession with precarious labour relations and an \nirresponsible commoditization of public services. The \nreal cause of the crises is that most of the sovereignty \nof peoples and nations and their democratic \ngovernments had been confiscated by autonomous \nnetworks of wealth and power. \n I said then that the time had come for political \ndecisions. I said that leaders, rather than arrogant \ntechnocrats must take responsibility for bringing \nworldwide disorder under control. Controlling the \ncrisis and changing the course of the world\u2019s economy \ncould not be left to the usual few. \n Developed countries and the multilateral agencies \nthat they run had been unable to foresee the \napproaching catastrophe, much less prevent it. The \nimpact of the crisis spread around the world, striking, \nabove all, countries that for years, and at great \nsacrifice, had been rebuilding their economies. \n It is not fair that the price of runaway speculation \nbe paid by those who had nothing to do with it, by \nworkers and by poor or developing countries. Twelve \nmonths later, we can see some progress, but many \ndoubts still persist. No one is yet clearly willing to \nconfront serious distortions of the global economy in \nthe multilateral arena. \n The fact that we avoided a total collapse of the \nsystem has apparently given rise to an irresponsible \nacquiescence in certain sectors. Most of the underlying \nproblems have been ignored. There is enormous \nresistance to the adoption of effective mechanisms to \nregulate financial markets. \n Rich countries are putting off reform at \nmultilateral agencies such as the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. We simply \ncannot understand the paralysis of the Doha Round, \nwhose conclusion will, above all, benefit the poorest \n \n \n7 09-52179 \n \ncountries of our world. There are also worrisome signs \nof return to protectionist practices, while little has been \ndone to fight tax havens. \n Many countries, however, have not sat waiting. \nBrazil, fortunately one of the last countries to be hit by \nthe crisis, is now one of the first to emerge from it. \nThere is no magic in what we did. We simply kept our \nfinancial system from being contaminated by the virus \nof speculation. We had already cut back our external \nvulnerability as we turned from debtors into \ninternational creditors. Along with other countries, we \ndecided to contribute resources for the IMF to lend \nmoney to the poorest countries, free of the \nunacceptable conditions imposed in the past. \n Above all, however, both before and after the \ncrisis broke out, we implemented countercyclical \npolicies. We intensified our social programmes, \nparticularly income-transfer programmes. We raised \nwages above inflation rates. We used fiscal measures to \nstimulate consumption and keep the economy moving. \n We have now emerged from our brief recession. \nOur economy has regained its impetus and shows \npromise for 2010. Foreign trade is recovering vitality, \nthe labour market is doing amazingly well and \nmacroeconomic equilibrium has been preserved, at no \ncost to the victories of our people\u2019s movements. What \nBrazil and other countries have shown is that, at times \nof crisis, we must still carry out bold social and \ndevelopment programmes. \n Yet I hold no illusions that we might solve our \nproblems alone, within our own borders. Because the \nglobal economy is interdependent, we are all obliged to \nintervene across national borders and must therefore \nestablish once again the world economic order. \n At meetings of the Group of 20 and many other \nmeetings I have held with world leaders, I have \ninsisted on the need to irrigate the world economy with \na significant volume of credit. I have defended the \nregulation of financial markets, the widespread \nadoption of countercyclical policies, the end of \nprotectionism and the fight against tax havens. \n With the same determination, my country has \nproposed a true reform of the multilateral financial \ninstitutions. Poor and developing countries must \nincrease their share of control in the IMF and the \nWorld Bank. Otherwise, there can be no real change, \nand the peril of new and greater crises will be \ninevitable. Only more representative and democratic \ninternational agencies will be able to deal with \ncomplex problems such as reorganizing the \ninternational monetary system. \n Sixty-five years on, the world can no longer be \nrun by the same rules and values that prevailed at the \nBretton Woods Conference. Likewise, the United \nNations and its Security Council can no longer be run \nunder the same structures imposed after the Second \nWorld War. We are in a period of transition in \ninternational relations. We are moving towards a \nmultilateral world. However, it is also a multipolar \nworld, based on experiences in regional integration \nsuch as South America\u2019s experience in creating the \nUnion of South American Nations. \n This multipolar world will not conflict with the \nUnited Nations. On the contrary, it could be an \ninvigorating factor for the United Nations. It would \ncreate the platform for a United Nations with the \npolitical and moral authority to solve the conflicts in \nthe Middle East, assuring the coexistence of a \nPalestinian State with the State of Israel; a United \nNations that confronts terrorism without stigmatizing \nethnic groups and religions, instead dealing with \nunderlying causes and promoting dialogue among \ncivilizations; a United Nations that can truly help \ncountries such as Haiti that are trying to rebuild their \neconomies and mend their social fabric after achieving \npolitical stability; a United Nations committed to the \nAfrican renaissance that we are now seeing; a United \nNations able to implement effective policies that \npreserve and expand human rights; a United Nations \nthat can make real progress towards disarmament in \ntrue balance with non-proliferation; a United Nations \nthat can truly lead in initiatives to protect the planet\u2019s \nenvironment; a United Nations that can use its \nEconomic and Social Council to forge decisions on \nconfronting the economic crisis; and a United Nations \nthat is representative enough to address threats to \nworld peace through a reformed Security Council that \nis renewed and open to new permanent members. \n We are not wishful thinkers. Yet it takes political \nwill to confront and overcome situations that conspire \nagainst peace, development and democracy. Unless \npolitical will is present, throwbacks such as the \nembargo against Cuba will persist. \n Unless there is political will, we will see more \ncoups such as the one that toppled the constitutional \n  \n \n09-52179 8 \n \nPresident of Honduras, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya, who has \nbeen granted refuge in Brazil\u2019s embassy in Tegucigalpa \nsince Monday. The international community demands \nthat Mr. Zelaya immediately return to the presidency of \nhis country, and it must be alert to ensure the \ninviolability of Brazil\u2019s diplomatic mission in the \ncapital of Honduras. \n Finally, unless political will prevails, threats to \nthe world such as climate change will continue to grow. \nAll countries must take action to turn back global \nwarming. We are dismayed by the reluctance of \ndeveloped countries to shoulder their share of the \nburden when it comes to fighting climate change. They \ncannot burden developing and poor countries with \ntasks that are theirs alone. \n Brazil is doing its part. We will arrive in \nCopenhagen with precise alternatives and \ncommitments. We have approved a national climate \nchange plan that includes an 80 per cent cut in \ndeforestation of the Amazon by 2020. We will reduce \ncarbon dioxide emissions by 4.8 billion tons \u2014 more \nthan the sum total of all the commitments of developed \ncountries. In 2009, we can already boast the lowest \ndeforestation rate in 20 years. \n Brazil\u2019s energy blend is in one of the cleanest in \nthe world. Forty-five per cent of the energy that my \ncountry consumes is renewable. In the rest of the \nworld, only 12 per cent is renewable, while no country \nin the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment has a rate higher than 5 per cent. Eighty \nper cent of our electric power also comes from \nrenewable sources. \n All the gasoline sold for our passenger cars has \n25 per cent ethanol blended into it. More than 80 per \ncent of the cars produced in our country have flexible-\nfuel engines that enable them to use any blend of \ngasoline and/or alcohol. Brazil\u2019s ethanol and other \nbiofuels are produced in ever-improving conditions \nunder the ecological zoning plan that we have just sent \nto our National Congress. We have banned sugar cane \nplantations and alcohol plants in areas with native \nvegetation. That decision applies to the entire Amazon \nregion as well as to other major biomes. Sugar cane \nproduction covers no more than 2 per cent of our \ntillable land. Unlike other biofuels, it does not affect \nfood security, much less compromise the environment. \nCompanies, farm workers and the Government have \nsigned an important commitment to ensure decent \nworking conditions on Brazil\u2019s sugar cane plantations. \n All those concerns are part of the energy policies \nof a country that is self-sufficient in oil and has just \nfound major reserves that will put us in the forefront of \nfossil fuel production. Even so, Brazil will not relinquish \nits environmental agenda and simply turn into an oil \ngiant. We plan to consolidate our role as a world Power \nin green energy. Meanwhile, developed countries must \nset emission-reduction goals that go far beyond those \ntabled to date, which represent a mere fraction of the \nreductions recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change. We are also deeply concerned that the \nfunding announced to date for technological innovations \nneeded to protect the environment in developing \ncountries is totally insufficient. \n The solutions to those and other impasses will \narise only if the perils of climate change are confronted \nwith the understanding that we share common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities. \n The issues at the core of our concerns \u2014 the \nfinancial crisis, new global governance and climate \nchange \u2014 have one strong common denominator: the \nneed to build a new international order that is \nsustainable, multilateral and less asymmetric, free of \nhegemonies and ruled by democratic institutions. Such \na new world is a political and moral imperative. We \ncannot just shovel away the rubble of failure; we must \nbe midwives to the future. That is the only way to \nmake amends for so much injustice and to prevent new \ncollective tragedies."

        "file_text": "I am speaking for the first \ntime as Head of State. However, in 1977 I appeared \nwith my country\u2019s delegation before the Trusteeship \nCouncil, seeking independence. In 1994, the \ntrusteeship ended and we took our place as a Member \nof the United Nations. Our independence is testament \nto the success of the International Trusteeship System, \nfor which we are grateful. The legacy of our experience \nis a Constitution that incorporates the rights and \nfreedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights: freedom, democracy, equal protection \nand the rule of law. \n We thank the permanent members of the Security \nCouncil, which recognized our sovereignty: the United \nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the \nFrench Republic, the Russian Federation, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and the United States of America. \nThe United States was our Administering Authority, \nand we express our deep appreciation to it for \nbecoming our close partner under the Compact of Free \nAssociation, a relationship we cherish and one that we \nhope will endure. \n As a new and young Member, Palau has \nshouldered its responsibilities in the community of \nnations, including the deployment of peacekeepers to \nDarfur, Timor-Leste and the Solomon Islands. When \nsigning international conventions and meeting our \ncounter-terrorism obligations, as set forth by the \nSecurity Council, we remember and honour the legacy \nof the United Nations. \n While our political progress has been satisfactory \nsince independence, I must report to you that we are \nnow confronted with several looming threats to our \ncontinued peaceful way of life, and indeed to our very \nexistence. Climate change, environmental degradation \nand the world financial crisis are challenges that we \nwill only be able to overcome if we work with the \ninternational community. \n We associate ourselves with the statements of \nconcern on climate change which we heard in this Hall \nearlier this week. We applaud the commitments made \nand note that we must use our best efforts to stop this \nslow-moving tsunami that threatens to engulf us. To \nthis end, Palau and our neighbours in the Federated \nStates of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands have adopted a joint policy, known as Green \nEnergy Micronesia (GEM) to move to renewable \nenergy as a pillar of our collective energy security. \nFurthermore, Palau has signed the Statute of the \nInternational Renewable Energy Agency, and we look \nforward to the exciting work that will emanate from the \nUnited Arab Emirates. We are hopeful that the \ncombined efforts of all our nations will lead to a \nfruitful outcome in Copenhagen. \n We note in particular the statement of the new \nPrime Minister of Japan, Mr. Yukio Hatoyama. Japan\u2019s \nvision and commitment to save our planet are \ninspiring. This is one of the many reasons we support a \npermanent seat for Japan on the Security Council. \n We reiterate that climate change is indeed a \ncross-cutting issue and that all aspects of it, especially \nthe security impact of climate change, need to be \nexamined. This is why Palau and the Pacific Small \nIsland Developing States initiated General Assembly \nresolution 63/281, on \u201cClimate change and its possible \nsecurity implications\u201d. We look forward to meaningful \naction by the Security Council on that resolution. \n Palauans have lived throughout history in \nsymbiosis with the sea. Now, though, the sea, which \nhas long been the source of our sustenance, is \nsimultaneously rising in rage to destroy us and \nbecoming barren. This fury was caused by abuses by \nhumankind, and we therefore must take every \nnecessary action to allow the oceans to heal \nthemselves. In days gone by, the traditional chiefs of \nPalau would declare a bul \u2014 a moratorium to protect a \nresource that had become scarce. This traditional \nconcept, now popularly known as conservation, shows \nthe way for us to move forward. As Mahatma Gandhi \nsaid, \u201cEarth provides enough to satisfy every man\u2019s \nneed, but not every man\u2019s greed\u201d. \n This is why the world must declare a bul on \ndestructive fishing practices like deep-sea bottom \ntrawling, unsustainable harvesting of shark for their \nfins and overexploitation of tuna stocks. The odious \nfishing practice of bottom trawling, where a weighted \nnet is dragged along the sea floor, crushing nearly \neverything in its path, is contributing to the rapid loss \nof a critical ecosystem, our coral reefs. We have \noutlawed deep-sea bottom trawling in Palau, but, no \nmatter what we do in our own waters, there must be an \ninternational solution. For several years, we, along \nwith our Pacific neighbours, have advocated a \n  \n \n09-52463 8 \n \nmoratorium on this practice. The sustainable fisheries \nresolution adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 \n(resolution 62/177) urged nations and regional fishery \nmanagement organizations to stop trawling in sensitive \nareas by 2009. We have waited for compliance, which \nhas not come, and we now renew our call for a \nworldwide moratorium on this practice. \n An equally destructive fishing practice is shark-\nfinning. We have banned it in Palau and call upon the \nworld to address this issue in order to save sharks from \nextinction. The physical strength and beauty of sharks \nare a natural barometer of the health of our oceans. \nTherefore, I declare today that Palau will become the \nworld\u2019s first national shark sanctuary, ending all \ncommercial shark fishing in our waters and giving a \nsanctuary for sharks to live and reproduce unmolested \nin our 237,000 square miles of ocean. We call upon all \nnations to join us. The need to save sharks and our \nenvironment far outweighs the need to enjoy a bowl of \nshark\u2019s fin soup. \n It is anomalous that Palau is experiencing \neconomic difficulty while it sits in the middle of the \nrichest fishing grounds in the world, the Pacific Ocean. \nWe can no longer stand by while foreign vessels \nillicitly come to our waters to take our greatest \nresource, our tuna stocks, without regard for their \nconservation and without regard for adequate \ncompensation to the island States that own the fishing \ngrounds and rely on this resource. Palau believes that \nthe best model for a regional effort to conserve our \ntuna resources and maximize the benefits to us is the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n(OPEC). I will therefore work for the establishment of \nOTEC, the Organization of Tuna Exporting Countries, \nand I now call on our friends in OPEC to come forward \nand help us to understand and obtain fair value from \nour threatened resource and to make tuna fishing \nsustainable. \n I come now to the economic crisis that my \ncountry is facing. As a developing nation, we are \ngrateful for the grants provided by our allies and \npartners to advance our development. They have been \nhelpful. \n Mr. Mart\u00ednez Bonilla (El Salvador) Vice-\nPresident, took the Chair. \n But we must acknowledge that outright grants do \nnot always create meaningful employment. Jobs \ncreated are illusory and temporary. In the absence of a \nstrong local economy, our children, our most valuable \nresource, are leaving our shores for opportunities \nelsewhere. The continuing downward cycle created by \ntheir departure must be stopped, or else it will destroy \nthe very fabric of our society. Our allies and partners \ncan help us stop this cycle by promoting the \ndevelopment of private enterprise through investment \nin our country. We need capital and entrepreneurial \nexpertise. \n I implore our allies and partners to consider \nproviding incentives to their nationals to encourage \nthem to invest in our islands, to come to our islands \nand launch partnerships with our talented people to \ncreate a viable economy. Let us once and for all put \naside the fiction that we need handouts. What we need \nare partners and investment to help advance our \neconomy, put an end to the out-migration of our people \nand propel Palau towards economic self-sufficiency. \n We note with satisfaction the decision by the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China to invite Taiwan to attend \nthe World Health Assembly. The health and safety of \nthe world\u2019s peoples are at the heart of the ideals of the \nUnited Nations. In order to further promote those \nideals, we recommend that Taiwan be invited to \nparticipate meaningfully in the International Civil \nAviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change coming up \nin Copenhagen and other international organizations \nand forums. \n We have heard the voices of world leaders from \ncountries small and large, powerful and vulnerable. We \nhave heard the voice of science. Let us heed those \nvoices, fulfil our obligations to our people, now and in \nthe next generation, and work for a strong economy \nand a healthy planet."

        "file_text": "I wish to offer my warm \ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-fourth session. We are confident that he will \nlive up to the high standards set by his esteemed \npredecessor. \n Allow me to begin my remarks today by thanking \nmembers of the General Assembly for their positive \n \n \n5 09-52470 \n \naction this past June in adopting resolution 63/281, on \nclimate change and its possible security implications. \nDeveloped and developing countries alike worked \ntogether with the smallest and most vulnerable to do \nsomething that would have been unthinkable just a few \nyears ago. It is now becoming all the more compelling \nthat we work together, as we did in adopting that \nresolution, to act decisively in confronting this threat. \n The importance of this groundbreaking resolution \ncannot be overstated. Its message is clear: climate \nchange is a threat to international peace and security. \nThe resolution is a historic milestone for this body. \nClimate change, including its far-reaching effects and \nits security implications, is the defining issue for the \nworld today \u2014 an issue that should command the \nattention and support of everyone. \n When we met here last year, the world economy \nwas going through a time of unprecedented crisis. \nFearing that the global economy was heading for \ncollapse, the world stood together and, with strong \ndetermination and swiftness, adopted difficult but \nconcrete measures aimed at averting that global \ndisaster. In keeping with the spirit of cooperation, it is \nindispensable for the international community to be \nsteadfast and bold enough to take equally difficult \ndecisions to address the climate change crisis without \ndelay. Accelerating action by and cooperation among \nGovernments, the private sector and civil society is \nimperative in order to meet the challenge posed by \nclimate change.  \n Given the critical importance of climate change \nto my country, allow me to address that issue here \nagain. I thank the Secretary-General for bringing more \nattention to climate change and for convening the high-\nlevel Summit on Climate Change on 22 September \n2009. \n For us Micronesians and our fellow Pacific \nislanders, including those of other parts of the world, \nclimate change is a matter of survival as peoples, \ncultures and nations. For centuries, the people of \nMicronesia have lived on their small islands, many less \nthan a metre above sea level. They have enjoyed a life \ndependent on the bounties of the sea and the harvest \nfrom the land. They have developed a culture of \nrespect for nature and have lived in harmony with their \nnatural surroundings. They built outrigger canoes and \nrigged them with sails from pandanus leaves. Long \nbefore Magellan, they sailed the vast expanse of the \nPacific Ocean, aided only by an intimate understanding \nof the stars and ocean currents.  \n Sadly, today\u2019s disregard for our planet is slowly \nmaking the ocean that has always nurtured us the very \ninstrument of our destruction. Micronesia is already \nexperiencing the brunt of the negative impacts of \nclimate change. The sea-level rise, changing weather \npatterns and an increase in the frequency and intensity \nof natural disasters, such as typhoons, are all \nundermining our development efforts. The years of El \nNi\u00f1o have brought more droughts and increased \nrainfall, causing substantial damage to staple crops. \nOur taro patches and arable lands are limited to begin \nwith. Compounding the problem is the intrusion of salt \nwater, damaging basic crops, including taro and \ncoconut trees \u2014 our tree of life. What if the melting of \npolar ice sheets and glaciers were to reach an \nirreversible point? The outcome is crystal-clear: \nMicronesia and all low-lying islands would disappear \nfrom the face of the Earth. But the effects would go \nmuch further, endangering coastal cities and \ncommunities all over the world, including Manhattan. \n Our vulnerability compels us to take proactive \nconcerted action in seeking fast-track solutions. In that \nregard, I am pleased to share two specific mitigation \nmeasures taken by my Government. \n The first action taken by Micronesia is a proposal \nthat has been submitted to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change \n(UNFCCC). The aim of the proposal is to make a \nmodest beginning to evaluating rapid mitigation \nstrategies by establishing a four-year programme for \nexperts to report on ways to achieve rapid mitigation \nby dealing with short-lived non-carbon dioxide agents, \nincluding black carbon, under the auspices of \nUNFCCC. \n This year, Micronesia and Mauritius proposed a \ntwo-part amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase \ndown the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons \n(HFCs). Secondly, our proposal would expand efforts \nto destroy so-called banks of discarded refrigerants that \nare harmful to climate. Our proposal, with additional \nsponsors, has started a global dialogue on the \ndemonstrated versatility of the Montreal Protocol as a \ntreaty for early climate protection. \n I want to commend the North American countries \nfor their strong support and action on HFCs. Recently, \nthe United States, Canada and Mexico added their \n  \n \n09-52470 6 \n \nsupport to the proposal to use the Montreal Protocol to \nphase down HFCs. That kind of cooperation, between \ndeveloped and developing countries, is what we need. \nWe therefore urge the North American countries and \nothers to support the second part of the amendment \nproposed by Micronesia and Mauritius. \n The bottom line is that Micronesia has already \nsuffered the effects of climate change. We therefore \nseek to draw the attention of the world to any and all \npossibilities for rapid mitigation action that could buy \nus more time while the long-term war against carbon \ndioxide proceeds. \n Allow me now to briefly focus on several other \nareas of priority to my country. To effectively manage \nand conserve our biodiversity and limited natural \nresources, Micronesia continues to work with other \nGovernments in our subregion to meet the \ncommitments of the Micronesia Challenge, which calls \nfor the conservation of at least 30 per cent of the area\u2019s \nmarine resources and 20 per cent of its land resources \nby 2020. We acknowledge the support of our friends \nand development partners who have helped us \nimplement that initiative. \n As part of our national development agenda, \nespecially in the priority areas of health, education and \nprivate sector development, we are seeking to acquire \ncomprehensive broadband connectivity capacity \nthrough undersea fibre-optic cable. That will enable us \nto meet the objectives of the World Summit on the \nInformation Society and the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). We are also taking the necessary \nmeasures to liberalize the environment for \ntelecommunications services in order to promote \ncompetition and to put in place an appropriate national \ninformation and communications technology plan.  \n To achieve those objectives, we look to the United \nNations system, the International Telecommunication \nUnion and our development partners for their support \nand guidance.  \n Micronesia is indeed undertaking a wide variety \nof tasks as it strives to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We recognize that some of the \nGoals can be especially difficult for us to sustain, even \nthough we may be on track to achieve them. Progress \ntowards the MDGs is inherently threatened by the \nnature of our vulnerability to climate change. \n As an island State with a large excusive economic \nzone abundant with marine and fisheries resources, we \nare naturally concerned about unsustainable fishing \npractices. We are also concerned about the unabated \nincidence of illegal, unreported unregulated fishing, \nwhich only robs the coastal island nations of their most \nprecious resource, which is fish. \n At a time when the world food market is deeply \naffected by the food crisis and economic turmoil, \nMicronesians are increasingly dependent on the \nbounties of the sea to provide their nourishment and \ntheir economic development. That is precisely why we \nremain concerned about the collateral catches and \ndiscards in commercial fisheries, as they deprive our \npeople of the critical resources that they depend upon \nfor their subsistence living and that are of cultural \nimportance. The international community must help us \nto find ways to minimize and eliminate that wasteful \nharvesting of resources. Economic resources are \ncritical to successfully implementing our nation-\nbuilding efforts. \n Micronesia has a genuine interest in the reform of \nthe Security Council \u2014 a Council that must embrace \nan expansion in both of its membership categories, to \nbe more inclusive and broadly representative and to \nreflect the present realities of the world in the new \ncentury. We urge the President of the Assembly to carry \nforward the intergovernmental negotiations that were \nbegun during its sixty-third session. I reiterate our \nsupport for the candidacies of Japan, India and \nGermany for permanent membership on the Council. \n December is around the corner and the world \nneeds to seal the deal in Copenhagen. The task will not \nbe easy, but we must not fail. Millions of lives are at \nrisk and our homelands are in peril. \n Micronesia is a member of the Alliance of Small \nIsland States and our position is well known. We have \nrepeatedly called for a strong agreement that must \nleave no island behind. Our collective failure to meet \nthis challenge now will lead us towards colossal and \nirreversible damage to our Mother Earth. \n When the health of our planet needs remedy and \nthe lives of millions depend on our action, we must \nrespond and take appropriate and swift action. I am \naware that different States have different ideas of what \na strong deal means, but mistrust between countries \ncannot become a reason for failure, nor can economic \nconsiderations become an excuse for inaction. \n \n \n7 09-52470 \n \n Throughout the history of humankind, there have \nbeen examples of nations that disagreed coming \ntogether for their own survival during a crisis, be it \nduring a time of war, economic hardship or epidemic. \nToday, that crisis is climate change. There is simply no \nmore time to waste, and I will therefore stop here. Talk \nis cheap; action speaks louder than words. And we \nneed action. Let us go to Copenhagen to seal the deal. \nWe will all meet again in Copenhagen."

        "file_text": "It is a great \npleasure for me to address and greet the General \nAssembly once again from this rostrum in my capacity \nas Prime Minister of Turkey on the occasion of the \ngeneral debate of the Assembly\u2019s sixty-fourth session. \n I would like to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. I also wish to \nexpress my appreciation and thanks to Mr. D\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann for his able and prudent conduct of the \npresidency of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. I \ntake this opportunity also to thank all the Member \nStates for the high degree of trust and approval shown \nto my country in electing it last year as a \nnon-permanent member of the Security Council by a \nwide margin of support. \n \n \n09-52320 32 \n \n The global problems of our age necessitate \nsolutions on a global scale, and we therefore need to \nwork in a determined fashion. From wars to economic \ncrises, from hunger and poverty to terrorism, from \nenergy security to climate change, the problems of our \nworld are extremely challenging. However, none of \nthem is insurmountable. \n If we are to resolve these problems, we need a \nfair and inclusive global order that is based on trust \nand regards diversity as a source of wealth. It is \npossible to make the transition from a conception of \nthe world based on risk and perceptions of threats to \none that is based on trust and solidarity. Indeed, this \nhas become a necessity for all of us. To do so, \nhowever, we need a new kind of leadership. We can \nindeed make the twenty-first century an era ruled by \npeace instead of war; trust instead of fear; justice \ninstead of injustice; tranquillity instead of terror and \nviolence; and prosperity instead of hunger and poverty. \nIt is our common responsibility and historic duty to \nparticipate in the construction of such a world, \nregardless of our differences of language, religion or \nnationality. \n Threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons have become sources of worldwide \nconcern. Problems such as hunger and poverty, the \nincreased frequency of pandemics, food and energy \nsecurity, growing xenophobia and radicalism remain \ngrave challenges. In addition, global warming and the \nfinancial crisis are fundamental issues that demand \nsubstantial solutions. \n Against that backdrop, the relevance and \nindispensability of the United Nations has become \neven more evident. In order to establish a fair and \nparticipatory global order, we must work together to \nenhance the Organization\u2019s efficiency. We certainly do \nnot despair. We maintain our hope that the achievement \nof global peace and stability is within our grasp. We \ntherefore wish to see the United Nations serve as the \nvoice and spokesperson of the global public \nconscience. We believe that a more representative, \ndemocratic, transparent, just and effective United \nNations will be able to make a greater contribution to \nglobal peace and stability. \n The United Nations must become a much more \neffective institution on such matters as climate change, \nsustainable development, the struggle against poverty, \ngender equality and the protection of human rights and \ndignity, and we fully support reform efforts to that end. \nHowever, there is no doubt that the reform of the \nUnited Nations system will be incomplete if not \naccompanied by Security Council reform. I would like \nto underscore once again that Turkey is in favour of \nenlarging the non-permanent membership of the \nSecurity Council. \n Another important aspect of reform that I wish to \nunderline is the need to improve the United Nations \npeacekeeping system. In this context, we want the \nviews and expectations of the United Nations troop-\ncontributing countries, in particular, on such issues as \nearly and effective coordination, capacity-building and \nenhanced cooperation with regional organizations to be \ntaken into full account. \n Turkey continues to be a force for peace and \nstability in its region. Especially in the course of the \npast seven years, we have made every effort to settle \nour problems with our neighbours. Thanks to this \napproach, which we call a zero-problem policy with \nour neighbours, Turkey has made significant progress \nin solving outstanding issues with its neighbours and \nhas greatly improved its bilateral relations. \n The problems of our region have global \nimplications as well. Therefore, our constructive and \npeaceful regional policies serve not only our own \nneighbourhood but also world peace. However, we do \nnot consider those efforts to be sufficient. We seek to \nmove from a relationship of passive good-\nneighbourliness to one of active friendship and \ncooperation. The positive impact of this approach on \nregional and world peace is well appreciated by all our \nfriends in the East and the West.  \n Another concrete example of this approach is our \nongoing dialogue with our neighbour, Greece. Another \ncase in point is our quest to normalize our relations \nwith Armenia, which has gained fresh momentum of \nlate and begun to bear fruit.  \n We also believe that the conflicts and disputes in \nthe Caucasus, including but not limited to the problems \nbetween Armenia and Azerbaijan, are issues that need \nto be resolved. In this regard, we hope that our regional \npartners will share Turkey\u2019s vision for region-wide \npeace, security and stability. We believe that the \nCaucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform, which \nwe launched in the aftermath of the crisis of August \n2008, can make a substantial contribution to efforts in \nthat direction. \n \n \n33 09-52320 \n \n Another issue of great interest to us and the world \nis Iraq\u2019s territorial integrity, political unity and internal \npeace. We attach great importance to the continuation \nof the political dialogue process encompassing all \ngroups in Iraq and the establishment of national unity. \nA clear manifestation of this importance is the \nneighbouring countries process regarding Iraq, which \nwas initiated by Turkey. \n In this connection, I also wish to emphasize the \nsignificance of the strategic dialogue mechanism set up \nbetween Turkey and Iraq, which is important in terms \nof both the fight against terrorism and other aspects of \nour bilateral relations. We are fully committed to \nmaintaining and further developing this process. \n Another area to which Turkey is sensitive is the \nPalestinian-Israeli conflict. In our view, the resolution \nof the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, based on the vision \nof two States existing side by side in peace and \nsecurity, is an indispensable element of regional and \nglobal peace. The achievement of Palestinian national \nunity will expedite the establishment of an independent \nPalestinian State. Turkey has always stood by the \nPalestinian people and will continue to do so.  \n I wish to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the \nfollowing facts. The aggression against Gaza carried \nout at the end of 2008 quickly turned into a human \ntragedy and resulted in the deaths of nearly \n1,400 people, most of whom were women and children, \nas the result of phosphate bombs. Over 5,000 people \nwere injured and the infrastructure of Gaza was \ncompletely destroyed. Even United Nations buildings \nin Gaza did not escape this destruction. Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon personally witnessed the \ndevastation and voiced his reaction. The 575-page \nUnited Nations report on Gaza (A/HRC/12/48), \nreleased on 15 September 2009, clearly confirms this \nfact. \n It has been eight months since the declaration of \nthe ceasefires that ended the hostilities in Gaza and the \nadoption of resolution 1860 (2009). Similarly, six \nmonths have elapsed since the Sharm el-Sheikh \nconference, at which the international community \npledged billions of dollars for the reconstruction of \nGaza. However, I regret to say that the human tragedy \nin Gaza continues.  \n People are living in tents and cannot find \ndrinking water. In the face of this situation, are we \nfulfilling our humanitarian responsibility? What can \nthe United Nations or the Security Council do? What \nmeasures have the United Nations and the Security \nCouncil really enacted? We really must think about that \nbecause the promises made in Gaza have not been \nfulfilled.  \n As at the time of aggression, Gaza has once again \nbeen left to its own devices in the aftermath of the \nheavy destruction it suffered. Currently, the \nimportation of construction materials to Gaza is not \npermitted; only food and medication are allowed to \npass through, and the suffering of the people of Gaza \ncontinues. \n We demand that these obstacles be immediately \nlifted and normalcy restored to Gaza for the sake of the \npeace and security of Israelis and Palestinians alike. \nThe Palestinian question cannot be resolved solely by \nsatisfying the demands of one party alone. The security \nof the Palestinians is as important as the security of \nIsrael. The Palestinian people\u2019s quest for freedom and \npeace is as legitimate as Israel\u2019s quest for stability. \n The settlement of the Palestinian question, which \nis one of the greatest obstacles to regional and global \npeace, will be possible only when everyone is treated \nfairly and equitably. On every possible occasion, \nTurkey has stressed that it is not possible to turn a \nblind eye to the appalling conditions in Gaza, and we \nwill continue to make that point. It is our common \nhumanitarian and moral responsibility to ensure that \nthe tragedy unfolding in Gaza is brought to an end and \nthat an atmosphere of lasting peace is created in the \nregion. \n It is extremely important that the international \ncommunity remain engaged in this matter and inject \nnew vigour and momentum into efforts to resolve the \nproblem. We call on all parties concerned not to remain \nindifferent to this question and not to condone further \nsuffering. \n We also believe that the resumption of the Israeli-\nPalestinian talks, which have been disrupted by the \nGaza conflict, is of the utmost importance. We hope \nthat the peace process will be revitalized as quickly as \npossible. To date, Turkey has made every possible \neffort to contribute to the peace process in the Middle \nEast. The indirect negotiations between Syria and \nIsrael, which we hosted in 2008, are a case in point. \nDepending on the mutual desire of both parties, we are \nready to resume our active role in the future. \n \n \n09-52320 34 \n \n We have always said that our neighbouring \ncountry Syria is a very important country in our region \nand is in a position to play a key role in the search for \nregional peace, security and stability. Lebanon, too, is \nof critical importance to regional stability. Turkey has \nexpended intensive efforts to ensure that a \ncomprehensive political compromise prevails in \nLebanon. We will continue to strongly support \nLebanon\u2019s stability in the future. \n We also believe that the dispute over our \nneighbour Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, which has long \npreoccupied the international community, should be \nresolved through dialogue. Turkey defends the right of \nall countries to benefit from the peaceful use of nuclear \nenergy. On the other hand, we also call on all countries \nto act responsibly and to bear in mind the serious \nconsequences of the proliferation of nuclear weapons \nfor the whole world. In that spirit, we supported the \nadoption of Security Council resolution 1874 (2009), \non North Korea\u2019s nuclear test last May. \n We also closely follow the situation in \nAfghanistan and developments in Pakistan. We support \nthe struggle against extremism by the peoples of \nAfghanistan and Pakistan, with whom we enjoy \nhistorical and brotherly ties. We are maintaining our \ninfrastructure investments in order to help those two \ncountries achieve the prosperity they deserve. The \nministerial-level meeting of friends of a democratic \nPakistan that we convened in Istanbul in late August is \nan indication of the importance we attach to Pakistan\u2019s \nstability and prosperity.  \n I would like to take this opportunity to announce \nthat, in addition to becoming the lead country on \nAfghanistan in the Security Council in 2010, we shall \nalso assume the chairmanship of the Council\u2019s \nCounter-Terrorism Committee. Our strong support for \nefforts to achieve security and stability in Afghanistan \nand to combat terrorism will continue unabated during \nthe course of our performance of those duties on the \nCouncil. \n The Balkans is another region that we follow \nclosely. We believe that the integration of the countries \nof the region into Euro-Atlantic institutions is \nimportant. That perspective should be maintained. \n Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern \nCyprus support efforts to find a comprehensive \nsolution on the island. The basis upon which such a \nsolution should be built is right here under the roof of \nthe United Nations. If all the parties to the current \nnegotiations were to act constructively, it would be \npossible to reach a comprehensive solution by the end \nof 2009. We believe that the Secretary-General should, \nas he did in 2004, play a role in bridging the \ndifferences on which the parties themselves cannot \nagree. \n It should be our common objective to submit the \nsolution to be reached to a referendum in the spring of \n2010, at the latest. However, at this juncture, I would \nalso like to stress that, if a solution cannot be found \ndue to Greek Cypriot intransigence, as was the case in \n2004, the normalization of the status of the Turkish \nRepublic of Northern Cyprus will become a necessity \nthat can no longer be delayed. It is therefore essential \nto realize that negotiations cannot be sustained \nad infinitum, that the current window of opportunity \ncannot remain open forever, and that efforts must be \ndeployed to ensure the success of the process. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \nemphasize once again that a comprehensive solution to \nbe achieved on the basis of established United Nations \nparameters, which will secure the founding of a new \npartnership in Cyprus, will enjoy the open support of \nTurkey as a guarantor Power. A fair and lasting \nsolution in Cyprus will make a major contribution to \nthe transformation of the eastern Mediterranean into a \nzone of peace, stability and cooperation. I call upon \neveryone to do their utmost to help achieve that goal. \n In the meantime, the Turkish Cypriot side is still \nsubject to unfair measures of isolation, despite the fact \nthat in 2004 it accepted all the sacrifices that the Annan \nplan entailed. It is not fair to expect the Turkish side to \npay the price for a lack of a solution. The lifting of \nsuch restrictions on Turkish Cypriots will not only \nremove an unjust practice, but also accelerate the \nprocess of resolution. \n Turkey continues to participate actively in \npeacekeeping operations around the world under the \numbrella of the United Nations, NATO, the European \nUnion and the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe. We also strongly support least \ndeveloped and developing countries in their struggle to \nresolve development problems. \n In addition, as a party to the Kyoto Protocol, \nTurkey is ready to live up to its responsibilities with \nrespect to a vital issue that concerns the future of our \nworld. We support the determined efforts being made \n \n \n35 09-52320 \n \nby the Secretary-General in the process of devising a \nnew climate change regime. \n I should also like to draw the Assembly\u2019s \nattention to another very important issue that poses a \nthreat to our world. We should not forget that each \nculture and civilization flourishes through the \ninspiration provided by the successes of other cultures \nand civilizations. As a matter of fact, our common \nvalues today, as well as our science, law and art, have \nbeen influenced not only by the ancient Greek and \nRoman civilizations, but also by ancient Eastern \ncivilizations. From Al-Khwarizmi, the father of \nalgebra, to Al-Farabi, who laid the foundations of \nmusic; from Ibn Sina, who ushered in a new era in \nmedicine, to Sinan the architect, who produced the \nfinest engineering examples of his time, many Turkish \nand Islamic scholars, men of learning and artists have \nmade significant contributions to the progress of \nhumankind. \n It is therefore essential to regard and understand \ndiverse cultures not as the other, but as individual \nelements of humankind\u2019s cultural inheritance, as well \nas to inculcate that spirit in new generations. That is \nthe philosophy that underlies the Alliance of \nCivilizations, which has become a United Nations \ninitiative that has strengthened its institutional \nstructure under the co-sponsorship of Turkey and \nSpain. I have no doubt that the Alliance will make a \nsignificant contribution. We should ensure that it has a \nmeaningful place in the Organization, as it can make \nimportant contributions to shaping a global civilization \nbased on universal values centred on democracy, the \nrule of law, good governance, human rights, gender \nequality, young people and media. \n In conclusion, I would like to express my hope \nthat the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly \nwill serve the best interests of all humankind, as well \nas the interests of peace."

        "file_text": "I should like to extend \nmy heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki on his assuming the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I \nshould also like to express my respect to His \nExcellency Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for his \nexcellent leadership at the previous session. I also \nhighly commend the dedication and leadership of His \nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in tackling \nthe various challenging issues that the United Nations \nfaces at the present time. \n It was 120 years ago, in 1889, that an electoral \nsystem, while limited, was initiated in Japan. From that \ntime forward, the change of governments through \nelections has been a matter of course in Japan. Japan \nalso enjoyed a period in the early twentieth century \nknown as the Taisho democracy. \n Japan is thus a nation with a solid heritage of \ndemocracy and elections. Since the Second World War, \nhowever, Japan has not experienced changes of power \nthrough the ballot box. Tensions between politicians \nand bureaucrats disappeared. It cannot be denied that \nas a result, Japan\u2019s foreign policy has been somewhat \ndeprived of vitality. \n However, on 30 August this year, the Japanese \npeople finally chose, through a general election, to \nhave a change of power. This is a triumph for \ndemocracy in Japan and a victory for the Japanese \npeople.  \n Last week, on 16 September, I assumed the office \nof Prime Minister of Japan, and thus I stand before you \ntoday. My new Administration embodies the dynamism \nof democracy and will exert all efforts to address both \ndomestic affairs and foreign policy challenges through \nour all-Japan agenda. \n Japan\u2019s membership in the United Nations was \napproved on 18 December 1956. The Prime Minister at \nthe time was Ichiro Hatoyama, my grandfather. At the \neleventh session of the General Assembly, where Japan \nmade its maiden speech, then-Foreign Minister \nMamoru Shigemitsu stated: \n  \u201cThe substance of Japan\u2019s political, \neconomic and cultural life is the product of the \nfusion within the last century of the civilizations \nof the Orient and the Occident. In a way, Japan \nmay well be regarded as a bridge between the \nEast and the West. It is fully conscious of the \ngreat responsibilities of such a position.\u201d \n(A/PV.623, para. 80) \n My grandfather Ichiro, Prime Minister at that \ntime, was an advocate of the concept of \u201cyu-ai\u201d, or \nfraternity. This \u201cyu-ai\u201d is a way of thinking that \nrespects one\u2019s own freedom and individual dignity \nwhile also respecting the freedom and individual \n \n \n29 09-52320 \n \ndignity of others. There is a remarkable resonance \nbetween the concept of the bridge in Mamoru \nShigemitsu\u2019s address and Ichiro\u2019s concept of \u201cyu-ai\u201d, \nor fraternity.  \n Now, 53 years later, here before the very same \nGeneral Assembly, I declare with firm determination \nthat Japan will again play the role of a bridge. Today, \nthe world faces numerous arduous challenges. This is \nnot an easy era by any means, but the new Japan will \nnot turn its back on such challenges. Based upon the \nspirit of \u201cyu-ai\u201d, or fraternity, Japan will make utmost \nefforts to become a bridge for the world, between the \nOrient and the Occident, between developed and \ndeveloping countries and between diverse civilizations.  \n Today, I should like to address the Assembly \nregarding five challenges that Japan intends to take on \nin serving as this bridge. \n The first is seeking measures to respond to the \nglobal economic crisis. While the global economy \nappears to have emerged from the worst stage of the \ncrisis, it is still difficult to predict its future prospects, \nincluding the issue of employment. What Japan must \ndo in this area is, first of all, to revive its own \neconomy. The new Japan has a plan for achieving this. \nChild allowances totalling 5.5 trillion yen per year will \nserve not only as an investment in education but also as \na means of stimulating consumption and addressing the \nlow birth rate in Japan. \n The abolishment of provisional rates on auto-\nrelated taxes will provide tax relief amounting to \n2.5 trillion yen per year and at the same time is \nexpected to enhance the cost competitiveness of \nJapanese industries through the revitalization of the \ndistribution infrastructure. \n On a topic I will return to later, we are setting a \nvery ambitious target to tackle climate change, which \nshould result in the creation of new markets, including \nfor electric vehicles, solar power generation and clean \nenergy businesses. Furthermore, we will ensure stable \npotential for growth through the creation of new \nindustries and new technologies in maritime, space, \nnext-generation information technology and other \nfields. \n By reviewing economic policies through this \nchange of power, Japan is sending a clear signal of the \nforthcoming revival of its economy.  \n The new Japan will also need to respond \nappropriately to globalization. The deepening of \nworldwide interdependence described by the term \n\u201cglobalization\u201d includes aspects of both light and \nshadow. Expanding the light while controlling the \nshadow has become a task on a global scale for today\u2019s \nworld. As we advance the liberalization of trade and \ninvestment, international coordination is necessary to \nforge systems to rein in the issues of poverty and \neconomic disparity \u2014 which are difficult to coordinate \nby simply leaving them to market mechanisms \u2014 and \nexcessive money-making games. Japan will play a role \nas a bridge in international forums, including the \nGroup of 20, towards the formulation of common rules \nto that end. \n The second challenge is to address the climate \nchange issue. As is apparent from the increased \nincidence of extreme weather events, rising sea levels \nand other phenomena, climate change is a danger that \nis already confronting us. Furthermore, efforts by one \ncountry can produce only limited effects. However, due \nto differences in short-term interests between \ndeveloped and developing countries, and among \ndeveloped countries as well as among developing \ncountries, the path towards creating a post-2012 \nframework will be anything but smooth. The new \nJapanese Government has set a very ambitious target \nfor a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 25 per cent \nby 2020, as compared to the 1990 level. \n It has also made it clear that it is prepared to \nprovide more financial and technical assistance to \ndeveloping countries than in the past, in accordance \nwith the progress of international negotiations. This \ninternational commitment is premised on the \nformulation of a fair and effective international \nframework by all major economies and agreement on \ntheir ambitious targets. Japan has announced this \nambitious pledge because it wishes to serve as a bridge \namong countries with varied interests and to preserve \nthe planet for future generations. I would like to appeal \nstrongly to the representatives present today \u2014 let us \nwork together to ensure the success of the upcoming \nCopenhagen meeting. \n The third challenge is that of nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. I welcome the \nprogress being made in the negotiations on nuclear \nweapons reduction between the United States and the \nRussian Federation. I also commend the United \nKingdom and France for their initiatives. It is urgent \n \n \n09-52320 30 \n \nthat all nuclear-weapon States take concrete measures \non nuclear disarmament. There are States currently \nengaged in efforts to develop nuclear weapons. \nFurthermore, there is an increasingly greater risk that \nnuclear materials and nuclear technologies will be \npassed onto terrorists or even actually used. \n In this area as well, Japan has the potential to \nbecome a promoter of nuclear disarmament and to \nserve as a bridge between States possessing nuclear \nweapons and those without them. Japan can speak with \nthe greatest persuasiveness in urging nuclear-weapon \nStates towards nuclear disarmament and non-nuclear-\nweapon States to avoid the temptation to acquire \nnuclear weapons. Japan can do so because it is the only \ncountry which has ever suffered the devastation of \natomic bombs and, as such, has never ceased to appeal \nfor no more Hiroshimas and no more Nagasakis. Japan \nhas also continued to maintain its three non-nuclear \nprinciples, despite its potential capability to acquire \nnuclear weapons. \n In April this year in Prague, President \nBarack Obama articulated a vision of a world without \nnuclear weapons, inspiring people throughout the \nglobe. I am one of those people. In order to ensure the \nsuccess of the Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \nto be held next year in May, we must take action now \ntowards the early entry into force of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the early \ncommencement of negotiations on a fissile material \ncut-off treaty. \n Here, I must touch upon the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea. Its nuclear tests and missile \nlaunches are a threat to the peace and stability not only \nof the region, but also of the international community \nas a whole, and cannot be condoned under any \ncircumstances. It is imperative that the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea comply fully with the \nrelevant Security Council resolutions and that the \ninternational community implement these resolutions. \n Japan will continue its efforts to realize the \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula through the \nSix-Party Talks. Japan seeks to normalize relations \nwith the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, in \naccordance with the Pyongyang Declaration issued by \nour two countries, through the comprehensive \nresolution of the outstanding issues of concern with the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, including the \nabduction, nuclear and missile issues, as well as by \nsincerely moving beyond the unfortunate past. \n In particular, regarding the abduction issue, \nconstructive actions by the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea, including swiftly commencing a \nfull investigation as agreed last year, will be an avenue \ntowards progress in relations between our two \ncountries. If the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea takes such constructive and sincere actions, \nJapan is ready to respond positively. \n The fourth challenge is posed by issues related to \npeacebuilding, development and poverty. Even in the \ntwenty-first century, the world has not been liberated \nfrom the problems of poverty, infectious diseases, \nhealth, education, water and sanitation, food and illegal \ndrugs. The situation is particularly serious in \ndeveloping countries. \n I am also compelled to point out the unfortunate \nreality that fragile or failed States can become breeding \ngrounds for terrorism. The global economic crisis that \nbegan last year has exacerbated the situation. The new \nJapan should also become a bridge in this area. Japan \nwill work in partnership with international and \nnon-governmental organizations and strengthen its \nassistance to developing countries in terms of both \nquality and quantity. \n\n Japan intends to continue and strengthen the \nTokyo International Conference on African \nDevelopment process, and redouble its efforts towards \nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \nand the promotion of human security. \n For the stability and reconstruction of \nAfghanistan, Japan has provided assistance in a broad \nrange of fields, such as strengthening the security \nsector, including through assistance for police, and \ndeveloping social infrastructure. Japan has also \nextended agricultural assistance and capacity-building \nsupport, including vocational training, through the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency, its aid \nimplementation agency. \n Japan will proactively support Afghanistan\u2019s own \nefforts to ensure its stability and reconstruction, in \nconjunction with the international community. It goes \nwithout saying that the primary actors in achieving \npeace in Afghanistan and in advancing national \n \n \n31 09-52320 \n \nreconstruction are the people of Afghanistan \nthemselves. \n As progress is made, the reconciliation and \nreintegration of insurgents will become critical issues. \nJapan will make vital contributions in these areas, \nincluding possible reintegration assistance, such as \nvocational training aimed at providing a means of \nlivelihood to people who have undergone \nreconciliation. The stability of the surrounding region \nis also important, and Japan is steadfastly providing \nsupport for Pakistan and other countries in the area. \n In the world in which we now live, national \nsecurity and human security are becoming increasingly \nintertwined. The path forward that will save humanity \nis one which can bring about shared security in which \nvarious nations, ethnicities, races and religions coexist \nwhile acknowledging the differences among them. In \nother words, it is to bring about shared security through \nthe principles of yuai, or fraternity.  \n The fifth challenge is to build an East Asian \ncommunity. Today, there is no way that Japan can \ndevelop without deeply involving itself in the Asia and \nPacific regions. Reducing the region\u2019s security risks \nand sharing in one another\u2019s economic dynamism, \nbased on the principle of open regionalism, will result \nin tremendous benefits not only for Japan but also for \nthe region and the international community. Given the \nhistorical circumstances arising from its mistaken \nactions in the past, Japan has hesitated to play a \nproactive role in this region. It is my hope that the new \nJapan can overcome this history and become a bridge \namong the countries of Asia. \n I look forward to an East Asian community taking \nshape as an extension of the accumulated cooperation \nbuilt up step by step among partners who have the \ncapacity to work together, starting with fields in which \nwe can cooperate \u2014 free trade agreements, finance, \ncurrency, energy, the environment, disaster relief and \nmore. Of course, Rome was not built in a day, so let us \nseek to move forward steadily on this, even if at a \nmoderate pace. \n In closing, I would like representatives to recall \nthat the United Nations is the forum in which bridging \ndiplomacy is made manifest. In resolving various \nissues of international peace and stability, development \nand the environment, among others, the United Nations \nhas an immense role to play. I intend to make greater \nuse of the Organization and to work to enhance the \neffectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations as a \nwhole. \n I firmly believe that Japan has the capacity to \nplay an even greater role in the United Nations, and \nabove all at the Security Council, as a bridge between \nvarious countries. Japan will continue to participate \nactively in the intergovernmental negotiations on \nSecurity Council reform, pursuing the expansion of \nboth permanent and non-permanent membership and of \nJapan\u2019s permanent membership in the Council. This \nconcludes my message from the new Japan."

        "file_text": "This session of the General \nAssembly offers further opportunity to reflect on how \nbest to reconcile what at times mistakenly appears to \nbe irreconcilable: socio-economic development and a \nhealthy environment. Leaders, experts and citizens the \nworld over ask how we can grow our economies and \nspread prosperity to more of the world\u2019s citizens, yet \nnot degrade our oceans, rivers and the air we breathe? \n But these are also times of extraordinary \nscientific, technological and business innovations that \ncan help address those challenges, if we have the \ncourage to put into proper perspective and indeed \nharmonize our national, regional and global priorities.  \n \n \n09-52320 10 \n \n History is replete with illustrations of how \nnations immersed in crises changed the underlying \nassumptions by which they acted, created new \ninstitutions and tools to solve problems and emerged \nfrom the process as stronger societies. While those \ninnovations are always different, the challenges to \nsurmount the crises are always the same: forging a \nshared vision, increasing the social capital required to \nenhance predictability, having trustful relations \nbetween peoples, being receptive to doing things in \nnew ways and adopting an explicit moral purpose in \norder to achieve common goals. \n We have an exceptional opportunity to \nsimultaneously address our environmental challenges, \nimprove our economies and reform our global \nmultilateral institutions for better global governance. \nFor example, the Group of Twenty (G-20) is now \nplaying a crucial role in restoring global economic \nstability. But should we not even broaden the base to \ninclude many nations that are most vulnerable to the \ndecisions of the few? All nations should be part of \nthose important discussions and decisions, because \nthey have valuable contributions to make. This is the \ntime to embrace true multilateralism.  \n We in developing nations appreciate the \ncorrective measures taken by the G-20 and the Group \nof Eight to accelerate global economic recovery. But it \nis evident that most of their proposals fall short of the \nconcrete steps needed to address challenges that are \nspecific to low-income countries. \n Multilateralism has always been the key tenet in \nforging a fairer international community based on \nequitable global governance. The United Nations itself \nis based on that very sound and tested principle, and \nthat should be the practice. The rise of worldwide \nnetworks of trade, industry, prosperity and social \nvalues, together with the creation of multilateral \ninstitutions to guide and harmonize those processes, \nhas no doubt contributed to a fairer and improved \nglobal decision-making system. That is what needs to \nbe rendered more inclusive. \n Improving global governance has also to address \ninternational justice. International justice should be fair \nto all \u2014 rich and poor, strong or weak. We are all \npleased to note that at its sixty-third session the \nGeneral Assembly undertook to examine \ncomprehensively the issue of universal jurisdiction. We \nlook forward to the resolutions on that matter during \nthe Assembly\u2019s current session.  \n It is also fitting that we recognize the recent \ncreation of a single entity within the United Nations to \nadvance the work on women\u2019s rights and gender \nequality. Rwanda has always made that one of its \npriorities and has achieved good results.  \n With regard to socio-economic challenges in our \nEast African Community region, we are making \nprogress in key areas. For instance, we are preparing to \ninaugurate, in January 2010, the East African Common \nMarket to facilitate greater trade, investment and the \nfree movement of almost 130 million people. We \nbelieve that there is no better strategy for mitigating \neconomic difficulties than building larger regional \nmarkets that bring about improved productivity, which \nincreases purchasing power and, in turn, strengthens \nour societies. \n With regard to the global environmental \nchallenge, this session of the General Assembly \nprovides an important platform for preparing for the \nCopenhagen climate change summit. Every nation \nshould have co-equal status and be considered a \nconcerned nation at the forthcoming summit. That \nimplies that each nation has both rights and obligations \nand should be open to burden-sharing according to its \nability. This is the time to address in a timely fashion \nsuch key issues as how much the industrialized \ncountries are to reduce their emissions of greenhouse \ngases, how much the developing countries are to limit \nthe growth of their emissions, and how to finance and \nsupport strategies to conserve energy, mitigate risk and \nbuild green technologies that counteract the impact of \nclimate change in the developing world. \n We in Rwanda have been making a modest but \nproportionate contribution by, among other things, \nhosting African preparatory meetings for the \nCopenhagen summit in order to encourage a strong and \nessential African voice at that critical meeting. We \nhave also been actively implementing national \nenvironmental policies for reforestation, terracing and \nthe rehabilitation of wetlands that supply lake and river \nsystems in our country, to name a few areas in which \nwe have had good results. \n On the matter of peace and security, the world \nfaces a number of regional threats. The Great Lakes \nregion has its share of peace and security problems, but \nwe continue to make significant progress in \n \n \n11 09-52320 \n \nfundamentally addressing that question. The leaders of \nthe region recognize that, most crucially, home-grown \nsolutions, beginning with a joint regional effort, can \nbring about sustainable peace. It is in that context that, \ntogether with our colleagues and neighbours in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, we are dealing \nwith the root cause of instability in our area, namely, \nthe negative forces that have been a menace since \n1994. \n If history teaches us anything, it is that we cannot \napply the same strategies to different problems and \nexpect satisfactory outcomes all the time. We have to \nthink differently on the fundamental questions, \nincluding the urgent imperatives of, first, strengthening \nthe future of all nations by fostering economic growth \nand development while investing in the environment. \nThat should be our moral purpose. Secondly, we must \nimprove peace and stability in all regions by learning \nfrom, and supporting, legitimate regional actors. \nFinally, we must engage and embrace the majority \nworld in terms of multilateralism in decision-making, \ntrade and prosperity.  \n These should be our shared vision. Future \ngenerations will then know how leaders of nations in \nthe year 2009, immersed in crises, focused on the most \ndifficult challenges, including the global economic \ncrisis, climate change and greater peace and security, \nand how they acted with resolve."

        "file_text": "I extend our gratitude to the \nSecretary-General for continuing to spearhead the work \nof the United Nations at a time when our membership \nis beset by historic challenges. \n I am told that it is only what one says from the \nrostrum that is reflected in the record of the meeting. I \nhope that perhaps in the future, we can change the \nsystem. If we do so, we may be able to say more \nwithout spending a lot of time at the rostrum. So I shall \ncirculate the full text of my speech and focus on only \ntwo areas that I think are important at this point in \ntime. The first has to do with the financial crisis and its \nimpact on the Caribbean, and the second concerns the \nclimate change crisis.  \n In the case of the prevailing financial crisis, the \nsmall, vulnerable economies of the Caribbean have had \nto bear the brunt of global recession. That has \nmanifested itself both through depressed prices for \nprimary exported commodities, such as bauxite, and \nthrough depressed demand for services, such as \ntourism. The result has been losses in export and \nforeign currency earnings, with attendant dislocation of \nexchange rates and Government revenues, exacerbating \nan already tenuous fiscal and debt situation and \ncausing the loss of jobs and welfare and a reversal of \ngains previously made against poverty. \n Even as we seek long-term solutions to bolster \nthe resilience of our economies, the need for relief and \nsupport is immediate. The capacity of the small \ncountries of the Caribbean to respond with \n  \n \n09-52425 12 \n \ncountercyclical measures is virtually non-existent, with \nno available fiscal space and levels of indebtedness \nthat are among the highest in the world. The case is \ntherefore compelling for the global community to \nrelieve and restructure the debt of these heavily \nindebted vulnerable small countries, including those \nthat were not previously considered for debt relief \nbecause of their income levels, but whose debt ratios \nare clearly unsustainable by any standard. \n The case is equally compelling for new additional \nflows of development assistance to be delivered to \nthese countries by both multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment partners. Despite injections of large \namounts of additional resources into some of the \nmultilateral institutions and the approval of new \nfacilities by those institutions, very little has actually \nmaterialized in terms of additionality in disbursements \nto smaller States. This needs to be corrected urgently if \nwe are to avoid the perception that there is an absence \nof concern at the global level for the needs of smaller \ncountries. \n My fear is that, as the crisis abates, so too will \nthe will to change the global financial architecture. \nTherefore, we are advocating urgent action in this area, \nand we are also saying that this solution \u2014 a new \nglobal financial architecture \u2014 must involve smaller \ncountries in its articulation. Our fear is that, if we \ncontinue along the same path, we will have a new \narchitecture that caters only to the concerns of the large \ncountries \u2014 now expanded to the Group of 20 \u2014 and \nthat the smaller countries will not see their concerns \nreflected in it. That is why, last year, I called for a new \nBretton Woods-type conference at which all the \ncountries in this Hall would help to create that \narchitecture.  \n The second crisis that I wish to mention is that of \nclimate change. This week, there has been much talk \nabout the urgency of tackling climate change. Thanks \nto the vision exhibited by the Secretary-General and \nthe work of leaders and citizens from countries across \nthe world, the level of understanding about the nature \nof the climate challenge is increasingly clear. \n But we need to move beyond simply \nunderstanding the challenge. We need to work as a \nglobal community to shape a solution that is in the \ninterests of all countries, and many of the building \nblocks that will enable us to do this have been \nidentified. The challenge for the Copenhagen meeting \nis to turn these building blocks into an agreement that \ncan start to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n In doing so, we should be guided by science and \nby the need for solutions that treat all countries fairly. \nBut we also need to recognize that the challenge now is \nas much about political will as it is about scientific, \neconomic and institutional considerations. In \naddressing the politics, we need to recognize that in all \ncountries \u2014 developed and developing \u2014 there are \nconcerns about the commitment of others to the long-\nterm global partnership we need. Many developing \ncountries question whether the international \ncommunity will commit to the scale of financial \ntransfers that all major analyses agree are needed. \nOthers are worried that acting on climate change now \nwill stymie their national development, precisely at a \ntime when many are poised for historic levels of \neconomic growth and social advances. \n On the other hand, many developed countries are \nworried that the financial transfers needed will be an \nexcessive burden on their budgets during extremely \nchallenging economic times. Domestic constituencies \nin the developed world are also fearful about \ntransferring significant sums of money abroad, and \nthey worry that jobs or investment will be driven away \nfrom their economies. There are also fears from \nindividual countries that they will be expected to carry \na greater burden than other developed nations. These \npolitical concerns could be a recipe for a stalemate that \nthe world cannot afford. Failure to overcome them now \nwill mean misery for future generations, and the \neventual costs of tackling climate change will be even \ngreater than they are now.  \n We therefore need to find a way through. This \nwill require leadership from all nations. I welcome the \nproposals laid out by Gordon Brown, and subsequently \nsupported by the European Union, to generate funding \nin excess of $100 billion per annum to address climate \nchange in the developing world. For the first time, \nthere is a proposal that starts to square up to the \nmagnitude of funding that is required for adaptation \nand mitigation. \n Having spoken with many of my fellow leaders \nthis week, I am confident that, with the right signal \nfrom the developed world, developing countries are \nready to play their part. Of particular urgency will be \nfinding ways to work together to address the 17 per \ncent of greenhouse gas emissions that result from \n \n \n13 09-52425 \n \ntropical deforestation and forest degradation globally. \nAs with climate change in general, we now have a \nlarge degree of clarity around the nature of this specific \nproblem. We know that it causes more emissions than \nthe entire European Union, and we know that this is \nbecause the world economy makes trees worth more \ndead than alive. We also know that the only sustainable \nway to address the problem is national-scale action in \nforest countries coupled with international incentives \nthat place a value on trees to make them worth more \nalive than dead. \n We now need to rapidly move from constantly \nrearticulating this problem towards putting in place \nworkable solutions. In Guyana, we remain ready to \nplay our part, and we have launched our low-carbon \ndevelopment strategy, which sets out how we can place \nour entire forest under long-term protection, not only \nto provide the world with badly needed climate \nservices, but also to move our economy onto a long-\nterm, sustainable low-carbon development path, where \njobs are created across our country in sectors that do \nnot threaten our trees. \n Thanks to the visionary leadership of the Prime \nMinister of Norway, our two countries are also \nworking together to provide a functioning model of \nhow low-deforestation and low-carbon economies can \nbe created in countries such as ours. \n In parallel, Guyana continues to play its part in \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC) process, which must provide the \nlong-term framework for combating forest-based \nemissions through the United Nations Collaborative \nProgramme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation \nand Forest Degradation in Developing Countries \n(REDD) or the REDD+ Programme. But we also \nbelieve that the world can move quickly to slow down \ndeforestation starting now, not in 2013. Guyana was \npleased to participate in the April G-20 side meeting \nthat addressed how this can happen. We support the \nproposals made by the informal working group on \ninterim financing for REDD, which was set up after the \nG-20 side meeting. We support its report, which lays \nout how the world can achieve a 25 per cent reduction \nin global deforestation rates by 2015 with an \ninvestment of less than \u20ac25 billion in total.  \n Using highly conservative estimates of forest \ncarbon, this could lead to seven gigatons of greenhouse \ngas emissions being avoided between now and 2015. If \nthis occurred, it would be the single biggest \ncontribution to averting climate catastrophe over this \nperiod. And it can be done. Rainforest countries \nrepresenting the vast majority of the world\u2019s tropical \nforests have worked with the informal working group \nand are willing to act. The question now is: Will the \ndeveloped world understand the enormous potential \nthis offers our world, and will it act to generate the \nfinances that are needed? \n The sum of money needed for this interim period \nmay seem large, but it does not only represent a very \ngood value for money abatement solution; it can also \ngenerate significant financial flows for developing \ncountries, it can create alternative livelihoods for \nindigenous peoples and other forest-dependent \ncommunities, and it can preserve the enormous \nbiodiversity present in the world\u2019s forests. \n Twenty-five billion euros over five years \nrepresent less than 1.5 cents per citizen per day in \ndeveloped countries. It is a fraction of what the world \nhas generated to save the financial system from \ncollapse, it provides a bridge to a long-term REDD+ \nsolution under the UNFCCC, and it buys the world \nbadly needed time in the race to defeat climate change. \nTo turn away from making this proposal a reality \nwould be a mistake of historic proportions. \n I have just said to President Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas that I \nwish I could conclude by singing, but I do not have his \nwonderful voice. Instead, I will confine myself to \nsaying that we all have an important role to play in \nsolving this crisis, but the developed world has a moral \nobligation to play a greater part in solving both the \nfinancial crisis and the climate change crisis, because it \nis due to its actions that we are in this situation. I hope \nthat the developed world recognizes this obligation and \nthe urgency to act upon it now. "

        "file_text": "This \nGeneral Assembly Hall is, in fact, the situation room of \nthe entire world. It seems to me that over the years we \nhere in this Hall have collectively understood and \nknown what to do. The main thing now is to agree how \nto do it. We all need an effective tool. \n There is hope that we are already close to a \ncommon understanding of how and with what tool we \ncan achieve our goals. For the international community \nto emerge from a series of multiple crises and to \novercome multidimensional new threats, we must \nachieve a policy of partnership. Modern international \nrelations are increasingly being built on the basis of \nhorizontal networks that include all interested and \nconstructive stakeholders in today\u2019s world \u2014 States, \ninternational organizations, civil society and the \nprivate sector. Partnerships are a mechanism of \nengagement that has no reasonable alternative in the \ncontext of a pluralistic and contradictory world. \n One particular political factor that raises hope \nthat that approach is a realistic instrument is an \nemerging meeting of minds \u2014 involving various forces \non different continents \u2014 that see in partnerships a link \nby which one can extend the chain. By way of \nillustration, I will cite the example of the call of \nBelarus, from this rostrum two years ago, for systems \nbased on opposition and confrontation to become new \ninternational ones based on engagement and \npartnership (see A/62/PV.11). A year ago, when \nopening the sixty-third session of the General \nAssembly, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon noted, \n \u201cNations can no longer protect their interests or \nadvance the well-being of their peoples without \nthe partnership of other nations.\u201d (A/63/PV.5, \np. 1) \nThis year the United States declared its readiness to \n\u201cbuild partnerships and solve problems that no nation \ncan solve on its own\u201d. The European Union has also \naddressed the General Assembly with the same \nmessage of cooperation and partnership. The President \nof Russia spoke from this rostrum about a \u201ccollective \nagenda for unification\u201d () dictated by life \nitself. \n After a long break it seems that the international \ncommunity is starting to think along the same lines on \nsecurity, partnership and development and that the \nworld\u2019s political leaders are beginning to speak the \nsame language \u2014 that of common sense. \n An important proof of the principled readiness to \nwalk the path of partnership is the efforts of the \n20 largest world economies to combine their resources \nto lead the world out of the global economic crisis. We \nwelcome in that connection recent meetings of some \nregional economic and political groups of States. On a \nless positive note, it should be noted that some aspects \nof the agreements reached remain to be carried out by \nthe parties, for example, the rejection and removal of \nprotectionist measures in international trade. It should \nbe said that the Group of Twenty format \u2014 let alone \nthe Group of Eight \u2014 is too narrow to be considered a \nrepresentative partnership. In this regard, engaging \neconomic regional groupings of States with significant \npotential, for example in our region \u2014 the Eurasian \nEconomic Community \u2014 would make the format more \nrepresentative. \n We also believe there is great potential for \ndialogue and partnership between the Non-Aligned \nMovement (NAM) and other major centres of power, \nas was discussed recently at the recent summit of the \nNon-Aligned Movement in Egypt. After all, today the \nMovement represents a significant international factor. \nIts members make tangible contributions to \ninternational security and are important actors on the \ninternational socio-economic stage. \n Today I address my colleagues from the European \nUnion, the United States, Russia and other developed \ncountries and call upon them to show leadership in \ndealing with the unprecedented global challenges \nthrough close partnerships and coordination with all \nmembers of the international community, including \nBelarus. Members of the international community, \nespecially the world\u2019s power centres and leading \npolitical groups, should give practical effect to their \ngood intentions by developing global partnerships and \ncrisis strategies. \n The greatest potential for responding to global \nthreats and challenges is clearly here in the United \nNations. As a founding member of the Organization, \n  \n \n09-52592 36 \n \nBelarus is convinced of the ability of the United \nNations to play a leading role in generating \npartnerships to overcome the most acute global \nproblems. \n Was it not under the aegis of the United Nations \nthat the foundation was laid for the establishment of an \nanti-terrorism coalition and elaboration of a counter-\nterrorism strategy after the tragic events of \n11 September 2001? And by the way, should the United \nNations not consider proclaiming 11 September as the \nday of the fight against terrorism? We would be \ninterested in hearing States\u2019 reactions to this idea. Have \nnot the achievement of the General Assembly in \nestablishing the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment been acknowledged worldwide? The \nMillennium Development Goals were also formulated \nin the context of a global partnership for development. \n United Nations capacities have been strengthened \nby some of the progress made in reforming the \nOrganization. In this regard I note, in particular, a new \npositive element, namely, the thematic debates in the \nGeneral Assembly. \n Bearing in mind the experience and potential of \nthe United Nations, Belarus has proposed the \nestablishment of a global thematic partnership against \nhuman trafficking and slavery in the twenty-first \ncentury. An informal mechanism on the topic initially \ntook shape at the Global Forum to Fight Human \nTrafficking in Vienna in February 2008. It must be \ninstitutionalized to work effectively \u2014 I stress \ninstitutionalized, not bureaucratized \u2014 through the \nelaboration and adoption by the General Assembly of a \nglobal plan of action to combat human trafficking. \n The idea for such a plan garnered wide support in \nMay during the thematic debate in the General \nAssembly. We have also heard expressions of support \nfrom high ranking participants in this general debate. \nWe welcome the recent decision by the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session to appoint \nthe Permanent Representatives of Cape Verde and \nPortugal as facilitators of the consultations on the \nglobal plan. We call on all our partners and friends to \nengage actively in this work. \n Global economic development is always driven \nby certain engines, which are replaced by new and \nmore effective ones. For example, coal and steel were \nengines for the European industrial revolution; the \nengine for the global economy after the Second World \nWar was oil, which was replaced by information \ntechnologies in the 1990s. The economic engine of the \npast decade was finance. It is absolutely obvious that \nthe global crisis has demonstrated the need to replace \nthe outdated financial engine. What can and should \nreplace it? We believe there will be not just one engine \nfor the future, but a number of elements that include a \nleading role for clean, green technologies. Given the \nincreasing interdependence of energy and environment \nand the determining role of energy in global survival, it \ncannot be otherwise. \n This year we face an especially momentous task: \nelaboration of new post-Kyoto agreements to deal with \nglobal warming that include universal introduction of \nnew and renewable energy sources. This issue was \ndiscussed in depth at the thematic dialogue of the \nGeneral Assembly held in June 2009. That was a good \nbeginning, yet we must move decisively forward. The \nincreasing topicality of the energy and environment \nagenda requires creation of a specific partnership \u2014 a \nglobal mechanism to improve the access of developing \ncountries and countries with economies in transition to \nnew and renewable energy sources. \n This issue must not be shelved. We need to lay \nthe foundations for a qualitative breakthrough at this \nsession of the General Assembly. Belarus will initiate a \ncomprehensive study of this issue with the involvement \nof leading international experts and include in its \nresults conclusions and recommendations for the future \nreport of the Secretary-General. We believe that, given \ncurrent conditions, the strengthening of the economic \npotential and political role of middle-income countries \ncould be yet another motor of economic and social \nprogress. \n Experience has clearly shown that resources and \ncapacities of a narrow circle of traditional world \nleaders are insufficient for overcoming the crisis. The \ngreatest potential for growth rests with middle-income \ncountries. To a certain extent, one could draw a parallel \nhere with the key role played by the middle class in the \nstable economic and political development of States. It \nis no coincidence that the majority of United States and \nEuropean companies are turning their eyes to the Asian \nand other developing world markets. \n Mindful of such importance, let alone the mere \nnumerical strength of this group of countries, which \nincludes more than 100 States, the United Nations \nsystem must take an active role. With this idea in mind \n \n \n37 09-52592 \n \nlast year, Belarus, together with its partners, sponsored \nthe adoption by the General Assembly of a resolution \non cooperation for development with middle-income \ncountries. \n This year, for the first time within these walls, a \nsubstantive discussion was held on how to make the \nbest use of the capacity of the United Nations system \nto assist such countries in addressing their specific \nsocial and economic problems, which are particularly \nimportant for sustainable global development. \n We hope that the work of the General Assembly \non that topic will not be seen simply in terms of \ncompetition for the scarce resources of the donor \ncommunity and the United Nations. That is not the \npoint. The larger the number of economically \nprosperous States in the world, the stronger and more \npredictable the world economy will be. There will be \nincreased predictability and fewer crises and \ncatastrophes. There will be more opportunities for \neconomic growth in the poorer countries and an \nincrease in international assistance will be generated. \nIn the long run, everyone will be a winner. \n I cannot but turn to the subject of Kyoto and post-\nKyoto, which sets the tone for the current session of \nthe General Assembly. The possible outcome of the \nCopenhagen meeting is, unfortunately, not quite clear. \nAll of us, big, medium-size and small States, have to \ndo our utmost to ensure its success. But the perfect \ndoes not have to be the enemy of the good. \n Belarus is the only State in the world that, for \nseveral years, has been trying to achieve what may \nseem, at first glance, to be a paradoxical goal. That is, \nto take on significant commitments to reduce harmful \nemissions. The commitments we have taken happen to \nbe more significant than many of our neighbours, and \neven than those of some European Union countries. \n Since we are all partners here, I will put it in a \nblunt and straightforward way. We do not understand \nwhy many States, including powerful groups of States, \nwhich are, by the way, leading the way in post-Kyoto \nadvocacy, do not allow us to assume legally binding \nand significant Kyoto commitments. I address this call \nto partners and colleagues. If we want to strengthen the \nKyoto paradigm, let us not undermine it. I sincerely \nhope that the call of Belarus for speedy ratification of \nour accession to Kyoto will be heeded. \n In a year\u2019s time, here in New York, there will be \nthe 2010 United Nations Summit. That is the only \nforum that has united the heads of State and \nGovernment of the G-8, the G-20, the European Union, \nthe Non-Aligned Movement, the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States and others. Belarus proposes \nconsidering the 2010 Summit as a summit of \npartnerships, the venue for putting forward and acting \nupon the ideas of global partnerships. \n We support the intention of the President of the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly to start \npreparations for the Summit well in advance. At the \nSummit itself, we propose the adoption, at the level of \nheads of State and Government, of a mechanism, an \nalgorithm or a plan of close cooperation on the part of \nMember States for the years to come on how to \novercome global challenges. And in the next few \nmonths, delegations could make suggestions as to the \nsubstance of such a document. Negotiations on the \ndocument could start in January 2010. \n Sixty-five years after the signing of the United \nNations Charter, we can and should make an \nhonourable attempt to return to the roots of the United \nNations by restoring the original meaning of the word \n\u201cunited\u201d, which forms part of our name. It all depends \non us. "

Our Organization remains as \nrelevant today as when it was established 64 years ago. \nIts status as the world\u2019s pre-eminent body will be \ndiminished if we as leaders do not accord it the respect \nour Organization deserves and observe its etiquette. \n Recent crises have not only validated our global \nsustainability, but highlighted our interconnectedness \nand interdependence. These crises, from those in food \nand energy security to the global recession and \npandemic, have adversely affected all Member States \nto varying degrees. Although they have resulted from \nthe decisions and actions of a few, the crises have not \ndifferentiated in impact between developed and \ndeveloping countries or between the rich and the poor. \nThe costs of these crises in terms of human suffering \nand social upheaval have been considerable, and \njustifiably required the collective and concerted global \naction that now seems to be working with a good \ndegree of success. \n \n \n19 09-52586 \n \n These crises are eminently solvable and short-\nterm when compared to the great and grave threat the \nworld faces from environmental degradation and \nclimate change. This week\u2019s summit of the Alliance of \nSmall Island States and the Secretary-General\u2019s high-\nlevel meeting both underscored the predominance and \nurgency of the climate change challenge.

The full cost \nsociety must bear is becoming a stark reality that we \ncan no longer ignore today. \n Climate change is not a concern of small island \ndeveloping States alone. Our vulnerability to climate \nchange should not absolve those responsible for its \ncauses in the past or now, nor should it be used to shift \nthe burden of leadership and responsibility away from \nthe main carbon emitters. Developed and emerging \neconomies will all be affected one way or another. \nSadly, the human and financial costs will be borne \ndisproportionately by small island developing States. \n A Copenhagen climate pact is therefore a must. It \nrequires a new brand of cooperation and a broad \noutlook. The narrow pursuit of self-interests and the \nuse of economic and political expediencies should be \nset aside and must not be allowed to derail the goal of \nconcluding an ambitious and binding agreement. \nClimate change is also everyone\u2019s job. While \nacknowledging historical responsibility is legitimate, \nallowing it to get in the way of making decisions to \nreach a comprehensive agreement would be a grave \nmistake. Reaching a climate change agreement is \ntherefore a test of multilateral solidarity.  \n Time is running out. The impacts of climate \nchange are getting worse daily. Playing the blame-and-\nshame game, or waiting to be led but not being willing \nto lead, are no longer options. For no single nation, no \nsingle group of nations and no single organization can \nwin the war against climate change on its own. The \ndivergent yet inextricably linked interests of Member \nStates demand that we seal a deal in Copenhagen. \n The cost of adaptation and mitigation at the \nnational level can be prohibitive because most of our \npeople and infrastructure are found along the coastal \nareas. Relocating them inland would be costly due to \nour rough and rugged terrain and the number of people \ninvolved. However, that has not deterred us. Using our \nresources and by partnering with the international \ncommunity, we continue to support the global effort to \nbuild our resilience against climate change. Our \nplantation access roads programme is one such \ninitiative. It facilitates relocation and helps boost \nagricultural production as a response measure to \nclimate change and to food security. \n The shadow of the financial crisis envelops us \nstill. As with climate change, most developing nations \nare victims forcibly drawn into the maelstrom of the \ncrisis through its consequential impact on the global \neconomy. Although remote from the epicentres of the \ncrises, our small and vulnerable island economies have \nnot been spared. Indeed, it has been acknowledged by \nthe Group of 20 that the global recession impacts the \nvulnerable and poorest countries disproportionately. \nInternational acceptance of the collective responsibility \nto provide assistance to help those countries mitigate \nthe impact of the global recession has also been very \nimportant. \n That undertaking to provide assistance is simply \ncritical for small and open economies like that of my \ncountry. The global recession has contracted our small \neconomy, and our narrow Government revenue base \nhas taken some hard hits that have made it impossible \nto provide on our own the kind of stimulus package \nthat would meaningfully mitigate the impacts of the \nrecession, let alone reignite growth in the economy.  \n In the circumstances, the effective assistance \nneeded by our economy at this time is direct budgetary \nsupport, which should be necessary only for the short \nterm to sustain expenditure, allow us breathing space to \nrebalance our finances, and put the economy back onto \nthe path of growth. We acknowledge with appreciation \nthe readiness of our development partners and of \ninternational financial institutions, such as the World \nBank and the Asian Development Bank, to \nsympathetically consider our requests in that regard. \n Samoa will graduate from the list of least \ndeveloped countries in December 2010. The \nintervention of the financial crisis was unanticipated \nand not taken into account when the decision was made \nto advance our country to the transitional period. An \nextension of the transitional period is therefore both \nnecessary and justified. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nwill be reviewed next year. Our scorecard on all eight \n  \n \n09-52586 20 \n \nGoals gives us guarded optimism, although meeting \nevery one of them in the time frame allowed remains a \nchallenge. Our needs are not matched by the resources \nat our disposal. Hence, central to our efforts to realize \nthe MDGs is the implementation of Goal 8 on \nachieving durable global partnerships for development. \nBut some aid donors either take their time to respond \nor do not do so at all. That is cause for justifiable alarm \nbecause if they are not forthcoming with relatively \nmodest resources to help us achieve the MDGs, then \nthe prospects for an effective global response to \nclimate change will all but vanish. \n The Pacific is a region of relative peace. We have \nbeen spared the scars of war and conflict, and nature \nhas gifted us the sea and land for our livelihood. While \nwe have challenges and differences, they tend to be \nlocalized. Our development needs, individually and \nregionally, are modest by world standards. However, \nbelying that tranquillity is our acute economic \nvulnerability. \n Given our credentials as a region of relative \nstability with needs that are not as large as those of \nother parts of the world, one would expect the \ninternational donor community to be jostling for \nopportunities to assist our development efforts. On the \ncontrary, that has not been borne out in the general \nexperience of the region. Some development partners \nseem unconcerned as to where and how their \ndevelopment aid is spent; whether it is in war-torn, \ndevastated and unstable regions or as a front to support \nmilitary-related industries at home appears to be of no \nconsequence. Then, there are those who engage in \nposturing and rhetoric that are devoid of tangible or \nreal action on the ground. \n Sustainable partnership is based on mutual trust \nand respect. That has been the foundation of Samoa\u2019s \nrelationship with our main development partners: \nAustralia, China, the European Union, Japan and New \nZealand. All have supported us and continue to do so at \nevery step of our development journey. Italy, Austria \nand Turkey are our newest partners, assisting in the \nrenewable energy field, and we would like to engage \ncountries at the cutting edge of renewable energy \ntechnology, such as China, Germany, Japan and the \nUnited States, to assist us in that key sector.  \n The One United Nations Initiative is a timely \nproject that reduces the costs and improves the \nefficiency and effectiveness of aid delivery by the \nUnited Nations system. Resources saved through that \nInitiative should flow back to benefit Member States. \n A permanent solution to the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict continues to be an elusive goal, and seems a \nlost cause. President Obama\u2019s relaunching afresh this \nweek of the stalled Middle East peace talks will \nhopefully be the catalyst that brings about renewed \nimpetus in achieving a secure State of Israel living \nalongside a Palestinian State. \n Mr. Christian (Ghana), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n International terrorism is a global menace. It \ncreates an atmosphere of collective fear and \nintolerance. It preys on the innocent, vulnerable and \ndefenceless and disrupts any progress towards peace \nand development. Terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations should always be condemned \nunreservedly. Individual actions by States cannot in \nand of themselves provide a solution. We must \nshoulder our responsibility to act together to meet the \nthreat through concerted multilateral action, which \nunderpins the spirit of our Organization. \n Wars are futile and serve no useful purpose. They \nwill not end unless disarmament, nuclear \nnon-proliferation and illicit small arms and light \nweapons are brought under effective control. The task \nof building peace lies with every nation. That is why \nwe welcome the decision by the United States to move \nforward with the ratification of the Comprehensive \nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We remain hopeful that the \nTreaty will enter into force soon. \n The United Nations cannot survive unless it \nconstantly adjusts and adapts to changing times. After \n18 years, Security Council reform has finally entered \nthe intergovernmental negotiating process. Samoa \ncontinues to support the expansion of the membership \nof the Council in both the permanent and \nnon-permanent categories. Countries such as Japan \nhave the credentials to assume permanent member \nstatus. \n United Nations peacekeeping operations around \nthe world have brought relief and hope to victims in \nconflict areas. Samoan civilian police officers are \ncurrently serving in three peacekeeping missions side \nby side with officers from other Member States. In our \nown region, Samoa is a contributor to the Regional \n \n \n21 09-52586 \n \nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands under the \numbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum. \n Let me conclude by wishing the President well in \nthe formidable challenges facing his presidency. When \nnations stand united and firm in pursuit of the goals of \nthe Organization\u2019s Charter, the world can look to the \nfuture with confidence."

        "file_text": "I bring very warm greetings \nfrom the people of Ghana. Allow me to join previous \nspeakers in congratulating the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session on his election. \nHis long distinguished service to his country and to \nAfrica gives us confidence that we are in experienced \nand capable hands. I also wish to express my \ndelegation\u2019s appreciation to his predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for the \nable manner in which he presided over the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session.  \n Last Monday, 21 September, Ghana celebrated \nthe centenary of the birth of an illustrious son of Ghana \nand of Africa, our first President, Mr. Kwame \n \n \n09-52320 4 \n \nNkrumah, under whose leadership Ghana became a \nMember of the United Nations on 8 March 1957, only \ntwo days after achieving independence. We recall \nMr. Nkrumah\u2019s declaration before the General \nAssembly on 23 September 1960 that the United \nNations was the only organization to hold out any hope \nfor the future of mankind. At the same session, he \ncalled for the reform of the Security Council in order to \nbring it in line with a rapidly changing world. Those \nviews were expressed almost 50 years ago, but they \nremain relevant.  \n Then, as now, Africa faced a deep crisis, with \nprofound and far-reaching implications for \ninternational peace and stability. Today, the combined \neffects of climate change, high food and energy prices \nand the current financial and economic crisis threaten \nto erode the modest but hard-earned economic growth \nand democratic achievements of the past two decades. \nAfrica remains volatile, and violent conflicts still \npersist. Therefore, it is my humble proposal that we all \nsupport the United Nations and its regional allies, such \nas the African Union, in living up to those and to the \nother pressing challenges facing the international \ncommunity.  \n While we acknowledge that globalization has \nexpanded and accelerated economic interdependence \namong States, the truth is that the benefits for many \ndeveloping countries have been negligible. Indeed, the \neconomies of many developing countries have not been \ntransformed in any significant manner. Despite almost \na decade of impressive growth of about 5 per cent, only \na few countries have been able to reduce the proportion \nof their population living on less than $1 per day. \nConsequently, most of those countries remain \nvulnerable to the various external shocks that continue \nto pose threats to their growth. \n In fact, over-reliance on high commodity prices \nand mineral exports has not lessened, but rather \nexposed structural impediments to food security. That \nis particularly true of sub-Saharan Africa, where the \nongoing world financial and economic crisis threatens \nto erode decades of modest growth, and thereby make \nthe Millennium Development Goals unattainable in any \nmeaningful way.  \n Ghana, therefore, reiterates its support for global \nintegration that ensures inclusive and equitable \ndevelopment and also leads to a substantial reduction \nin poverty, including full and productive employment \nand broad access to social services. \n A number of developing countries have adopted \nvarious measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis on \ntheir economies, including interest rate reductions, \nrecapitalization of financial institutions, trading \nreforms, and increased liquidity to banks. Ghana has \nalso exercised fiscal restraint in response to the crisis, \nby cutting out all low-priority public spending and \nshifting the balance from recurrent expenditure to \ninfrastructure investment. \n In addressing the impact of the crisis on their \neconomies, African countries would like to see the \nfollowing: rich countries making a greater effort to \nmeet existing commitments on aid and debt reduction; \nthe acceleration of disbursements and improved access \nto existing financial facilities; the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) being urged to put in place a \nnew facility with relaxed conditions to help African \ndevelopment during this crisis period; a capital \nincrease for the African Development Bank to enable it \nto scale up its interventions in support of African \ndevelopment; the sale of IMF gold reserves to release \nmore resources to help African development during \nthis period; and finally, the issuance of new Special \nDrawing Rights. \n International trade carries enormous potential for \npoverty reduction and alleviation as well as for driving \neconomic growth so that millions of our people can be \nlifted out of the quagmire of poverty. The ongoing \nDoha Round of trade talks promises, at least in \nprinciple, to improve market access for poor countries. \nThis commitment, in our view, is very important, \nespecially in low-skill and labour-intensive sectors \nsuch as garment manufacturing, from where most \nAfrican exports come. \n Sustained economic growth requires that poor \ncountries increase their exports to rich countries. \nUnfortunately, the current system of trade \ndiscriminates against poor countries, hinders their \nparticipation in the global economy and damages the \nearning potential and opportunities of rural \ncommunities in those countries. \n These developments do not work in the interest of \nour developing countries. Indeed, trade-distorting \nsubsidies, as well as tariff and non-tariff barriers \ninstituted by most advanced countries, discriminate \nagainst African products. Developing countries, \n \n \n5 09-52320 \n \nincluding Ghana, though we accept that liberalization \nis, indeed, required, believe that liberalization must be \naccompanied by predictable access to markets, \nelimination of the abuse of anti-dumping measures as \nwell as the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers. \n In the face of all these developments, we in \nAfrica acknowledge and recognize that all our efforts \nto achieve social and economic development will not \nyield much result unless we demonstrate our \ncommitment to good governance. In spite of the \ndifficulties and challenges, I can say without fear of \ncontradiction that, leaders across the continent have \nembraced democratic values, except in a few cases \nwhere narrow self-interests are threatening the \ncommendable gains that we have made in the past \ndecade. \n We are also confronted with the grave risks to \nenvironmental, social and economic development \nposed by climate change. The need for concrete, timely \nand decisive measures to enable us to deal with this \nlargely man-made problem is obvious, and meeting \nthat need must not be deferred any longer. \n As we proceed to the United Nations Climate \nChange Conference scheduled for December 2009 in \nCopenhagen, the issue of financing mitigation and \nadaptation to climate change in developing countries \nwill remain central to the deliberations. In fact, \nprogress on these issues will be crucial in determining \nany outcome in Copenhagen. \n The intrinsic link between security and \ndevelopment has been generally recognized by the \ninternational community. Despite the pivotal role \nplayed by the United Nations in identifying the threats \nconfronting the international community and \nmarshalling the necessary international support to deal \nwith those challenges, humanity\u2019s hope and aspiration \nfor a peaceful and prosperous world are weakened by a \nlitany of unfulfilled promises and failures. \n Rather than being discouraged by these \nshortcomings, we in Ghana are unwavering in our \nconviction that, though daunting, the challenge to the \ncommunity of nations could be surmounted through \ninnovative, bold, and achievable measures. \n Peacekeeping operations have played a pivotal \nrole in the Organization\u2019s efforts to fulfil its core \nmission of maintaining international peace and \nsecurity. Ghana, as one of the oldest and most \nconsistent troop-contributing countries, deems it a \nmatter of privilege and honour to be associated with \nthis success story of our Organization. We equally \nacknowledge that increasing demands have placed \nfurther strain on an overstretched system. \n It is for this reason that we applaud and renew \nour support for the reform process that is in place and \nalso acknowledge the fruitful dividends that have come \nout of it, even though we admit that much more needs \nto be done if we are to achieve our objectives.  \n Ghana cannot but commend the growing \ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \norganizations. We call for its intensification to enable it \nto take advantage of the cooperative strength of the \nUnited Nations and regional organizations in a \nmutually complementary manner. \n Next year marks the fifteenth year since the \nadoption, at the Fourth World Conference on Women, \nof the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action. In view of the \nhuge gap between policy and practice and the \nunyielding progress in implementing that international \nconvention on gender equality and the empowerment \nof women, it is our suggestion that we need to take a \ncoherent, integrated and multisectoral approach to this \nproblem. \n Over the years, Ghana has demonstrated its \ncommitment to implementing in an accelerated manner \nthe goals of the Beijing Platform for Action, and we \nhave done so by adopting concrete administrative, \nlegal and constitutional means. Our efforts have \nyielded some measure of success, as clearly testified to \nby the appointment of our first female speaker of \nparliament, the first female attorney-general, and quite \na number of female ministers and deputy ministers.  \n At its sixty-third session, the General Assembly \nadopted resolution 63/194, urging us to improve our \nefforts and join the international initiative against \nhuman trafficking and for the protection of victims. We \nin Ghana concur with those who view the elaboration \nand adoption of a United Nations global plan of action \nas an effective and practical way to give life and effect \nto the international initiative against this despicable \ncrime. It is our expectation that the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session will make \nthis an urgent and priority issue. I can assure him of \nGhana\u2019s commitment and support. \n \n \n09-52320 6 \n \n In conclusion, I note with regret that conflicts, \nparticularly in the developing world, have robbed us of \nan opportunity to improve the circumstances of our \npeoples. Indeed, it is well known that sustainable \ndevelopment can only be achieved in an international \nenvironment characterized by peace and stability. \n We in Ghana therefore want to take this \nopportunity to renew our commitment to the ideals of \nthe United Nations and to fulfil our Charter obligations \nby joining together with other Member States to assist \nthe United Nations in playing its role in the \nmaintenance of international peace and stability and in \nthe promotion of fruitful international cooperation. We \nare convinced that the United Nations remains the ideal \nmultilateral instrument for achieving international \npeace and security and promoting fruitful international \ncooperation. I would therefore want all of us to \nstrengthen our resolve and muster the necessary \npolitical will to assist the United Nations to more \neffectively discharge its obligation to redeem our \npeoples from war, disease and poverty. \n We in Ghana have pledged to build a better \nGhana. We therefore want to assist the United Nations \nto build a better world. May God bless us in all these \nefforts."

        "file_text": "I should like to \nwarmly congratulate Mr. Treki on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. We express our readiness to work with him to \nachieve the ambitious agenda ahead of us during this \nsession. I should also like to extend our thanks to \noutgoing President Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for his \nhard work during the previous session. \n Each new session of the General Assembly \nprovides an opportunity for us to share our \nachievements and concerns with each other, and to join \nour efforts in moving the global agenda forward. We \nare going through a truly challenging period. In the \npast year, we were all devastated by the impact of the \nfinancial crisis. The crisis left no corner of the world \nand no economic sector untouched. Many countries \nexperienced unprecedented economic decline, which \nseriously challenged their hard-earned advances and \nprospects for attaining the Millennium Development \nGoals by 2015. Armenia was not spared the dramatic \neffects of the ongoing financial crisis. However, the \nArmenian Government has done best to safeguard the \nsocially vulnerable. No budget cuts have been made in \nthe social sector. \n We believe that our endeavours must be guided \nfirst and foremost by the need to mitigate the human \ncosts of the crisis in order to avoid serious \nconsequences for human security. We believe that an \nequitable global recovery requires the full participation \nof all countries, irrespective of their size and level of \ndevelopment, in shaping appropriate responses to the \ncrisis. And we have to come together here, in this \nuniversal body, to take decisions that will help us \novercome the past and build for the future, because \nthere are still painful gaps separating the dreams of our \npeople and their prospects. \n In accordance with their respective mandates, the \nUnited Nations funds, programmes and agencies have \nan important role to play in advancing development in \naccordance with national strategies and priorities, and \nin assisting countries in achieving the internationally \nagreed Millennium Development Goals. We understand \nthat achieving these goals, the deadline for which is \n2015, will require enormous efforts. The General \nAssembly will continue to address this issue during its \nsixty-fourth session, and Armenia is ready to contribute \nto the preparatory process for a high-level meeting on \nthis topic in September 2010. \n We have embarked on the process of United \nNations reform in order to ensure that this forum can \n \n \n13 09-52604 \n \nbetter reflect present-day realities and to enhance its \ncapabilities and effectiveness in addressing modern \nchallenges. Armenia commits itself to strengthening \nthe institutional capacities of the United Nations, \nsupports the process of United Nations reform and is \nready to make its contribution. \n We have successfully agreed on several vital \ndecisions, including the creation of the Peacebuilding \nCommission and the Human Rights Council. We aspire \nto further advance the protection of human rights, in \nconformity with the obligations of Member States, and \nwe see honest discussion within the Human Rights \nCouncil on outstanding issues and the sharing of \nexperiences on how to overcome them as the true path \nto success in this respect. \n We regard the prevention of genocide and the \nresponsibility to protect as the key principles and \ncornerstones of the overall human security system. In \nthis respect, we commend the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on implementing the responsibility to protect \n(A/63/677), which charts a course for the United \nNations to prevent genocide, war crimes and ethnic \ncleansing by bolstering the capacities of the \nOrganization.  \n As is rightly stated in the report, genocide does \nnot happen all of a sudden. The instigators propagate \nintolerance and hatred, preparing the ground for \nviolence. As survivors of genocide, we Armenians \nwelcome all efforts to prevent and combat racist and \nxenophobic attitudes. We have done and will continue \nto do all we can to provide for continuous advocacy in \nfavour of the prevention of genocide. The international \ncommunity must be vigilant to the development of \nsuch situations and events, and demonstrate its ability \nto act in a timely fashion to prevent future tragedies. \n We consider achieving the goals of disarmament \nand non-proliferation to be major elements of global \nand regional security systems. We must shoulder our \nresponsibilities and work towards not only \nnon-proliferation and the elimination of nuclear \nweapons, but also the elimination of the militaristic \naspirations of some States. It is totally unacceptable \nthat threats to resolve disputes by military means are \nmade at the highest level, and that they are left \nunchallenged by the international community. \n The Nagorny Karabakh peace process, which is \nmediated by the co-chairs of the Minsk Group of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE), is moving forward. The Presidents and \nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of Armenia and \nAzerbaijan meet regularly to discuss the principles of a \ncomprehensive resolution of the conflict. Armenia is \nconvinced that, in order to create an opportunity for \nprogress in the peaceful settlement of the Nagorny \nKarabakh conflict, the parties should commit to \nrefraining from taking steps that could hamper \ndialogue and the peace process.  \n Azerbaijan consistently misrepresents the essence \nof the Nagorny Karabakh problem in the international \narena, as it did two days ago in this forum, trying to \ndownplay ethnic cleansing and its policy of violence \nagainst the people of Nagorny Karabakh. The \ninternational community will recall Azerbaijan\u2019s open \naggression, large-scale hostilities and war against \nNagorny Karabakh, in which it was also aided by \nmercenaries closely linked to terrorist organizations. \nThese events ultimately claimed lives of tens of \nthousands of civilians. \n We believe that there is a serious basis for the \nsettlement of the Nagorny Karabakh problem if the \nprovisions contained in the declaration signed by the \nPresidents of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia in \nNovember 2008; the declaration of the Ministers for \nForeign Affairs of the co-chair countries of the OSCE \nMinsk Group; and the declaration adopted by the \nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of all 56 OSCE member \nStates in Helsinki in December, are met. Pursuant to \nthese documents, the parties must commit themselves \nto the peaceful settlement of the problem through \nnegotiations based on the Madrid principles of the \nco-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group. \n The basic principles around which negotiations \nare currently being held are anchored in benchmark \ncodes of international law as incorporated in the \nCharter of this Organization, the Helsinki Final Act and \nother relevant international documents. The \ninternational principles of the non-use and non-threat \nof use of force, of the self-determination of peoples \nand of territorial integrity are equally viable.  \n Some have long attempted to downplay the \nimportance of the notion of the self-determination of \npeoples as a second-rate principle in the system of \ninternational law and as inferior to that of territorial \nintegrity. I have to disappoint the advocates of double \nstandards. The right to self-determination is an \nunconditional clause of international law; it is a \n  \n \n09-52604 14 \n \nprinciple of liberty and of the freedom of any people to \nchoose its future and fate, and to defend its collective \nrights whenever those rights and that future are \njeopardized. If self-determination were a principle \ninferior to territorial integrity, there would have been \nonly 52 Member States of the United Nations, instead \nof the current 192. \n Trust and accountability among neighbouring \nStates are guarantees of sustainable cooperation and \ndurable security in any region. We in the South \nCaucasus have yet to witness that. Our region, in fact, \nis among the most sensitive hot spots on the world\u2019s \npolitical map, overloaded with a plethora of security \nthreats and challenges. The region is devastated by \nconflicts and inter-State tensions, dividing lines and \neconomic blockades. Closed borders and ruptured ties \nhave become the norm of life.  \n However, a courageous act and a courageous \nresponse hold the promise of changing the situation for \nthe better. The process of the normalization of \nArmenian-Turkish relations was begun in September \nby the President of Armenia, Serzh Sargsyan. That \ninitiative on his part \u2014 known as football \ndiplomacy \u2014 promises to bear fruit despite all \ndifficulties. Over the past year, with the help of our \nSwiss mediators and other international partners, we \nhave made progress towards opening our shared \nborder, one of the last closed borders in Europe, and \nthe normalization of our relations with no \npreconditions. We trust that the necessary political will \nshall finally overcome the mentality of the past and \nthat the wisdom and courage necessary to taking the \nlast decisive steps will prevail.  \n We have been most encouraged by the support of \nthe international community. We are well aware of the \nfundamental and positive implications of the \nnormalization of Armenian-Turkish relations and of the \nopening of the border for the security and stability of \nthe region. \n We must reinforce the bridges between United \nNations Member States, working out mutually \nbeneficial and comprehensive security and cooperation \nplans. Our common objective should be the shaping of \nan environment that is safe and prosperous for all. To \nmeet the political, economic, environmental and social \nchallenges, we have to jointly muster our efforts, \nresources and political determination. Only together \ncan we successfully confront these challenges and push \nforward the international development agenda."

        "file_text": "\nNothing is created without men; nothing lasts without \ninstitutions. Those words of Jean Monnet, one of the \nfounders of the European Union, remain as true as \never. Security, climate change and some effects of \nglobalization are challenges that all our countries face. \nThat is why a global approach, with the United Nations \nplaying a central role, is needed. But the United \nNations must earn that central role. As President \nBarack Obama said here (see ), we cannot \ncomplain, on the one hand, about the so-called \nunilateral action of the United States while at the same \ntime expecting it alone to solve all the world\u2019s \nproblems.  \n In that spirit I would call for a new multilateral \ncommitment, as the reform of international institutions \nis crucial in order to enhance their legitimacy, \nrepresentativeness and capacity for action. Nothing is \ncreated without men; nothing lasts without institutions. \nFrom now on, those institutions should work \nefficiently, starting with the United Nations. It is \nessential to move ahead rapidly on the reform of the \nSecurity Council and of the functioning of the General \nAssembly. \n Indeed, there is an urgent need to improve the \nefficiency of our own operations. A glance at the \norganizational chart of the United Nations allows us to \nsee not only the overlaps but also the gaps in the \nsystem. It is out of commitment to the Charter of the \nUnited Nations that Belgium, one of the founding \nMembers, strongly appeals for more rigour and \ntransparency in the management and budget of the \nUnited Nations in order to better use its limited \nresources.  \n In addition to the fragmentation of the United \nNations system, two other trends reveal the need for \nenhanced multilateral commitment. The first is the \nmultitude of regional and subregional organizations \nalmost everywhere in the world. It is true that this \nmultitude enhances international cooperation, but \nregional and international organizations sometimes \nlack harmonization. Better cooperation should \nhenceforth allow the optimal use of the resources of \nall. \n The second trend can be summed up by the words \n\u201cimperfect multilateralism\u201d. Countries get together on \nan informal basis to discuss international issues, for \nexample \u2014 and this is very pertinent \u2014 the economic \nand financial crisis. These informal groups may, \nparticularly at first, expedite the decision-making of \ninternational multilateral organizations, but they cannot \nreplace those organizations themselves because \nmultilateralism cannot be exclusive. Rather, it should \n  \n \n09-52592 26 \n \nbe inclusive and transparent. Nothing can last without \ninstitutions, but even the best organized institutions \ncannot function in the absence of inspiration and \nhuman will. Even the best organized institutions are \npowerless when men prevent them from working.  \n The economic and financial crisis has been given \na great deal of attention, which is only natural. The \ncrisis most severely affects developing countries. It is \nnow more important than ever that donor countries \nmeet their official development assistance objectives of \n0.7 per cent of the gross national product. Belgium \nplans to achieve that goal in 2010. \n The worst international disorder is violence \nbetween States and within States. Within some States, \nviolence continues to kill, maim and rape millions of \npeople. The worst international disorder is reflected in \nthe wars, civil conflicts, inter-ethnic fighting and harsh \nrepression that deprive millions of people of a decent \nexistence. This is our first and foremost challenge \nbecause without peace and security there is no \ndevelopment, let alone sustainable development. \nWithout peace and security, there can be no fair \ndistribution of the wealth of our Earth. \n As stipulated in the preamble of the Constitution \nof UNESCO,  \n \u201csince wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the \nminds of men that the defences of peace must be \nconstructed\u201d. \nIndeed, conflict prevention begins with the banishment \nof all hate speech attacking the dignity of human \nbeings, nations and communities, or the right of States \nto exist. Far too often, we have witnessed bloodbaths \nprovoked by incitement to hatred. Such speech has no \nplace in this Hall or in this Organization, whose \nprimary mission is precisely to promote peace and \nsecurity through constructive cooperation. \n To function efficiently, our multilateral \ninstitutions need leaders and representatives of States \nwho share basic approaches established on the core \nbelief in the unique dignity of each human being. \nNational sovereignty implies responsibility. That is \nwhy Belgium wholeheartedly supports the principle of \nthe responsibility to protect. The principle requires \nGovernments to safeguard their citizens against \ngenocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes \nagainst humanity. Incidentally, Belgium would like to \nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his excellent \nreport on this topic (A/63/677) and fully supports his \nefforts in this area. \n It is civilians, and women and children in \nparticular, who are often the primary victims of \nviolence and of indescribable and unacceptable \nsuffering. Indeed, women constitute half of the world\u2019s \npopulation, but too often we forget that human rights \nalso fully apply to them. In situations of war and \nviolence, women are frequently twofold victims \nbecause of the sexual violence inflicted upon them. My \ncountry is therefore determined to pursue its action \nagainst sexual violence and any kind of violence \nagainst children. \n Wars are caused by men, not by weapons. \nNonetheless, the arms control issue has to be high on \nthe international agenda. That is why Belgium \nwelcomes the meeting of the Security Council at the \nhighest level on the subject of non-proliferation and \nnuclear disarmament (S/PV.6191). That meeting was \nundoubtedly a highlight of this week. Resolution \n1887 (2009), adopted yesterday, represents, in our \nopinion, a milestone for a world free of weapons of \nmass destruction. \n However, unfortunately, the latest news from Iran \nseems to be heading in the opposite direction. My \ncountry therefore endorses the very urgent call on Iran \nand North Korea to cooperate with the international \ncommunity and respect the Security Council \nresolutions that pertain to them. If they do not, they \nwill be ostracized by the international community. \n At the same time, the fight against the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction should \nnot make us overlook conventional weapons, which \ncurrently kill on a massive scale. In particular, I refer \nhere to anti-personnel landmines. The Convention that \nprohibits these weapons entered into force in 1999, and \nBelgium hopes that it will be strengthened at the \nReview Conference scheduled to take place in \nCartagena, Colombia, in early December. With respect \nto that Convention, Belgium, along with Thailand, will \nhead the Standing Committee on Victim Assistance and \nSocio-Economic Reintegration. Furthermore, Belgium \nhas spared no effort to push for the conclusion of the \nConvention on Cluster Munitions. \n Human rights in all their aspects are a major \nconcern for Belgium. That is why my country plays an \nactive role as a member of the Human Rights Council. \nIn that regard, I would like to thank the members of the \n \n \n27 09-52592 \n \nCouncil that entrusted my country, Belgium, with the \nresponsibility and honour to preside over that \nimportant institution. That trust is, in my view, a \nrecognition of our commitment. \n Finally, human rights also concern the rights of \nfuture generations. We do not own this Earth; we have \nit on loan from our children. Today more than ever, \nthat heritage is threatened, and that is why \nenvironmental protection should be our main shared \nconcern and priority. The Climate Change Conference \nscheduled for late 2009 in Copenhagen is an \nopportunity that cannot be squandered. We need to \nmake specific and binding commitments there. I \nbelieve that the European Union has shown the way \nwith its ambitious package of measures adopted in late \n2008. \n Institutions cannot function without the input of \nmen. Therefore, those who undermine the performance \nof these institutions should be held accountable. That is \nwhy Belgium has been particularly active in the fight \nagainst impunity. An international legal order is \nrequired, but it can function only if it is upheld by \nStates governed by the rule of law. I therefore reaffirm \nthe need for common positions that are essential for a \nworld that is safer, fairer and more prosperous. In the \nwords of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan,  \n \u201cThere is no long-term security without \ndevelopment. There is no development without \nsecurity. And no society can long remain secure, \nor prosperous, without respect for human rights \nand the rule of law.\u201d (Press release \nSG/SM/10425) \nStrengthening the rule of law at the national and \ninternational levels is more vital than ever for \nachieving a more equitable form of globalization. \n I will conclude with these words. Peace and \nsecurity, sustainable development, and a fair \ndistribution of the wealth of the Earth are the essential, \nglobal challenges that we face. To meet these \nchallenges, we need solid international institutions, but \ninstitutional multilateralism is not enough. We also \nneed a multilateralism of minds, and men and women \nof conviction to carry it forward.  \n This will, belief and ambition motivate my \ncountry, a founding Member of the United Nations, to \noffer the candidacy for the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session of our compatriot \nLouis Michel, former Minister for Foreign affairs of \nBelgium and former European Commissioner in charge \nof Development and Humanitarian Aid. We are \nconvinced that the strength of his conviction and \ndedication will unite us further. It is indeed only when \nthe men and women who take the floor here are fired \nby a shared vision of human rights, peace and \ndevelopment that our institutions will be able to deliver \nwhat we need: collective results rather than individual \nachievements."

        "file_text": "It is my \npleasure at the outset to convey the best wishes of the \nGovernment and people of the Sudan for successful \ndeliberations in the sixty-fourth session of the General \nAssembly on its entire agenda. The agenda contains \ntopics reflecting the challenges faced by the \ninternational community and the priorities we have to \nset, such as the development and welfare of our \npeoples, the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), the mitigation of \neconomic and financial crises, containing the effects of \nclimate change and maintaining international peace and \nsecurity. \n I am also pleased to extend warm congratulations \nto Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at this important \nsession. We are confident, Sir, that your political skills \nand diplomatic expertise will help realize our \nambitions to have an able, effective and transparent \nUnited Nations. We also wish to commend the \ndexterity and high competence with which your \npredecessor, Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, conducted \nthe proceedings of the previous session. We also wish \nto commend the Secretary-General for the efforts \nundertaken by the Secretariat to fulfil the role and \nresponsibilities of the United Nations. \n Millions throughout the world look forward to \nour deliberations in the wake of the suffocating crises \nthrough which the international community is passing. \nTraces of the crises are still lingering in the family of \nnations, especially in the developing countries, while \nthe fruits of scientific and technological progress \nnourish the hope of better opportunities for a just and \nequitable world order. \n While non-compliance with the purposes and \nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and \ninternational law and its established rules, along with \ndouble standards, has made the world less safe, the \neconomic and financial crises have exacerbated the \nchallenges. The world is experiencing the worst and \ngravest economic and financial crisis since the \nDepression of the 1930s. The crisis is compounded by \nsuch numerous and intertwined problems as the food \ncrisis and climate change along with their destructive \neffects on the developing countries and threats to their \nnational priorities and to the gains they have made \ntowards the achievement of the MDGs. \n In its chairmanship of the Group of 77 and China, \nthe Sudan has accorded special attention to the \nrepercussions of this crisis on the developing countries. \nIn those countries the crisis has given rise to poverty, \nhunger, unemployment and slackening of growth, if not \neconomic downturn, and has adversely affected \nbalances of trade and of payment. At the same time, the \ncrisis has led to falls in commodity prices, sharp \nfluctuations in exchange rates, sudden diversions of \n  \n \n09-52598 30 \n \ncapital flows and of foreign direct investment, falls in \nremittances and drops in tourism revenues. \nConcomitantly, the social sector has suffered greatly \nbecause of the erosion of social security networks that \nprovide health, education and other services. That in \nturn has augmented infant and maternal mortality rates. \n The Group of 77 and China is deeply concerned \nover this crisis and its impact on countries facing \nspecial challenges, foremost among which are African \nStates, the least developed countries, small island \nStates and countries emerging from conflict. The \nrealities impose a moral duty on us \u2014 especially the \nindustrial countries \u2014 to channel our collective \nresponse into a strong commitment to providing the \nrequired solutions. Those include direct funding, \ncapacity-building, promoting sustainable development, \naddressing debt problems, eliminating obstacles to \ntrade and investment and States meeting their \ninternational development pledges. \n Comprehensive reform of the international \nfinancial and economic system and ensuring an \nenhanced role for the developing countries in decision-\nmaking processes in international financial institutions \nare of central significance. Major industrial countries \ncannot ignore the universal legitimacy of the collective \nvoice of the world\u2019s States here at the United Nations. \nIn this connection, the open-ended working group of \nthe General Assembly to follow up on the issues \ncontained in the Outcome of the Conference on the \nWorld Economic and Financial Crisis and Its Impact on \nDevelopment (resolution 63/303, annex), held in New \nYork in June 2009, must discharge its work and \nmandate expeditiously. \n By the same token, we hope that endeavours to \ndeal with climate change in the course of the \nconference to be held in Copenhagen in December of \nthis year will be crowned with success. The developing \ncountries \u2014 which were by no means responsible for \nclimate change and global warming \u2014 urge \nindustrialized countries, on the basis of their historic \nresponsibility, to address the root causes of climate \nchange by providing new and additional predictable \nfinancial resources, to help build capacities, to transfer, \nentrench and develop technology and to fulfil relevant \nobligations and pledges with a view to attaining \nsustainable economic growth that satisfies the \nlegitimate priorities and needs of the developing \ncountries. As Chair of the Group of 77 and China, my \ncountry will spare no effort in furthering those \ndemands. \n The absence of democracy in international \nrelations, as exemplified by the present form and \ncomposition of the Security Council, has become a \nmajor factor in diminishing the ability of the United \nNations to respond to the structural and substantive \nchallenges and changes in the international community. \nThat has been exacerbated by unilateral sanctions that \nhinder international trade and investment and violate \nthe Charter of the United Nations and the rules of \ninternational law.  \n The United Nations rostrum is being used by \nsome to serve narrow interests such that the concept of \nhuman rights has become a tool for ceaseless \npoliticization and score settling. In the same vein, the \noften misused concept of terrorism has led to the \nvictim being equated with the aggressor, as is currently \nevident in the plight of the Palestinian people, who are \nstill chafing under the yoke of occupation. As a result, \nthe Palestinian question has remained unsolved, which \nhas gravely compromised the reputation and credibility \nof the United Nations. \n It is thus clear that for the United Nations to \neffectively serve a changing world, it has to effect an \nall-out change in its working methods and approaches \nso that it will truly express the voice of all nations. \nConsequently, my country, like all other developing \nnations, supports the call to reactivate the role of the \nGeneral Assembly and to reform the Security Council, \nbased on the well-known African position on this \nmatter. \n This session is of special importance to my \ncountry for it comes at a time when we are putting an \nend to what has been called the longest civil war in \nAfrica by concluding the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement. The Agreement adopts a system making \ncitizenship a basis for rights and duties, and espousing \ndiversity as a source of unity and brotherhood built on \nthe rule of law, good governance, respect for freedoms \nand human rights, as well as fair and democratic \npower-sharing. \n Additionally, the Agreement establishes the \nprinciples of wealth sharing, in line with the norms of \nequity and equality. The implementation of the \nAgreement has proceeded with the completion of the \nformation of relevant mechanisms and institutions, \nalong with the full commitment by the two parties to \n \n \n31 09-52598 \n \nthe Agreement to the sound treatment of the question \nof entitlements as reflected in the handling of the \nquestion of Abyei. \n We note here the fact that donors have not \nfulfilled the development resources and pledges they \ntook upon themselves in support of the Agreement has \nadversely affected its implementation, particularly in \nthe spheres of development, rehabilitation and \nreintegration of former combatants in society. We \ntherefore urge the fulfilment of all pledges so as to \nfoster peace and stability, as well as the reconstruction \nof the country after the ravages of years of war, so that \npeace can be meaningful. \n After conducting a population census \u2014 the \naccuracy and credibility of which were testified to by \nnumerous international and regional institutions, \nincluding the United Nations \u2014 and in conformity with \nthe Agreement, we are about to hold general legislative \nand executive elections. We assert our resolve and \ndetermination to hold them in April 2010, while we \ncontinue to strengthen efforts aimed at political reform, \nwhich is indispensable for founding a durable peace. \nWe invite the international community, including the \nUnited Nations, to support the holding of elections in \nword and deed. \n Despite all the positive developments in the peace \nprocess, we note with profound concern the recent \narmed tribal conflicts in southern Sudan. Those \nconflicts threaten not only the stability of the Sudan \nand the South but also the stability of the whole region. \nWe would like to recall here that, in accordance with \nthe Agreement, the responsibility for the maintenance \nof peace in the South lies with the Government of \nSouthern Sudan. Therefore, it is everybody\u2019s duty to \nurge and encourage the Government of Southern Sudan \nto discharge its duty for the sake of its citizens\u2019 \nsecurity and prosperity. \n Our people have recognized that peace will not be \ncomplete unless it extends to our people in Darfur. The \nsigning of the Darfur Peace Agreement in Abuja under \nthe gracious aegis of the African Union affirmed the \nGovernment\u2019s serious commitment to resolving the \nproblem of Darfur peacefully. \n While we were earnestly attempting to implement \nthat Agreement, certain international parties did not \nfulfil their pledges and obligations in strict application \nof the Agreement, such as by applying unwarranted \npressure on the wrong side. Instead of pressuring the \nparties that shied away from the peace option, pressure \nwas put on the Abuja signatories themselves. That \nhampered peace endeavours and led to the protraction \nof the conflict. \n Yet, thanks to the steadfast maintenance of the \nAgreement by our Government and people and our \nrelentless efforts to achieve peace, we are now seeing \npositive and far-reaching developments leading \ntowards lasting peace in Darfur, thanks also to the \ncomplete commitment shown by the National Unity \nGovernment and its close cooperation with the African \nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur \nthrough the Tripartite Mechanism. \n That policy has led to far-reaching improvements \nin the humanitarian situation in Darfur, as recognized \nand attested to by United Nations reports. That is \nfurther supported by our scrupulous commitment to the \nhumanitarian agreement signed last April with the \nUnited States Special Envoy to the Sudan. We reiterate \nour commitment to close cooperation with the United \nNations and with national and international \norganizations with a view to enhancing and developing \nthat policy in a manner that prevents any humanitarian \ndisaster or even food gaps in the future. \n In this connection, it is imperative to note the \nmassive return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) \nto their villages, which makes it incumbent on the \nGovernment, the Sudanese people and the international \ncommunity to seize this opportunity to foster this \ntrend, as it is the real test of peace. \n We renew our commitment and preparedness to \nwork expeditiously and at all times to ensure the \nsuccess of the forthcoming negotiations in Doha within \nthe framework of the Afro-Arab initiative and the \nefforts of the Joint Mediator, in accordance with the \ndecision taken by the initiatives committee in its \nmeeting held at the margins of this session. \n We welcome the declaration made by the \nAmerican President, Barack Obama, before the General \nAssembly, on his country\u2019s readiness to help find \nsolutions to the problems of Darfur. Noting the positive \ntone in the statements voiced by the American \nPresident towards developing countries in general, we \nhope that his words will be translated into action and \nsincere effort in order to correct the misguided policies \nand positions of the previous American Administration, \nwhich have compromised bilateral relations and \naggravated the region\u2019s problems. This, undoubtedly, \n  \n \n09-52598 32 \n \nrequires, first and foremost, lifting the unilateral \nsanctions and removing the name of the Sudan from \nthe United States\u2019 list of terrorist States. \n We renew our appeal to the armed groups to \nmuster the will for a solution and for involvement in \nthe peace process, so that the interests of the Sudanese \npeople are put first and foremost. The people of the \nSudan are more than capable of solving their own \nproblems. My country has repeatedly declared its \ncommitment to a unilateral ceasefire as an initiative for \nconfidence-building and bringing about successful \nnegotiations, and we hope that armed factions will \nrespond positively so that a permanently monitored \nceasefire can be reached. \n The international community, which has, in the \npast, promised to take stringent measures against those \nwho refused to take part in the peace talks or impede \nthem, has to do so in deed and not just in word. The \nquestion of development, recovery, rehabilitation and \nreconstruction should be given special attention, as \ncalled for in Security Council resolution 1769 (2007). \nThere should be a transition from providing emergency \nhumanitarian assistance to supporting development, in \norder to facilitate the return and settlement of IDPs and \nrefugees. \n From this rostrum, I wish to assert my country\u2019s \nkeen interest in having constructive relations with all \nits neighbours and its full readiness for complete \ncooperation with them, with a view to extinguishing all \nregional hot beds of tension. In this regard, I would \nlike to stress our preparedness and willingness to \nnormalize relations with Chad, in conformity with all \nagreements and instruments signed with them and we \nhope they will demonstrate the same determination and \nreadiness. \n At a time when the Government of National \nUnity had made remarkable progress in the \nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \nand when the Sudan had started a new phase towards \nthe achievement of political reform and transformation, \npeaceful devolution of authority, progress towards \nending disputes and infighting and towards the \nachievement of inclusive development for our people, \nthe President of the Republic himself, who is the chief \nguarantor of the Sudan\u2019s sovereignty, was targeted by \nso-called international justice in a futile attempt to \nundermine stability and development. The Sudanese \nrejected this, as did the international community, \nincluding regional and international organizations. \n We emphasize that the realization of security and \nstability in Darfur requires speedy correction of those \ndevelopments and a renewed commitment to the peace \nprocess and the avoidance of all that may have a \nnegative impact on peace in the Sudan and the African \ncontinent. \n Between the signing of the United Nations Charter \nin the middle of the last century and the momentous \ndevelopments and profound challenges currently \nexperienced by the world, much water has flown under \nthe bridge of international relations, which makes \nannual General Assembly sessions serious opportunities \nfor introspection and for gleaning lessons. \n Let us renew our resolve to foster multilateral \naction, for which this Organization stands. Let our \nsixty-fourth session be a defining point towards \nachieving our collective aspirations for a world where \nthe values of fraternity and common destiny prevail."

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for \nme to have this opportunity to address the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session to share the views \nand offer the contribution of the Republic of \nMozambique on some of the challenges facing the \nworld today. \n I would like, on behalf of my delegation, to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki \non his unanimous election to preside over this session \nof the General Assembly. I assure him of the full \nsupport and collaboration of Mozambique for the \nsuccessful discharge of his noble mission. \n We pay tribute to his predecessor, Father Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann \u2014 a great sponsor of popular \nliberation \u2014 for the resolute manner in which he \npresided over the General Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession, and for his tireless efforts in favour of and \ndevotion to the poorest and most disadvantaged. Father \nMiguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann\u2019s engagement as an \nadvocate for those suffering in the Palestinian \nterritories and his strong leadership, demonstrated by \nbringing together the 192 Member States of the United \nNations to address the financial and economic crisis, \nhave given us a vivid example of how commitment and \ngenerosity, combined with vision and resolve, can \n \n \n11 09-52604 \n \nmake a difference in bringing the international \ncommunity together in the search for solutions to \ncurrent global problems. \n I wish to convey to this gathering the warmest \ngreetings of His Excellency President Armando Em\u00edlio \nGuebuza, who could not be present today due to \npressing national commitments. Indeed, on 28 October \nthis year, Mozambique will hold its fourth general \nelection. There will also be elections for provincial \nparliaments for the first time in the country\u2019s history. \nThese elections attest to our strong political will and \ncommitment to further strengthening democracy in the \ncountry, where the rule of law and the promotion and \nprotection of the human rights of all Mozambicans \nunite us in our fight against absolute poverty and for \npeace, stability and sustainable development. \n As a result of this enabling political environment, \nMozambique has recorded steady economic \nperformance and signals of economic stability over the \npast five years, with an average gross domestic product \ngrowth rate of 7.8 per cent. Poverty levels decreased \nfrom 69.4 per cent in 1997 to 54.1 per cent in 2003. As \na result of our discernible progress in education, \nhealth, water and sanitation, we expect to reduce \npoverty to 45 per cent by the end of the current year. \nHowever, the current global financial and economic \ncrisis is constraining our progress towards that goal; it \nwas recently forecast that our economic growth may \nslow to 4.3 per cent in 2009. \n In this context, the Government\u2019s focus is to \nensure that the effects of the crisis, combined with \ncyclical natural disasters, as well as diseases like \npandemic HIV/AIDS and endemic malaria and \ntuberculosis, are not deepened and do not create \nconditions that would prevent our return to the \neconomic and social growth I just described. \nMozambique welcomes the launching, here at the \nUnited Nations on 23 September 2009, of the African \nLeaders Malaria Alliance, and pledges to play an active \nrole in support of this new mechanism aimed at \ncoordinating our responses to the scourge of malaria. \n Climate change is another pressing challenge. \nTherefore, we cannot afford to fail to seal the deal in \nDecember at the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, in Copenhagen. It is our hope that the \ncommitments made during the Summit on Climate \nChange, held on 22 September, will inspire the \ndeliberations in Copenhagen. \n In southern Africa, we continue our efforts \ntowards regional economic integration, the \nconsolidation of democracy, good governance and \npolitical stability. It is within this framework that \nprogress has been made in the implementation of the \nFree Trade Area in the Southern African Development \nCommunity (SADC), and that free and fair elections \nhave been held in a number of countries in the region.  \n In spite of these advances, we continue to face \nchallenges in many areas that still demand our \nattention, in particular those of peace, security and \nstability. In this regard, Mozambique, in its capacity as \nchair of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and \nSecurity Cooperation, will strive to ensure the success \nof the common regional efforts to eradicate pockets of \ninstability so as to enable our countries to concentrate \non achieving the social and economic development \ngoals that our peoples are longing for. \n We are encouraged by the progress made in the \nimplementation of the Global Political Agreement in \nZimbabwe, which is enabling the country to move \ntowards an atmosphere of political and social stability \nconducive to permanent dialogue, reconstruction and \neconomic recovery. The economic challenges facing \nZimbabwe, associated with the current global \neconomic crisis and the continued sanctions applied by \nsome international development partners, make the \ndesired rapid economic recovery hard to achieve. We \ntherefore reiterate the SADC call for the removal of all \nsanctions against Zimbabwe. \n We are concerned by the attempts to undermine \nthe agreements signed in Maputo by all Malagasy \npolitical movements on 9 August 2009, and we \ncondemn any unilateral decision that violates the spirit \nof the agreements. We reaffirm our support for the \nongoing political dialogue in Madagascar and urge all \npolitical stakeholders to fully implement the Maputo \nagreements. \n In addition to the subregional efforts to address \nthe current situation of conflicts in Africa, a special \nsession of the African Union was convened in August \nin Tripoli to consider a wide range of conflicts with a \nview to finding solutions and establishing consolidated \nand sustainable peace, security and stability on the \ncontinent. It is in this spirit that Mozambique \ncommends and supports the ongoing initiatives at the \n  \n \n09-52604 12 \n \nregional and continental levels aimed at promoting \ndurable and sustainable peace and stability in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Darfur and \nSomalia, among other areas. \n With regard to the Middle East, Mozambique is \nencouraged by the prospects for an effective, viable \nand durable two-State solution for the Palestinians and \nIsraelis, as well as for broader Arab-Israeli \nnormalization as a result of the commitments made by \nrelevant stakeholders during this general debate. \n The time has come for us to act together at the \nnational, regional and international levels to ensure the \nspeedy and full implementation of the internationally \nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We reiterate our recognition of the \nvital role played by the United Nations in coordinating \ninternational efforts in the search for sustainable \nresponses to the problems facing the world today.  \n In this regard, it is worth recalling the urgent \nneed to accelerate the ongoing reform of the United \nNations, including the reform of the Security Council, \nthe revitalization of the General Assembly, and the \nprocess of reforming the United Nations system to \nmake it more effective, efficient and coherent and thus \nmore responsive to the development needs of \ndeveloping countries. Indeed, as one of the eight pilot \ncountries testing the Delivering as One initiative, \nMozambique is fully engaged in the reform of the \nUnited Nations system at the country level. \n Mozambique strongly believes in multilateralism, \nand that the United Nations is at the centre of it. We \nalso believe that the United Nations is a special forum \nthat brings together the universal aspirations for a \npeaceful, secure, stable and prosperous world, where \nthe values of tolerance, respect for human rights and \ninternational cooperation for development are upheld. \n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate Mozambique\u2019s \ncommitment to continuing to engage in international \nefforts to address issues of global concern, in particular \nthe fight against poverty, the negative impact of \nclimate change, and the promotion of sustainable \ndevelopment."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to salute Mr. Ali Treki, our \nPresident and a distinguished diplomat. I wish him \nmuch success in leading the deliberations of this \nsession. At the same time, I would like to express our \nadmiration and respect for Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, who led the Assembly at its last session. \n My presence highlights our commitment to \nmultilateralism in general and to the United Nations in \nparticular. I salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \nreiterate to him our appreciation for his management. \nAllow me to say how the Guatemalan people \nappreciate and value the presence of the United \nNations. We try to reciprocate, in part with our \nparticipation in various peacekeeping operations. \n I would like to touch briefly on some topics that \nare at the heart of our concerns but that at the same \ntime have an important international dimension. \n First, like the other countries of our region, \nGuatemala has been strongly impacted by the \ninternational economic and financial crisis. This fact is \nreflected in the value and volume of our exports, in the \nlevel of family remittances and especially in the level \nof economic activity, employment and tax collection. \n  \n \n09-52425 36 \n \nIn more general terms, the crisis has made it more \ndifficult for us to meet the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n To make matters worse, our efforts to mitigate the \nimpact of the crisis have been partially annulled by an \nirregular climatic event, as we are suffering the worst \ndrought in the last thirty years. This phenomenon has \naffected the harvest of basic grains and has had a \nserious impact on the poorest regions of our country. \nBecause of this, I decided to declare a state of \nemergency. The disaster is not just because of the \ndrought, but also an historic disaster, striking the \npoorest people in our country, whom our Government \nis aiming to lift from extreme poverty. \n This situation illustrates one of the manifold \nmanifestations of climate change occurring in diverse \nregions, and it comes on top of the burden of the \nregressive effects we experienced during the first half \nof 2008, in the double crises of energy and food, \nfollowed by the aforementioned effects of the \neconomic crisis. Unfortunately, the adverse effects of \nthis situation disproportionately affect those sectors of \nthe population with less capacity and less income. The \npicture is complicated by the fact that the imperative of \nthe State to address the people\u2019s needs is severely \nrestricted by fiscal considerations. \n Nevertheless, we are not sitting on our hands, far \nfrom it. We have surged forward with a dynamic and \nstrong social cohesion programme. Today, more than \nhalf a million families are covered by programmes in \nthe poorest and most excluded regions of the country. \nToday, I note with real satisfaction that in only \n18 months since our Administration began, our health \nindicators \u2014 all of the health indicators \u2014 have \nimproved to an extraordinary extent. \n Education indicators have improved. For \nexample, this year enrolment increased by 37 per cent \nin secondary education, by 9 per cent in primary \neducation and by 27 per cent in preschool. Now we \nhave the problem of schools that cannot cope with the \nnumber of children, but we prefer that problem to not \nhaving children in school. This means that there is an \nurgent need to build more than 14,400 classrooms over \nthe next 14 months, but we prefer that to having \nchildren on the streets or working. \n The international cooperation that we have \nreceived in this effort is important, and we would like \nto recognize here the support of the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank, the World Bank and the Central \nAmerican Bank for Economic Integration, which have \nhelped us with our efforts to build social cohesion and \nto support the indigenous people who constitute our \npopulation. \n I wish to sincerely express our total conviction \nwith regard to the change that we all must make. It is a \nchange of attitude, a change of will, as President Lula \nsaid yesterday. It is important that we see the birth of \nthis new international order, this new order of justice \nand equity.  \n The drought in Guatemala exacerbated abject \npoverty, but a solution to drought will not resolve the \npoverty situation in the country, because it is structural \nand historical, resulting from 50 years of neglect of \nrural populations and our indigenous peoples.  \n We will follow with interest the deliberations of \nthe Group of 20, which is meeting this very day in \nPittsburgh. We trust that that exclusive forum will also \ntake into account the concerns of countries with small \nand medium-sized economies. In addition, we support \nthe efforts being promoted within the multilateral \ninternational financial institutions and the United \nNations to improve their capacity to help developing \ncountries and to address the crisis. That is why our \ncountry is seriously promoting the capitalization of the \nInter-American Development Bank and our regional \nfinancial organization, the Central American Bank for \nEconomic Integration.  \n I should like to mention the lack of security in \nour country. Our country is being assaulted by \norganized crime, and our Government, within the space \nof a year and a half, has begun a merciless war against \nit. In this forum, I wish to express my appreciation for \nthe magnificent cooperation and support that we have \nreceived, particularly from Colombia, Panama and \nMexico, to attack and staunch the scourge of drug \ntrafficking and to begin a process of eliminating it.  \n I also wish to inform the Assembly with great \nsatisfaction that, in terms of seizures of cocaine alone, \nwe have seen a 700 per cent increase compared with \nthe same period under the previous Government; \nseizures of marijuana have risen fifteenfold, and poppy \neradication has increased by 300 per cent during the \nsame period. Our efforts against drug trafficking are \ndefinitive and resolute, but we recognize that it is a \nphenomenon that must be attacked at the regional \nlevel. That is why we are working closely with the \n \n \n37 09-52425 \n \nfraternal country of Mexico and our Central American \nbrothers to address it directly and regionally. \n The problem of drug trafficking has had a serious \nimpact on Guatemala. For more than eight years, the \ncountry was handed over to organized crime \u2014 \nspecifically, drug trafficking \u2014 leaving territories and \ntrafficking corridors more unprotected than ever \nbefore. The national army was reduced beyond the \nlevel mandated by peace agreements, and territorial \ncontrol was suspended. The National Civilian Police \nwere seriously compromised by drug traffickers, \nbecoming corrupt and dishonest.  \n However, thanks to the United Nations and the \npresence of the International Commission against \nImpunity in Guatemala \u2014 a United Nations exercise in \nGuatemala, unique in the world \u2014 we have support \nand advice for our Public Ministry, and our prosecutors \nand are making significant progress. For the first time \nin Guatemala\u2019s history, one of the drug-trafficking \nbosses is a fugitive, and we will capture him very soon. \nThe notorious drug-trafficking families have never \nbeen sent such a strong message.  \n We have also imprisoned 10 murder suspects \nconnected to the 10 May crisis. I take this opportunity \nto thank this forum, the United Nations, for the \nunrestricted support provided to my Government \nduring the crisis. I am confident that the efforts of the \nInternational Commission against Impunity in \nGuatemala will reach the masterminds of that \ndespicable crime and that the truth will be found and \njustice done. What could have become a technical coup \nd\u2019\u00e9tat has become a genuine example of justice and \ntruth. I am sure that my Government, which has \nensured the total independence of this investigation, \nwill get to the heart of the matter and that the truth will \nsoon be found. \n We have worked hard on the security of our \ncitizens, and I recognize that it is a long and \ncomplicated process. Here again, the assistance of the \nInternational Commission is essential, and we believe \nthat this experience will be effectively used by our \nPublic Ministry, which has already begun the process \nof re-engineering and restructuring itself.  \n I should like to mention the case of Honduras, \nour fraternal neighbouring country. From the very \nbeginning, Guatemala has supported a return to \ndemocracy and the rule of law in Honduras. Nowhere \nin the world, much less in Central America \u2014 where \ndemocracy has cost us so many lives and where so \nmany deaths and, in the case of Guatemala, massacres, \nhave affected us \u2014 can we allow a President to be \ndeposed at gunpoint and fail to use democratic and \nlegal mechanisms. We will accept nothing less than the \nreturn of President Zelaya to power so that the \nelections in Honduras can be carried out legitimately \nand our Honduran brothers can soon live in peace and \ntranquillity. Our Government has been unsparing in its \nsupport for President Zelaya, and I am sure that we will \nsee Central America return to its natural rhythm of \nintegration, democratic development and democratic \nsecurity. \n I should also like to highlight our adherence to \nnearly all human rights mechanisms, principles and \nnorms within and outside Guatemala. We are a \nmulti-ethnic, pluri-cultural and multilingual nation. We \nhave a beautiful 108,000-square-kilometre country \nwith 23 cultures and 23 peoples sharing the blessed \nland that God gave us. That is why we are committed \nto promoting the strengthening of the participation of \nall the indigenous peoples of Guatemala in terms of our \ndaily life, development, peace and security. \n We have adopted a law on free access to \ninformation, with very few problems, which has \nguaranteed free access to all State information except \nthat related to security matters and foreign relations. \nThat is why we wish to stress the need to strengthen \nthe mechanisms for human rights and arms control. I \nbelieve that countries have the freedom to arm \nthemselves for defence, but I do not agree that our \ncountries should be arms-trafficking corridors. I also \nbelieve that countries exporting armaments should be \nmore careful and have more controls and standards \nwith regard to the entire weapons trade. Our country, \nmy Government, has increased its seizures of illegal \nweapons almost tenfold, but we still have much work \nahead of us. Meanwhile, many innocent people are \ndying as a result of drug trafficking, smuggling and \norganized crime.  \n Let us make progress in the definition of the \nconcept of the responsibility to protect our respective \npopulations from genocide and war crimes, which we \nhave already endured; ethnic cleansing and crimes \nagainst humanity, from which Guatemala suffered \ngreatly for 36 years.  \n I wish to express my total conviction that the \nUnited Nations must be constantly renewed and \n  \n \n09-52425 38 \n \nadapted to today\u2019s needs. Our civilization is changing. \nThis is a crisis not just of energy or finance or climate; \nit is a crisis of values, of principles. The financial crisis \nis a crisis of values and principles, and we are paying \nfor it with the poverty of our people. That is why we \nneed better adaptation of the United Nations \nmechanisms so we can really get to the bottom \u2014 al \ngrano, as we say in Guatemala \u2014 of the problems of \npoverty and inequality, to strengthen democracy and \nthe rule of law. \n I have the honour to be familiar with the Mayan \ncosmic vision, and I am quite sure that in 2012, the \ntransformation of civilization it prophesied will begin. \nThis is a very ancient prophecy and it will be fulfilled, \njust as all the others have been. We will enter an era of \ngreat humanity and great human strength. And America \nis also changing. If you look at the Americas today, \nthey have nothing to do with the way they were \n10 years ago. Democracy, although it has problems, \nhas improved and been strengthened, thank heaven. \n We support United Nations and Organization of \nAmerican States (OAS) resolutions with regard to \nHonduras, and I am also happy to affirm that we have \nmade very concrete progress in honourably ending our \nhistorical dispute with our brother nation of Belize. In \nDecember, under the good offices of the OAS, both \nGovernments signed a special agreement, which, prior \nto complying with the domestic ratification processes \nof our Congresses, commits us to seek a juridical \nsettlement through the International Court of Justice. \nWe hope that, through these internal procedures, we \nwill be able to proceed to plebiscites in both countries, \nin order to put an end to the dispute with our brother \ncountry of Belize. \n I would like to conclude with some very brief \nreflections on our Organization and its agenda for the \nfuture. I would like it to continue to give priority to the \npoor, those with limited incomes, children, young \npeople living in the mountains of our countries who do \nnot have access to health care, education or drinking \nwater. The drought and the malnutrition we are seeing \namong our children in Guatemala are nothing more \nthan the product of historical injustice. If all of us in \nthe United Nations share in this fight to help those who \nhave so little, I am sure that we will have more for \neveryone. The more we support those who have less, \nthe more we will all have in the end. I hope that this \nAssembly session reaches a fruitful conclusion."

        "file_text": "It is my honour to address the \nAssembly for the first time as the forty-fourth \nPresident of the United States. I come before you \nhumbled by the responsibility that the American people \nhave placed upon me, mindful of the enormous \nchallenges of our moment in history and determined to \nact boldly and collectively on behalf of justice and \nprosperity at home and abroad. \n I have been in office for just nine months, though \nsome days it seems a lot longer. I am well aware of the \nexpectations that accompany my presidency around the \nworld. Those expectations are not about me. Rather \nthey are, I believe, rooted in a discontent with the \nstatus quo that has allowed us to be increasingly \ndefined by our differences and outpaced by our \nproblems. But they are also rooted in hope \u2014 the hope \nthat real change is possible and the hope that America \nwill be a leader in bringing about such change. \n I took office at a time when many around the \nworld had come to view America with scepticism and \ndistrust. A part of that was due to misperceptions and \nmisinformation about my country. Part was due to \nopposition to specific policies and a belief that on \ncertain critical issues America had acted unilaterally, \nwithout regard for the interests of others. That has fed \nan almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often \nhas served as an excuse for collective inaction. \n Like all of you, my responsibility is to act in the \ninterests of my nation and my people, and I will never \napologize for defending those interests. But it is my \ndeeply held belief that in the year 2009, more than at \nany point in human history, the interests of nations and \npeoples are shared. The religious convictions that we \nhold in our hearts can forge new bonds among people, \nor they can tear us apart. The technology we harness \ncan light the path to peace, or forever darken it. The \nenergy we use can sustain our planet, or destroy it. \nWhat happens to the hope of a single child, anywhere, \ncan enrich our world, or impoverish it. \n In this Hall, we come from many places, but we \nshare a common future. No longer do we have the \nluxury of indulging our differences to the exclusion of \nthe work that we must do together. I have carried this \nmessage from London to Ankara, from Port-of-Spain to \nMoscow, from Accra to Cairo, and it is what I will \nspeak about today. \n Because the time has come for the world to move \nin a new direction, we must embrace a new era of \nengagement based on mutual interests and mutual \nrespect, and our work must begin now. We know the \nfuture will be forged by deeds, and not simply words. \nSpeeches alone will not solve our problems. It will take \npersistent action. \n So for those who question the character and cause \nof my nation, I ask you to look at the concrete actions \nwe have taken in just nine months. \n On my first day in office I prohibited, without \nexception or equivocation, the use of torture by the \nUnited States of America. I ordered the prison at \nGuantanamo Bay closed, and we are doing the hard \nwork of forging a framework to combat extremism \nwithin the rule of law. \n Every nation must know that America will live its \nvalues, and we will lead by example. We have set a \nclear and focused goal to work with all members of \nthis body to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al-Qaida and \nits extremist allies \u2014 a network that has killed \nthousands of people of many faiths and nations and has \nplotted to blow up this very building. In Afghanistan \nand Pakistan, we and many nations here are helping \nthose Governments to develop the capacity to take the \nlead in this effort, while working to advance \nopportunity and security for their people. \n In Iraq we are responsibly ending a war. We have \nremoved American combat brigades from Iraqi cities \nand set a deadline of next August to remove all our \ncombat brigades from Iraqi territory. I have made clear \nthat we will help Iraqis make the transition to full \nresponsibility for their future and keep our \ncommitment to remove all American troops by the end \nof 2011. \n I have outlined a comprehensive agenda to seek \nthe goal of a world without nuclear weapons. In \nMoscow, the United States and Russia announced that \nwe would pursue substantial reductions in our strategic \nwarheads and launchers. In the Conference on \nDisarmament we agreed on a workplan to negotiate an \nend to the production of fissile materials for nuclear \nweapons. And this week, my Secretary of State will \nbecome the first senior American representative to the \n  \n \n09-52179 10 \n \nannual members\u2019 conference of the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. \n Upon taking office, I appointed a special envoy \nfor Middle East peace, and America has worked \nsteadily and aggressively to advance the cause of two \nStates \u2014 Israel and Palestine \u2014 in which peace and \nsecurity take root and the rights of both Israelis and \nPalestinians are respected. \n To confront climate change we have invested \n$80 billion in clean energy. We have substantially \nincreased our fuel efficiency standards. We have \nprovided new incentives for conservation, launched an \nenergy partnership across the Americas and moved \nfrom being a bystander to being a leader in \ninternational climate negotiations. \n To overcome an economic crisis that touches \nevery corner of the world, we worked with the Group \nof 20 nations to forge a coordinated international \nresponse of over $2 trillion in stimulus to bring the \nglobal economy back from the brink. We mobilized \nresources that help prevent the crisis from spreading \nfurther to developing countries, and we joined with \nothers to launch a $20 billion global food security \ninitiative that will lend a hand to those who need it \nmost and help them build their own capacity. \n We have also re-engaged the United Nations. We \nhave paid our bills. We have joined the Human Rights \nCouncil. We have signed the Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities. We have fully embraced the \nMillennium Development Goals, and we address our \npriorities here in this institution, for instance through the \nSecurity Council meeting on nuclear non-proliferation \nand disarmament that I will chair tomorrow and \nthrough the issues that I will discuss today. \n That is what we have already done, but it is just a \nbeginning. Some of our actions have yielded progress; \nsome have laid the groundwork for progress in the \nfuture. But make no mistake: this cannot solely be \nAmerica\u2019s endeavour. Those who used to chastise \nAmerica for acting alone in the world cannot now \nstand by and wait for America to solve the world\u2019s \nproblems alone. We have sought, in word and deed, a \nnew era of engagement with the world, and now is the \ntime for all of us to take our share of responsibility for \na global response to global challenges. \n If we are honest with ourselves, we need to admit \nthat we are not living up to that responsibility. \nConsider the course that we are on if we fail to \nconfront the status quo: extremists sowing terror in \npockets of the world, protracted conflicts that grind on \nand on, genocide, mass atrocities, more nations with \nnuclear weapons, melting ice caps and ravaged \npopulations, persistent poverty and pandemic disease. \n I say this not to sow fear, but to state a fact. The \nmagnitude of our challenges has yet to be met by the \nmeasure of our actions. This body was founded on the \nbelief that the nations of the world could solve their \nproblems together. Franklin Roosevelt, who died \nbefore he could see his vision for this institution \nbecome a reality, put it this way: \n \u201cThe structure of world peace cannot be the work \nof one man, or one party, or one nation. It cannot \nbe a peace of large nations or of small nations. It \nmust be a peace which rests on the cooperative \neffort of the whole world.\u201d \n The cooperative effort of the whole world \u2014 \nthose words ring even more true today when it is not \nsimply peace, but our very health and prosperity that \nwe hold in common. Yet, we also know that this body \nis made up of sovereign States and that, sadly but not \nsurprisingly, this body has often become a forum for \nsowing discord instead of forging common ground, a \nvenue for playing politics and exploiting grievances \nrather than solving problems. After all, it is easy to \nwalk up to this podium and point fingers and stoke \ndivisions. Nothing is easier than blaming others for our \ntroubles and absolving ourselves of responsibility for \nour choices and our actions. Anybody can do that. \nResponsibility and leadership in the twenty-first \ncentury demand more. \n In an era when our destiny is shared, power is no \nlonger a zero-sum game. No one nation can or should \ntry to dominate another nation. No world order that \nelevates one nation or group of people over another \nwill succeed. No balance of power among nations will \nhold. The traditional divisions between nations of the \nSouth and the North make no sense in an \ninterconnected world, nor do alignments of nations \nrooted in the cleavages of a long-gone cold war. \n The time has come to realize that the old habits \nand the old arguments are irrelevant to the challenges \nfaced by our peoples. They leave nations to act in \nopposition to the very goals that they claim to pursue \nand to vote, often in this body, against the interests of \ntheir own people. They build up walls between us and \n \n \n11 09-52179 \n \nthe future that our peoples seek, and the time has come \nfor those walls to come down. Together we must build \nnew coalitions that bridge old divides \u2014 coalitions of \ndifferent faiths and creeds, of North and South, East, \nWest, black, white and brown. \n The choice is ours. We can be remembered as the \ngeneration that chose to drag the arguments of the \ntwentieth century into the twenty-first, and that put off \nhard choices, refused to look ahead, and failed to keep \npace because we defined ourselves by what we were \nagainst instead of what we were for; or we can be a \ngeneration that chooses to see the shoreline beyond the \nrough waters ahead, that comes together to serve the \ncommon interests of human beings, and finally gives \nmeaning to the promise imbedded in the name given to \nthis institution \u2014 the United Nations. That is the future \nAmerica wants \u2014 a future of peace and prosperity that \nwe can reach only if we recognize that all nations have \nrights. But all nations have responsibilities as well. \nThat is the bargain that makes this work. That must be \nthe guiding principle of international cooperation. \n Today, let me put forward four pillars that I \nbelieve are fundamental to the future that we want for \nour children: non-proliferation and disarmament, the \npromotion of peace and security, the preservation of \nour planet, and a global economy that advances \nopportunity for all people. \n First, we must stop the spread of nuclear weapons \nand seek the goal of a world without them. This \ninstitution was founded at the dawn of the atomic age \nin part because man\u2019s capacity to kill had to be \ncontained. For decades, we averted disaster, even under \nthe shadow of a super-Power stand-off. But today the \nthreat of proliferation is growing in scope and \ncomplexity. If we fail to act, we will invite nuclear \narms races in every region and the prospect of wars and \nacts of terror on a scale that we can hardly imagine. \n A fragile consensus stands in the way of this \nfrightening outcome, and that is the basic bargain that \nshapes the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT). It says that all nations have the right \nto peaceful nuclear energy, and that nations with \nnuclear weapons have a responsibility to move towards \ndisarmament and those without them have the \nresponsibility to forsake them. The next 12 months \ncould be pivotal in determining whether this compact \nwill be strengthened or will slowly dissolve. \n America intends to keep our end of the bargain. \nWe will pursue a new agreement with Russia to \nsubstantially reduce our strategic warheads and \nlaunches. We will move forward with ratification of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and work \nwith others to bring the Treaty into force, so that \nnuclear testing is permanently prohibited. We will \ncomplete a nuclear posture review that opens the door \nto deeper cuts and reduces the role of nuclear weapons, \nand we will call upon countries to begin negotiations in \nJanuary on a treaty to end the production of fissile \nmaterial for weapons. \n I will also host a summit next April that reaffirms \neach nation\u2019s responsibility to secure nuclear material \non its territory and to help those who cannot, because \nwe must never allow a single nuclear device to fall into \nthe hands of a violent extremist. And we will work to \nstrengthen the institutions and initiatives that combat \nnuclear smuggling and theft. \n All of this must support efforts to strengthen the \nNPT. Those nations that refuse to live up to their \nobligations must face consequences. Let me be clear: \nThis is not about singling out individual nations. It is \nabout standing up for the rights of all nations that do \nlive up to their responsibilities, because a world in \nwhich International Atomic Energy Agency inspections \nare avoided and the United Nations demands are \nignored will leave all people less safe and all nations \nless secure. \n In their actions to date, the Governments of North \nKorea and Iran threaten to take us down this dangerous \nslope. We respect their rights as members of the \ncommunity of nations. I have said before and I will \nrepeat: I am committed to diplomacy that opens a path \nto greater prosperity and more secure peace for both \nnations if they live up to their obligations. But if the \nGovernments of Iran and North Korea choose to ignore \ninternational standards; if they put the pursuit of \nnuclear weapons ahead of regional stability and the \nsecurity and opportunity of their own people; if they \nare oblivious to the dangers of escalating nuclear arms \nraces in both East Asia and the Middle East, then they \nmust be held accountable. The world must stand \ntogether to demonstrate that international law is not an \nempty promise and that treaties will be enforced. We \nmust insist that the future does not belong to fear. \n That brings me to the second pillar for our future: \nthe pursuit of peace. The United Nations was born of \n  \n \n09-52179 12 \n \nthe belief that the people of the world can live their \nlives, raise their families and resolve their differences \npeacefully. Yet we know that in too many parts of the \nworld this ideal remains an abstraction \u2014 a distant \ndream. We can either accept that outcome as inevitable \nand tolerate constant and crippling conflict, or we can \nrecognize that the yearning for peace is universal and \nreassert our resolve to end conflicts around the world. \nThat effort must begin with an unshakeable \ndetermination that the murder of innocent men, women \nand children will never be tolerated. On this, there can \nbe no dispute. \n The violent extremists who promote conflict by \ndistorting faith have discredited and isolated \nthemselves. They offer nothing but hatred and \ndestruction. In confronting them, America will forge \nlasting partnerships to target terrorists, share \nintelligence, coordinate law enforcement and protect \nour people. We will permit no safe haven for Al-Qaida \nto launch attacks from Afghanistan or any other nation. \nWe will stand by our friends on the front lines, as we \nand many nations will do in pledging support for the \nPakistani people tomorrow. And we will pursue \npositive engagement that builds bridges among faiths \nand new partnerships for opportunity. \n Our efforts to promote peace, however, cannot be \nlimited to defeating violent extremists, for the most \npowerful weapon in our arsenal is the hope of human \nbeings \u2014 the belief that the future belongs to those \nwho would build and not destroy; the confidence that \nconflicts can end and a new day can begin. And that is \nwhy we will strengthen our support for effective \npeacekeeping, while energizing our efforts to prevent \nconflicts before they take hold.  \n We will pursue a lasting peace in Sudan, through \nsupport for the people of Darfur and the implementation \nof the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, so that we \nsecure the peace that the Sudanese people deserve. \n And in countries ravaged by violence, from Haiti to \nCongo to East Timor, we will work with the United \nNations and other partners to support an enduring peace. \n I will also continue to seek a just and lasting \npeace between Israel, Palestine and the Arab world. We \nwill continue to work on that issue. Yesterday I had a \nconstructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu \nand President Abbas. We have made some progress. \nPalestinians have strengthened their efforts on security. \nIsraelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement \nfor the Palestinians. As a result of these efforts on both \nsides, the economy in the West Bank has begun to \ngrow. \n But more progress is needed. We continue to call \non Palestinians to end incitement against Israel. And \nwe continue to emphasize that America does not accept \nthe legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements. \n The time has come to re-launch negotiations \u2014 \nwithout preconditions \u2014 that address the permanent-\nstatus issues: security for Israelis and Palestinians, \nborders, refugees and Jerusalem. The goal is clear: two \nStates living side by side in peace and security: a \nJewish State of Israel, with true security for all Israelis, \nand a viable, independent Palestinian State with \ncontiguous territory that ends the occupation that began \nin 1967 and realizes the potential of the Palestinian \npeople. As we pursue this goal, we will also pursue \npeace between Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Syria, \nand a broader peace between Israel and its many \nneighbours. In pursuit of that goal, we will develop \nregional initiatives with multilateral participation, \nalongside bilateral negotiations. \n Now, I am not naive. I know this will be difficult. \nBut all of us \u2014 not just the Israelis and the \nPalestinians, but all of us \u2014 must decide whether we \nare serious about peace, or whether we will only lend it \nlip-service. To break the old patterns \u2014 to break the \ncycle of insecurity and despair \u2014 all of us must say \npublicly what we would acknowledge in private. The \nUnited States does Israel no favours when we fail to \ncouple an unwavering commitment to its security with \nan insistence that Israel respect the legitimate claims \nand rights of the Palestinians. And nations within this \nbody do the Palestinians no favours when they choose \nvitriolic attacks against Israel over a constructive \nwillingness to recognize Israel\u2019s legitimacy and its \nright to exist in peace and security. \n We must remember that the greatest price of this \nconflict is not paid by us. It is not paid by politicians. \nIt is paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her \neyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle \nof the night. It is paid by the Palestinian boy in Gaza \nwho has no clean water and no country to call his own. \nThese are all God\u2019s children. And after all the politics \nand all the posturing, this is about the right of every \nhuman being to live with dignity and security. That is a \nlesson embedded in the three great faiths that call one \nsmall slice of Earth the Holy Land. And that is why \u2014 \n \n \n13 09-52179 \n \neven though there will be setbacks, and false starts, and \ntough days \u2014 I will not waiver in my pursuit of peace. \n Thirdly, we must recognize that in the twenty-\nfirst century there will be no peace unless we take \nresponsibility for the preservation of our planet. And I \nthank the Secretary-General for hosting the summit on \nclimate change yesterday. \n The danger posed by climate change cannot be \ndenied. Our responsibility to meet it must not be \ndeferred. If we continue down our current course, \nevery member of this Assembly will see irreversible \nchanges within its borders. Our efforts to end conflicts \nwill be eclipsed by wars over refugees and resources. \nDevelopment will be devastated by drought and \nfamine. Land that human beings have lived on for \nmillennia will disappear. Future generations will look \nback and wonder why we refused to act \u2014 why we \nfailed to pass on an environment that was worthy of \nour inheritance. \n And that is why the days when America dragged \nits feet on this issue are over. We will move forward \nwith investments to transform our energy economy, \nwhile providing incentives to make clean energy the \nprofitable kind of energy. We will press ahead with \ndeep cuts in emissions to reach the goals that we set for \n2020, and eventually 2050. We will continue to \npromote renewable energy and efficiency \u2014 and share \nnew technologies \u2014 with countries around the world. \nAnd we will seize every opportunity for progress to \naddress this threat in a cooperative effort with the \nentire world. \n Those wealthy nations that did so much damage \nto the environment in the twentieth century must \naccept our obligation to lead. But responsibility does \nnot end there. While we must acknowledge the need for \ndifferentiated responses, any effort to curb carbon \nemissions must include the fast-growing carbon \nemitters who can do more to reduce their air pollution \nwithout inhibiting growth. And any effort that fails \nboth to help the poorest nations to adapt to the \nproblems that climate change has already wrought and \nto help them travel a path of clean development simply \nwill not work. \n It is hard to change something as fundamental as \nhow we use energy. I know that. It is even harder to do \nso in the midst of a global recession. Certainly, it will \nbe tempting to sit back and wait for others to move \nfirst. But we cannot make this journey unless we all \nmove forward together. As we head into Copenhagen, \nlet us resolve to focus on what each of us can do for \nthe sake of our common future. \n This leads me to the final pillar that must fortify \nour future: a global economy that advances opportunity \nfor all people. \n The world is still recovering from the worst \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression. In \nAmerica, we see the engine of growth beginning to \nchurn, and yet many still struggle to find a job or pay \ntheir bills. Across the globe, we find promising signs, \nbut little certainty about what lies ahead. And far too \nmany people in far too many places live through the \ndaily crises that challenge our humanity: the despair of \nan empty stomach; the thirst brought on by dwindling \nwater supplies; the injustice of a child dying from a \ntreatable disease or a mother losing her life as she \ngives birth. \n In Pittsburgh, we will work with the world\u2019s \nlargest economies to chart a course for growth that is \nbalanced and sustained. That means vigilance to ensure \nthat we do not let up until our people are back to work. \nThat means taking steps to rekindle demand, so that \nglobal recovery can be sustained. And that means \nsetting new rules of the road and strengthening \nregulation for all financial centres, so that we put an \nend to the greed and the excess and the abuse that led \nus into this disaster, and prevent a crisis like this from \never happening again. \n At a time of such interdependence, we have a \nmoral and pragmatic interest, however, in broader \nquestions of development: the questions of development \nthat existed even before this crisis happened. And so \nAmerica will continue our historic effort to help people \nfeed themselves. We have set aside $63 billion to carry \nforward the fight against HIV/AIDS, to end deaths \nfrom tuberculosis and malaria, to eradicate polio and to \nstrengthen public health systems. We are joining with \nother countries to contribute H1N1 vaccines to the \nWorld Health Organization. We will integrate more \neconomies into a system of global trade. We will \nsupport the Millennium Development Goals and \napproach next year\u2019s summit with a global plan to \nmake them a reality. And we will set our sights on the \neradication of extreme poverty in our time. \n Now is the time for all of us to do our part. \nGrowth will not be sustained or shared unless all \nnations embrace their responsibilities. That means that \n  \n \n09-52179 14 \n \nwealthy nations must open their markets to more goods \nand extend a hand to those with less, while reforming \ninternational institutions to give more nations a greater \nvoice. And developing nations must root out the \ncorruption that is an obstacle to progress, for \nopportunity cannot thrive where individuals are \noppressed and businesses have to pay bribes. That is \nwhy we will support honest police and independent \njudges, civil society and a vibrant private sector. Our \ngoal is simple: a global economy in which growth is \nsustained and opportunity is available to all. \n Now, the changes that I have spoken about today \nwill not be easy to make, and they will not be realized \nsimply by leaders like us coming together in forums \nlike this, as useful as that may be. For, as in any \nassembly of members, real change can only come \nthrough the people we represent. That is why we must \ndo the hard work to lay the groundwork for progress in \nour own capitals. That is where we will build the \nconsensus to end conflicts and to harness technology \nfor peaceful purposes, to change the way we use \nenergy and to promote growth that can be sustained \nand shared. \n I believe that the people of the world want this \nfuture for their children. And that is why we must \nchampion those principles that ensure that \nGovernments reflect the will of the people. These \nprinciples cannot be afterthoughts. Democracy and \nhuman rights are essential to achieving each of the \ngoals that I have discussed today, because \nGovernments of the people and by the people are more \nlikely to act in the broader interests of their own \npeople, rather than the narrow interest of those in \npower. \n The test of our leadership will not be the degree \nto which we feed the fears and old hatreds of our \npeople. True leadership will not be measured by the \nability to muzzle dissent or to intimidate and harass \npolitical opponents at home. The people of the world \nwant change. They will not long tolerate those who are \non the wrong side of history. \n This Organization\u2019s Charter commits each of us \n\u201cto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the \ndignity and worth of the human person, in the equal \nrights of men and women\u201d. \n Among those rights is the freedom to speak your \nmind and worship as you please, the promise of \nequality of the races and the opportunity for women \nand girls to pursue their own potential, and the ability \nof citizens to have a say in how you are governed and \nto have confidence in the administration of justice. For, \njust as no nation should be forced to accept the tyranny \nof another nation, no individual should be forced to \naccept the tyranny of their own people. \n As an African-American, I will never forget that I \nwould not be here today without the steady pursuit of a \nmore perfect union in my country. That guides my \nbelief that no matter how dark the day may seem, \ntransformative change can be forged by those who \nchoose to side with justice. And I pledge that America \nwill always stand with those who stand up for their \ndignity and their rights \u2014 for the student who seeks to \nlearn, the voter who demands to be heard, the innocent \nwho longs to be free and the oppressed who yearns to \nbe equal. \n Democracy cannot be imposed on any nation \nfrom the outside. Each society must search for its own \npath, and no path is perfect. Each country will pursue a \npath rooted in the culture of its people and in its past \ntraditions. And I admit that America has too often been \nselective in its promotion of democracy. But that does \nnot weaken our commitment; it only reinforces it. \nThere are basic principles that are universal. There are \ncertain truths that are self-evident, and the United \nStates of America will never waiver in our efforts to \nstand up for the right of people everywhere to \ndetermine their own destiny. \n Sixty-five years ago, a weary Franklin Roosevelt \nspoke to the American people in his fourth, and final, \ninaugural address. After years of war, he sought to sum \nup the lessons that could be drawn from the terrible \nsuffering and enormous sacrifice that had taken place. \nWe have learned, he said, to be citizens of the world, \nmembers of the human community. The United Nations \nwas built by men and women like Roosevelt from \nevery corner of the world \u2014 from Africa and Asia, \nfrom Europe to the Americas. These architects of \ninternational cooperation had an idealism that was \nanything but naive. It was rooted in the hard-earned \nlessons of war, rooted in the wisdom that nations could \nadvance their interests by acting together instead of \nsplitting apart. \n Now it falls to us, for this institution will be what \nwe make of it. The United Nations does extraordinary \ngood around the world, in feeding the hungry, caring \nfor the sick and mending places that have been broken. \n \n \n15 09-52179 \n \nBut it also struggles to enforce its will and to live up to \nthe ideals of its founding. I believe that those \nimperfections are not a reason to walk away from this \ninstitution; they are a calling to redouble our efforts. \nThe United Nations can be a place where we either \nbicker about outdated grievances or forge common \nground; a place where we focus on what drives us apart \nor what brings us together; a place where we indulge \ntyranny or a source of moral authority. In short, the \nUnited Nations can be an institution that is \ndisconnected from what matters in the lives of our \ncitizens or it can be an indispensable factor in \nadvancing the interests of the people we serve. \n We have reached a pivotal moment. The United \nStates stands ready to begin a new chapter of \ninternational cooperation, one that recognizes the \nrights and responsibilities of all nations. And so, with \nconfidence in our cause and with a commitment to our \nvalues, we call on all nations to join us in building the \nfuture that our people so richly deserve."

        "file_text": "This year marks the twentieth \nanniversary of the adoption, in 1989, of General \nAssembly resolution 44/27 A, on international \nsolidarity with the liberation struggle in South Africa. \nThat was one of numerous Assembly resolutions in \nwhich the nations of the world pledged their support \nfor the eradication of apartheid. \n Within months of the adoption of that important \nresolution, the ban on South African liberation \nmovements was lifted. Nelson Mandela and other \npolitical prisoners were released. The stage was thus \n  \n \n09-52228 20 \n \nset for the negotiations that would eventually lead to \nthe achievement of freedom and democracy in our \ncountry. \n The role of the United Nations in the struggle to \nend apartheid is an exceptional example of the \ncollective political will of the international community. \nIt represented the victory of unity over division and of \nnegotiation over confrontation. It represented a clear \ncommitment to the promotion of basic human rights. \nAs South Africans, we will always be grateful for that \ninternational solidarity. \n Since the advent of democracy in 1994, we have \nbuilt a solid, stable democracy, founded on the \nprinciples of unity, non-sexism, non-racialism and \ndemocracy. As we continue to build our young nation, \nwe are cognizant of the need for a conducive \ninternational environment. For that reason, we are \ncommitted to playing our part, with the rest of the \ninternational community, in taking forward the fight \nagainst poverty and in responding to the crises that are \nconfronting the world today. We must act now, \ntogether, to halt the degradation of the environment. \nWe must act now, together, to prevent the global \neconomic crisis from undoing the gains that we have \nachieved over decades. \n The eradication of poverty must remain central to \nthe work of the United Nations. The Organization must \ncontinue to work harder to unite the world to work to \nalleviate the suffering of the world\u2019s poor and \nmarginalized. The global economic meltdown has dealt \na heavy blow to world efforts to eradicate poverty. But \nit should not diminish our resolve. \n The United Nations must play a significant role \nin finding solutions to the global economic crisis. The \ncrisis should not be an excuse to delay further action \non the delivery of the Millennium Development Goals. \nRather, it should urge us to double our efforts to \nachieve greater and faster progress. Developing \ncountries did not cause the economic crisis, but they \nare severely affected by it. The crisis has further \nhighlighted the urgent need for fundamental reform of \nthe Bretton Woods institutions, including their \nmandate, scope, governance and responsiveness. \n These institutions have been unrepresentative \nsince their formation half a century ago. The current \narrangements are inadequate and unfair. They do not \nreflect the changes that have taken place in the global \neconomy. We should ensure that the election of the \nheads of all those institutions is more democratic, and \nopens opportunities to developing countries. The \nemerging and developing countries, including the \npoorest, must have a greater voice and greater \nparticipation in those institutions. Similarly, if we are \nto eradicate poverty there is an urgent need to conclude \nthe Doha Round of trade negotiations in a manner that \nprioritizes development. \n We continue to work for an African renewal, and \nwelcome the ongoing support of the United Nations \nsystem in addressing the challenges facing the \ncontinent. Now more than ever, it is necessary for the \nUnited Nations to ensure that the international \ncommunity collectively implements the commitments \nmade to Africa. We have a viable socio-economic \ndevelopment blueprint, the New Partnership for \nAfrica\u2019s Development, which should be used in \nmobilizing resources for Africa. We appreciate that \nthere can be no lasting peace without development, and \nno development without security. \n Over the past 20 years, Africa has made much \nprogress in working to end conflicts and to promote \ndemocratic practices and institutions. However, some \npockets of conflict persist. For its part, South Africa \nhas been engaged in mediation, conflict prevention and \npeacekeeping on the continent, in, among other places, \nBurundi, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo. \n The African Union has the political will to \nresolve conflicts on the continent. However, it lacks \nresources to run effective peacekeeping interventions \nand conflict prevention mechanisms. We appeal for \nsupport for African peacemaking efforts, and for \ngreater cooperation between the United Nations and \nthe African Union. In this regard, we call on the \nGeneral Assembly to align itself with resolutions of the \nAfrican Union and the Southern African Development \nCommunity that do not recognize Governments that \ncome into power by force or other unconstitutional \nmeans. \n The search for global peace, stability and security \ncannot be separated from the pursuit of justice, \nself-determination, human rights and economic \ndevelopment. We need to constantly reaffirm the \ninalienable human rights of all people. We call for the \nfull and effective implementation of the outcomes of \nthe World Conference against Racism and the \nsubsequent Durban Review Conference. It is of \n \n \n21 09-52228 \n \nconcern that at the close of the first decade of the \ntwenty-first century there are still nations that find \ntheir lands occupied and their peoples oppressed.  \n We are convinced that urgent and concrete steps \nare needed to resolve the situation in Western Sahara. \n We must work with similar urgency towards the \nachievement, through negotiations, of peaceful \ncoexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. This \nmust be based on the creation of a viable Palestinian \nState, existing side by side with Israel, within the 1967 \nborders, which must be secure and internationally \nrecognized. \n We also call for the lifting of the economic, \ncommercial and financial embargo on Cuba. \n We also appreciate the recent pronouncements by \nsome nuclear-weapon States on their intention to \nreduce their nuclear arsenals. \n Let us take up this new momentum and utilize the \nopportunity of the 2010 Review Conference of the \nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT) to recommit ourselves to the \nfull implementation of obligations under the NPT. We \nshould ensure a balance among the objectives of \ndisarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of \nnuclear energy. \n For Africa, the impact of climate change is \ndevastating and will severely undermine development \nand poverty eradication efforts. We need to act now to \nensure that there is an inclusive, fair and effective \nglobal agreement on this critical challenge. The \nagreement must recognize that solving the climate \nproblem cannot be separated from the struggle to \neradicate poverty. Developed countries bear the \ngreatest responsibility for climate change and its \nimpact. We must therefore strike a balance between \nadaptation and mitigation. Our goal should be to \nsignificantly reduce emissions across the globe without \nconstraining development in the countries of the South. \n Ms. McClean (Barbados), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n Developed countries must make ambitious, \nquantified and legally binding emission reduction \ncommitments that are in line with science and that \naddress their historical responsibilities. At Copenhagen, \nthere needs to be agreement on new, additional, \nsustainable and predictable financing for adaptation. \nThis should be for programmes that reduce the \nvulnerability of developing countries to the effects of \nclimate change. \n In a world that is increasingly interconnected and \ninterdependent, international problems can be resolved \neffectively only through multilateral cooperation. The \nUnited Nations must continue to be at the centre of \nmultilateralism, but it needs to be reformed if it is to \ncarry out its mandate effectively, efficiently and \ntransparently. \n We remain committed to the view that no reform \nof the United Nations can be complete without the \nfundamental reform of the Security Council. It must be \nrepresentative of the international community and \nreflect the geopolitical realities of today. If the Security \nCouncil is not reformed and does not have permanent \nrepresentation for Africa, the legitimacy of the \nCouncil\u2019s decisions will continue to be questioned. \nSouth Africa continues to advocate an expansion in \nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories of \nmembership. \n Let me express our appreciation to the world for \nthe celebration of the inaugural Nelson Mandela Day \non 18 July this year. Scores of people engaged in a \nminimum of 67 minutes of voluntary action in the \nservice of humanity, in honour of our icon, President \nMandela. The Non-Aligned Movement has joined the \ncall for this General Assembly to declare 18 July \nNelson Mandela Day. This would be in recognition of \nPresident Mandela\u2019s contribution to the struggle for \ndemocracy and the cause of humanity, and to promote \ncommunity service across the globe. In this regard, we \nhope that the General Assembly will adopt a consensus \nresolution in support of Nelson Mandela Day. \n South Africa is privileged to host the 2010 \nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association \nWorld Cup in the middle of next year, which will be \nthe first time that the tournament has been held on \nAfrican soil. We look forward to hosting the peoples of \nthe world, who will enjoy unique African hospitality \nand vibrancy. \n I wish to take this opportunity to thank the \noutgoing President of the General Assembly for his \nleadership at the sixty-third session of the Assembly. I \nthank the General Assembly and representatives for the \nopportunity to address this esteemed gathering. \nWorking together as a global family, we can do more to \ncreate a better and just world."

        "file_text": "Allow me at \nthe outset, Sir, to congratulate you on your election to \n  \n \n09-52179 30 \n \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfourth session. I wish you every success in your task. \n I would also like to thank your predecessor, my \nfriend Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for his tireless \nwork during the previous session. \n I would also like to thank His Excellency \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his effort to \nstrengthen the role of the United Nations. \n This new session of the General Assembly \ncoincides with a unique international situation \u2014 one \nof those situations that take shape at a critical juncture \nof major historical developments. Such situations \npresent an opportunity to lay foundations, stress \nprinciples and regulate systems of international \ninteraction and relations. \n In our view, the present situation is similar to \nthose that prevailed on the eve of the conferences of \nVienna (1814), Versailles (1919) and Potsdam (1945). \n This situation, and the opportunity it presents in \ntoday\u2019s world, is fertile ground for embarking on a \nsearch for a different future. It comes in the wake of a \nperiod of violent turmoil in which the world was \nburned by the fires of World War II, was bitten by the \nfrost of the cold war, and went adrift \u2014 especially after \nthe 11 September 2001 tragedy \u2014 in the fallout from \nthe war on terrorism. This was followed by the \nfinancial market crisis just last year. \n The succession of major developments has \naltered the world map, changed the balance of power \nand influence, and brought in capable parties from \nEurope, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and \nAfrica. It has also generated a renewal-seeking \nmovement in the United States of America that we are \nfollowing with interest and we sincerely hope will \nsucceed. \n We note that during the stages of the global \nconfrontation and polarization, and the significant \nturmoil that followed both of them, the international \ncommunity lived in, and suffered from, severe \nconfusion, when it became clear that achieving world \npeace and prosperity required more than the weapons \nof the mighty Powers, more than a bipolarity of States, \nmore than the hegemony of one country \u2014 no matter \nhow advanced that country might be \u2014 and a broader \nand more comprehensive global management of urgent \ncrises. \n In such a situation, the significance of the \nopportunity looms large, after long years of firestorms, \nsnow blizzards and dust storms, signalling to us that \nthe world requires something new. In fact, that obvious \nfact stands out against the background of our harsh \nprior experience. \n However, we have been failing to pay attention to \nit, despite the numerous appeals pointing to it and the \nsincere attempts calling for renewal so that the \nOrganization can fulfil its mission in changing times \nand remain a standard and reference of international \nlegitimacy. This requirement for change covers the \nwhole of the United Nations system with all its \nbranches and agencies. \n It is clear to us that the serious crises of the world \nwere exacerbated when nations with major influence in \nthe international order decided to transfer tackling the \nmost important issues of war, peace and progress from \nthe United Nations framework to other extraneous \nframeworks. \n Such was the case with regard to conventional \nand nuclear arms, security agreements and \narrangements covering the broad spectrum from outer \nspace to policy and economics. The reasons given for \ngoing outside the United Nations framework were, as \nsome believed, that such issues were beyond the \ncapability of the smaller States that represent the \nmajority of United Nations Members. \n Thus, according to this approach, the absence of \nthe smaller States would make dealing with the issues \nat hand easier. But in the emerging circumstances and \nrealities, those who advocate the monopolizing of \ninternational decision-making need to realize that we \nlive in one world. And in a world like this one, concern \nis equal, even though the distribution of power may not \nbe. \n This attitude represents for us a confirmation of \nour view, by which we stand firm. Namely, that it is \ntime to go back to the United Nations system as a \nframework that accommodates everyone, provides a \nvenue recognized by all, and has a Charter accepted by \nall nations mindful that equal rights do not run counter \nto a division of responsibilities which takes into \naccount the different levels of capability of the parties. \n We are aware and appreciative of the great \nimportance of an overarching international authority as \nexpressed by a legitimate international order and \n \n \n31 09-52179 \n \ngoverned by a Charter, by the law, and by an \nexperience of a harsh and bloody political history. That \nappreciation stems from our intimate familiarity with \nthe crises and complex situations of the Middle East, \nwhich became intertwined and increasingly ominous \nwhen addressed outside the United Nations framework, \non the assumption that the new setting could yield \nswifter and more effective solutions. In fact, that \napproach was merely an aimless diversion that only \ncaused greater confusion and complexity. \n Resorting to the authority of the United Nations \nis essential not only to resolve intractable crises such \nas the ones in the Middle East, but also to realize \naspirations that can be fulfilled only through a \nlegitimate international consensus and within an agreed \nframework. One such pressing crisis is the quest for \nalternative energy sources. Another equally urgent \nissue is that of climate change and its definite impact \non the environment and life on this planet. \n As for the issue of energy, while it would seem \nthat oil-producing countries are benefiting from \ncontinued world dependence on their oil production, I \nwish to stress to the Assembly that we consider global \nsecurity to be our security and global prosperity to be \nour prosperity. There can be neither peace nor \nprosperity when global civilization is threatened by an \nenergy crisis that is far greater than a war of any kind, \neven a nuclear war. \n With regard to the issue of climate change, I \nshould like to take this opportunity to thank His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations, for having organized the Summit on \nClimate Change yesterday within the framework of the \nUnited Nations to discuss this most serious challenge, \nwhich threatens not only the security of the planet but \nalso all life on it. \n We believe that, while the United Nations system \ncomprises a comprehensive range of institutions, those \ninstitutions require urgent renewal and strengthening \nso that United Nations work will be commensurate \nwith the new realities in the community of nations on \nall continents. At this session, we face a historic \nsituation \u2014 an opportunity that does not present itself \nvery often. It is the duty of the international \ncommunity, and in particular of its powerful members, \nto shoulder their responsibilities by responding to that \nopportunity. \n Almighty God has blessed the State of Qatar with \nvast hydrocarbon resources, including the giant North \nGas Field, whose resources make Qatar the third-\nlargest country in the world in terms of natural gas \nreserves. Since the Field was discovered, the \nGovernment has sought to develop concepts and plans \nfor projects to supply the local market with gas and to \nexport liquefied natural gas to world markets, as well \nas for the gas-to-liquid process, petrochemical \nindustries and other projects using natural gas, whose \nconsumption is less harmful to the environment than \nthat of other fossil substances. While the State of Qatar \nhas sufficient reserves to meet its needs for decades to \ncome, we are fully aware of the future challenges \nfacing the international community in terms of the \nimplications of greenhouse gas emissions, climate \nchange and their negative effects on sustainable \ndevelopment projects. \n The State of Qatar is aware of the enormous \npotential of clean and renewable energy sources \u2014 in \nparticular solar energy, which is abundantly available \nin our climate. The Government has encouraged our \nindustries, educational institutions and scientific \nresearch centres to develop renewable energy \ntechnologies that will help to improve efficiency and \nperformance and are suited to local conditions. \n The State of Qatar looks forward to a more \nintensive international effort to share information and \nexpertise in the development of solar and other \nrenewable energies. We urge developed countries to \nshare modern technologies in that area and to \ncontribute to the implementation and financing of \nrenewable energy projects throughout the world."

        "file_text": "In \ncircumstances like these, I would normally speak for \nabout an hour, but I would like to assure you, Sir, and \nthe Assembly that the quality of mercy is not strained \nand that I will be considerably briefer than that. Today, \nI propose to stay within the time allotted to me. \n Trinidad and Tobago extends its sincerest \ncongratulations to the President on his ascension to the \nstewardship of this sixty-fourth session of the General \nAssembly. We know that his vast experience and \nleadership qualities will ensure very successful \ndeliberations. We also pay tribute to his predecessor, \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua, for his \nvision and fearless discharge of his responsibilities as \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. \n We convey our very best wishes to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, whom we welcomed to Port of \nSpain earlier this year when Trinidad and Tobago \nhosted the fifth Summit of the Americas. We assure \nhim of our continuing support as he pursues his \n  \n \n09-52586 16 \n \nmission to ensure that the United Nations meets the \nnew challenges of the twenty-first century. \n We meet at a time of very serious challenges for \nthe world economy. We are now beginning to emerge \nfrom a global recession caused by a near collapse of \nthe international financial system, but there is no room \nfor complacency. Unemployment continues to grow in \nalmost every country, credit remains contracted and \nconsumer confidence, that most critical factor, persists \nat very low levels. Additionally, there is no certainty of \na steady upward trajectory for the global economy. \nValued opinion on this matter points to the possibility \nof further recessionary trends before the present green \nshoots produce flourishing green fields. \n We clearly cannot take our eye off the ball. We \nmust not return to business as usual. We should not \ncountenance the resurfacing of discredited patterns on \nfinancial streets and capitals. We must be wary of the \nlevel of adventurousness in leading financial \ninstitutions that contributed very significantly to \ndriving the world to the edge of an economic precipice \nfrom which we are just starting to pull back. There is \njustification for concern about this situation in every \ncountry on this planet. In the globalized economy, we \nare all affected by policies or actions that direct the \ninternational financial system. \n We of the smaller countries and the developing \nworld have always been the most vulnerable and the \nworst affected. It is happening again. Especially in the \nsouthern hemisphere, the prospects have grown for \nincreased poverty, unemployment and general slippage \nin the development process. How much longer will this \nacute vulnerability of so many nations persist? How \nmany more dreams must now, once again, be deferred? \n The trust of the world in the totally unregulated \nmarket has been entirely misplaced. We must now \ncapitalize on the opportunity of this crisis and, without \ndelay, reform our international economic system. The \nglobal architecture must be transformed to take the \nnew realities into account. Among these are new and \nemerging centres of economic power and the now \nindispensable need to deliberately generate growth in \nthe developing world if the global economy is to \nachieve resurgence and sustainability. In this extremely \ninterconnected world, it is our collective resources, \ningenuity, productivity, markets and technology that \nwill keep all of us afloat. \n Let this General Assembly therefore play its part \nin ensuring that we leave behind the old approaches \nthat suffocated development of the many for the benefit \nof the few. Let it call for greater recognition of the \nabsolute need to bring into the global mainstream the \nentire productive and purchasing capacity of this \nplanet, our collective home. \n We are heartened by developments and decisions \namong the countries of the Group of 20, but we must \nensure that there is absolutely no reversal of the new \napproach; no dimming of the new light that the present \ncrisis has generated; and no diminution of the \nacceptance that we are all in this together and that \ndevelopment everywhere translates into prosperity for \nall. Let us therefore ensure that the reform of \ninternational financial institutions does indeed take \nplace; that we entrench greater sensitivity to the \nvarying needs of countries at differing levels of \ndevelopment; that new voices, respecting and \nrepresenting more of humanity, are in the decision-\nmaking process; and that resource flows for trade and \ninvestment are in fact realized and activated. \n The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has not \nbeen spared the debilitating effects of the current \nglobal economic situation. Most CARICOM States are \nnow experiencing economic contraction and rising \nlevels of debt and unemployment, with their \nchallenging social consequences. It is therefore \nregrettable that some middle-income countries, such as \nmany in CARICOM, may not be eligible for funding \nunder some of the World Bank\u2019s facilities for \ninternational development assistance.  \n Given their vulnerabilities, middle-income \ncountries\u2019 need for access to concessionary financing \nmust not be underestimated. This was highlighted in \n2008 at the Third Ministerial Conference of Middle-\nIncome Countries in Namibia, which called for \nenhanced levels of international development \nassistance and noted that the current categorization \ndoes not accurately reflect the particularities and needs \nof these nations. This General Assembly must take \nsteps to advance the cause of middle-income countries \nin this matter. \n The situation in Haiti is one of grave concern. We \nare encouraged by the diverse United Nations-related \ninitiatives aimed at promoting peace and security in \nthat country, but greater attention is required by the \ninternational community. Arising out of the Fifth \n \n \n17 09-52586 \n \nSummit of the Americas, Trinidad and Tobago has \nadvanced a proposal for the establishment of a \nhemispheric development fund for Haiti, to which all \nwestern hemisphere countries would be expected to \ncontribute. Haiti is first and foremost a western \nhemisphere challenge, and we see this fund as essential \nto the re-establishment of proper standards of living in \nthat country. We bring this matter before the General \nAssembly for its support. \n One of the very significant problems facing the \nglobal community is transnational organized crime of \nincreasing strength, which includes terrorist activity as \nwell as the illegal traffic in drugs, arms and persons. \nThe Caribbean is particularly plagued by the illegal \ndrug trade, which uses our region as a trans-shipment \nroute for its pernicious cargo headed northwards. This \nactivity has a corrosive effect on our small societies, \nfuelling, for example, trafficking in small arms and \nlight weapons, with troubling consequences.  \n In CARICOM, we have been pooling our \nresources for this fight. There is now unprecedented \ncooperation among the legal and security systems of \nour countries, but we need more resources in our \nstruggle with this menace. We will continue to engage \nin the various processes of the United Nations aimed at \naddressing this problem. We encourage those Member \nStates that have not been supportive of the initiative \naimed at negotiating a legally binding arms trade treaty \nto join those States working to ensure that it becomes a \nreality. \n But the security situation has been aggravated by \nthe deteriorating economic situation in many of our \ncountries, weakened by the loss of preferential markets \nfor bananas and sugar. The situation is exacerbated by \nthe new paradigm of reciprocity in trade, and by the \nfact that both the tourism industry and the financial \nservices sector, to which many have turned to \nsupplement their economic development, have not \nproduced the anticipated returns. The economic \nsituation of these countries has therefore become even \nmore critical, with severe consequences for the security \nand prosperity of our region, given the inextricable link \nbetween security and socio-economic development. \n Climate change is one of the major challenges \nfacing our civilization today. The Secretary-General \nmust be highly commended for his commitment to \ndealing with this issue, which he declared as a priority \nat the start of his tenure. In this regard, we add our \nvoices to those that have praised highly the United \nNations Summit on Climate Change, which has just \nconcluded. This General Assembly must promote more \nmeaningful action directed towards an internationally \nacceptable formula for the reduction of carbon \nemissions. \n Trinidad and Tobago wishes to make it absolutely \nclear that we do not accept the per capita basis for the \ndetermination of levels of carbon emissions. It is \nmanifestly unfair to a small, energy-producing \ndeveloping country like ours with a small population. \nWe consider the method of absolute emissions to be a \nmore just method of determining a country\u2019s \ncontribution to global warming, since it is affected not \nby per capita emissions, but by absolute levels. The \nquestion of population size, in this context, has nothing \nto do with the matter whatsoever. \n We also assure the Assembly that our country has \nalready voluntarily embarked on reducing emissions \nthrough a programme that includes the pursuit of \nrenewable sources of supply. We will also be hosting \nthe 53 Commonwealth heads of Government at a \nmeeting in Port of Spain in November of this year. This \nwill be the last major summit before the Copenhagen \nClimate Change Summit in December. We propose to \nuse the opportunity to attempt to forge a consensus that \nwould reflect the common views of the \nCommonwealth, comprising as it does both high \ngreenhouse-gas emitters and some of the countries \nmost threatened by climate change. We are determined \nto do all in our power to ensure agreement in \nCopenhagen. \n We are firmly of the view that non-communicable \ndiseases demand the heightened attention of the \ninternational community at this time. It has been \nforecast that by 2020 non-communicable diseases will \naccount for approximately 73 per cent of global deaths \nand 60 per cent of the global burden of disease. We \njoin the call for indicators on non-communicable \ndiseases and injuries to be integrated into the core \nmonitoring and evaluation system of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We have taken this matter on \nboard at the level of the Caribbean Community. Indeed, \nwe held a special regional summit in Port of Spain on \nchronic non-communicable diseases in 2007. I now \npropose that this Assembly convene a special summit \nmeeting of the United Nations on non-communicable \ndiseases at the earliest opportunity. \n  \n \n09-52586 18 \n \n The year 2015 is fast approaching, but there has \nbeen, sadly, no encouraging progress towards our \nMillennium Development Goal of food security for all \nby that date. Indeed, we have fallen behind in our \nschedule, with an increase in deaths from hunger and \nmalnutrition in the developing world. A much greater \nsense of urgency is needed in our approach to this \nsituation. All countries must honour their commitments \nmade at the 2008 High-Level Conference on World \nFood Security. Trinidad and Tobago therefore looks \nforward to the next World Summit on Food Security, \nscheduled for November in Rome, with the expectation \nthat the results will aid the international community in \nachieving the revised target set by the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations to \neradicate hunger by 2025. \n My country is committed to an international order \nbased on peace, security and the right to development \nof all countries. We believe that democracy and \nrepresentation are key to achieving meaningful and \neffective multilateralism. We therefore wish again to \nsupport efforts to reform the Security Council. Reform \nof that important organ of the United Nations, \nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \nand security, must include efforts aimed at making its \ncomposition reflect more closely the global \ngeopolitical realities since the end of the Second World \nWar. \n In this new century, the United Nations must \nbecome an even more effective voice for all of \nmankind. We have very important work ahead of us at \na very challenging time in our history. Let us never \nlose sight of our main purpose, which is the security \nand development of the people of the world. Let us \nrenew our focus on this main objective. \n Let us therefore support the reign of fundamental \nfreedoms and human rights in every country. Let us \nstrive for the individual empowerment of citizens in \nevery nation; let there be opportunity and upward \nmobility for all; let none be marginalized on the \nperiphery; and let the abundant talent and potential of \nhumanity flower everywhere, serving as inspiration, \nguidance and example to present and future \ngenerations. \n Let us therefore join our strengths for the benefit \nof all. Let us indeed build a global community where \nthere is increasing and intensified cooperation and \ncommunication among our nations, where no country \nlags behind, and where all nations and their peoples are \non the international road to development.

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, \nSir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly and on the very effective manner in which \nyou are presiding over its proceedings. I also pay \ntribute to your predecessor, Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann, \nfor his leadership and commitment and for the very \nable manner in which he guided us throughout the past \nsession. Under his leadership, a lot was achieved and \nwe also weathered a number of turbulent storms. \n The global economic environment has \nexperienced many challenges since our last session. \nNever before has our common goal of advancing the \npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter \nfor the betterment of all mankind been so tested. The \nchallenges confronting humanity have since grown \ntenfold, both in scope and magnitude. The sheer \nenormity of these fast-evolving challenges threatens \nthe very existence of the human race and the security \nof our planet. \n I am convinced that these challenges are neither \nbeyond our collective capability to address, nor are \nthey insurmountable. Our moral imperative is to ensure \n \n \n09-53165 40 \n \nthat the United Nations has the requisite resources, the \ntools and the capability to respond to the ever-changing \nenvironment in a timely, effective and decisive manner \nin order to help Member States address the many \ncomplex and multidimensional challenges. \n It is important to remind ourselves of the decision \nwe adopted at the World Summit in 2005 to \n \u201cstrengthen the United Nations with a view to \nenhancing its authority and efficiency, as well as \nits capacity to address effectively \u2026 the full \nrange of challenges of our time\u201d. (resolution 60/1, \npara. 146) \n In that respect, my delegation welcomes the \nprogress made in implementing ongoing reforms of the \nUnited Nations with a view to streamlining rules, \nmandates and policies in order to promote \ntransparency, coherence and efficiency in the system. \n The global economic crisis that has besieged us \nhas accentuated existing challenges and made them \nmore complex. The crisis has been felt more seriously \nin developing countries. Human, financial and other \nresources are severely overstretched as countries seek \ncreative and innovative ways to mitigate what has \nbecome the greatest economic threat of our time. The \ncrisis therefore warrants a concerted effort involving \nboth developed and developing countries. We should \nemerge from the crisis stronger and wiser, with new \nthinking about a new global financial architecture. \n In the present circumstances, poverty levels in \nmany economies appear to be spiraling out of control. \nOur poverty reduction strategies therefore need to be \nrevised to face the new challenges. That goes for the \ncommitments we signed on to at the 1995 Copenhagen \nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development and at the \n2000 Millennium Summit. The new strategy should \nfocus on raising the living standards of all people the \nworld over. In dealing with those challenges, we \nshould deploy all the resources of nature and \ntechnology to better life on the planet. But in doing so \nwe should avoid any actions that could endanger the \nvery lives that we want to uplift. \n The devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic is among \nthe myriad challenges to which we committed \nourselves to tackle through international cooperation \nand assistance. HIV/AIDS undoubtedly continues to be \none of the most daunting challenges of our time. \n In June of last year, our leaders gathered in New \nYork for the midterm review of the implementation of \nthe goals and targets of the Declaration of Commitment \non HIV/AIDS, which was adopted in 2001. The review \nrevealed that, despite heightened political momentum \nand national and global responses to HIV/AIDS, not \nmuch progress had been made towards mitigating its \neffects. Only a handful of countries were reported to be \non track to achieving some of their commitments, \nwhile the majority of countries were found to be \nlagging far behind in implementing them. That \nsituation underscores the urgent need to accelerate the \nmomentum for universal access to HIV/AIDS \nprevention, treatment, care and support. \n The ongoing global economic crisis has already \nplaced people living with HIV/AIDS at great risk, as \nmany countries have had to cut down on some \nHIV/AIDS programmes due to budgetary constraints. \nBudget reductions in HIV/AIDS programmes, in \nparticular, in developing countries, will obviously \nresult in increased loss of life, as well as an increase in \nthe cost of health care in the future. \n We need to redouble our implementation efforts \nas we draw closer to the 2010 deadline for achieving \nthe goal of ensuring universal access to HIV/AIDS \nprevention, treatment, care and support. To that end, it \nis essential that as Governments we renew our \ncommitment to put our people first when it comes to \nthe kind of policies and programmes we formulate and \nimplement. \n The adverse impact of climate change and global \nwarming is another problem that requires our urgent \nand sustained attention. Our collective response to the \nchallenge of climate change and global warming \nnecessitates pragmatism and decisive action. History \nwill judge us harshly if we cannot muster the political \nwill and commitment to put in place measures required \nto save planet Earth. The Copenhagen meeting \nscheduled for December of this year provides an \nopportunity to galvanize the efforts of the international \ncommunity to address the challenges of climate \nchange. \n More important, the Copenhagen meeting will be \na defining moment in the negotiations on the global \ncommitments to be made with regard to the Kyoto \nProtocol after 2012. Botswana is strongly committed to \nthose negotiations. We will do everything in our power \nto ensure their successful and timely conclusion. We \n \n \n41 09-53165 \n \ntherefore call upon Member States to ensure that no \neffort is spared in giving the issues under negotiation \nthe priority attention that they deserve. \n Turning to international peace and security, my \ndelegation is deeply concerned about the deterioration \nof the global security situation. We are convinced that \nthe security of our world is dependent upon the entire \nmembership of the United Nations working in unison. \n The number and intensity of conflicts still raging \nin some parts of the world, in particular in Africa, is a \ncause for grave concern. It is sad that Africa appears \u2014 \nat least in my estimation \u2014 to have experienced more \nincidents of civil strife and violent confrontation than \nany other part of the world. In that regard, it is worth \nnoting that the Security Council remains seized of \nconflict situations and developments in a number of \nAfrican countries and regions, including Chad, the \nCentral African Republic, the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo, the Great Lakes region, Eritrea and \nEthiopia, Somalia and the Sudan, to name but a few. \n Somalia remains the most dangerous place in the \nworld, and a blemish on the conscience of the \ninternational community. Incidents of violence, \nkidnapping, banditry and piracy abound. Peacekeepers \nhave also not been spared that barbarity. We commend \nBurundi and Uganda for the courage and heroism of \ntheir troops in support of the peace effort. International \nsupport and assistance is urgently required to deploy a \nstabilization force to strengthen the African Union \nMission in Somalia and to support long-term peace and \nstability in that country. \n With regard to the situations in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo and the Great Lakes region, it is \nthanks to the collective efforts of the United Nations \nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo and former President Obasanjo of Nigeria, \nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for the \nGreat Lakes Region, as well as other international \ninitiatives, that there are now prospects for positive \ndevelopments. However, we should not underestimate \nthe gravity of the challenges that continue to hamper \nthe achievement of lasting peace, stability and \nsustainable development in that region and many more \nin Africa. \n Apart from finding lasting solutions to conflicts, \nwe should put in place measures to deal with post-\nconflict situations, as there is a danger that countries \nemerging from conflict could easily relapse into it. \nRegional bodies such as the African Union, as well as \nthe United Nations, must stay focused on assisting \ncountries to deal with both conflict and post-conflict \nsituations. \n We all know the causes of conflict and instability. \nThey are the result of bad governance, mismanagement \nof national resources and the absence of democracy. In \nthat respect, we cannot simply demand the full and \nactive support of the international community in efforts \nto achieve lasting peace and stability. We must do more \nto consolidate the democratic process, respect for \nhuman rights and the rule of law. In that way, we \nwould be more deserving and worthy of assistance. \n Botswana is disturbed by the emerging trend of \ncoups and of the unconstitutional transfer of power in \nAfrica and in other parts of the world. We had thought \nthat the era of military coups was now history. We \nunreservedly condemn the coups that took place in \nMauritania, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar and \nHonduras. We would have been very disappointed if \none such as Rajoelina, who masterminded the \noverthrow of a democratically elected Government in \nMadagascar, had been allowed to address this \nAssembly. We therefore applaud the decision taken by \nthe General Assembly in that regard.  \n The Southern Africa Development Community \ncorrectly decided to suspend the regime in Madagascar \nfrom participating in the councils and structures of the \nsubregional organization. Our continental organization, \nthe African Union, has also maintained a principled \nposition of automatically suspending any regime that \ncomes into power by overthrowing the constitutional \norder. The international community must be united in \nits determination to isolate the regime in Antananarivo. \nWe must not give it any comfort by embracing it in \ninternational forums. \n We are also witnessing a disturbing development \nthat undermines democracy and subverts the will of the \npeople. There is a growing resort to changing \nconstitutions in order to prolong the grip on power of \nleaders and political parties that have lost elections. In \nthat regard, Africa, and indeed the world at large, must \ncollectively and in one voice reject the extra-\nparliamentary transfer of power and isolate illegal \nregimes until constitutional order is restored. \nEmbracing them in any small measure would be \nimmoral and would perpetuate those hideous acts \nthroughout the globe. \n \n \n09-53165 42 \n \n The world can be a better place for us and for \nfuture generations if we persistently nurture democratic \npractices, good governance and respect for the rule of \nlaw. As leaders, we should commit to building \nfraternity and greater mutual understanding among \npeoples across cultures and faiths. We have the \nresponsibility to lead by example. We must desist from \nusing inflammatory language that promotes tension and \nconflicts. \n We cannot and must not condone leaders who, for \ntheir own selfish interests, change the constitutions of \ntheir countries in order to ensure their continued stay in \npower. At the same time, we should ensure that our \nelections are credible and that they reflect the \nsovereign will of the people. Governments should not \nbe allowed to conduct elections and then tamper with \nthe outcomes in order to suit their interests. People \nmust be allowed to freely choose their leaders. \n Botswana reiterates its position that it is fully \ncommitted to respecting the integrity and impartiality \nof the International Criminal Court so that it can freely \ncarry out its judicial mandate. We equally support the \nprinciple of universal jurisdiction under international \nlaw and practice. However, we object to situations \nwherein its abuse becomes blatant. \n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the daunting \nchallenges facing our world today, as stated previously, \ncannot and should not be tackled by any one country or \nby a group of countries alone. They require a strong \nmultilateral approach that needs the commitment and \nunyielding support of the international community as a \nwhole. Let us join hands together in an effort to \naddress those complex challenges. Our timely, \ncoordinated and effective action will go a long way in \nsecuring a better future for generations to come. \n  "

        "file_text": "Allow me at \nthe outset to convey my congratulations to the \nPresident of the General Assembly and to wish him \nvery fruitful work. \n Can you imagine a General Assembly where the \nrepresentatives of States and Governments who follow \none another on this rostrum would bring us only good \nnews, inform us that our world is doing better and that \nmost development indicators are at their best level \never? We are very far indeed from such an ideal. \n It would even seem that, in addition to numerous \ncrises of all kinds \u2014 food, energy, financial and so \nforth \u2014 that are already exacting a very high toll on \nour populations, some of us must now get used to \nrecurrent upheavals resulting from natural disasters. \nEach time, we have to rebuild the same ruined \ninfrastructure; we have to restore the same productive \ncapacities that have been swept away by cyclones and \nfloods. And, for lack of sufficient resources, the \nreconstruction process is never launched in time. We \nfind we are having to prepare for the return of these \ndisasters even before our communities have recovered \nfrom the previous ones. This, evidently, is the new life \ncycle that vulnerable countries such as ours must be \nprepared for. With, of course, insufficient resources at \ntheir disposal. \n \n \n39 09-52425 \n \n This situation is no accident. It is the direct \nconsequence of a development and governance model \nthat nations recognized as powerful have imposed on \nthe rest of the world for centuries: a development and \ngovernance model that is largely concerned with the \nwelfare of money and too little with the welfare of \npeople; a development model that, even in very rich \ncountries, imposes a precarious existence on major \nsections of the population, which lack health care, \ndecent housing and even a good education. \n Why should the whole of humankind accept that \nhalf the inhabitants of our planet should live with these \nprivations, in hunger and misery, with no prospect of \nimprovement in their situation? Why should the whole \nof humankind accept that our planet should be \nendangered irresponsibly, that species should be \ncondemned to extinction or that, through climate \nchange, our populations should become more \nvulnerable to natural disasters merely because of \nselfish economic choices by a small minority of \npolluters? \n What substance can we give to our membership \nin this human community that the United Nations seeks \nto champion? To paraphrase George Orwell, beyond a \ncertain level of inequality, there is no common world \nanymore. The glaring inequalities that characterize our \ncountries\u2019 situations are an obstacle to the formation of \nthe great family that the United Nations should be. \n The time has come to oppose the globalization of \nprofit at any price, which has become the new credo, \nand to replace it with the globalization of solidarity, \nwhich alone will ensure the eradication of poverty, as \nrequired by this Assembly.  \n Here, I should reiterate to members that the true \nvehicle for peace, stability and security is development. \nThe aid received by our countries will be ineffective \nand a source of great frustration for donors and \nbeneficiaries unless it is part of a plan to create and \ndevelop the productive potential of our countries. That \nis the only way to put an end to the cycle of poverty \nand dependence. \n Haitians, like many other peoples of the South, \nare a hardworking, clever and entrepreneurial people \nequipped with great resilience forged by dealing with \ndaily setbacks and able to utilize to the extreme and \noptimize the scant resources made available to them. \nOur peoples yearn to mobilize that potential and that \ncapacity to take the path of sustainable development.  \n Developing our countries is thus a possible \nendeavour. However, all the efforts under way could \nremain ineffective unless we are able to develop a new \nparadigm for international cooperation \u2014 a paradigm \nrequiring that we transcend the logic of human \nassistance and recognize the capacity of poor peoples \nto engage in business and produce wealth, using the \nmeans and opportunities afforded them to strengthen \ntheir productive capacity. Without such a new vision, \nwhich breaks with the culture of perpetual \nhumanitarian assistance, peace and stability will \nremain precarious and fleeting achievements.  \n Permit me to add a few words about Haiti, \nbecause my country is the focus of particular attention \nby the Security Council. Over the past three years, \ndespite the negative effects of numerous international \ncrises on our economy, significant progress has been \nmade, in particular in the areas of security, respect for \nhuman rights, the investment climate, eliminating \ncorruption and building a friendly society in which \ndialogue occupies a central place, supported and \nreported on by totally free and independent media. \nThat progress must be deepened and expanded. That is \nwhy United Nations support is necessary for us.  \n In his report to the Security Council, the \nSecretary-General recommended that the mandate of \nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \n(MINUSTAH) be extended for another year. That \nproposal is most welcome, and we fully endorse it. We \nare convinced that the right balance among its military, \npolice and administrative components will best place \nMINUSTAH to assist our country more effectively in \nconsolidating an atmosphere of peace and stability, \nwithout making it indifferent to our struggle to rebuild \nand to reduce poverty and vulnerability. I thank the \nSecretary-General for having chosen Bill Clinton as his \nSpecial Envoy to our country. I also thank the former \nPresident, a friend of Haiti, for having agreed to help \nus.  \n Many summits organized under United Nations \nauspices produce resolutions and commitments that are \nconsigned to oblivion or indifference when the time \ncomes to implement them. It is our shared \nresponsibility to work to ensure that this general debate \nis not pure ritual in which, from this lofty rostrum, we \nuse rhetoric to share our ideas about major \ninternational issues, express our good intentions, make \ntempting promises and leave again without any real \n  \n \n09-52425 40 \n \ndesire to take appropriate measures to keep our \ncommitments.  \n For example, will we accept the fact that the \nPresident of Honduras, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya, \nlegitimately elected by his people, has been deposed by \nthe military and that the many resolutions adopted by \nvarious regional organizations condemning that coup \nd\u2019\u00e9tat remain dead letters? Similarly, every year for \nmore than 15 years now, the General Assembly has \nadopted a resolution condemning the embargo against \nthe Cuban people. The continuation of that embargo \nruns counter to all the values that we promote to make \ninternational trade a tool for human development. \nWhen will rhetoric be replaced by action?"

        "file_text": "A little more than a year ago, we witnessed \nwith great concern the collapse of some of the largest \nfinancial institutions of the world\u2019s wealthiest \ncountries. That financial fissure precipitated a global \neconomic crisis which, despite the emerging signs of \nrecovery, all of us continue to experience. We faced the \nstark reality that we lacked the necessary guidelines \nand rules to prevent what was occurring in the global \nfinancial system, even though it already was a global \nsystem. Now, following the G-20 summits in \nWashington and London, where we laid the \nfoundations to resolve the problems, it is up to the \nPittsburgh conference to finish the work.  \n Despite what has been said, this is not the first \nglobalization crisis. Instead, it is the first crisis of \nglobal governance, that is to say, a crisis of an \ninsufficiently governed globalization. We have an \nobligation to learn from this experience \u2014 certainly to \nlearn a lesson with regard to the financial and \neconomic crisis, but also about the other global \nchallenges that require both collective determination \nand coordinated multilateral political efforts. For those \nchallenges are interrelated. We cannot aspire to \neconomic and social development unless countries and \npeoples enjoy adequate peace and security. Conversely, \nit will not be possible to build lasting peace and \nsecurity unless there is sustainable development.  \n That same willingness to take responsibility for \nboth problems and solutions, which has re-emerged \nstrongly in recent months, should ensure that we do not \nfail in responding to the conflicts and threats \nconfronting world peace and security. That willingness \nshould also ensure that we do not fail in dealing with \nextreme hunger and poverty; in effectively committing \nourselves to combating the effects of climate change; \nor in tackling organized crime, terrorism and piracy. \nWe therefore have a great opportunity before us.  \n Here at the general debate, one year after the \nbeginning of the financial crisis that nearly engulfed \nthe well-being of developed countries and dashed the \nhopes of many others, I would like to reiterate that \nSpain is a country committed to multilateralism and the \nneed to continue to develop a system of global \ngovernance \u2014 and that applies to every one of the \nchallenges to which I have just referred. But before \nturning to those challenges, I should like to begin by \nsaying that multilateralism is not just a process for \ntaking decisions and resolving conflicts at the \ninternational level. It is indeed that; but in order for \nmultilateralism to be effective and lasting, it must \nabove all include two fundamental elements. \n First of all, multilateralism is intrinsically linked \nwith the faithful observance of democratic values, \nhuman rights and effective equality between women \nand men throughout the world. In that regard, I very \nmuch welcome the last resolution adopted by the \nGeneral Assembly at the previous session, which will \nmake a single body responsible for all gender issues.  \n Today, however, standing firmly for democracy \nelicits a single name: Honduras. Our Latin American \nbrothers in that country have in recent years seen the \nstrengthening of both democracy and the prospects for \nthe future. With the support of Spain and the \ninternational community, they have now decided that \nthey are going to overcome the challenge before \nHonduras. We will not accept an anti-democratic coup. \nWe will not accept it, and democracy must return to \nHonduras. \n \n \n09-52320 26 \n \n Secondly, but no less important, multilateralism \nrequires, if not a culture, an atmosphere of dialogue, \nrespect and acceptance between countries, regions and, \nmore broadly, civilizations. Five years ago, I addressed \nthe General Assembly for the first time to propose the \nestablishment of an alliance of civilizations focused on \npromoting understanding and cooperation between \ncountries and peoples of different cultures and \nreligions, as well as on countering the forces that breed \nextremism and endanger peace.  \n We cannot be satisfied solely at the fact that the \ngroup of friends for that initiative has since grown to \nover 100 members, or that there are now associated \nnetworks of individuals and representatives of civil \nsociety organizations who are ensuring the continued \nexistence of the project, or that the third forum of the \nAlliance will be held next year in Rio de Janeiro. Nor \ncan we be satisfied at the fact that those developments \nclearly illustrate the universality of the principles \nunderpinning the initiative. Respect for the diversity of \ncivilizations, cultures and traditions are crucial to the \neffectiveness and sustainability of the multilateralism \nthat we wish to see strengthened on the basis of human \nrights and the universal values that we share as \nresponsible members of the international community. \n When I launched the Alliance of Civilizations \ninitiative from this very rostrum five years ago, it was \nat a less favourable time than the present. Yesterday, \nhaving heard statements by the President of the United \nStates of America and other international leaders, I \nthought to myself that this effort has been worthwhile. \nToday the Alliance is able to deploy its full potential in \norder to promote the effective multilateralism we \ndesire. We are now able to build. The initiative was \nworth it and \u2014 if I may put it this way \u2014 it was also \nright that the United Nations made it its own through \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his predecessor, \nKofi Annan.  \n Spain is therefore pleased that the President of \nthe General Assembly has proposed that the debate at \nthis new session focus on \u201cEffective responses to \nglobal crises: strengthening multilateralism and \ndialogue among civilizations for international peace, \nsecurity and development\u201d. We must now take a new \nstep.  \n The Alliance of Civilizations, which sets out and \npromotes those values throughout the entire United \nNations, should be a structural component of the main \nbodies and all other entities of the Organization. The \ntime has come for the General Assembly to adopt a \nresolution conferring that structural character on the \nAlliance of Civilizations through a constitutive charter. \nSpain will work with Turkey and the wider \nmembership of the Alliance\u2019s group of friends in order \nthat such a resolution can be adopted by the end of this \nfall. I am convinced that it will make a very positive \ncontribution to the work of such bodies as the Human \nRights Council, the Economic and Social Council and \neven the Security Council. The dialogue among \ncivilizations should be the mother tongue of the United \nNations. \n The new multilateralism has been essential for \ntaking significant steps forward in the area of \ndisarmament and arms control, such as prohibiting \nanti-personnel landmines and cluster bombs.  \n Now, the world has the opportunity to take a \ngreat step: abolishing nuclear weapons. President \nObama has had the courage to put that on the table, and \nthe United States and Russia \u2014 a country that is and \nwill remain key to Euro-Atlantic security \u2014 are \nnegotiating the largest cuts ever made to these arsenals. \nWe encourage them. We are hopeful about the initiative \nto convene a special summit of the Security Council \ndevoted to the fight against nuclear proliferation.  \n Spain, a nation that renounced the development \nand possession of nuclear weapons, fully shares that \nobjective and will support it with every means at our \ndisposal. We should immediately undertake to \nstrengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT), whose Review Conference in \nMay 2010 will coincide with Spain\u2019s presidency of the \nEuropean Union. I pledge to do everything possible, as \nfar as Spain and the European Union are concerned, to \nensure that this important conference has concrete \nresults that will enable us to advance the perspective of \na world free from nuclear weapons.  \n Let us continue to act with determination and \nwithout discouragement to build and consolidate peace \nin all areas and regions. My country is proud to have \nbeen contributing to United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions for 20 years. Over those 20 years, we have \ntaken part in 22 missions comprising a total of more \nthan 100,000 troops.  \n Currently, we share the concern over the situation \nin Afghanistan. I am sure, however, that the \ninternational community will be able to find a \n \n \n27 09-52320 \n \nsolution \u2014 a solution that is not and cannot be purely \nmilitary. The shared conviction as to the strategic value \nof the region and the internal solidarity among the \ncountries present there is stronger than ever and will be \ndecisive in the face of the difficulties before us.  \n I also wish to reiterate the need to persevere in \nseeking formulas for peace in the Middle East because \nof that conflict\u2019s potential to spread and affect other \nregional conflicts such as those just mentioned. The \nworld has an unresolved task: peace in the Middle \nEast, with two secure States \u2014 the State of Israel, but \nalso the State of Palestine, which the international \ncommunity must consider and recognize within a \nreasonable period of time. Peace in the Middle East has \nbeen and continues to be the first strategic priority for \nthe international community.  \n According to the most recent estimates, more \nthan 1 billion people throughout the world \u2014 nearly \none sixth of its total population \u2014 suffer hunger. We \nmust say this as often as possible: figures such as that, \nreflecting unfathomable human suffering, assault our \nconsciences time and again as leaders of the \ninternational community and as citizens. It is unjust \nand unacceptable to proceed further into the twenty-\nfirst century, as we are doing, with such a radical \nimbalance in the living conditions of humanity. It is \nunjust, unacceptable and also unsafe \u2014 a permanent \nsource of instability. It is not possible to aspire to a \nsecure world if the current levels of inequality and \npoverty persist.  \n That is why our commitment to international \npeace and security must go hand in hand with a \nrenewed effort to eradicate poverty, using our \nleadership responsibly and with solidarity and avoiding \nthe temptation, in times of economic crisis, to lessen \nour commitment to the world\u2019s poorest and most \nvulnerable.  \n The achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals must be a central aspect of the international \nagenda. Five years before 2015, the Goals can still be \nachieved, with sustained collective effort. At the next \nsession of the General Assembly, we must reach \nspecific agreements that will guarantee their \nachievement.   \n I wish to strengthen the appeal for that urgent \njoint effort by citing the commitment of my country \nand its citizens. I refer in particular to Africa. The \ntwenty-first century should belong to a continent that \nhas been dispossessed for too long in the history of \nhumanity: the African continent. Spain has become the \nseventh-largest international donor and the eighth-\nlargest United Nations contributor, and we have made a \nclear commitment in the area of food security. \n Over the past few years, we have raised \nhumanity\u2019s awareness about the seriousness of the \neffects of climate change. There is now sufficient \nawareness about the need to combat climate change \nand also about the opportunities it provides us to create \na new model of economic development \u2014 sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n With climate change, the time for awareness-\nraising is over and the time for commitments has \narrived. We do not need any more words; it is time for \naction. We must take everyone\u2019s circumstances into \naccount, but, if we are to make collective progress, we \nmust not delay. Although we have been able to see the \neffects of the economic crisis, we still find it difficult \nto react to the effects of a phenomenon much more \ndevastating for entire future generations. That is \nparadoxical and incomprehensible \u2014 even more so \nwhen we consider that to emerge from the economic \ncrisis means ensuring the only kind of growth possible: \nsustainable growth.  \n We have 75 days before the Copenhagen summit \nbegins. They can be 75 days for the future or for \nfailure, 75 days for responsibility or for impotence, \n75 days for agreement or for the useless defence of \nselfish interests. Copenhagen should give two answers \nto the world, regarding what and when: an ambitious \nreduction of emissions \u2014 the what \u2014 and a horizon \nthat is near and defined \u2014 the when. \n In order to attain those objectives, we also need \nto think about how. We know that technological \nresearch, innovation and development in the area of \nenergy assist in the fight against climate change. That \nis why Spain has proposed that every State should \ndevote at least 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic \nproduct to research, development and innovation in the \narea of technology and energy. That is a reference \nfigure that, as in the area of development cooperation \npolicy, will help us determine a commitment before the \ninternational community. My country also proposes to \npromote, when we assume the European Union \npresidency in the first half of 2010, the agreements that \nwe must all adopt at Copenhagen.  \n \n \n09-52320 28 \n \n Finally, only one year ago we were struck by a \nfinancial crisis that shook every corner of the world. \nSince then, all of us have suffered the effects of that \ncrisis, but we have also become aware of the need to \nmove ahead in building global governance and have \ntaken resolute steps in that direction. Let us continue \non that path, not just to continue fighting against the \ncrisis and for employment, but to overcome it together \nand successfully address the other global challenges.  \n Let us use this time for clarity; let us take this \nopportunity. Let us build a multilateralism that is \neffective and responsible \u2014 above all, a \nmultilateralism of solidarity. Since 1945, there have \nnever been such favourable circumstances for \ntranslating the desires of the founders of the United \nNations into the reality of the international order. \nThose desires were intended for succeeding \ngenerations. And we are the first generation that has \nwithin its reach the ability to fulfil the old and \nbeautiful dream of a world governed by all. Let us do \nso."

I have a great deal of \nconfidence that your efforts will bear fruit and enable \nthe Organization to continue to achieve the success \nattained under the presidency of your predecessor, \nFather Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann. \n I should also like to convey my gratitude and \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the \nefforts he has devoted to consolidating peace and \nsecurity throughout the world, to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals and to promoting the \nfight against climate change. \n This session is being held at a time when my \ncountry is extricating itself from a political and \ninstitutional crisis that lasted for a few months and was \nresolved, with the help of the efforts of the \nInternational Contact Group on Mauritania, through a \nconsensus reached by the political parties of \nMauritania and enshrined in the Dakar Accord. This \nagreement provided for the elaboration of an electoral \nagenda supervised by a Government of national unity \nin which minority parties in Parliament enjoy half of \nthe number of seats, including among the sovereign \nministries, such as the Ministries of Home Affairs, \nInformation, Defence and others. \n The normalization of the constitutional process \nled to the election of Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz as \nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. He \nreceived 53 per cent of the votes during the first round \nof the elections held on 18 July and all national and \ninternational observers attested to the transparency and \nfairness of this election. \n On behalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, \nI convey my special gratitude to the International \nContact Group, and especially to the President of the \nAfrican Union, the Leader Muammar Al-Qadhafi, who \nwas one of the first to call for a domestic solution, thus \nenabling Mauritanian stakeholders to normalize the \npolitical situation in their country. I also convey my \ngratitude to His Excellency Abdoulaye Wade, President \nof the brotherly country of Senegal, who accompanied \nthe signing of the Dakar Accord and ensured its \nfollow-up implementation. \n Mauritania, under the presidency of \nMr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, is determined to \nconsolidate democracy and institutions and uphold the \nrule of law in a spirit of calm and stability, thereby \n  \n \n09-52604 2 \n \nproviding for the progress and well-being of the people \nof Mauritania. \n Aware of the need to integrate peoples and States, \nMauritania reiterates its attachment to the Arab \nMaghreb Union as a strategic choice for the people of \nthe region. It also affirms its attachment to joint work \nwithin the framework of the League of Arab States, as \nwell as its commitment to the African Union and to \nUnited Nations purposes and principles, \n We reiterate our support for efforts aimed at \nreforming the United Nations, especially the expansion \nof the Security Council, where a permanent seat should \nbe granted to the African continent and another to the \nArab Group, whose people make up more than 11 per \ncent of the world population. \n The tremendous efforts undertaken during the \nsixty-third session of the General Assembly are \npraiseworthy, whether we are referring to the Doha \nReview Conference or the conference on the world \nfinancial and economic crisis and its impact on \ndevelopment. Despite these commendable efforts, the \nworld continues to be wracked by a stifling financial \ncrisis that has undermined development efforts, \nespecially in the least developed countries (LDCs). The \nimpact of the financial crisis on the economies of the \nLDCs is disastrous. While the rich countries of the \nNorth have achieved economic and social progress \nduring these past few years, the least developed \ncountries will face many obstacles that will have an \nimpact on programmes aimed at achieving their \nMillennium Development Goals. \n The international community must act rapidly to \nconfront this disaster that threatens the global \neconomic order. It must take concrete measures aimed \nat restoring confidence, achieving economic progress \nand creating jobs. Commerce, trade and investment \nmust be revitalized to provide the necessary financing \nto poor countries and to maintain achievements made \nthus far in the fight against poverty and in \nstrengthening the role of the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme in countering the economic \ncrisis and its adverse impact on development. \n In this respect, we urge rich countries to fulfil the \ncommitments made in London in early April towards \nfinancing development in developing countries, and \ntheir pledges to allocate $1 trillion to revitalize the \nglobal economy, including $50 billion devoted to the \nlow income countries. I pay tribute to all of those steps \nfrom this rostrum. \n The economic, social and environmental \ndimensions of development are all closely interlinked. \nFor that reason we call upon all countries to fight \nagainst climate change. My country is one of the ten \ncountries most affected by global warming, which \ncould lead to a rise in sea level. Here, we request that \nindustrialized States limit their greenhouse gas \nemissions. We also welcome the meeting on climate \nchange that was convened by the Secretary-General \nand await the outcome of the international conference \non climate change to be held in December in \nCopenhagen, with great interest. \n My country follows the issue of the Western \nSahara with great interest and reaffirms its backing for \nthe efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special \nEnvoy aimed at finding a final solution to this issue, \nwhich would strengthen security and stability in the \nregion. \n The Arab-Israeli conflict is a source of ongoing \ntension and a threat to international peace and security \nin a sensitive and vital region of the world. For that \nreason, we support peace efforts aimed at finding a \nsolution to the conflict that will, on the one hand, \nguarantee the brotherly Palestinian people all of their \nrights, including the establishment of an independent \nPalestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \nand the right to live in peace and security side by side \nwith Israel; and on the other hand, will restore all \noccupied Arab territories, including the Syrian Golan \nand the Lebanese Sheba'a farms. \n Turning to the situation in the Sudan, we wish \nhere to underscore our categorical rejection of the \nInternational Criminal Court\u2019s arrest warrant for the \nSudanese President, because it undermines peace \nefforts under way in that country and runs counter to \ninternational norms.  \n The culture of peace, tolerance, justice and \nrespect for peoples and civilizations is the best possible \nway to uphold international peace and security. \nOutstanding issues are still without an available \nsolution; the chasm between the rich and the poor and \nthe turbulent international economic infrastructure \nhave led to tension, extremism and terrorism. Here I \nreaffirm that the Islamic Republic of Mauritania rejects \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and \nreiterates its commitment to Islamic values, which \n \n \n3 09-52604 \n \nreject violence and extremism and call for tolerance \nand fraternity. We believe that it is the duty of the \ninternational community to consider seriously the \ncauses of this phenomenon and to devise ways to \nconfront it and eradicate it once and for all.  \n Fulfilling the commitments that the international \ncommunity made in creating this Organization will \nonly be possible if all peoples and all countries share \nthe available resources and possibilities for successful \ndevelopment, and if the policies of the countries of the \nNorth are rooted in a vision of dignified, free and equal \nexistence for all. In my view this is the only way to \nreach the objectives that this Organization was created \nfor."

        "file_text": "My country, the Czech \nRepublic, has always appreciated the role that the \nUnited Nations has played in strengthening security, \nstability and prosperity in the world. I want to assure \nMembers that we will continue to participate in the \nactivities of the United Nations. We firmly believe in \nthe importance of this Organization and want it to be \nefficient and effective. For that reason, we support the \nreform of the Security Council so that it will more \nadequately reflect the political and economic realities \nof the world today, as some speakers have stressed here \ntoday. Changes are necessary and we are ready to start \ndiscussing them very seriously. \n This year, in our part of the world, we \ncommemorate 20 years since the fall of communism, \nsince the moment when my country \u2014 together with \nother States of Central and Eastern Europe \u2014 regained \nfreedom and sovereignty, and was again able to resume \nthe place in the community of free and democratic \ncountries that it enjoyed when the United Nations was \nfounded in 1945. \n In the 20 years that have passed since those \nhistoric events, we succeeded in building a stable \npolitical democracy and in transforming our economic \nsystem into a functioning free-market economy. I am \nmentioning this because I believe that our experience is \nrelevant to the ongoing discussions about how to solve \nthe economic problems that the world faces today. \n We are meeting at a time when the world is in the \nmidst one of the deepest economic crises since the \nSecond World War. The financial crisis, which \noriginated in the United States two years ago, quickly \nspilled over into most other countries and led to a \nsevere decline in economic activity all over the world, \na substantial decrease in international trade and capital \nflows and an increase in social and economic \ninstability in a large number of countries on all \ncontinents. \n The United Nations \u2014 as a unique worldwide \nOrganization \u2014 and its specialized institutions have \nbecome an important global platform for discussing \nalternative steps and policies that could, one hopes, \nhelp to overcome the crisis and diminish its impact. \nThe measures that have been implemented to date have \ncontributed to the fact that the world has succeeded in \navoiding a repetition of the situation in the 1930s. We \nalso succeeded in avoiding a repetition of a massive \nprotectionist reaction to the crisis. Protectionism in all \nits forms should be resolutely condemned here today. \n We see the first signs that the economic crisis has \nreached bottom, or come close to it. Nevertheless, we \nfind ourselves at the beginning of a difficult and very \ncomplicated post-crisis period. There are many reasons \nfor the fragility and vulnerability of this phase, but I \nshould like to refer to just a few. \n First, attempts to increase aggregate demand led \nto unprecedented expansion in public expenditure and \npublic debt. As a result, a large number of United \nNations Member States are facing or approaching a \ndebt trap. Those huge fiscal deficits will harm future \neconomic growth. Secondly, international flows of \nprivate capital, which contributed so substantially to \nrapid economic growth in recent decades, are \ndecreasing and becoming less reliable. Thirdly, a \ndecrease in international trade will undermine the \ncontinuation of export-oriented strategies of many \nemerging markets. \n It would be a tragic mistake to fundamentally \nimpair economic freedom in favour of State or \nsupra-State regulation just now. Long-term experience \nshows us that it is thanks to free markets and free \nentrepreneurship that we enjoy the current material \nwell-being and economic progress. Business cycles, \naccompanied by economic downturns, recessions and \n \n \n23 09-52228 \n \ncrises, did exist, do exist and will exist in the future. In \nspite of them, the world has been \u2014 at least in the past \ntwo centuries \u2014 characterized primarily by economic \ngrowth and growing prosperity.  \n When looking for an appropriate reaction to the \nproblems connected with the current crisis, we should \nbuild on the idea that the crisis was basically a failure \nof Governments, not of markets. The manipulation of \nmonetary policy in an attempt to artificially prolong \nthe period of growth, the irrational subsidization of \ndemand in the housing sector and the failures in \nfinancial-market regulation contributed substantially to \nthe crisis. Let us not delude ourselves into believing \nthat economic cycles and their consequences can be \nprevented by more extensive Government regulation or \nby aiming at global governance of the world economy. \n This issue has its important territorial and \ngeographic aspects as well. We have to pay attention to \nthe needs and interests of all kinds of countries \u2014 rich \nand poor, developed and developing. Global economic \ndevelopment will benefit from the removal of barriers, \nnot from creating new ones, because barriers would \nsubstantially complicate poorer countries\u2019 access to \nforeign markets, as well as their ability to develop by \ntheir own means. \n Economic recession and large increases in public \ndebt have reduced the possibilities available to today\u2019s \nworld to meet such goals as combating climate change. \nI do not intend to go into details of this issue here now, \nbut we should carefully follow it because of unfinished \nscientific debate and pay attention to the costs and \nbenefits of our future decisions. \n I do, however, want to emphasize that the \nmeasures proposed to combat climate change represent \nanother heavy burden for both developed countries, \nwhich are falling into deep fiscal deficits now, and for \ndeveloping countries. This is happening in a context in \nwhich rich countries, often pushing this agenda at \ninternational forums, are losing their ability to \ncompensate poorer countries for the impact of those \nadditional costs. \n The Czech Republic, as a successor State to \nCzechoslovakia, which was one of the founding \nMembers of the United Nations, has always \nparticipated actively in all kinds of United Nations \nactivities. It intends to do so in the future as well. It is \nin our interest that the Organization remains a \nrespected high-level forum that contributes to \nprosperity, stability and peaceful solutions to the \nconflicts of today\u2019s world."

        "file_text": "I bring the greetings and \nbest wishes of the people of the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands. I congratulate the President on his \nelection to chair the Assembly at this session. He has \nour confidence and support.  \n I offer my gratitude to the United Nations for its \ncontinuing role in coordinating and leading the world\u2019s \nefforts to meet challenges affecting the interests of all \nnations. The United Nations Joint Presence Office in \nthe Marshall Islands has brought the ideals of the \nOrganization closer to our people and country. Our \nhope is that other United Nations agencies \u2014 including \nthe World Health Organization, the United Nations \nDevelopment Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the Food \nand Agriculture Organization and the United Nations \n \n \n51 09-52425 \n \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific \u2014 will follow suit and make their presence felt \nmore prominently, producing concrete results on the \nground. \n I wish to acknowledge the personal commitment \nof the Secretary-General to meeting the challenges of \nclimate change. His reminder to take our best to the \ntable in Copenhagen in service of a higher calling to \nsave the planet is well noted. His call for a clear moral \nimperative for bold and decisive urgent action and his \nrecognition of the duty of the larger economies to the \nmost vulnerable have not gone unnoticed by us small \nisland States. Although some may consider as \ninsufficient the Group of 8 commitment in Italy this \nyear, I believe it is an encouraging and a necessary step \nforward. \n We cherish the hope that the increasing \nparticipation of the United States in debates on issues \nrelating to climate change is a signal of its intention to \ntake its rightful place at the forefront of the global war \nagainst climate change. Likewise, we are encouraged \nby Japan\u2019s bold and new commitment to address the \nadverse effects of climate change. \n Let me express my appreciation to the Alliance of \nSmall Island States (AOSIS) for its leadership in \nassisting small island developing countries to prepare \nfor negotiations in Copenhagen. We assure AOSIS of \nour unwavering support. \n Full of expectation, the world has its eyes on \nCopenhagen. It will be an event of historic significance \nwhere, despite our differences, everyone can now view \nthe entire planet through a common perspective. \n Now, a few weeks away from Copenhagen, I feel \nmoved to ask what it is that we want to see happening \nin there. What kind of outcome do we expect? How \nshould we and future generations judge the success of \nCopenhagen? \n The answer, it seems to me, is a matter of \nperspective. Major economies will no doubt be \nwatchful that Copenhagen does not disturb too much \nan established way of life and all its benefits. I ask \nthese nations to consider the implicit moral obligation \nthat comes with their privileged and affluent status. \n For the small island States, however, the question \nis whether Copenhagen will diminish or enhance their \nsecurity and their chances of survival, whether the \npopulations of the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Tokelau \nand others should make haste to evacuate and head to \nsafer regions, as foreshadowed in a recent warning \nfrom the United Nations High Commissioner for \nRefugees. \n Therefore, our message to the leaders in \nCopenhagen is clear: we appeal to them to strive with \nevery fibre of their being to increase their level of \ncommitment to combating climate change, to show the \nworld by their deeds \u2014 not words \u2014 their unbending \ncommitment to secure an effective post-Kyoto global \nagreement. We appeal to them to be as unrestrained as \nthe wind and set the limit on the increase in global \naverage temperature above the pre-industrial period at \na level that will ensure our survival. We appeal to them \nto be fair-minded and to act with determination to \nreduce global emissions from 1990 levels by at least \n85 per cent by 2050. We appeal to them to ensure that \nglobal emissions peak no later than 2015. Finally, we \nappeal to the leaders of all nations to construct in \nCopenhagen the ark of salvation in which all nations \nand peoples will find shelter. \n I believe that the success of Copenhagen will be \nultimately judged by the extent to which small, low-\nlying island States \u2014 the most vulnerable \u2014 will feel a \nsense of guaranteed safety and security. For, in our \ninterdependent global community, the moral duty of \nthe collective must always be the protection of the \nweak and the most vulnerable. \n Short of that, however, Copenhagen will be no \nmore than the continuation of the law of the jungle, the \nsurvival of the strongest. It will be a moral and \npolitical failure. For Copenhagen is not about \nmathematics. It is not about raw power; it is not \ncompetition for the survival of the few. It is about \nunleashing the moral and political forces and synergies \ninherent in the collective body of nations for the good \nof all. What else does political will mean but this? \n Failure in Copenhagen will make a mockery of \nthe Millennium Development Goals, for their \nachievement will be beyond our capacity to attain. It \nwill question the ability of the Charter of the United \nNations to safeguard our pre-existing sovereign rights. \nIn short, the world and the most vulnerable in it cannot \nafford the cost of failure.  \n Closer to home, even though the rate of emission \nof the Marshall Islands is insignificant in relative \nterms, we have set for ourselves a reduction target of \n40 per cent by 2020. Over the years, and subject to \n  \n \n09-52425 52 \n \naccessibility of funding, we have been pursuing a \nsystematic programme of solar power use. Nearly 40 \nper cent of the households in our outer islands are now \ndrawing on that power as one of their main sources of \nenergy. We intend to pursue this initiative until all 33 \nislands in our country are fully covered. On the \nMicronesian subregional front, we are committed to the \ngoals of the Micronesia Challenge. \n Our efforts to adapt continue to suffer from the \nlack of adequate funding, compounded by the sheer \ncomplexity in accessing it from the sources. \nSimplifying the process by direct access to those \nsources could enable us to fast-track some of our \nadaptation priorities, such as seawalls, coastal \nmanagement and safe water projects. \n I now turn to a matter that is very dear to the \nheart of every Marshallese. We are deeply encouraged \nby the Security Council meeting today, moderated by \nPresident Obama, on the use and testing of nuclear \nweapons.  \n Nuclear weapon testing was conducted on our \nislands between 1946 and 1958, at the time when we \nwere a ward of the United Nations trusteeship system. \nOur first-hand experience as victims of nuclear weapon \ntesting on our islands, and the painful memories that \ncontinue to haunt us after six decades, are nightmares \nwe would not wish on anyone. The toll in human \nsuffering and environmental damage has been \ndevastating. Now, sixty years since the detonation of \nsome 67 nuclear bombs, the Marshall Islands is still \ngrappling with the after-effects. Complete recovery in \nterms of restoring affected islands to full economic \nproductivity and adequate compensation of the victims \nremains uncertain. \n We have not come here to condemn or to point \nfingers. However, we are compelled by our moral duty \nto humanity to raise our voice in gatherings such as \nthis and to appeal to the conscience of the world \ncommunity. We call for the formulation of a new \nperspective by which the spectre of war and of the use \nof nuclear weapons may forever be dismissed from the \nsurface of the Earth.  \n Banning nuclear weapons will not by itself \nremove the root cause of war. Important as it may be, it \ndoes not exert an enduring influence. People are too \ningenious not to invent still other forms of warfare. \nPolitical agreements or good intentions alone are not \nenough. The world craves something much more deep-\nseated than pure pragmatism. It yearns for permanent \npeace that springs from an inner state supported by a \nmoral attitude. \n There is no lack of recognition by national \nleaders of the nature of the problem, but there is a \nparalysis of will. The stark realities of the experience \nof the people of the Marshall Islands have deepened \nour profound conviction that, in a world irreversibly \nmoving towards a global society, it becomes imperative \nthat we recast our perspective, a perspective in which \nnational impulses and interests will find their fullest \nexpression when subordinated to the needs and \ninterests of the planet, our collective homeland, a \nperspective that does not regard that subordination as \nbeing disloyal to the nation. \n Amid our deepening economic and financial \nwoes, the Republic of the Marshall Islands continues to \nremain buoyant through the generous support of our \nfriends and partners. Our special relationship with the \nUnited States within the framework of the Compact of \nFree Association provides a unique partnership that is \nenduring and stable. \n We express our firm support for the efforts of the \nUnited States and its allies in combating terrorism, and \nwe are proud of our young Marshallese men and \nwomen serving in the armed forces of the United \nStates. The support also provided by Japan, the \nRepublic of China (Taiwan), the European Union, \nAustralia and our other donor partners is sincerely \nacknowledged. \n The increasing complexity of the management of \nevolving global affairs demands a reconstitution of the \nmembership of the Security Council. Japan\u2019s \ndistinguished leadership and achievements in the area \nof human security match its aspirations to seek a \npermanent seat on the Council and thus deserve \nfavourable consideration. Evidence of progress in the \nconfidence-building process between China and the \nRepublic of China (Taiwan) deserves praise and \nencouragement from the international community. \nTaiwan\u2019s membership in the United Nations \nspecialized agencies will enable its 23 million people \nto play an active part in the affairs of the family of \nnations. \n Not a single nation can escape the powerful grip \nof the challenges of climate change. Its deadly virus is \nhere already. The remedy is clear: collective and \nresolute action, now more than ever. The choice is \n \n \n53 09-52425 \n \nours. We implore Almighty God to give us courage and \nwisdom. "

Canada was \namong its founding members, who were inspired at the \ntime by the need to create an international consensus \nfor the stability and security of a world ravaged by war, \nmore than 60 years ago. There is therefore no more \nappropriate forum than this one for me, as Minister for \nForeign Affairs of Canada, to reaffirm my country\u2019s \n  \n \n09-52592 46 \n \ncommitment to collective action, namely, to work \ntogether with all countries to pursue shared objectives \nand overcome common challenges. \n The global economic and financial crisis, as well \nas the global security and environmental threats facing us, \nhave underscored the extent of that interdependence. We \nhave placed economic recovery and growth at the top of \nour priorities and have taken decisive action in Canada \nto mitigate the impact of the crisis on all Canadians. \n However, the recovery of Canada\u2019s economy cannot \nhappen in isolation from economic recovery across the \nworld. Moreover, protectionism is a common threat to all \nof the world\u2019s economies. History has taught us that we \ncannot hope to emerge from the current crisis if we \nimpede global trade in an effort to protect our national \neconomies. We therefore need vigorous and effective \nconsultation at the highest levels so that we can work \ntogether to resist the protectionist urge. \n Since the establishment of the United Nations, \nmore than 100,000 Canadians have served in United \nNations missions in Africa, the Americas, the Asia-\nPacific region and the Middle East. Today, thousands \nof others \u2014 soldiers, police, diplomats, aid workers \nand others \u2014 are working in support of missions led or \nmandated by the United Nations around the world. \n Eradicating terrorism in all its forms is the \nresponsibility both of Canadians and of the United \nNations. Indeed, Canada is committed to combating \nterrorism and to ensuring that the perpetrators and \nsupporters of terrorism are held accountable for their \nactions. The Taliban in particular are a threat to global \npeace and security. Like the United Nations, Canada is \ndetermined to eradicate that threat. \n Our mission in Afghanistan is the most vivid \nillustration of Canada\u2019s determination to that end. It also \nconstitutes our most significant overseas contribution. \nCanada\u2019s mission is an efficient, integrated, civilian-\nmilitary partnership of approximately 2,800 military \npersonnel and more than 100 civilians. Those Canadians \nare working tirelessly and making great sacrifices in \nsupport of the United Nations-mandated Mission to \nreconstitute a stable and secure Afghanistan that is at \nlast led by Afghans themselves. \n In the months ahead, Canada will expect Afghan \npolitical leaders to make progress on key priorities \u2014 \nfrom good governance to anti-corruption efforts and \nfrom reconciliation to reconstruction, economic growth \nand regional cooperation, so as to promote stability in \ntheir country. As they tackle the many challenges \nahead, they must ensure that their efforts promote, \nprotect and improve human rights in a concrete \nmanner, in particular the rights and living conditions of \nAfghan women and girls. \n Canada is also providing significant assistance to \nHaiti, where our contribution will total $555 million \nbetween 2006 and 2011. We aim to promote democracy, \nsecurity and economic growth and, above all, to secure a \nbetter future for all of Haiti\u2019s children and young people. \n Many other challenges remain. Canada regrets \nthe deteriorating security situation in southern Sudan, \nand we call for the full implementation of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement. Along the same \nlines, we encourage all parties to the Darfur conflict to \nend hostilities through the joint mediation of the \nUnited Nations and the African Union. Canada is \ndetermined to contribute to resolving the conflict in the \nSudan. Since 2006, we have disbursed more than \n$640 million in support of international efforts to \nachieve sustainable peace in that country. \n We are all acutely conscious that nuclear \nproliferation is a global threat we all face. Canada was \ndeeply troubled by the recent revelation that Iran has \nbeen building a covert uranium enrichment facility for \nseveral years. We condemn Iran\u2019s continued refusal to \nrespect Security Council resolutions and International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) obligations. We \ntherefore call on Iran to allow the IAEA immediate and \nunfettered access to all sites, including that facility. We \nexpect a full investigation. \n We hope that talks between Iran and the five \npermanent members of the Security Council plus \nGermany that are scheduled for 1 October will address \nthe continued duplicity surrounding Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme. Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada \nhas been clear in his discussions with President \nObama, Prime Minister Brown, President Sarkozy and \nour other allies. Canada will welcome the efforts \ndeemed necessary to remove what is clearly a threat to \ninternational peace and security. \n In that regard, Canada commended President \nObama for having taken the initiative to organize a \nsummit meeting of the Security Council on the issue of \nnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament (see \nS/PV.6191). We commit ourselves to working with other \ncountries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and \n \n \n47 09-52592 \n \nnew terrorist threats. However, finding a diplomatic \nsolution to those problems will require that we mobilize \npolitical will to ensure that every country adheres to \nthe vision of a world free of nuclear weapons. \n(spoke in English) \n At this time of the year in my country, the leaves \non the trees are changing colours. That dramatic \ndisplay reminds all Canadians of the need to protect \nour natural heritage, which is one of the most majestic \nin the world. But neither borders nor seasons can stop \nthe havoc caused by climate change. Canada therefore \nremains committed to an ambitious post-2012 global \nclimate change agreement that is consistent with the \nprinciples and provisions of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and \nsupports sustainable, low-carbon global growth. \n We are committed to taking domestic actions to \nreduce our total greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per \ncent from 2006 levels by the year 2020, and by 60 to \n70 per cent by 2050. Canada is a world leader in the \ndevelopment of clean technologies to combat climate \nchange, including carbon capture and storage. We seek \nto establish a new global partnership that will advance \nthe development and deployment of those technologies. \n Canada joined other countries at the L\u2019Aquila \nmeeting of the Group of Eight (G-8) and at the Major \nEconomies Forum in affirming the broad scientific \nview that the increase in global average temperature \nabove pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two \ndegrees Celsius. \n This global phenomenon needs a global response. \nThat is why Canada wants to see all emitters be part of \nthis international effort. We congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral for convening his productive Climate Change \nSummit, as well as for assuming the leadership that \nnaturally falls to the United Nations in this area. All \nmajor economies will be required to meet this global \nchallenge. This must be reflected in the context of a \nfair, equitable and effective agreement at Copenhagen \nin December. \n Adaptation to the impacts of climate change is an \nimportant issue for all countries. It must be a core \nelement of a post-2012 climate change regime if we are \nto build resilience to climate change impacts. Canada \nhas contributed significantly to a number of initiatives, \nincluding the World Bank\u2019s Pilot Program for Climate \nResilience. We continue to support international action \nthat strengthens the capacity of the poorest and most \nvulnerable to adapt to a changing climate. \n As an Arctic State and Power, Canada is proud of \nits long-standing sovereignty over that increasingly \npromising territory. Canada also recognizes the important \nresponsibility that we have to Northerners and to the \nsustainable development and environmental protection of \nthe region. Cooperation with our Arctic neighbours and \nthe peaceful pursuit of our interests has underpinned \nand will continue to underpin Canada\u2019s arctic foreign \npolicy and to guide our actions in the region. Through \nour bilateral and multilateral engagement \u2014 whether at \nthe United Nations and the Arctic Council or in \nworking with our Arctic partners \u2014 Canada will continue \nto show leadership on such Arctic issues as shipping, oil \nand gas and contaminants and biodiversity. \n Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights, 61 years ago, Canada has worked \nvigorously to strengthen the United Nations human \nrights machinery to ensure the credibility and integrity \nof fair and balanced mechanisms to promote human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. Human rights are an \nimportant part of Canadian foreign policy and our \nrelations with Member States. During our recently \ncompleted term on the Human Rights Council, Canada \nworked to make it a forum for constructive international \ndialogue. We will continue to work towards building an \nefficient, responsive and credible Human Rights \nCouncil that is true to its founding principles. Canada \nwill also continue to promote respect for basic human \nrights and the freedom of expression and association. \nAnd we will continue to advocate for those unjustly \ndetained in the world\u2019s most abusive regimes. \n Finding the political will to translate our values into \nactions and ensuring that we continue to hold to account \nthose who would violate basic human rights is in the \ninterest of all Member States. Supporting those who \nare making sincere efforts to advance the human rights \nof their populations is also one of our collective \nobjectives. \n Canada is meeting its international commitments. \nWe are on track to double our international assistance \nto $5 billion by 2010. We have also already met our \ncommitment to double aid to Africa between 2003 and \n2009. Canada will also continue to provide \nhumanitarian assistance to those affected by conflict \nand natural disasters. \n  \n \n09-52592 48 \n \n Through Canada\u2019s chairmanship of the Sierra \nLeone country-specific configuration of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, we are working to bridge \nthe gap between humanitarian assistance and long-term \ndevelopment. As Chair of the G-8 in 2010, Canada will \nplace emphasis on making the G-8 more accountable \nand effective. Accountability means fulfilling our \ncommitments. Effectiveness is about strengthening our \npartnerships, including with the United Nations, to \ntackle challenges such as the fragility of States and \nnuclear non-proliferation. Canada will also co-host the \nsummit of the Group of 20 (G-20) in June 2010, along \nwith our good friend the Republic of Korea. \n Our priority will remain economic recovery and \nbuilding the foundation for sustainable growth, \nincluding for the most vulnerable. Earlier this week, \nPrime Minister Stephen Harper announced a concrete \nand innovative contribution to that effort. Building on \nour previous G-20 commitments, Canada will provide \nthe African Development Bank with approximately \n$2.6 billion in additional lending room. That will assist \nthe Bank in responding quickly to the demands of its \nborrowing members while it continues its poverty \nreduction efforts. \n I would urge representatives not to let the \ndizzying succession of major events addressed here \ncause them to lose sight of the importance of reforming \nthe Security Council. The Council is our most powerful \nmeans of collective action. But we can, and indeed we \nmust, make it more effective, more accessible and more \nflexible \u2014 more adapted, in fact, to the challenges and \nopportunities of the broader international community. \n Canada has long supported efforts to make the \nSecurity Council more responsive to today\u2019s security \nchallenges and more representative of the world\u2019s \nregions, in particular Africa, which has been \nhistorically underrepresented. Any real reform must \nlead to increased transparency and accountability. That \nwill not be achieved by extending the privileges of a \nfew to a few more, but through democratically elected \naccess to the Security Council and through more \nconsultation with and openness to the wider \nmembership of the United Nations. \n In conclusion, this small reminder of the \nresponsibility we all bear for our citizens\u2019 economic, \nenvironmental and nuclear security can leave us \nperplexed or even worried. But what we must never \nforget is that, in this seemingly uneven battle, we have \nin our arsenal the most effective weapons ever devised \nby humankind, namely, freedom, democracy, human \nrights and the rule of law."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nKingdom of Morocco, I should like to congratulate you \nwarmly, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \nGeneral-Assembly of the United Nations at its sixty-\nfourth session. We are proud to see a son of a brotherly \ncountry from our region at the helm of this universal \nbody. You may rest assured that our delegation is \nprepared fully to support your endeavours aimed at \nensuring a greater role for our Organization in meeting \nthe challenges of today\u2019s world. \n I wish also to seize this opportunity to express \nour appreciation and support to His Excellency \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts \nnot only to realize the objectives for which our \nOrganization was created, but also to enable the \nOrganization to fulfil the aspirations of the peoples of \nthe world in the course of this third millennium. \n The global crises, owing to their universal \nimpact, multifaceted nature and wide implications, \nhave given additional impetus to our collective action \nand strengthened coordination among the different \nconstituents of this universal body. Today, the world is \nfacing recurrent and unprecedented crises in the fields \nof economics, finance, food and energy that have \nshaken the foundations of universal governance. These \ncrises have also adversely affected the socio-economic \nand environmental systems of all States, especially in \ndeveloping countries. \n As the most representative Organization in the \nworld, the United Nations embodies the living \nconscience of the international community. As such, it \nis the most appropriate forum for coordinated joint \naction and for the reactivation of collective initiatives \nin order to analyse the root causes of such crises and \ncontain their impact through the adoption of agreed \nsolutions likely to mitigate their effects. Effective and \n  \n \n09-52586 50 \n \nfair economic governance is dependent on the \nrevitalization of the multilateral system based on \nrealism, efficiency and innovation as a means of \nfinding solutions that reflect the aspirations and hopes \nof present and future generations. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nwere adopted as a common platform for action with \nclear objectives and a time frame for their \nimplementation, with a view to achieving human \ndevelopment in the world. Much progress has been \nachieved in many States thanks to the efforts of the \ninternational community since the Millennium Summit. \nHowever, the progress made towards those goals has \nnot been consistent or steady within States or among \nStates in general. The negative implications of the \ncurrent economic crisis may exacerbate those \ndisparities, especially in Africa. The few years that \nremain before 2015 thus require us to adopt a \ncoordinated global approach and to build real \npartnerships in order to mobilize additional financial \nresources in line with the commitments made in the \nMonterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on \nFinancing for Development as well as in the \ndeclarations of the Group of Eight and the Group of 20. \n In this context, Morocco hopes that the fourth \nhigh-level meeting on financing for development, to be \nheld in November 2009 in New York, will yield results \ncommensurate with the expectations of the developing \ncountries, thus giving new impetus to efforts to attain \nthe Millennium Development Goals, thus leading to the \nformation of an international alliance for African \ndevelopment in the framework of coordinated efforts \nand initiatives aimed at achieving the Goals within \nspecific time frames. We also hope that the United \nNations agencies that are active in the area of \ndevelopment will mainstream the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and use them as the main and \nappropriate framework for their action. In this context, \nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nin particular should use the Millennium Development \nGoals as practical and comprehensively agreed upon \nindicators when drafting its report on human \ndevelopment. The MDGs provide a practical and \nqualitative, not only quantitative, way to measure \nliving that better reflects the ever-evolving concept of \ndevelopment. \n In keeping with this vision, the National Initiative \nfor Human Development, launched in May 2005 by His \nMajesty Mohammed VI, constitutes a pillar of \nMoroccan social policy. The initiative is based on an \nintegrated approach to development in all its aspects \u2014 \npolitical, economic, social, environmental and cultural. \nBy building roads, providing energy services and \nencouraging income-generating activities, the Initiative \nhas achieved concrete results in fighting poverty and \nexclusion, improving infrastructure and de-marginalizing \nrural areas. \n Collective efforts in the field of development will \nremain insufficient unless they are accompanied by \ndaring and effective policies for the protection of the \nenvironment and concrete measures to mitigate the \nimpact of climate change, which now more than ever is \nthreatening the future of mankind. In that connection, \nMorocco is convinced that the conference on climate \nchange to be held in Copenhagen in December will \nundoubtedly constitute an important step towards an \ninternational agreement on climate. In that regard, \nMorocco reiterates the proposal it made at the \nconference held at Poznan, Poland, in December 2008 \nfor the creation of a multilateral fund for the transfer of \ntechnology to the developing countries in order to \nenable them to deal with the grave implications of \nclimate change. \n Mindful of the necessity to operationalize \nconcrete measures to protect the environment and \ncontain the negative impact of climate change, His \nMajesty Mohammed VI instructed the Government to \ndraft swiftly a comprehensive national environmental \ncharter, with the aim of protecting national resources \nand reserves as part of a sustainable development \npolicy. The environment should be considered a shared \nnational heritage whose protection is the collective \nduty of current and future generations. Likewise, \nMorocco will reactivate its national energy strategy \naimed at the development of renewable energy sources \nand the recycling of waste water. \n Convinced that the peace process is the only \nviable option in the Middle East, the Kingdom of \nMorocco has participated constructively and \nresponsibly in all efforts of the international \ncommunity to relaunch the peace process on solid \nfoundations. That means that the process must be in \naccordance with resolutions of international legality, \nthe previous relevant agreements and commitments \namong the parties concerned, and the Arab Peace \nInitiative, which as a realistic option reflects the \ncollective Arab will to arrive at a just and \ncomprehensive solution that guarantees the right of the \n \n \n51 09-52586 \n \nPalestinian people to create their own independent \nState, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, an Israeli \nwithdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, \nincluding Syrian and Lebanese territories, and a stable, \nsecure and peaceful existence for all peoples of the \nregion. \n The Kingdom of Morocco expresses its \nappreciation to the United States Administration for its \nefforts and for the encouraging positions taken by \nPresident Obama. We hope that it will persevere in \norder to overcome obstacles to a resumption of \nnegotiations. We also commend all other international \nefforts, including European efforts, to that end.  \n Those efforts will be productive only if Israel \nhalts its illegal practices, which prevent the \nachievement of peace. Those practices, in particular the \nbuilding of settlements in the occupied Palestinian \nterritories and the unjust blockade against our brotherly \nPalestinian people, run counter to the peace option. \nThe settlement activities and the expulsions taking \nplace in Al-Quds, aimed at altering the legal and \ndemographic status of that holy city, are flagrant \nviolations of international instruments and require \nurgent action on the part of all peace-loving countries.  \n In that regard, His Majesty Mohammed VI, in his \ncapacity as Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, has \nalways warned the international community against the \nrisks associated with altering the legal status of \nAl-Quds. He has also been urging the influential \ninternational Powers to swiftly implement the \nrequirements of international legitimacy in order to \npreserve the religious, cultural and spiritual features of \nthe holy city in such a way as to create appropriate \nconditions conducive to the resumption of the peace \nprocess. \n The achievement of peace through the peaceful \nresolution of conflicts is the essence of the historical \nmandate of the United Nations. It should be based on \nthe principles of equality among States and respect for \ntheir independence and territorial integrity, in \naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations. In \naddition, there is a need to eliminate all weapons of \nmass destruction and to combat terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations.  \n As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, \nMorocco will continue its relevant activities, including \nby mobilizing efforts in support of African countries. \nSuch efforts are being made within the framework of \nSouth-South cooperation, with concrete projects, \ndefined goals and shared benefits and in keeping with \nthe priorities of Moroccan foreign policy as determined \nby His Majesty King Mohammed VI. As one of the \nfirst active participants in United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions, Morocco has always taken a keen interest in \nUnited Nations efforts to enhance such operations as \npart of the new partnership proposed to adapt to \ninternational developments and the requirements for \nlasting peace. \n Furthermore, recent developments in the area of \ndisarmament provide reason for optimism. The \npositions expressed and the statements made at the \nhighest levels augur well and maintain the momentum \nfor disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. We hope \nthat efforts will be made at the international and \nregional levels for the entry into force of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, given the \noutcome of the meeting on article 14 of the Treaty, \nwhich I had the honour to co-chair last Thursday with \nmy colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of \nFrance.  \n Since its establishment, the United Nations has \nendeavoured to promote international and regional \ncooperation to uphold the principles of coexistence, \npeace, good-neighbourliness and consultation at a time \nwhen regional economic gatherings are playing a \npivotal role in addressing economic, security and \nenvironmental issues. Convinced of that role, Morocco \nhas taken a keen interest in promoting good-\nneighbourly relations in nearby African, Maghreb and \nMediterranean regions. Likewise, Morocco supports \nthe Mediterranean Union as a promising framework for \nincreasing dialogue and cooperation between the two \nsides of the Mediterranean. Moreover, on 4 August \n2009, mindful of the important role of the Atlantic \nOcean and the opportunities it provides for collective \naction, Morocco launched an initiative aimed at \ncooperation among African countries bordering the \nAtlantic as the basis for a broader partnership with \nother coastal countries in that geo-strategic region.  \n His Majesty King Mohammad VI has reaffirmed \nMorocco\u2019s strong and enduring resolve to contribute in \ngood faith to the consolidation of the Arab Maghreb \nUnion, the reactivation of its structures and the \nstrengthening of relations among its members, \nincluding brotherly Algeria. Indeed, that regional body \ncould play a central role in building fruitful \npartnerships and in ensuring security and stability in \n  \n \n09-52586 52 \n \nAfrica, the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Our \nbelief that the Arab Maghreb project must be \nreactivated as an embodiment of our peoples\u2019 hopes \nand aspirations is in keeping with our sincere desire to \nwork to remove all obstacles to the realization of our \npeoples\u2019 expectations and the consolidation of \nbrotherly relations among its five members.  \n In that regard, Morocco has responded \nresponsibly and in good faith to the appeals of the \nSecurity Council for efforts to find a political, lasting \nand negotiated solution to the regional dispute over the \nMoroccan Sahara. A bold autonomy initiative, regarded \nas serious and credible by the international community, \nhas been proposed as a promising and realistic basis for \na lasting solution to that artificial conflict. \n With the same resolve and responsibility, \nMorocco, with the support of the Security Council, has \nbeen engaged in the new dynamic resulting from its \ninitiative aimed at negotiations under United Nations \nsupervision. In its resolutions 1813 (2008) and 1871 \n(2009), the Council called for serious and intense \nnegotiations in a spirit of compromise and realism with \na view to finding a political, lasting and negotiated \nsolution that is in keeping with the principle of \nself-determination and that cannot be monopolized by \nanyone or selectively interpreted to conceal undeclared \nobjectives and a hidden agenda. Morocco will continue \nits full cooperation with the Secretary-General and his  \nPersonal Envoy to find a definitive solution to this \nregional dispute that fully respects the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco and \ngrants autonomous status to the population of the \nSahara provinces, which is likely to ensure their \nprogress and well-being and enable them to manage \ntheir domestic affairs in a democratic manner. \n The Kingdom of Morocco has always been at the \nforefront of international and regional initiatives aimed \nat promoting the values of dialogue, tolerance and \nopenness to others, especially as they relate to the \nnecessary dialogue between Islam and the West and to \nrespecting universal human rights standards, as \nprevalent as they are all over the world. \n Based on those convictions, Morocco will \ncontinue to promote its fruitful cooperation and \npositive dialogue at the bilateral, regional and global \nlevels. Motivated by the same spirit of commitment, \nthe Kingdom of Morocco will assume its responsibility \nand will play its role fully within the main United \nNations bodies, with a view to reinforcing the \nOrganization\u2019s efficiency, credibility and contribution. \n May the blessings, peace and mercy of Allah be \nupon all participants."

        "file_text": "It \nis my pleasure, Sir, to convey to you on behalf of the \nState of Kuwait and on my own account our most \nsincere congratulations on your election as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. \nUndoubtedly, your long regional and international \nexperience will be an important asset in achieving the \nsuccess we desire in the work of this important session \nof the General Assembly. I also wish to pay tribute to \nthe presidency of your predecessor, His Excellency \nFather Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, former Minister \nfor Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua, during the sixty-third \nsession. I cannot fail to express also our appreciation for \nthe efforts and good offices of His Excellency \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and of the entire \nSecretariat staff. We thank them for all their efforts in \nthe service of peace and security and in improving the \nperformance and the programmes of United Nations \nbodies with a view to enhancing and developing their \ncapacities to keep pace with new developments on the \ninternational scene and to respond effectively to the \nchallenges and dangers of today\u2019s world. \n Never before has the world been in such need of a \nstrong, effective global organization. The diversity and \ncomplexity of the challenges, crises and new \ndevelopments which confront our world today, in \naddition to regional and international questions that \nhave remained unresolved for a long time, require \nMember States to shoulder their responsibilities in \nsupporting this Organization, providing it with the \nfinancial resources it needs to perform its duties and \ndischarge its responsibilities effectively and with \ninnovative methodology. Also, the United Nations \nitself has a responsibility to improve its own \nadministrative structure and its performance in the \nfield, and to enhance its capacity to detect and monitor \ndeveloping challenges. This must be commensurate \nwith the current dangers, which require bold initiatives, \nquick action and effective treatment.  \n Combating terrorism; eradicating poverty and \nhunger; combating dangerous diseases such as \nHIV/AIDS, malaria and the A (H1N1) influenza virus, \nwhich of late has spread in a frightful manner all over \nthe world; and dealing with the spread of the scourge \nof illegal drugs: these are all challenges that require \nfrom our Organization innovative joint action that \nrecognizes the dangers, diagnoses the crises, prepares \nthe resources and intervenes effectively in a radical and \ncollective fashion. Also, mobilizing specialized \nregional organizations to act in a concerted and \norganized effort is an important element in addressing \nthese challenges. \n Moreover, there are other challenges and threats \nfrom which the international community still suffers, \nthe most prominent being the financial and economic \ncrisis and the phenomenon of climate change. The \nfinancial crisis has had a negative impact on the \neconomies of the developing countries and has \nimpeded their efforts to attain the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). This has resulted in the \nemergence of economic and social problems such as a \nhigh rate of unemployment, deceleration in the rate of \neconomic growth, the collapse of financial markets and \nan obvious contraction in regional and world trade. \n In this regard, we welcome the Outcome \nDocument adopted by the high-level meeting convened \nby the President of the General Assembly last June (see \nresolution 63/303), where commitments were made to \nhelp developing countries overcome the effects of the \nfinancial crisis, through an increase in official \ndevelopment assistance, and to improve the \ninternational trade system. It also emphasized the need \nto continue the reform of the international financial \ninstitutions to ensure equitable representation on their \nexecutive boards and to enhance their oversight role, as \nwell as to improve the conditions for providing \nfinancial and technical assistance for the developing \nand least developed countries. \n \n \n37 09-52463 \n \n That effort, along with joint arrangements, led to \nthe emergence of signs of global economic recovery \nduring the last few weeks. It is our hope that such \naction will continue in order to address a no less \ndangerous crisis, that of climate change and the \ndegradation of the environment. This problem requires \nan urgent global response. In this regard, we look \nforward to the success of the important Climate \nChange Conference, to be held in December in \nCopenhagen, Denmark.  \n Kuwait will be honoured to host in \nmid-December their Majesties and Highnesses, the \nleaders of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States \nof the Gulf, at their thirtieth Summit Conference, \nwhere they will have a full agenda. Foremost of the \nmany issues before them will be a project of vital \nimportance: the electric grid linking their States. We \nhope that this strategic step will be the first of many, \nincluding the monetary unification project and the \nissuance of a unified Gulf currency. \n The State of Kuwait is proud to top the list of \nArab States, and to hold thirty-third position overall, in \nhuman development. As indicated in the Arab Human \nDevelopment Report 2009, \u201cChallenges to Human \nSecurity in the Arab Countries\u201d, issued by the United \nNations Development Programme, Kuwait scored the \nhighest marks among the Arab States in the fields of \neducation, health and general freedoms. Let there be no \ndoubt that the Government of Kuwait will continue its \nefforts to improve economic and social conditions, and \nto achieve all the Millennium Development Goals even \nbefore the target date, which will provide a better life \nfor its citizens and residents. \n Kuwait is proud, too, that the United Nations \nOffice on Drugs and Crime, located in Vienna, has \nlisted Kuwait as first among Arab States, and third \nglobally, in combating illegal drugs and drug \ntrafficking. That was possible only through a focused \nnational effort and broad regional cooperation, which \nachieved outstanding results. \n The State of Kuwait will continue steadily to \nmeet all its financial commitments to international and \nregional institutes, funds and programmes in the field \nof development assistance as well as to support \ninfrastructure projects in the developing and least \ndeveloped countries. Kuwait will also continue to \ncontribute to development projects through the Kuwait \nFund for Arab Economic Development, which since its \nestablishment in 1961 has provided assistance \namounting to more than $14.5 billion to more than a \nhundred countries.  \n The State of Kuwait has also taken initiatives to \nstimulate economic growth, raise living standards and \nreduce poverty in States suffering from the increase in \nprices of basic food commodities. For this purpose, \nKuwait has established the Decent Living Fund, with \n$100 million capital, and has allocated $300 million to \nfight poverty in Africa through the Islamic \nDevelopment Bank. \n Although Kuwait is a developing country, the \npercentage of humanitarian development aid that it \nprovides exceeds the target adopted at international \nconferences, reaching 1.31 per cent of its gross \nnational product, compared with 0.45 per cent of the \ngross national product of States members of the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD). \n Based on the State of Kuwait\u2019s realization of the \nimportance of economic cooperation and trade in \nconsolidating relations between States, His Highness \nthe Emir of the State of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah \nAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, convened the first Arab \nEconomic Summit, focusing on development, which \nKuwait hosted last January. The Conference adopted a \nnumber of important and ambitious economic projects \naimed at reaching new horizons of partnership and \ncooperation. Also adopted was the proposal by the \nState of Kuwait to establish a $1 billion fund, to which \nwe will contribute $500 million, to support and finance \nsmall and medium-size development projects, which \nwill help raise the standards of living of Arab citizens. \n The June parliamentary elections in my country \nrepresented a qualitative transformation in Kuwaiti \nparliamentary life, with four women obtaining the trust \nand support of the Kuwaiti voters. They now join their \nbrothers in representing the Kuwaiti people and \nexpressing their ambitions under the dome of the \nNational Assembly. This civilized accomplishment \ncomes after Kuwaiti women have achieved success in \nthe fields of private and public enterprise, as well as \ngovernment work, including holding ministerial \npositions in the Kuwaiti Cabinet. We express our pride \nin, and appreciation of, the significant achievements of \nKuwaiti women and will continue to support their role \nas active partners in the political, economic and social \nfields. \n  \n \n09-52463 38 \n \n We express much sorrow and pain that the \nquestion of Palestine has remained unresolved for over \nsix decades, despite numerous international efforts and \ninitiatives by a number of international and regional \nparties. A source of major concern is the deteriorating \npolitical, economic, social and humanitarian situation \nin the occupied Palestinian territories, including \nJerusalem, as a result of the continued exercise by \nIsrael, the occupying Power, of its illegal policies and \npractices, contrary to international law and relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions. \n In this regard, we renew our condemnation of \nrepeated Israeli aggression against the occupied \nterritories, in particular, the military aggression against \nGaza last December, in which more than \n1,400 Palestinians, among them women, children and \nthe elderly, were killed. That aggression also resulted \nin the unjustifiable destruction of homes, property and \ncivilian infrastructure.  \n We call upon the international community, the \nSecurity Council in particular, to assume its \nresponsibilities and take all necessary measures to stop \nIsrael\u2019s violation of international humanitarian law and \nits settlement activities as well as the policy of \ncollective punishment it imposes on the Palestinian \npeople. That policy is applied through its blockade of \nGaza and its restriction of the freedom of access and \nmovement of persons in all areas, including in the \noccupied territories. We also call for an immediate halt \nto Israel\u2019s settlement activities, which are carried out \nunder unacceptable pretexts. \n The State of Kuwait also wishes to refer to the \nreport (A/HRC/12/48) of the United Nations Fact \nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, which clearly \nproves that the Israeli forces committed war crimes \nduring the brutal aggression against Gaza last year. \nThis represents a grave violation of international \nhumanitarian law. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the \nSecurity Council and the broader United Nations to \nassume their responsibility to stop these crimes against \nhumanity and to punish the perpetrators in accordance \nwith international law. \n Because of its moral and national responsibilities, \nas well as its steady support for the Palestinian cause, \nthe State of Kuwait, in addition to supporting \ninternational efforts to improve living conditions in \nGaza and to rebuild what the Israeli aggression against \nGaza destroyed, has voluntarily pledged to donate \n$500 million, $200 million of which is to rebuild Gaza. \nThis is a portion of its commitments within the context \nof the League of Arab States to support the Palestinian \nAuthority. \n Kuwait also took the initiative of responding to \nthe appeal that the United Nations Relief and Works \nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \n(UNRWA) launched last December by donating the \nentire amount sought, $34 million, to cover the cost of \nurgently needed relief aid. \n In this context, we believe that the suffering of \nthe Palestinian people will continue until there is a \npermanent, just and comprehensive peace, which must \nmean ending the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian \nterritories, the establishment of a Palestinian State, \nwith Jerusalem as its capital, and total Israeli \nwithdrawal from all Arab territories it has occupied \nsince 4 June 1967, in implementation of relevant \nSecurity Council resolutions, the Road Map and the \nArab Peace Initiative. \n As for Iraq, the State of Kuwait commends the \nspeedy efforts of the Iraqi Government to achieve \npeace, security, stability and prosperity for the Iraqi \npeople. Kuwait supports every action that will preserve \nthe sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity \nof brotherly Iraq and ensure non-interference in its \ninternal affairs. The State of Kuwait also condemns all \nacts of terrorism in Iraq aimed at destabilizing its \nsecurity and stability and instigating detestable violent \nsectarianism. \n To put an end to the so-called sectarian violence, \nit is important to resume the policy of dialogue and \nnational reconciliation in order to ensure ample \nparticipation by all sectors of society in all phases of \nthe political process, including the parliamentary \nelections to be held next January. The State of Kuwait \nwill continue to support every effort to assist brotherly \nIraq to regain its standing and natural position in its \nregional and international environment, in order to \nbuild a democratic, unified and peaceful Iraq, living in \npeace internally and with its neighbours, committed to \nfulfil its obligations as laid down in resolutions of \ninternational legitimacy. \n The State of Kuwait hopes that the conflict over \nthe occupied United Arab Emirates islands will be \nresolved by peaceful means. It calls upon the friendly \nIslamic Republic of Iran to settle the question through \n \n \n39 09-52463 \n \ndirect brotherly negotiations or by recourse to the \nInternational Court of Justice. \n The resolution of conflicts and the settlement of \ndifferences between States, particularly in our region, \nmust depend on a set of firm principles, deeply rooted \nin international relations, and emanating from \nresolutions of international legitimacy and the rules of \ninternational law. If necessary, a decision of the \nInternational Court of Justice must be sought to \npreserve good-neighbourly relations. That basis and \nthose legal principles cannot be sidestepped to achieve \nthe self-interests of one side at the expense of the other. \nIn no case would that serve good-neighbourly relations \nor the building of mutual trust, and therefore it would \naffect the peace and stability of the parties, as well as \ninternational peace and security. \n We followed with great interest yesterday\u2019s \nSecurity Council summit (see S/PV.6191) addressing \none of the most important matters affecting \ninternational peace and security, nuclear disarmament, \nin order to create a world free of nuclear weapons. We \nnoted with satisfaction the unanimous adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1887 (2009), which sets \nthe stage for a world free of nuclear weapons and \nweapons of mass destruction, a world that fulfils the \nhopes of humanity and ensures the safety and \nprosperity of the world\u2019s peoples. \n While Kuwait supports the right of all States to \nuse nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, it reiterates \nits deep-rooted belief in the important need for \ndisarmament of all weapons of mass destruction and \nfor declaring the Middle East region a zone free from \nnuclear weapons. We renew our call to deal seriously \nwith Israel, the only country in the region that did not \nadhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and \ncall upon Israel to adhere to the Treaty and subject all \nits facilities to comprehensive International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. \n Kuwait also hopes that negotiations between the \nfriendly Islamic Republic of Iran, the IAEA and other \ncountries concerned will continue, with a view to \nreaching a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear \nissue in order to dispel the fears and doubts \nsurrounding the nature and purpose of its programme. \n In conclusion, it is our hope that joint political \nwill can be mustered to achieve the noble purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter and to confront the serious \nchallenges facing our world today.  \n There is also an urgent need to redouble our \nefforts to reject fanaticism and xenophobia, and to \ncontinue strengthening the dialogue between different \ncivilizations and religions as the ideal mode for \nachieving understanding between cultures. This will \ncreate an appropriate environment to consolidate the \nprinciple of mutual respect and build bridges between \nsocieties."

        "file_text": "It is a great \nhonour for me to address the General Assembly today \nin my capacity as the Chairman of the Presidency of \nBosnia and Herzegovina. At the very outset, allow me \nto congratulate the President of the Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session and the other members of the \nBureau on their election, and to express our full \nsupport to their future work. Furthermore, I would like \nto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, whom I met on several occasions, on the \nresults achieved during his presidency of the sixty-\nthird session of the General Assembly at a time when \nthis body and the international community in general \nwere facing an array of challenges related to pressing \nglobal issues.  \n Sessions of the General Assembly have always \nserved as opportunities for leaders of States to gather \nand exchange their opinions about the situation in the \nworld with the aim of finding the most suitable \nsolutions for current global issues. The United Nations, \nlike other organizations, depends upon the collective \nstrength of its Members; that strength needs to be \nbased on consensus among Member States. One of the \nmost pressing issues that has marked the past year is \nthe global economic and financial crisis, which has \nbecome the biggest threat to global peace and stability. \nIf we miss the opportunity to tackle its negative effects \nimmediately, it could produce unimaginable \nconsequences throughout the world. \n Even though there are indicators which show that \nrecession in developed countries is slowly abating, it is \nevident that recovery will be slow and time-consuming. \nWith regard to the developing and less developed \ncountries, we can only imagine the harmful \nconsequences that this crisis could produce in the times \nahead. It is more than obvious that countries cannot \ncombat these crises on their own, regardless of the \nefficiency of their Governments. Global crisis requires \nglobal solutions.  \n Ms. Koirala (Nepal), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n We welcome the adoption of the outcome \ndocument of the recent high-level Conference on the \nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \nDevelopment (resolution 63/303, annex). The \nConference confirmed once again that the role of the \nUnited Nations \u2014 and especially of the General \n \n \n7 09-52320 \n \nAssembly, as one of the most democratic of forums \u2014 \nis to lead this process and find new modalities for \nimprovement of cooperation with the aim of \nestablishing effective mechanisms for preventing crises \nand alleviating and eliminating their consequences, as \nwell as for eradicating poverty and establishing social \njustice in the world. \n It is accurate to say that the present global \neconomic crisis \u2014 the severest since the establishment \nof the United Nations \u2014 has heavily compromised and \neven jeopardized the attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, one of the noblest tasks set by the \nOrganization since its foundation. This applies in \nparticular to the poorest countries, and especially to \nsub-Saharan African countries that had failed to \nachieve positive results even before the onset of the \ncrisis. I stress that besides the responsibility borne by \nthose countries pertaining to their activities in \nestablishing good governance and the rule of law, \nwhich are prerequisites for achieving the \naforementioned development goals, a huge \nresponsibility lies with the developed countries. \n It is exactly the developed countries that are \nexpected to do everything in their power in order to \novercome the global economic crisis. We think that \nduring the crisis it is necessary to reform the global \nfinancial system and make it more transparent, to \ndevelop mechanisms for market monitoring and thus to \navoid the mistakes that occurred in the period prior to \nthe current decrease in the global GDP.  \n State institutions in my country \u2014 Bosnia and \nHerzegovina \u2014 have made systematic efforts to \naccomplish the Millennium Development Goals, and \nwe believe that other than the difficulties caused by \nglobal economic volatility, there possibly will be no \nother obstacles in the context of finalizing the defined \ntasks by 2015. At the moment, Bosnia and Herzegovina \nis preparing a development strategy and a social \ninclusion strategy. The anti-poverty strategy was \ndrafted earlier and has been implemented. Such \nprojects have been carried out in cooperation with \nrelevant United Nations agencies in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, and I wish to take this opportunity to \nexpress my gratitude for that intensive cooperation. \n Climate change is one of the key issues that \nrequire an urgent response from the international \ncommunity. Bosnia and Herzegovina aspires to end the \nyear 2009 with successful completion of international \nnegotiations on climate change. Furthermore, we hope \nthat the Copenhagen summit will produce an \nagreement that outpaces the Kyoto Protocol and that it \nwill gain the support of the United Nations Member \nStates.  \n However, it is not only island countries that are \naffected by this problem. It is a universal challenge and \nthreat. Humanitarian catastrophes caused by weather \nconditions that have affected parts of our planet over \nrecent years should serve as a warning to all of us. \nNeither economic nor political interests must be \nallowed to obstruct the achievement of a global \nconsensus as the true beginning of a global struggle to \nprevent the loss of the natural balance of our planet. \n All of us gathered here today agree that \nconsensus and comprehensive reform of the United \nNations system is necessary and that it ought to be \ncarried out in a careful, prudent manner that ensures \nthe broadest consensus of the Member States. United \nNations reform should result in efficient and \ncoordinated functioning of all bodies of the system. \nHowever, a widely accepted perspective is that the \nreform of the Security Council is of key importance for \nsubstantive reform of the entire system of the world \norganization.  \n I am convinced that the majority agree with me \nthat Security Council reform ought primarily to result \nin better transparency of that body and its activities and \nshould provide for a considerably larger spectrum of \nnon-member States to participate in its work. That \napplies in particular to countries that are most on the \nCouncil\u2019s agenda, countries that are directly affected \nby a particular crisis, as well as countries that could \nuse their expertise or experience gained in similar \nsituations that contribute to following the best and \nmost acceptable solutions. \n We all have to be aware that any further delay in \nSecurity Council reform will undermine the credibility \nof that body, whereas the willingness to reach a \ncompromise must be an imperative. Dialogue and \ncompromise are the only way to ensure the broadest \npossible support for reforms.  \n Bosnia and Herzegovina is of the opinion that \nSecurity Council reform should urgently commence. In \nany case, we believe that in the future reformed \nCouncil, the group of Eastern European countries must \nhave another non-permanent seat, considering that the \n \n \n09-52320 8 \n \nnumber of countries in that group has more than \ndoubled in the last two decades. \n I wish to emphasize that I expect the Council to \nengage more strongly in preventive diplomacy. We \nbelieve that taking that new course of action would \nmean that many issues and crises could be solved \nbefore they become aggravated, thus increasing the \nCouncil\u2019s efficiency. Ensuring timely and efficient \nconflict prevention, rather than reacting once a crisis \nhas already escalated, is a more efficient and less \nexpensive method for preserving peace and security. \n Unfortunately, armed conflicts remain the reality \nof our world, and those most in danger are the poorest \npeoples and nations, who are left to fend for \nthemselves. Therefore, it is necessary to foster \nadditional United Nations early warning mechanisms \nand establish multiple sources of information in order \nto create a true picture of the situation and at the same \ntime strengthen countries\u2019 abilities to resist enticements \nthat lead to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \ncrimes against humanity. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina remains committed to \nfull cooperation with the International Criminal \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, since those \nindicted for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia must \nbe prosecuted. Meanwhile, a legal framework has been \nset up in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Court of \nBosnia and Herzegovina has begun to prosecute war \ncrimes. That is one of the requirements for building \nmutual confidence and reconciliation in post-conflict \nBosnia and Herzegovina. \n The number of refugees has been growing daily \naround the globe, but less effort and fewer means are \ndevoted to finding a concrete solution to this global \nissue. We in Bosnia and Herzegovina are well \nacquainted with the destiny, pain and suffering of \nrefugees, and thus we urge maximum effort to \nsystematically resolve the global refugee crises. We \nsupport the joint and continued endeavours of all \nUnited Nations agencies and the non-governmental \nsector that directly deal with this problem. We are \nwilling to offer cooperation in every aspect. \n With regard to United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions, we believe that, with foresight and \nconsidering the best practices, each crisis has to be \ncarefully examined, taking into consideration all its \ncauses, if we are to find a sustainable and justifiable \nsolution. We believe that there are no universal \nsolutions applicable to every crisis, to the requirements \nof each particular case. \n Various cultures and traditions have coexisted in \nthe Balkans for centuries. We are willing to share both \nour positive and negative experiences in the post-\nconflict peacebuilding aspect.  \n The foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is \naimed at preserving and improving long-lasting peace, \nsecurity and stability, democratic and comprehensive \nsocial development and contributions to international \npeace and stability. \n The presence, participation and actions of small \ncountries in the decision-making process of the \nSecurity Council are of great importance in \nmaintaining balance within the Council. However, \napart from the views of the permanent members and \nworld Powers, the Council needs to encourage smaller \ncountries to present their views and participate in the \ndecision-making process of that body, which in some \nways represents global government. That is one of the \nreasons why we decided, after careful consideration \nand for the first time in our history, to run for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \nperiod 2010-2011. Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has \nbeen the main topic of numerous debates of the \ninternational community, today wants to have the \ncapacity to actively participate in and contribute to the \nwork of the Security Council.  \n As a small but multi-ethnic, multinational and \nmultireligious country with a rich historic heritage, \nBosnia and Herzegovina is conversant with a plethora \nof sociopolitical systems and cultural and historical \ncontexts. Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to share its \nexperience in peacebuilding in a post-conflict situation, \nparticularly in the area of confidence-building among \nmulticultural communities, and thus actively contribute \nto better understanding and long-term reconciliation in \nsuch regions.  \n Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina actively \nparticipates in the work of international organizations, \nespecially the work of the United Nations. It has been a \nmember of the Human Rights Council since June 2007, \nand within the Council\u2019s framework it has been \nworking on promoting and protecting human rights \nthroughout the world. Since 2000, members of the \narmed forces and police forces from Bosnia and \nHerzegovina have been equal participants in United \nNations international military and police missions in \n \n \n9 09-52320 \n \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, \nEritrea, Liberia, Sudan, East Timor, Cyprus and Haiti, \nthus contributing to the preservation of international \npeace and stability. Furthermore, it supports \ninternational efforts to stabilize the situations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. \n Finding a solution to the Middle East crisis \nremains one of the priorities of the world Organization. \nWe believe that positive momentum ought to be used in \nthe best possible manner to establish equitable and \ncomprehensive peace in this region. After so many \nyears of suffering, bloodshed, tension, mutual \nmisunderstanding and conflict, we must support the \nlatest activities of the Quartet members, as well as \nregional initiatives aimed at taking the crucial step \nforward leading to sustainable peace, which implies \ncreation of a sovereign, independent and self-\nsustaining Palestinian State. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina has been closely \nfollowing the situation in Africa. We expect that \ndespite the hard-hitting global economic crisis, the \nworld\u2019s most developed countries will continue to \nincrease the percentage of their gross domestic product \nthat they contribute to official development assistance \nand to contribute the other expertise necessary for \nstrengthening the capacities of poor African countries. \nWe therefore welcome the efforts by the United \nNations through the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment intended to lead Africa to stable and \nsustainable development and to fulfil the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals.  \n This particularly relates to sub-Saharan countries. \nWe support the efforts of the African Union, African \nGovernments, the United Nations, the United Nations \nOffice for West Africa and other regional initiatives \ndesigned to improve the rule of law and democracy and \nto strengthen capacities of civil society and \ninstitutions, and thus to upgrade all aspects of social \nlife. We underline the importance of the continued \nprovision of material aid for Africa, as well as \nimproved use of these resources towards sustainable \ndevelopment. \n Nowadays, when political and social processes \nare more dynamic than ever and we are facing \nchallenges quite opposite from those of several decades \nago, it has become more obvious that only a strong, \nmultilateral approach can provide the right answers. \nThe United Nations has faced numerous challenges, yet \nit remains the only path leading to a better future and \nthe only Organization able to offer adequate solutions \nto the array of global issues we are facing. If we work \ntogether to implement the conclusions reached here at \nthis high-level event, we will undoubtedly live in better \nand more equitable conditions than is the case today. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to fully \ncontribute to the work of the United Nations. I would \nlike to express my gratitude to all Member States who \nsupported Bosnia and Herzegovina and who are willing \nto elect my country as a non-permanent member of the \nSecurity Council for the period 2010-2011."

        "file_text": "At the outset, please allow me to \ncongratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election \nas President of the United Nations General Assembly at \nits sixty-fourth session. We wish him success in his \nwork and assure him of Montenegro\u2019s unwavering \nsupport. \n I would also like to thank the former President, \nMiguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for his endeavours and \npersonal contribution in discharging this challenging \npost. \n At the same time I would like to pay my tribute to \nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \noutstanding efforts in leading the Organization in these \ntrying times. \n As we have heard from the statements of previous \ndistinguished speakers, given the impact of the world \neconomic and financial crisis and related food and \nenergy crises, climate change and the flu pandemic on \nthe economic and social growth and development, \npolitics and global relations, including achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other \ninternationally agreed development goals, only a \ncoordinated and a concerted global effort can yield \npositive results. \n Response to current challenges requires, \ntherefore, that we pool all capacities and resources, as \nwell as a strong political will from us all. In this, the \nkey role belongs to the United Nations, the world\u2019s \nmost important multilateral forum. \n Montenegro, as a country that advocates the \nequality of peoples and nations in international \nrelations, is fully committed to active participation in \nefforts to work out a global response to present-day \nchallenges. Preserving peace and security through \nactivities aimed at creating positive political, \neconomic, social and cultural environments for the \nimplementation and respect of international law, the \nrule of law and the protection and promotion of \nfundamental human rights and freedoms are the main \nprinciples and bases of the Montenegrin foreign policy \npriorities. \n In that regard, Montenegro remains strongly \ncommitted to the fundamental principles and purposes \nof the United Nations Charter, which imply peaceful \nresolution of disputes and non-interference in the \ninternal affairs of States. \n  \n \n09-52470 34 \n \n Strong cooperation with neighbouring countries \nand regional stability are the underlying principles of \nthe foreign policy of Montenegro and a precondition \nfor progress in its broader integration processes. Since \nthe previous General Assembly session, we have \nmoved to a new and more demanding phase of \nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration. We feel \nparticularly encouraged by the dynamic progress \nMontenegro has made towards membership in the \nEuropean Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO). We expect that in the near future \nthe European Commission will issue an opinion on \nMontenegro\u2019s preparedness for EU membership, and \nwe also expect an invitation to join in the NATO \nMembership Action Plan, which will open additional \nopportunities for those two integration processes to \ngain momentum. \n Taking into consideration the strong impact of the \nworld economic and financial crisis on overall socio-\neconomic development, the most recent reports from \nthe global financial markets are encouraging, \nindicating an end to the global crisis even earlier than \nexpected. However, in order to ensure sustained \neconomic development, increased aid and \nimplementation of trade agreements and the \nachievement of international solidarity is imperative in \naddressing the needs of the world\u2019s poorest and most \nvulnerable. \n Given that the recovery is going to be long and \ngradual, all countries, led by the United Nations, \nshould be committed to the implementation of policies \nand measures initiated in the various international \nforums, including the United Nations Conference on \nthe world economic and financial crisis and its impact \non development, the G-20, World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund. \n Bearing in mind the nature of the Montenegrin \neconomy as a small and open system, we have not been \nable to remain immune to the turbulent global \ndevelopments. In that regard, the Government of \nMontenegro has adopted a package of economic policy \nmeasures aimed at maintaining macroeconomic \nstability, improving productivity and preserving a \nfavourable economic environment. \n The harmful consequences of climate change, \nincreasing energy consumption and growing \ndependence on imported fossil fuels, along with their \nnegative impacts on the environment and standards of \nliving, are issues causing profound concern among us \nall. The Summit on Climate Change held on the eve of \nthe general debate is, in our view, a significant step \nforward in Member States\u2019 political support for the \nprocess of the implementation of the MDGs in this \nfield. \n We believe that both the character and the effects \nof climate change call for a comprehensive \ninternational response based on the principles of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC), which would facilitate sustainable \neconomic development of society in accordance with \nthe guidelines of the 2007 Bali Action Plan. \n I would like to take this opportunity to express \nMontenegro\u2019s strong support for the negotiation \nprocess on a new post-2012 climate framework and for \ncalls to \u201cseal the deal\u201d in Copenhagen in December. \n We believe that further efforts need to be made to \npromote a green recovery and to build up national \ncapacities for adaptation and mitigation of the impact \nof climate change, while simultaneously stimulating \ninnovation and economic growth, contributing to \npoverty reduction and ensuring access to sustainable \nenergy sources. \n In that regard, we underline the importance of \nregional cooperation, which enables us to implement \nadaptation and mitigation measures in a regional \ncontext, which promotes political dialogue and leads to \nmore effective action by States in the talks within the \nUNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol frameworks. \n In order to contribute to the efforts being \nundertaken at the national and international levels in \naddressing the impact of climate change on the \nenvironment and economic development and in \nreaching a successful deal in Copenhagen, Montenegro \nwill organize a regional conference on climate change \nand sustainable development for the Mediterranean and \nSouth-East European countries in Budva, on 16 and \n17 October. \n The Millennium Development Goals require each \nand every one of us to redouble our efforts to reduce \npoverty, improve health and education, promote peace \nand human rights, and achieve sustainable \ndevelopment. We are aware that it is the primary \nresponsibility of States to take measures aimed at \nimproving the social security of the poor and \nvulnerable segments of society and alleviating the most \n \n \n35 09-52470 \n \nsevere consequences of poverty. In this context we \nstrongly welcome the convening of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) review summit in 2010. \n Montenegro strongly supports and is committed \nto fulfilment of the MDGs and implementation of all \nUnited Nations documents \u2014 including the \nMillennium Declaration \u2014 related to development \nissues and the special needs of Africa, as a pre-emptive \naction aimed at creating a safer world. As a country \nmoving towards European integration, we welcome the \nEuropean Union-Africa partnership and the efforts \ncurrently under way to find solutions to development \nneeds and to root out poverty on the African continent.  \n In this regard, we support the message of the \n2008 Yokohama Declaration aimed at giving \nmomentum to current development issues, including \neducation, health and sanitary measures within the \nframework of the MDGs, the development of \nagriculture to improve food security, measures to \ntackle climate change, as well as establishing and \nmaintaining peace as a prerequisite for economic \ngrowth. \n We emphasize the crucial importance of the \ndebate on the concept of the responsibility to protect, \nand we fully support the activities of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the assessments outlined in his latest \nreport. We believe that an upsurge of internal conflicts \nand serious violations of human rights in the 1990s has \nspurred a discussion on the need for the protection of \ncivilians in armed conflict, which has unquestionably \nled to further deliberations on and analyses of the \nprimary obligation of each State to protect its citizens \nfrom genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \ncrimes against humanity, as well as to consideration of \nthe international community\u2019s responsibility in the \nevent that countries fail to act. In this context, we \nunderline the importance of reaching an agreement on \nan appropriate concept and instruments within the \nframework of the United Nations and international law, \nbased on a broad consensus of all actors. \n In supporting peacekeeping missions as efficient \nand dynamic instruments for monitoring respect of \nhuman rights and building sustainable institutions in \nconflict areas, we have established legal prerequisites \nwithin our security policy in order to be able to \ncontribute our military and police troops to the United \nNations peacekeeping missions, including missions to \nLiberia, Afghanistan and Cyprus and the European \nUnion peace operation in Somalia.  \n Given the problems of the Balkan region, \nMontenegro attaches particular importance to a policy \nthat addresses the needs of refugees, asylum-seekers \nand internally displaced persons (IDPs) and is \nconducting extensive activities aimed at finding lasting \nsolutions for the refugees and IDPs from the territory \nof the former Yugoslavia. As part of those efforts, a \nrenewed registration procedure supported by the Office \nof the United Nations High Commissioner for \nRefugees (UNHCR) is under way for refugees and \nIDPs living in Montenegro to resolve their final status, \nin accordance with the highest international standards \nand international law instruments. \n In this regard we highlight the importance of a \ncomprehensive approach and the need for the \ncooperation of all actors, primarily UNHCR, the \nEuropean Commission and the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. \n Montenegro stresses the importance of the \npromotion of and the respect for international law in \nthe development of international relations today. In this \ncontext, the rule of law and the protection of human \nrights have an irreplaceable role in the fight against \ninternational terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction and organized crime. \n We are firmly convinced that only the \ncoordinated efforts of the global community can take \non international terrorism. Montenegro supports the \nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, as well as measures to fight \ncorruption, organized crime, drug trafficking and \nhuman trafficking, and we further underscore the need \nfor cooperation among all the bodies of the United \nNations system, in particular the committees of the \nSecurity Council and the Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee.  \n Montenegro attaches particular importance to the \nfulfilment of the obligations stipulated by the United \nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \nCrime and the United Nations Convention against \nIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic \nSubstances and it actively participates in projects of \nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which \ncontribute to regional peace and stability, strengthening \nof the judiciary and a more efficient fight against all \nforms of organized crime. \n  \n \n09-52470 36 \n \n In view of all of the above, it is clear that the \nresponsibility of the United Nations is only increasing. \nWe therefore welcome the reform process of the world \nOrganization and hope that it will result in a more \ndemocratic and representative United Nations. We \nattach particular importance to strengthening the role \nand efficiency of the General Assembly and its main \nbodies, and fully support intergovernmental talks on \nSecurity Council reform. These negotiations offer an \nopportunity for small States to express their interests, \nin addition to providing a vision for an improved and \nmore transparent functioning of the most important \nUnited Nations organ. \n As the Assembly may know, this past June the \nUnited Nations Development Group identified \nMontenegro as a country eligible for implementation of \nthe Delivering as One pilot initiative launched within \nthe framework of the overall reform process aimed at \nimproving the efficiency, coherence and coordination \nof United Nations development programmes on the \nground. In our view, that decision recognizes \nMontenegro\u2019s strong commitment to United Nations \nstandards and values and provides an endorsement of \nthe highly successful joint efforts of the United Nations \nteam and the Montenegrin Government. \n Given the myriad of challenges and their negative \neffects on the environment, as well as the potential \nincrease in social, religious and cultural tensions \nleading to political instability, only the coordinated and \ncomprehensive response of all international \nstakeholders, including civil society and the private \nsector, can create the preconditions for efficiently \naddressing the consequences of the ongoing crises. In \nthis regard, the United Nations has a decisive role to \nplay in coordinating efforts towards the achievement of \nconcrete results. \n Convinced of the great potential of the United \nNations, if supported by the active participation of \nMember States, we reiterate Montenegro\u2019s commitment \nto building a responsible international community \nready to meet the needs of all of its members."

        "file_text": "I thank Almighty God \nfor granting me the opportunity once again to address \nthis important international forum. \n At the outset, I wish to begin by congratulating \nMr. Ali Treki on his assumption of the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, and to \nwish him every success. I would also like to extend my \nthanks to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-third session, for \nhis excellent stewardship of the work of the Assembly \nduring his term. \n Over the past four years, I have spoken about the \nmain challenges facing our world. I have talked about \nthe underlying causes of those challenges and about the \nneed for world Powers to review their outlook and \nwork out new mechanisms to address the pressing \ninternational problems before us. I have also talked \nabout the two conflicting outlooks that prevail in our \nworld. One is based on the predominance of its \nmaterialistic interests through spreading inequality and \noppression, poverty and deprivation, aggression, \noccupation and deception and looks to bring the entire \nworld under its control and to impose its will on other \nnations. That outlook has produced nothing but \nfrustration, disappointment and a dark future for \nhumankind as a whole. \n The other outlook is one that espouses a belief in \nthe oneness of the Almighty God, follows the teachings \nof His messengers, respects human dignity and seeks to \nbuild a secure world for all members of the human \ncommunity in which everybody can equally enjoy the \nblessings of sustainable peace and spirituality. This is \nan outlook that respects all human beings, nations and \nvenerable cultures in defiance of all types of \ndiscrimination in the world. It is also one that commits \nitself to an ongoing fight to promote equality for all \nbefore the law on the basis of justice and fraternity \nwhile laying a solid foundation to guarantee equal \naccess for all human beings in their quest to excel in \nknowledge and science. \n Time and again, I have emphasized the need to \nmake fundamental changes in the current outlook on \nthe world and on humankind, so as to be able to create \na brighter tomorrow. \n Today, I wish to share with the Assembly a few \npoints about the changes that should take place. First, \nthe continuation of the current circumstances in the \nworld is clearly impossible. The present inequitable \nand unfavourable conditions run counter to the very \nnature of humankind and move in a direction that \ncontravenes the truth and the goal behind the creation \nof the world. It is no longer possible to inject trillions \nof dollars of unreal wealth into the world economy \nsimply by printing worthless paper assets or by \n \n \n33 09-52228 \n \ntransferring inflation and social and economic \nproblems to others by creating severe budget deficits.  \n The engine of unbridled capitalism, with its \nunfair system of thought, has reached the end of road \nand is unable to move. The era of capitalist thinking \nand the imposition of one\u2019s thoughts on the \ninternational community, which is intended to \ndominate the world in the name of globalization, as \nwell as the age of setting up empires, is over. It is no \nlonger possible to humiliate nations or to impose \ndouble standard on the world community. \n It is necessary to delegitimize and reject any \napproach that holds up the realization of the interests \nof certain Powers as the only measure of democracy or \nemploys despicable forms of intimidation and deceit in \nthe name of freedom and democratic practices. \nApproaches by which dictators are portrayed as \ndemocrats lack legitimacy and must be totally rejected. \nTime has come to an end for those who define \ndemocracy and freedom and set standards while they \nthemselves are the first to violate those fundamental \nprinciples. They can in fact no longer be both judge \nand executioner or challenge real democratically \nestablished Governments.  \n I would like to say again that the time has passed \nfor a group of people who believe that they alone can \ndefine concepts such as democracy and freedom and \nput forth the criteria for those definitions while \nsimultaneously violating the very principles to which \nthey claim to aspire. The continuation of Governments \nis based on the rule of the people. The development of \nnations and increasing freedom worldwide will no \nlonger allow them to continue their hypocrisy and \nvicious attitudes. For those reasons, most nations, \nincluding the people of the United States, are waiting \nfor real and profound change. They have welcomed \nand will continue to welcome change. \n How can it be possible that inhuman policies in \nPalestine have driven the entire population of the \ncountry from their homeland for over 60 years by \nmeans of force and coercion, attacking them with all \ntypes of weapons, including banned weapons, and \ndenying them their legitimate right of self-defence, \nand, to the astonishment of the international \ncommunity, calling the occupiers peacemakers and \nportraying the victims as terrorists? \n How can the crimes of the occupiers against \ndefenceless women and children and the destruction of \ntheir homes, farms, hospitals and schools be supported \nunconditionally by certain Governments and, at the \nsame time, oppressed men and women be subjected the \nharshest economic blockade, depriving them of \nresources to meet their basic needs, including food, \nwater and medicine, and leading to genocide? They are \nnot even allowed to rebuild their homes, destroyed \nduring the 22-day barbaric attacks of the Zionist \nregime, with winter approaching, while the aggressors \nand their supporters deceitfully continue their \nrhetorical defence of human rights in order to put \nothers under pressure. \n It is unacceptable for a small minority to \ndominate the politics, economy and culture of large \nparts of the world through complex systems, \nestablishing a de facto new form of slavery, and \nharming the reputation of other nations, even European \nnations and the United States, to achieve its racist \ngoals. \n It is unacceptable that nations several thousand \nmiles from the Middle East send their troops to \nintervene militarily and to promote war, bloodshed, \naggression, terror and fear in our region, the Middle \nEast, while brushing aside the protests of nations in the \nregion concerned about their future and their national \nsecurity, thereby violating peace and interfering in the \naffairs of others.  \n Such standpoints are baffling. We only have to \nlook at the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. A \ncountry cannot remain under military occupation in the \nname of the fight against terrorism and drug \ntrafficking, when the production of illicit drugs has \ngrown, terrorism has increased and tightened its grip, \nthousands of innocent people have been killed, injured \nor displaced, infrastructure has been destroyed and \nregional security has been seriously jeopardized.  \n Yet those who have created the current disastrous \nsituation continue to blame others. How can they talk \nabout friendship and solidarity with other nations while \nthey expand their military bases in various parts of the \nworld, including Latin America. That situation cannot \ncontinue. It is increasingly impossible to promote \nexpansionist and inhuman policies on the basis of \nmilitaristic logic. The logic of coercion and \nintimidation will have dire consequences and \nexacerbate current global problems. \n It is not acceptable that the military budgets of \nsome Governments far exceed the budgets of entire \n  \n \n09-52228 34 \n \ncountries of the world. Some countries export billions \nof dollars of arms every year, stockpile chemical, \nbiological and nuclear weapons, establish military \nbases or have a military presence in other countries \nwhile accusing others of militarism, and mobilize all \ntheir global resources to impede the scientific and \ntechnological progress of other nations under the \npretext of countering arms proliferation. \n It is not acceptable that the United Nations and \nthe Security Council, whose decisions should represent \nall nations and Governments through the application of \ndemocratic and popular methods of decision-making, \nbe dominated by a few Governments who seek to serve \ntheir own interests.  \n Above all, in a world where culture, ideas and \npublic opinion should be the only determining factors, \nthe present situation cannot continue and a \nfundamental change seems inevitable. We must strive \nto establish a new world system. \n Secondly, any change must be deep-seated both \nin theory and in practice, encompassing all spheres of \nour life. Outdated methods of government that have \ncaused the current problems in society cannot be used \nto bring about change and create a better world. \nLiberalism and capitalism, in particular the types that \nseek to dominate the world and to alienate people from \nspiritual and moral values, will never bring humankind \nhappiness, since they are the principal source of all \ndisasters, wars, poverty and deprivation. We have all \nseen how unfair economic structures controlled by \ncertain political interests have been used to plunder the \nnational wealth of countries for the benefit of a group \nof corrupt businesses. Existing structures are thus \nincapable of addressing the challenges that we face. \nThe political and economic structures created after the \nSecond World War that sought to dominate the world \nhave failed, in short, to promote justice and lasting \nsecurity. \n Rulers whose hearts do not beat with love for \nhumankind and who have abandoned ideas of justice \ncan never provide humankind with the promise of \npeace and friendship. By the grace of God, Marxism is \nno more; it is history now. And the unhindered growth \nof capitalism will certainly meet the same fate because, \nbased on the divine tradition of a principle in the Holy \nKoran, the deceitful one, like a bubble on the surface \nof water, will disappear. Only that which eternally \nserves the interests of human societies survives. \n We must therefore all remain vigilant to prevent \nthe pursuit of colonialism and discriminatory and \ninhuman goals disguised under slogans for change or in \nany new format. The world needs to undergo \nfundamental changes, and we must all engage \ncollectively to bring them about in the right way. \nThrough such efforts, no one and no Government \nwould consider itself an exception to change or \nsuperior to others, or try to impose its will on others by \nproclaiming world leadership. \n Thirdly, all of the problems that exist in our \nworld today emanate from the fact that rulers have \ndistanced themselves from human values, morality and \nthe teachings of divine messengers. Regrettably, in the \ncurrent state of international relations, selfishness and \ninsatiable greed have taken the place of such \nhumanitarian concepts as love, sacrifice, dignity and \njustice. Belief in the one God has been replaced with \nself-belief. Some have sought to take the place of God \nand insist on imposing their values and wishes on \nothers. Lies have taken the place of honesty, hypocrisy \nhas replaced integrity and selfishness has taken the \nplace of sacrifice. Nowadays, deception in interactions \nis called foresight and statesmanship. Looting the \nwealth of other nations is called development efforts. \nOccupation is introduced as a gift in promotion of \nfreedom and democracy. And defenceless nations are \nsubjected to repression in the name of the defence of \nhuman rights. \n Global problems will be resolved, justice \nadministered and peace maintained only through the \ncollective determination and cooperation of all nations \nand States. The era of a world polarized by the \npremises of hegemony or the domination by a few \nGovernments is over. Today, we must rise together \nthrough collective commitment against the present \nchallenges. We must take change seriously and work \ncollectively to help others return to basic moral and \nhuman values. \n Messengers were sent by God to show the light of \ntruth to humankind. They came to make people aware \nof their individual and social obligations. Living in \npiety, having faith in Allah and judgment of human \nbehaviour or conduct in the next world, believing in \nthe primacy of justice in both lives, seeking happiness, \nwell-being and security in the happiness, well-being \nand security of others, respecting humankind, making \nefforts to expand love and compassion against \nhostility \u2014 these were all paramount in the teachings \n \n \n35 09-52228 \n \noffered by the divine messengers of God, from Adam \nto Noah, Noah to Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ and \nthe last Prophet, Muhammad, may peace be upon all of \nthem. All of them came to eliminate war and \nignorance, eradicate poverty and uproot discrimination \nin order to spread happiness to the entire world. They \nare the best gifts that almighty God has granted to \nhuman beings. If the belief in Entezar \u2014 that is, in \npatiently awaiting the return of justice to Earth \u2014 can \nbecome a common goal and we join hands to achieve \nprosperity for all, then there will be greater and more \ngenuine hope for reform.  \n Fourthly, in my opinion, we have several \nimportant matters before us. The Secretary-General and \nthe General Assembly can take the lead by undertaking \nthe necessary measures to fulfil our shared goals on the \nbasis of the following actions. \n First, the United Nations should be restructured \nin order to transform this world body into an efficient \nand fully democratic organization, capable of playing \nan impartial, equitable and effective role in the \ninternational relations. The structure of the Security \nCouncil should be reformed, especially by abolishing \nthe discriminatory privilege of the veto right. The \ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people should be \nrestored by holding a referendum and free elections in \nPalestine to prepare an environment in which all \nPalestinian populations, including Muslims, Christians \nand Jews, can live together in peace and harmony. All \ntypes of interference in the affairs of Iraq, Afghanistan \nand the Middle East, as well as all countries of Africa, \nLatin America, Asia and Europe, must be ended. \n As our great Prophet said, a Government may \nsurvive with blasphemy, but never with oppression. \nThe Palestinians continue to suffer oppression and their \nrights continue to be violated. Yet another group of \nPalestinians who lived in al-Quds al-Sharif were forced \nout of their homes as the occupiers and usurpers \ncontinue to destroy their residential area. Bombings in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan have not yet stopped, the \nGuantanamo prison has not yet been shut down, and \nthere are still secret prisons in Europe. \n The continuation of the present situation adds to \nhostilities and violence. Oppression and military \naggression must be stopped. Regrettably, official \nreports concerning the brutalities of the Zionist regime \nin Gaza have not all been published. The Secretary-\nGeneral and the United Nations have crucial \nresponsibilities in this respect, and the international \ncommunity is impatiently waiting for the aggressors \nand the murderers of the defenceless people of Gaza to \nbe punished. \n Regarding the second action, current economic \nstructures must be reformed and a new international \neconomic order set up based on human and moral \nvalues and obligations. A new course is needed that \nwould help promote justice and progress worldwide by \nallowing the potential and talents of all nations to \nflourish, thus bringing well-being to all and for future \ngenerations. \n The third action is that international political \nrelations must undergo reform on the basis of \npromotion of lasting peace and friendship, the \neradication of arms races and the elimination of all \nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons to pave the \nway for all nations to have access to advanced and \npeaceful technologies for the advancement of the \nhuman race. \n The fourth action is that we should reform \ncultural structures, promote respect for the diverse \ncustoms and traditions of all nations and foster moral \nvalues and spirituality aimed at strengthening the \ninstitution of the family, which is the backbone of all \nhuman societies. \n For the fifth action, worldwide efforts must be \nmade to protect the environment and fully observe the \ninternational agreements and arrangements to prevent \nthe annihilation of nature\u2019s non-renewable resources. \n My fifth point is that our nation has successfully \ngone through a glorious and fully democratic election, \nopening a new chapter for our country in the march \ntowards national progress and enhanced international \ninteractions. Once again, a large majority has entrusted \nme with this heavy responsibility.  \n And now, I want to declare that our great nation, \nwhich has made significant contributions both to world \ncivilization and to the Islamic Republic of Iran itself, \nand as one of the most democratic and progressive \nGovernments in the world, is ready to mobilize all its \ncultural, political and economic capabilities to engage \nin a constructive process aimed at addressing the \ninternational concerns and confronting the challenges \nthat face human society. Our country, the builder of \ncultures, has itself been a principal victim of blind \n  \n \n09-52228 36 \n \nterrorism and the target of all-out military aggression \nduring the first decade of its revolution. \n Throughout the past 30 years, we have been \nsubject to the hostile attitudes of those who at one time \nsupported, with all their might, Saddam\u2019s military \naggression and his use of chemical weapons against us, \nand who at another time decided to take military action \nin Iraq to get rid of the same man. \n Today, our nation seeks to create a world in \nwhich justice and compassion will prevail. We \nannounce our commitment to participating in the \nprocess of building lasting peace and security \nworldwide for all nations, based on justice, spirituality \nand human dignity, while being dedicated to strongly \ndefending our legitimate and legal rights. \n To achieve those goals, our nation is prepared to \nwarmly shake all hands which are extended to us in \ngood faith. No nation can claim to be free of the need \nto change and reform in this journey towards \nperfection. We welcome real and humane changes and \nstand ready to actively engage in fundamental global \nreforms. \n Therefore, we emphasize that the only path to \ncontinued safety and security is to return to \nmonotheism and justice. That is the greatest hope and \nopportunity of all ages and generations. Without belief \nin God and commitment to the cause of justice, along \nwith the fight against injustice and discrimination, the \nworld structure will not be corrected. \n Man is at the centre of the universe. Man\u2019s \nunique feature is his humanity, a humanity that seeks \njustice, piety, love, knowledge, awareness and all other \nhigher values. These human values should be \nsupported, and each and every fellow human being \nshould be given the opportunity to develop them. \nNeglecting any of them is tantamount to the omission \nof an essential aspect of humanity. These are common \nelements which connect all human communities and \nwhich constitute the basis of peace, security and \nfriendship. \n Divine religions pay attention to all aspects of \nhuman life, including obedience to God, morality, \njustice, fighting oppression and endeavouring to \nestablish just and good governance. The Prophet \nAbraham called for the oneness of God against \nNimrod, as the Prophet Moses did the same against the \nPharaohs. Jesus Christ and the Prophet Muhammad, \nmay peace be upon them, did the same against the \noppressors of their own time. All of these men were \nthreatened with death and were forced out of their \nhomelands. Without resistance and objection, the face \nof the Earth will not be rid of injustice. \n I turn now to my final point. The world is in \ncontinuous change and evolution. Mankind\u2019s promised \ndestiny is the establishment of a pure humane life. This \nwill come about when justice prevails around the globe \nand when every single human being enjoys respect and \ndignity. That will be the moment when mankind\u2019s path \nto moral and spiritual perfection will be opened and his \njourney to God and the manifestation of God\u2019s divine \nnames will come to be. Mankind should strive to \nrepresent God\u2019s knowledge and wisdom, his \ncompassion and benevolence, his justice and fairness, \nhis power and art, and his kindness and forgiveness. \n These will all come true under the rule of the \nperfect Man, the last divine source on Earth, Hazrat \nMahdi, peace be upon him. He will be an offspring of \nthe Prophet of Islam, who will re-emerge, and Jesus \nChrist, peace be upon him. Other noble and pious men \nwill accompany him in the accomplishment of this \ngrand universal mission. This is the belief in entezar: \nwaiting patiently for the Imam to return; waiting \npatiently for the rule of goodness and the governance \nof the best, which he promises. This is a universal \nhuman notion and a source of the hope of nations for \nthe betterment of the world. \n They will come, and with the help of righteous \npeople and true believers will realize man\u2019s long-\nstanding desire for freedom, perfection, maturity, \nsecurity, tranquillity, peace and beauty. They will come \nto put an end to war and aggression and to reveal all \nknowledge to the world, as well as spirituality and \nfriendship. Yes indeed, mankind\u2019s bright future will \ncome. \n In waiting for that brilliant time to come and in a \ncollective commitment, let us each do our part to pave \nthe way and prepare the conditions for building that \nbright future. Long live love and spirituality. Long live \npeace and security. Long live justice and freedom."

        "file_text": "I would like to \ncongratulate the President on his unanimous election to \npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. We are confident that he will discharge the \nresponsibilities of that office with honour and dignity, \ngiven his track record and experience. I wish to assure \nhim of Namibia\u2019s support and cooperation to ensure \nthat his tenure in office is crowned with success. In the \nsame vein, I wish to commend His Excellency \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for the able manner \nin which he presided over the Assembly at its sixty-\nthird session. I equally wish to express our sincere \nappreciation to the Secretary-General, His Excellency \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless efforts in leading our \nOrganization to respond effectively to the large number \nof challenges and pressing issues facing humanity. \n We are meeting today at a very challenging time. \nThe impact of the world financial and economic crisis \non our countries and economies is very severe. This \ncrisis is a major concern that requires concerted efforts \nto search for effective methods of coping with it, in \norder to mitigate its impact and to achieve sustainable \ngrowth and development. This crisis is taking its toll \non every aspect of our development and social life. The \nprogress that we made in the fight against poverty, \nhunger and diseases, as well as in achieving the \ninternationally agreed development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), is \nthreatened. \n The financial crisis came in the middle of the \nfood and energy crisis. Skyrocketing prices of basic \nfoodstuffs, though said to have stabilized now, have \nleft many households unable to put food on the table. \nNet food importing countries like Namibia had to \ndivert resources from development to emergency relief, \nwhile importing high-priced food destabilized our \nbalance of payments and State revenues. \n The situation was also worsened by high fuel \nprices. Oil-importing developing countries like ours \nhave been negatively affected by ever-increasing oil \nprices, which have also led to price increases in other \nsectors, as suppliers of goods and services raise prices \nto make up for production and transportation costs.  \n The financial and economic crisis, coupled with \nthe food and energy crisis, has plunged the world into a \nglobal recession. The combination of these crises with \nclimate change and its adverse impact on sustainable \ndevelopment is cause for great concern. Namibia, like \nmany other developing countries, is an insignificant \ncontributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Yet our \ncountry is one of the most vulnerable to the effects of \nclimate change. I therefore call upon major emitters to \nnot only make drastic reductions in their greenhouse \ngas emissions, but also to use technology and financial \nresources to support the efforts of developing countries \nto adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. The \nGovernment of the Republic of Namibia fully supports \nthe efforts of the Secretary-General to mobilize \npolitical will to ensure a good and legally binding \nagreement on climate change in Copenhagen this \nDecember. \n Namibia is one of the countries with the highest \nsocio-economic inequality in the world because of its \ncolonial past. Nevertheless, the country has made \nprogress in the provision of health, education and other \ncritical services for the majority of the population, and \nwe are on course to meet a number of the MDGs. \n However, we face severe difficulties in \nresponding to the combination of the devastating \nHIV/AIDS pandemic, high levels of food insecurity \nand poverty. I once again call upon the international \ncommunity to increase support to our national \nprogrammes for sustainable economic and social \ndevelopment through measures such as market access \nand access to financial resources in the form of \nconcessional loans and foreign direct investment flows. \n The need for a strong and effective United \nNations cannot be overemphasized. The process for the \nreform of the Organization should be expedited in \norder to deliver on its promises in the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, respect for human \nrights, social and economic development and the \nprotection of the environment. \n There is an urgent need to reform the Security \nCouncil to make it more representative, democratic and \naccountable. Is it not an anomaly, and unjust, that \nAfrica remains the only region without permanent \nrepresentation on the Security Council? This does not \nreflect the continent\u2019s vital role in the maintenance of \nglobal peace and security. The need for Africa to be \nequitably represented on the Council, with all the \nprivileges associated with membership, remains our \npriority. In this regard, Namibia stands by the common \n \n \n5 09-52598 \n \nAfrican position on the reform of the United Nations as \narticulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \nDeclaration. \n Namibia welcomes the joint communiqu\u00e9 on \nstrengthening the capacity of the African Union (AU) \nin peacekeeping operations, as agreed to by the United \nNations Security Council and the African Union Peace \nand Security Council, as a step in the right direction. \nThere is a need for more structured and formalized \ncooperation between the two bodies on issues of peace \nand security in Africa. Such cooperation should also \ninclude the areas of financing, logistics, transfer of \ntechnology and training. Furthermore, there is a need \nfor the United Nations to support the AU position of \nprinciple on not recognizing Governments that come to \npower through military coups. Namibia calls upon the \nGeneral Assembly to urgently pass a resolution \nprohibiting the participation of such Governments in \nthe activities of all United Nations institutions. \n The right of all people to self-determination is a \nfundamental human right, which is enshrined in the \nUnited Nations Charter. It is deplorable that almost \n10 years into the twenty-first century colonialism is \nstill an issue with which this Organization has to deal. \n My delegation has raised its voice repeatedly in \nthis Assembly, calling for the realization of the \ninalienable rights of the people of Western Sahara to \nself-determination. The international community has an \nobligation to assist the people of Western Sahara in \ntheir quest for freedom and independence. Namibia \ntherefore calls for the immediate and unconditional \nimplementation of the United Nations Settlement Plan \nfor Western Sahara and of all resolutions of the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, with the \naim of holding a free and fair referendum in Western \nSahara. \n Similarly, Namibia is deeply concerned about the \ncontinuing suffering of the people of Palestine under \nIsraeli occupation. We wish to reaffirm our full and \nunequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the \npeople of Palestine to self-determination, including the \nreturn to their land. I wish to again call upon the \nparties to resume the peace process on the basis of all \nrelevant United Nations resolutions. \n My delegation wishes to reiterate its long-held \nposition on the unilateral economic, commercial and \nfinancial blockade imposed against Cuba. We believe \nthat the blockade constitutes a violation of international \nlaw and the rights of the people of Cuba. Its \nextraterritorial nature impedes free trade and economic \ndevelopment. Furthermore, it undermines the efforts of \nthe international community to attain the \ninternationally agreed development goals, as it affects \nthat country\u2019s economy adversely and subjects its \npeople to untold pain and suffering.  \n We urge the Government of the United States of \nAmerica to heed the call of the international \ncommunity and to implement the resolutions of the \nGeneral Assembly that call for an end to the blockade. \nNamibia wishes to reaffirm its solidarity with and \nsupport of Cuba\u2019s call for the immediate release of the \nfive Cuban nationals detained in the United States of \nAmerica. \n I would like to seize this opportunity to express \nour deep appreciation to the Governments and \ninternational organizations that responded in a timely \nmanner to our appeal for support and assistance \nfollowing the devastating floods that my country has \nexperienced during the past two years. That assistance \nhas greatly contributed to the alleviation of the \nsuffering of those in the affected areas. \n Finally, I wish to call upon all States Members of \nthe United Nations, in keeping with their \nresponsibilities and obligations under the United \nNations Charter, to fully address the challenges facing \nhumankind today in order to make the world a better \nplace for all and where we can all live together in \npeace, security and true justice."

        "file_text": "I begin by joining my \ncolleague Heads of State in congratulating Mr. Ali \nTreki on his well-deserved election as the President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I \nwould also like to take this opportunity to thank His \nExcellency Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for his \neffective stewardship of the sixty-third session and to \nsalute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless \nefforts to promote global peace, security and \ndevelopment. \n It is an internationally accepted fact that we are in \na period characterized by unprecedented crisis. Crises \nrelated to basic human needs such as food, water and \nenergy are contributing to great distress and hardship \nin every region of our world and precipitating an \nescalation in poverty, which we in the United Nations \nhad committed to halve at the beginning of this decade. \nThese crises have the potential to bring great social and \npolitical instability to many regions.  \n The sheer complexity of these matters and their \nconnectivity with human development make the task of \naddressing them very daunting. The progress made by \nthe international community in this respect must be \nnoted. However, we must all be mindful that whatever \nthe perceived impact or fallout experienced by the \neconomies of the world, the citizens of the small \nvulnerable States among us will be the worst hit, and \ntherefore they continue to warrant the special attention \nof this body. \n The United Nations Conference on the World \nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \nDevelopment, which convened last June in this Hall, \nbrought renewed international attention to the \nmagnitude of this crisis. The outcome document \n(resolution 63/303, annex) confirmed, and further \nemphasizes, that the crisis has had a particularly \nnegative effect on developing countries such as \nDominica.  \n The irony is that though severely affected by the \ncrisis, our countries had absolutely no relationship or \ncontribution to its cause. It also threatens the \nrealization of the Millennium Development goals. In \nthe Caribbean it is estimated that the impact of the \ncrisis has created the worst set of economic \ncircumstances since the era of independence of the \ncountries of the region, bringing with it depressed \ncommodity prices, a decline in agricultural export \nearnings, contraction of tourism revenues, retreating \nforeign direct investment, decreased access to external \nfinancing and declining remittances, among others. \n At the regional level the Governments of the \nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) are addressing the \nimpacts of the crisis through the establishment in July \nof a task force that will allow the member States, along \nwith the heads of our regional financial institutions, to \nfacilitate the mobilization of funds and present a core \nset of proposals for dealing with this crisis. Our Heads \nof Government have also agreed to the institution of a \nprogramme of collective enhancement of our financial \nservices sector through improved national regulatory \nand supervisory systems, and also through \nrationalization and consolidation to ensure safety, \nsoundness and stability in that sector.  \n We concur with the call for the strengthening of \ninstitutional arrangements for international cooperation \nin tax matters. Furthermore, we endorse the \nrecommendation of the Conference of the CARICOM \nHeads of State for consistent and non-discriminatory \nimplementation of transparency requirements and \ninternational standards for exchange of information. \n We believe that in order to adapt to the adverse \nimpact of the financial crisis it is crucial that small \nisland developing States and less developed countries \nreceive the following: one, speedy implementation of \nthe decisions of the Conference; two, assistance to \nfacilitate economic diversification while responding to \nthe crisis and the negative impact of climate change; \nthree, fiscal support in view of already high debt \nburdens; four, practical assistance from United Nations \nagencies through a compact framework; and five, \nstimulus funds to be made available by bilateral and \nmultilateral entities. \n  \n \n09-52463 24 \n \n With the onset of the financial crisis, there is now \na wrong perception that the food crisis is over. Food \ninsecurity continues unabated around the world, and it \nis estimated that more than a billion people go to bed \nhungry every night. This is both unacceptable and \nunsustainable. The creation of the United Nations \nsystem high-level Task Force on Global Food Security \nwas a timely and welcome initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the Director-General of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization. Increasing investments in \nagriculture in the developing nations is critical to \naddressing the food crisis. We therefore welcome the \nGroup of Eight pledge of $15 billion over the next \nthree years for enhancing food security, but we warn \nthat the desired objective may not be achieved if \nharmful subsidies in agriculture continue to prevail in \nthe developed countries. \n Completion of the Doha Development Agenda \nnegotiations at the World Trade Organization takes on \nrenewed importance as we seek solutions to the global \nfinancial crisis. An appropriate trade environment for a \nsustainable recovery for all is highly desirable. It is in \nthat spirit that we must renew our commitment to \nre-engage in the Doha negotiations with the declared \nobjective of concluding them in 2010.  \n The status quo has served only to further \nmarginalize small and vulnerable States and has led to \nthe almost total collapse of some of our major \nindustries, including sugar and bananas, which \nprovided the livelihoods of numerous farming families \nand communities. Our Governments continue the \nstruggle to develop their economies in the absence of \nthe much-needed foreign exchange that those industries \ngenerated. Increasing the competitiveness of \ndeveloping countries and their effective participation in \nworld trade underscores that Aid for Trade as a new \nand independent source of development financing must \nbe at the centre of the trade and development agenda. \n Climate change has emerged as one of the leading \nchallenges of our generation. If it is not arrested and \nsufficiently managed, its adverse impact has the \npotential to undermine human security and the social \nand economic stability of all nations. All around us we \nsee evidence of escalating climate change in the form \nof severe weather, floods, drought, devastating \nhurricanes and cyclones and rising sea levels.  \n Small island developing States are most \nvulnerable to the negative impact of climate change. As \na consequence, we find our countries in the front line \nof this monumental challenge to humanity. In \nDominica and several of the sister islands of the \nCaribbean, situated as we are in the hurricane belt, \nthere have been and will continue to be an almost \nannual cycle of considerable damage to houses, roads, \ncoastlines and other infrastructure. For many of our \ncountries there is a constant struggle to achieve \neconomic development and a higher quality of life for \nour people, only to find ourselves experiencing these \nheavy losses and having routinely to start all over \nagain.  \n As global preparations for the critical \nCopenhagen conference continue, the urgency to act to \naddress climate change has increased. What has long \nbeen pointed out by the scientists has now been \nconfirmed by those whose unsustainable production \nhas precipitated an Earth crisis, which must be \naddressed if our planet is to survive. The General \nAssembly, in its resolution 63/281 of 3 June this year, \nrecognized the security implications of climate change \nas an additional dimension of the crisis. That is clearly \nevident for many small island States whose viability \nand very existence are threatened by conditions such as \nthe rising sea levels. \n Dominica is at the forefront of nature \nconservation. Upon attaining political independence in \n1978, our country was aptly dubbed the \u201cNature Island \nof the Caribbean\u201d in view of our unwavering \ncommitment to the management and conservation of \nour abundant biodiversity, extensive national parks \nsystem, rich forest resources, mountain ranges, fresh \nwater resources and a pure marine environment. At the \nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development held in \nJohannesburg in September 2002, the then Prime \nMinister of Dominica, the Honourable Pierre Charles, \nproclaimed our country as the \u201cNature Island of the \nWorld\u201d. Today in the presence of the world gathering \nin this body, I announce Dominica\u2019s intention to make \nour country a model for sustainable development. A \ncordial invitation is extended to the international \ncommunity to contribute to this noble venture. \n Dominica continues to work closely within the \nframework of small island States to continue to bring \nour perspective, as climate change front-line States, to \nthe negotiating table. We are contributing to a solution \nto the effects of climate change by pursuing measures \nat the national level to promote energy efficiency, \nreduce the consumption of fossil fuels and develop our \n \n \n25 09-52463 \n \ngeothermal potential for national energy needs, as well \nas for the possible export of clean energy to our \nneighbours, in the first instance to the French overseas \nDepartments of Guadeloupe and Martinique.  \n Dominica is already generating 40 per cent of its \nelectricity by hydropower. We are at an advanced stage \nof geothermal energy development, which by 2015 \nshould enable us to reach the target of 100 per cent \nelectricity generation by renewable energy. We express \nour gratitude to France and the European Union for \ntheir commendable cooperation towards the shift to \nrenewable energy. \n Dominica is therefore encouraged by the many \nexpressions of support for a successful outcome of the \nCopenhagen meeting made by world leaders at the \nhigh-level Summit on Climate Change held a few days \nago in this Hall. There is an urgent need for a greater \ndemonstration of political will in this regard. I \ntherefore urge every Head of State or Government to \nseize the moment to reach an agreement that will \nprotect the inhabitants of this planet from one of the \nmost serious challenges ever to confront humanity. \n Dominica remains concerned about the current \neconomic situation in our sister island of Haiti. We \nrecognize the important role of the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in \nensuring the stability of that country. We commend all \ntroop-contributing States for their engagement in Haiti, \nand we appreciate the support of the Security Council \nin extending the mandate of the Mission. Haiti needs \nconsiderable development assistance in order to \nconsolidate the stability that MINUSTAH\u2019s presence \nhas fostered and to ensure the success of the \npeacebuilding process. In this regard, we endorse and \napplaud the decision of the Secretary-General to \nappoint former United States President Clinton as \nSpecial Envoy for Haiti. We hope that this appointment \nwill advance the cause of rebuilding that country. \nDominica, through its actions and also through \nCARICOM, will continue to do all in its power to \nadvance the quality of life of the Haitian people. \n Central to my country\u2019s development thrust is a \nparticular focus on the advancement of our indigenous \npeople. Consistent with this priority of the United \nNations, we support the continued and expanded \nefforts of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in \nthe implementation of the measures contained in its \nrecommendations. In this connection, we welcome the \nrecommendations of the eighth session of the \nPermanent Forum on indigenous women, the economic \ndevelopment and human rights of indigenous peoples, \nand specific actions in relation to the Arctic region. \nDominica has undertaken and continues to undertake \nimportant initiatives to improve the social development \nof our indigenous people. \n We come together every year in the general \ndebate in a true spirit of common resolve and \npartnership. This common resolve and partnership must \nassume greater meaning this year because the tasks \nbefore the international community are enormous and \nnecessitate collective action. However challenging may \nbe the efforts towards their solution, it seems evident \nthat only genuine global cooperation and concerted \nmultilateral action have the possibility of yielding \nfavourable results. But committed multilateral action in \nthe face of these crises has so far proved to be elusive. \nA greater demonstration of political will should ensure \nmultilateral action in confronting these crises, as it is \nan absolute necessity for the survival of this planet. \n I take this opportunity to recognize all the \ncountries and organizations that have assisted \nDominica and the more vulnerable States in our \ndevelopment thrust. Particular reference must be made \nto those developing countries which, while dealing \nwith their own domestic challenges, have extended a \ntrue fraternal hand of friendship. To all, we express our \nmost sincere gratitude. We also reiterate the call of this \nGeneral Assembly for an end of the United States \nembargo against the Republic of Cuba and look \nforward to an early date for its removal. \n Finally, as we chart a most progressive \ndevelopment course for our future, we should ensure \nthat it includes the full implementation of the \nrecommendations emanating from the Conference on \nthe World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its \nImpact on Development. We should also make every \neffort to leave Copenhagen with a framework for a firm \ncommitment and a sound climate agreement that will \nprotect the inhabitants of this planet, particularly the \nmost vulnerable, from one of the most serious \nchallenges ever to confront humanity."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nNigerian delegation, I wish to congratulate His \nExcellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election as \nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfourth session. I have no doubt that the Assembly will \nbenefit from his wealth of experience and wisdom. Let \nme therefore affirm the full support and solidarity of \nmy country. Similarly, I wish to commend the \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-third session, His \nExcellency Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for the \nable and effective manner with which he conducted the \naffairs of that session. \n Last year when we gathered here, we were \nhopeful that the world would soon put behind it the \ndevastating impact of the various global crises in the \nenergy, agriculture and financial sectors. However, in \nspite of the efforts by the international community, the \ndeveloping world is yet to experience any serious \nrelief. There is no doubt that more than ever before the \ninternational community needs to fulfil its \ncommitments to the developing world if more than half \nof humanity is to avoid an imminent calamity.  \n In this connection we welcome and applaud the \nefforts of the United Nations, in particular the outcome \nof the United Nations Conference on the World \nFinancial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on \nDevelopment held in New York last June . We call for \nthe support and implementation of the recommendations \nof the conference and hope they will receive the \nunconditional support of the developed nations. \n Equally important is the need for global efforts to \nboost food security. We need to increase food \nproduction, whether for domestic consumption or for \nexport, which requires collaboration among investors, \norganizations and Governments. It is relevant here to \nreiterate our call for the removal of the enormous \nagricultural subsidies that developed countries continue \nto give their farmers, a practice that defies the logic of \na free market economy and remains unfair to millions \nof poor peasant farmers across the world. \n As we approach the countdown to 2015, a \nconvergence of many factors, including the global \neconomic crisis, is threatening not only the \nachievement of the targets for the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), but also the substantial \ngains already made. Unless we act fast, our dream of \nlifting the vast majority of humanity out of extreme \npoverty, hunger and disease will remain an illusion. \nDonors and recipient countries alike should make more \neffort to fulfil their commitments under the \nprogramme. For our part, we are determined to do all \nwe can in order to attain the MDG targets, and we are \ncalling on the international community to continue to \nprovide support. \n The African Summit on Roll Back Malaria, which \nwas held in Abuja in 2000, adopted the Abuja \nDeclaration and the Plan of Action to reduce malaria \nby 50 per cent in Africa by 2010. To achieve this goal, \nAfrican countries affected by malaria were expected to \ndevote 15 per cent of their public expenditures to the \nhealth sector. \n Although considerable efforts have been made by \nthe affected countries, as well as by donor agencies, the \ngoal of Roll Back Malaria has not been realized. \nMalaria remains by far the biggest killer disease for \n  \n \n09-52604 42 \n \nchildren under 5-years old in Africa. This should weigh \nheavy on the global conscience. \n Africa is committed to the goal of eliminating \nmalaria, and to this end, Nigeria intends to host the \nAbuja-Plus Ten Summit on Roll Back Malaria in 2011. \nWe would therefore appreciate the support of the \nSecretary-General, not only to make the proposed \nsummit possible, but also to facilitate the realization of \nits objective. \n The quality of participation at the just concluded \n2009 Summit on Climate Change was a testimony to \nthe global realization that climate change has truly \nbecome seen as a genuine existential threat to \nhumanity. I commend the Secretary-General for his \nconsistent engagement with this most important issue \nof our time, and call on all Member States to rededicate \nthemselves to reversing the worst effects of this \nphenomenon. \n For us in Africa, as the continent where, \nunfortunately, 15 of the world\u2019s 20 countries most \nvulnerable to the impact of climate change are situated, \nwe hope that the outcome of the fifteenth Conference \nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change coming up in \nCopenhagen later this year will be an acceptable \nresponse to this global threat. \n Even in the middle of this tale of global economic \nand financial woes, there is a silver lining. We are \ngratified and greatly encouraged by the increasing \nrapprochement between the United States and Russia \non nuclear disarmament. The idea of a nuclear-free \nworld, the architecture of which is now being put \ntogether, has great appeal for many of us. \n Such an outcome, probably achievable in our \nlifetime, would not only result in a safer and better \nworld, but would free resources for use in sectors that \nwould benefit humanity. Nigeria encourages all nuclear \nPowers to identify with this great initiative, this dream, \nand to embrace any and all initiatives that promote the \nachievement of the goal of a world free of nuclear \narmaments and the apocalyptic nightmare. \n It is in this connection that Nigeria applauds the \nconclusion and bringing into force of the Pelindaba \nTreaty, the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, \nwhich bans the testing, manufacturing, stockpiling, \nacquisition and possession of nuclear weapons in \nAfrica. This is a commendable testimony to Africa\u2019s \ntotal rejection of the proliferation, and indeed the \nexistence, of nuclear weapons. We call on all other \nregions to follow suit. The Review Conference of the \nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons coming up next year provides an \nopportunity that should not be missed. \n While we applaud this development, let us not \nforget that there are weapons still being produced that \nhave killed far more people than nuclear arms in the \ntragic history of humanity. I speak, in particular, about \nthe production of small arms and light weapons and \ntheir illicit export to regions like my own, Nigeria and \nWest Africa, where these small arms and light weapons \nhave become the real weapons of mass destruction \u2014 \ndestroying many lives of innocent children, men and \nwomen, destroying property, economies and dreams \u2014 \nas well as the undermining of national and regional \nefforts at development. \n We are all aware of the close link between such \nweapons and organized crime, drug trafficking and, in \nthe case of Nigeria, piracy and oil smuggling in the \nNiger Delta. The proliferation of such weapons in West \nAfrica is fast turning the region into a major transit \npoint for illicit drugs, thus also facilitating the growth \nof criminal syndicates, some with enough firepower to \nchallenge a nation\u2019s military forces. This cannot be just \na West African problem. It should be seen as a global \nthreat. \n This is why we continue to call on the \ninternational community to demonstrate greater \ncommitment to keeping this threat in check by \nimplementing existing initiatives, as well as developing \nnew and legally binding ones, where necessary, geared \ntowards achieving the goal of preventing, combating \nand eradicating illicit trade in small arms, and \nregulating the transfer of conventional weapons in \ngeneral. The full implementation of the United Nations \nProgramme on Small Arms would be a very good \nbeginning. \n Although over the past decade, West Africa has \nmade considerable progress by way of building or \nstrengthening democratic structures in our various \ncountries, the job is far from done, and this is not the \ntime to rest on our laurels. Peace and security \nchallenges remain daunting in some parts of the \nsubregion. As current Chairperson of the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), the \nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, \n \n \n43 09-52604 \n \nMr. Alhaji Umaru Yar\u2019Adua sent a special envoy, in \nfact a former Head of State, the former President of \nNigeria, to President Mamadou Tandja of the Republic \nof Niger with a view to establishing a line of \ncommunication with him in favour of a peaceful \nresolution of the political problems of our esteemed \nneighbour to the north. A delegation of ECOWAS \nForeign Ministers undertook a similar visit with the \nsame objective. Our role is largely mediatory, but we \nare waiting with cautious optimism for the democratic \nimperative in the Republic of the Niger to be upheld. \n The situation in Guinea-Bissau is somewhat more \ncheerful. Guinea-Bissau held successful elections last \nJuly and, as members may already be aware, President \nMalam Bacai Sanh\u00e1 was sworn in on 8 September. \nBecause of the strong commitment on the part of all \nstakeholders in Guinea-Bissau, this peaceful transition \nto democratic, constitutional rule has taken place. We \nare indeed very proud of what the Government and the \npeople of Guinea-Bissau have been able to achieve. \nGuinea-Bissau can now look forward with hope to a \npeaceful and bright future, and Nigeria will continue to \nstand side by side with that country as it charts its \ndestiny for the future. \n In Guinea-Conakry, where elections have again \nbeen slated for next January, we continue to impress on \nthe authorities the need for the country to return to \ndemocratic rule through manifestly transparent, free \nand fair elections. We hope that these efforts will yield \ndividends in the form of an elected civilian government \nearly next year. Our own experience and history in \nNigeria leave us with no other choice than to remain \nunwaveringly and unambiguously on the side of the \nconsolidation and maturation of constitutional \ndemocracy and to strongly repudiate even the slightest \nprospect of democratic reversal in the subregion. It is \nour national interest to do so.  \n ECOWAS has proven over and over again its \nwillingness and capacity to come to the aid of its \nmembers in their hour of need. In that spirit, we will \ncontinue to make our best efforts to ensure that peace \nand stability reign in the region and to facilitate the \nrealization of the objectives implied in the \nCommunity\u2019s name. We continue, as usual, to count on \nthe support of the United Nations system. \n Nigeria continues to make great strides in our \nefforts to build a peaceful, stable and prosperous \nnation, able to provide the best possible life for its \ncitizens and able to fulfil its international commitments \nand obligations. We have made great progress in laying \na solid foundation for democracy, and we are seeking \nto build on this foundation to grow an economy that \nwill see Nigeria take its rightful place among the \nworld\u2019s economic powerhouses. However, there are \nchallenges. Some we can deal with by ourselves. \nOthers require the help, support and cooperation of our \nfriends and allies and of the United Nations family. \n Those who have been watching events in our \ncountry in the past few months will testify to the \nprogress we have made in the Niger Delta in finding \ndurable solutions to the political, social and \nenvironmental problems of one of the most \nstrategically important regions of our country. Today, \nrelative peace has returned to the Niger Delta, largely \non the back of an amnesty deal which the Government \nand erstwhile militants forged and are implementing \ntogether. The return of peace to the region would \nprovide the platform for meeting the aspirations of the \npeople, as well as allowing the resumption of full \neconomic activity there. \n Nigeria is a signatory to the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and to the majority of \nother international and regional human rights \ninstruments, and we continue to remain focused and \ncommitted on the issue of human rights.  \n In our endeavour to overcome the constraints \nbrought about by the present gap between our nation\u2019s \nincreasing demand for power to drive its development \nand the available supply, we join others in pursuit of \nreliable, cheap and environmentally friendly alternative \nsources of energy. In this regard, we are gratified by \nthe support and assistance that we, as a non-nuclear \nState, continue to receive from the International \nAtomic Energy Agency in exploring alternative sources \nof electricity generation, as well as in the areas of \nradiation control, waste management and training. We \nwill continue to collaborate closely with the Agency, as \nwell as to rely on the assistance of our allies and \nfriends. \n Nigeria welcomes the ongoing reform and \ndemocratization of the United Nations system and \nnotes the progress made in the intergovernmental \nnegotiation process. We encourage all parties to \ncontinue the negotiations with renewed vigour with a \nview to achieving the desired objectives. Of particular \nimportance to Nigeria is the enlargement and \n  \n \n09-52604 44 \n \ndemocratization of the Security Council. It is \nunacceptable that Africa, with 53 countries, is not \nrepresented in the permanent seat category of the \nCouncil. We call upon Member States to demonstrate \nthe necessary political will to bring about the long-\nawaited reform, in order to make the Security Council \nmore legitimate, more democratic and more transparent \nand inclusive. \n Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the United Nations and \nthe international system has been demonstrated over \nthe years. This commitment accords with the \nprovisions of our Constitution, which enjoins us, inter \nalia, to promote international cooperation for the \nconsolidation of universal peace and to promote \nrespect for international law and treaty obligations. Our \ninternational behaviour has always been guided by \nthose noble foreign policy objectives. \n Nigeria has been the fourth-largest contributor in \nthe world to peacekeeping operations, and the role we \nhave played \u2014 and will continue to play \u2014 in \npeacekeeping in the subregion, the African continent \nand, with the United Nations, around the world is a \nclear testimony to our unflinching commitment to \njoining hands with others, especially the United \nNations, in laying solid foundations upon which human \nprosperity can be built. This is why we welcome the \nnew strategy by the United Nations to strengthen the \npartnership between troop-contributing countries and \nthe United Nations, especially in the provision of \nadequate resources and the capacity to strengthen \nregional peacekeeping initiatives. \n Finally, as usual, Nigeria will continue to draw on \nits vast experience and commitment in its efforts to \ncontribute to the realization of the objectives and \nvalues of the United Nations. We assure all our allies \nand friends that Nigeria will continue to be a \nresponsible global member of the United Nations, \nsubscribing to all the norms, conventions and values of \nthis human family and providing leadership, especially \non issues concerning West Africa and indeed the rest of \nthe world."

        "file_text": "We are \nmeeting once again, but this time at a moment when \nhumankind is facing many problems, each as difficult \nas the others, as if they had been planned to coincide: \nthe agriculture crisis, the financial and economic crisis, \nenvironmental peril and tenacious, deadly diseases. Be \nthat as it may, we are destined to prevail. There is \nsimply no other option. We must and we can succeed. \nThe numerous deliberations about these problems at all \nlevels illustrate our increasing awareness of the \ndangers to us and succeeding generations. \n Believing fundamentally as I do in the genius of \nhumankind and its capacity for imagination and \ncreativity in extricating itself from the most difficult \nsituations, I am both optimistic and aware of the price \nthat will have to be paid. This is what we are called on \nto do here and elsewhere. The only question is how to \ncoordinate the numerous elements required to expedite \nthe rescue mission. \n Before going any further, however, I should like \nwarmly to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, who \nhas been charged with guiding the work of this sixty-\nfourth session of the General Assembly. I have known \nMr. Treki for a long time, and Senegal is delighted by \nhis election and expresses its confidence in his human \nand professional qualities, which will bolster the \nsuccess of his mission.  \n I also pay tribute to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session, for his contributions to the effort to \nrevitalize the Assembly. His commitment and \ndynamism are well known. I have admired his \nintelligence, his lively wit and the sensitivity he shows \nin his relations with others. To Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, Senegal reiterates its support for his delicate \ntask in the face of the many and urgent issues facing \nthe Organization. \n This sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly \nhas begun at a time of multifaceted turmoil. The \neconomic and financial crisis, the scale of which has \nsurprised many observers, reveals above all the \ndeadlock in contemporary economic theory. In \nhighlighting the inadequacy of our analytical and \npredictive abilities, it calls for a broader sense of \nshared responsibility both for the management of its \nimmediate effects and for the search for long-term \nresponses. In seeking solutions, let us be careful not to \nmake the mistake of falling back on received wisdom \nand ready-made answers. Be it in the sphere of the \nenvironment, political and economic governance or \ndevelopment, the world must find a new way of \nthinking and acting, and thereby address the need to \nchange our outlook. \n Having myself argued, often strongly, for the full \nparticipation of Africa in the conversation on world \ngovernance, I welcome the progressively expanded \ncooperative framework of the Group of Eight (G-8) \nand the Group of 20 (G-20). I only regret that my \nproposal to establish a shadow G-20, made up of the \n \n \n41 09-52425 \n \nworld\u2019s greatest experts but open to all those who bring \nnew ideas, has not yet been put into practice. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n Clearly, the world\u2019s heads of State, elected on the \nbasis of political criteria, cannot miraculously \ntransform themselves into universal polymaths. They \nmust hold to their political and even strategic role, and \nrely on the superior knowledge of experts. It is through \ndialogue open to all that we will be able to grasp the \ndiversity of our respective situations and apply real-\nworld answers to real-world problems. It is therefore \nfitting that the theme of this sixty-fourth session should \nbe \u201cEffective responses to global crises: strengthening \nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for \ninternational peace, security and development\u201d. \n The current challenges, both complex and global \nin nature, call strongly for innovative and concerted \nsolutions if we are to succeed. That is especially true \nfor problems of agriculture and food security. If we are \nto achieve on schedule Millennium Development Goal 1, \nto halve by 2015 the number of people suffering from \nhunger, we must put into practice a different approach \nto international cooperation, one based on support for \nagriculture instead of food assistance, which should be \nused only as an emergency response to exceptional \ncircumstances.  \n The development of agriculture to promote \nsustainable food security in Africa necessarily involves \nwater management, the availability of equipment, \nproducers\u2019 access to inputs and a sound organization of \nchains of production, storage, processing and sales of \nagricultural products. That is why Senegal hopes that \nthese essential questions \u2014 and others, such as the \nregulation of agricultural markets and scientific \nresearch to increase productivity \u2014 will take a \nprominent place on the agenda of the Summit of the \nWorld\u2019s Regions on Food Security, to be held in \nJanuary 2010 in Dakar, and of the Global Partnership \nfor Agriculture and Food Security proposed by the G-8. \n Once the right conditions are in place, there is no \nreason why Africa should not be able to ensure its own \nfood security. Better yet, its enormous land and water \nresources predispose the continent to become the \nworld\u2019s breadbasket. To that end, however, we must \navoid the vicious trap of ceding land to foreigners \nbearing millions of dollars. The G-8 quite rightly \nexpressed its concern on this subject at its most recent \nsummit in Italy. According to recent estimates, between \n15 and 20 million hectares have changed hands over \nthe past three years, primarily in Africa. We Africans \nshould make it our vocation to become farmers tilling \nour own land rather than being agricultural labourers \nworking for capital-rich foreign planters. \n For its part, Senegal, as I have often said, cannot \naccept such a course, which would without doubt \nempty our countryside of newly impoverished millions, \nwho would swell our slums and the ranks of those ripe \nfor illegal emigration. On the other hand, if we exploit \nour mutually complementary circumstances, we of the \nNorth and the South can promote a win-win \npartnership in which investors and local communities \njoin to develop African land without dispossession. \nSenegal has succeeded, in record time, in responding \npositively to the food crisis. For the second year in a \nrow, our home-grown agricultural campaign for food \nand abundance, known as GOANA, has rewarded us \nwith excellent results. \n We intend to strengthen this food self-sufficiency \noption with the unionization of rural producers, on the \nmodel of Qu\u00e9bec. To this end, we are currently setting \nup a green bank for farmers, fishers and livestock \nfarmers, which will support financing of these sectors. \nThis is a bold innovation, a green revolution that we \nwant very much to see succeed. \n At the global level, I believe that, beyond its \nadverse impacts, the current crisis has a silver lining \ninsofar as it stimulates creativity, initiative and a \nfighting spirit. If the Secretary-General had not \nlaunched his emotional appeal at World Food Day in \nRome two years ago, I might not have felt a challenge \nso great as to demand the invention of GOANA. And \nbecause the fate of our people is at stake, it is our \nprimary responsibility to establish on our own the \nconditions necessary for a brighter future. \n Internal efforts will continue to be futile without \na healthy global environment rid of the speculative \npractices of the virtual economy and unjust asymmetric \nprogrammes, such as subsidies and other inequitable \npractices. In this context, non-oil-producing African \ncountries continue to feel the full brunt of the increase \nin oil prices resulting from speculative practices that \nwe cannot mitigate because they are controlled by the \noil oligarchy. Economies such as ours, which had \nhitherto posted average growth rates of 5 per cent, have \nbeen brutally weakened by imported inflation. \n  \n \n09-52425 42 \n \n For that reason, Senegal supports and encourages \nthe dialogue between producers and consumers \ninitiated by the International Energy Forum to improve \ntransparency in the oil market and take effective \nmeasures against speculative practices that devastate \nthe economies of importing States. \n In implementing the \u201cWade formula\u201d, I proposed \na fund to fight poverty funded by voluntary \ncontributions from African oil-producing States and oil \ncompanies working in Africa, based on the principle of \nshared social responsibility. The fund could be \nmanaged collectively or entrusted to the World Bank. \nSimilarly, I welcome the extension of the Exogenous \nShocks Facility to countries benefiting from the Policy \nSupport Instrument. \n The summit meeting on climate change \nconfirmed a broadly shared conclusion. If we do not \nchange our methods of production and consumption, \nthe future of mankind itself will be in peril. We must \nadmit that we have not taken sufficient action to \nreverse these negative trends. Nature subjects us daily \nto the adverse consequences of our own attacks against \nit in different ways, including floods, droughts, \ndesertification and coastal erosion. These upheavals \nforeshadow even more devastating phenomena. \nInternational consensus is therefore urgently needed to \nsave the planet. In order to survive, each of us must \nstrive to behave more respectfully towards the \nenvironment and to create a world with fewer \ngreenhouse gas emissions. According to the hopeful \nstatement of the Secretary-General, we now find \nourselves on the threshold of a new era \u2014 that of the \ngreen economy. Let us have the courage to cross the \nthreshold for ourselves and for succeeding generations. \n Africa for its part wishes to assume its share of \nresponsibility in this necessary environmental rebirth. \nThat is the essence of the Great Green Wall project that \nruns from Dakar to Djibouti. Shared by all countries it \nruns through, the Great Green Wall is 7,000 kilometres \nlong and 15 kilometres wide, and Senegal has the \nresponsibility of coordinating it on behalf of the \nAfrican Union.  \n With the assistance of experts from all over the \nworld, we have selected plants adapted to the fairly \narid conditions prevailing in the Sahelian-Saharan \nzone. At the same time, we have decided to build \nwater-collection basins along the entire length of the \nGreat Green Wall, based on the model that we have \nimplemented in Senegal with some 250 basins. Every \nAfrican State involved in the construction of the Great \nGreen Wall organizes its implementation at the local \nlevel through a national agency. At the continental \nlevel, national agencies are coordinated by a pan-\nAfrican Great Green Wall agency under the auspices of \nthe African Union. \n I cherish the hope that the United Nations will \nbecome involved in this project, which contributes to \nprotecting the global environment, by mobilizing what \nmight be called anti-desert soldiers along the lines of \npeacekeeping troops. Here, I pay tribute to the \nparticipation of Ivorian boys and girls who, although \nnot directly impacted by desertification \u2014 C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire being a country of forests \u2014 spontaneously \nparticipated in building the Senegalese section of the \nGreat Green Wall in Senegal. They worked voluntarily, \nside by side with their comrades from Senegal. These \nyoung people, transcending the artificial borders \ncreated by colonization, are using self-determination to \ntake ownership of the struggle for Africa\u2019s future. This \nexperience could serve as a prelude to the creation of a \nbroad movement of \u201cyouth without borders\u201d that unites \nyoung Africans from throughout the continent. They \ncould be the heralds of various causes, such as the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS, early marriage and female \ncircumcision, as they in Senegal. \n While we await foreign assistance, Senegal has \nalready built nearly 527 kilometres of the Great Green \nWall. The project is also under way in Mali, and Chad \nwill follow in the near future. \n Through the progressive restoration of the \nSaharan ecosystem, the Great Green Wall will \ncontribute through greenhouse gas sequestration to the \nglobal fight against global warming. I thank the \nEuropean Union for its pledged support, and I welcome \nin particular President Sarkozy\u2019s initiative to deploy to \nthis front \u2014 the only worthy front \u2014 soldiers to plant \ntrees and build water-collection basins. I cherish the \nhope that this initiative will serve to inspire other \nStates with the necessary human and material resources \nto support the Great Green Wall. \n Given the severity of the situation, the \nenvironmental threat, in my opinion, should be \nconsidered a threat to international peace and security. \nIf it were, we might consider allocating new \ninternational missions to national armies. In the \nmanner of peacekeeping operations, Senegal proposes \n \n \n43 09-52425 \n \nthe creation of a mechanism to save and restore the \nenvironment based on the voluntary commitment of \narmies through modalities to be determined. \n In the framework of civilian and military \nactivities, countries wishing to do so could mobilize \ncontingents for specific periods to assist in \nimplementing major environmental projects, such as \nthe Great Green Wall, or what is referred to in Senegal \nas the Atlantic wall against coastal erosion. \n In Senegal, we are currently creating along our \ncoastline a concrete wall 3 to 4 metres deep and \n40 centimetres wide built on an impermeable \nfoundation to stop the maritime erosion that threatens \nmany African countries. Its effectiveness is guaranteed. \nThe only problem is the cost \u2014 $1.5 million per \nkilometre. From Casablanca to Cotonou, representing \nsome 5,000 kilometres of vulnerable coastline, the \noverall cost would be $7.5 billion. Compared to \nexpenditures often seen at the global level, it certainly \nis not much. Moreover, if mankind were to stop \nbuilding lethal weapons for only three months and \nallocate the money thus saved to building the Atlantic \nwall, the threat to that part of Africa would be \npermanently removed.  \n For 16 years now, Security Council reform has \nbeen an important item on our agenda. It is a paradox \nthat an Organization, universal in its mission, should \nremain deadlocked 64 years after its creation by the \nelitist nature of its principal body. The leader \nAl-Qadhafi summarized our position on that issue (see \n). As Africa is the only continent not \nrepresented among the permanent members, despite the \nfact that it\u2019s the focus of 70 per cent of the Council\u2019s \nwork, that historic injustice must be corrected by \ngranting the continent here and now, outside the \ncontext of overall reform, one seat with the right of \nveto that could be held by the Chairman-in-Office of \nthe African Union. Let us ensure that this session is the \none at which we finally solve the issue of Security \nCouncil reform so that we can focus our efforts on \nother important issues.  \n Those important issues still unfortunately include \nthe tragic situation in the Middle East. While it \nrecognizes the Israeli people\u2019s right to live in peace \nwithin secure and internationally recognized borders, \nSenegal resolutely supports the just and legitimate \nclaim of the Palestinian people to a viable, free and \nindependent State. That claim is morally consonant \nwith the right of peoples to self-determination.  \n However, in general, Senegal rejects violence in \nall its forms, whatever its origin. Israel\u2019s pursuit of \nillegal activities on Palestinian territory is \ncounterproductive. The settlement, expropriation and \nlockdown of the territories are a serious obstacle to the \nnegotiations process and delay the prospects of an era \nof peace for all peoples of the subregion. Senegal \nsupports the vision of two States, Israeli and \nPalestinian, as recalled here yesterday by President \nBarack Obama (see ). \n Turning to the situation in Africa, Senegal \nwelcomes the considerable progress made in the \npeaceful settlement of disputes and in the integration \nprocess towards establishing the United States of \nAfrica. The accomplishment of African unity is the \nonly viable answer to the challenges of globalization, \nthe creation of large groupings and the redefinition of \nthe rules of governance. It is also an essential condition \nfor the establishment of lasting peace and stability on \nthe continent. \n Senegal continues to contribute to the settlement \nof disputes in Africa on the basis of that ideal of peace. \nI therefore welcome the normalization of the situation \nin our sister Republic of Mauritania following the \nDakar Accord of June 2009. We should remember that \nthe Accord was concluded with the support of the \nInternational Contact Group throughout the negotiation \nprocess. I reiterate my congratulations and my \nappreciation to all. \n In the sister Republic of Guinea-Bissau, I \nwelcome the gradual return to stability after the \npresidential elections, recognized and acknowledged \nby all as free and transparent. As a neighbour, Senegal \nreiterates its call for the convening of a donor \nconference in support of the courageous stabilization \nand development efforts of the people of Guinea-\nBissau, through their new authorities. \n On the other hand, the situation in the Republic \nof Guinea seems to me of greater concern. That \ncountry merits our full attention because it could fall \ninto violence at any time. Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, \nPresident of Liberia, and I, in our capacity as goodwill \nneighbours, were in Conakry only two weeks ago. I \nreported back to the African Union, stressing the need \nfor an ongoing presence in the field and for a dialogue \nwith all stakeholders, including the army. In my view, \n  \n \n09-52425 44 \n \nthat is the only way to help restore the constitutional \norder in Guinea. \n The ideal of peace, the primary raison d\u2019\u00eatre of \nour Organization, remains seriously threatened by \nextremism of all stripes, fuelled and perpetuated by \nignorance, mistrust and the manipulation of religion. \nThe need for dialogue between cultures and \ncivilizations is all the more urgent on that account. The \nchallenge today, in particular for the three revealed \nreligions that share the same God, is to build on that \ncommon monotheistic pedestal a bridge of brotherhood \nthat brings us closer and teaches us to live together \nagain by sharing our common values and with respect \nfor our differences. \n As Chairman-in-Office of the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference, I reiterate once again the \ndedication of the Islamic ummah to dialogue for the \nmutual understanding and peaceful coexistence of \npeoples because Islam, in letter and spirit, is a religion \nof the happy medium and of peace that teaches, in all \nthings, knowledge, moderation, reasonableness and \nrespect for the freedom of worship. \n Let us all agree to strive to learn to better \nunderstand each other, overcome mistrust and fight the \nobscurantist ideas that give rise to tensions and \nconfrontation. A world living in peace in the twenty-\nfirst century will be one in which all peoples enjoy an \nequally dignified existence. \n In that spirit, Senegal will host the Third World \nFestival of Negro Arts from 1 to 15 December 2010. \nThat artistic and intellectual event, with Brazil as guest \nof honour, will provide the opportunity for Africa and \nits diaspora to celebrate the values of culture and \ncivilization of the black world. For us, that is a way to \nfight the prejudices that still haunt some malicious \nminds and fuel the re-emergence of revisionist ideas. \n Africa is ready to meet the challenges of the \ntwenty-first century in a spirit of openness and \ndialogue with all peoples for a world of peace and \nhuman brotherhood."

        "file_text": "I join other speakers in \ncongratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on assuming \nthe presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. We are confident that his extensive diplomatic \nexperience will guide his leadership. He can be assured \nof the support and cooperation of Jamaica during his \ntenure.  \n I also extend Jamaica\u2019s appreciation to Father \nMiguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for his energetic and \nvisible leadership during the sixty-third session of the \nAssembly, and our gratitude to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his expert leadership of the Organization. \n We meet at a critical juncture, as the world \nconfronts multiple crises: the global financial and \neconomic crisis and the food, energy and climate \ncrises, joined by the H1N1 pandemic. Both developed \nand developing countries are affected by these crises. It \nis the poorest and most vulnerable, however, that are \ndisproportionately affected and are least capable of \nresponding. Even as major economies are reporting \ntheir emergence from the global recession, the outlook \nfor most developing countries remains bleak. For many \ndeveloping countries, there are no early signs of so-\ncalled green shoots of economic recovery. For the \nmajority, the impact of the recession will be deep; it \nwill be prolonged; and it will be painful. The irony is \nthat developing countries are hapless victims of a crisis \nfor which they are inculpable. \n The synchronized nature of the downturn in the \nworld economy means that its repercussions are \nevident in virtually every sphere. Inflows of financing \nand investment have plunged precipitously; exports are \nweak, and commodity prices are low; official \ndevelopment assistance has diminished drastically.  \n  \n \n09-52592 18 \n \n Those consequences are reflected in Jamaica and \nthroughout the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \nregion. Countries like ours now face the daunting \nchallenge of protecting the most vulnerable of their \ncitizens in a responsible and sustainable manner in the \ncontext of declining export demand, contraction in \nservices, including tourism, and lower remittances. As \nwith most developing countries, the fiscal and financial \nstress has forced us to make significant adjustments to \nour expenditure programmes. \n The distressing reality is that we in the \ndeveloping world have limited scope and capacity to \nmitigate the impact of the crisis. We have neither the \nfiscal flexibility nor the policy space to afford \nambitious stimulus packages to respond effectively to \nthe upheavals in our country.  \n A major corollary of the economic downturn is \nthe problem of debt servicing and debt sustainability. \nMany developing countries could be on the verge of a \ndebt crisis, and require special support to help them \nattenuate the impact of the global crisis.  \n Jamaica has always supported efforts to assist the \nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries that have benefited \nfrom debt relief initiatives. But there is another group \nof developing countries that are equally burdened by \nhigh debt and deserving of special consideration. I \nspeak of the heavily indebted lower-middle-income \ncountries, which are overlooked on the presumption \nthat, by virtue of their levels of gross domestic product \n(GDP) per capita, they do not require international \nassistance. That approach continues to mask the reality \nof our vulnerability to external shocks, persistently \nhigh levels of poverty and dependence on commodity \nexports. \n Jamaica is particularly concerned about the \nsituation of highly indebted middle-income countries, \nwhich cannot benefit from the kind of assistance \navailable to the Least Developed Countries and \nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries, but which have been \ndevastated by the impact of the global economic and \nfinancial crisis. Jamaica is currently saddled with a \ndebt-to-GDP ratio of 125 per cent. Along with our \nCARICOM partners, we will continue to advocate for a \nvery special category of small, vulnerable and highly \nindebted middle-income countries. A review of the \ncriteria for determining middle-income status could \nhelp to address financial resource accessibility in the \nlong term. We are lobbying for a review of those \ncriteria. \n The pervasiveness of the crisis makes coordinated \ninternational action imperative. Over the last two days \nin Pittsburgh, leaders of the Group of 20 (G-20) met \nfor the third time in less than a year to review the \nprogress on commitments made at their last summit \nand chart a course to counter the impact of the adverse \neconomic environment. As much as we value the \ninclusion of advanced developing countries in the G-20 \nprocess, we believe that it is critical that space be made \nto accommodate the voices of a wider cross-section of \ndeveloping countries, particularly the most vulnerable. \nOur interest is in ensuring that the particular needs of \nsmall, vulnerable economies and highly indebted \nmiddle-income developing countries of the CARICOM \nsubregion are addressed through appropriate \nrepresentation at the summits of the G-20. We must \nhave an integrated approach in order to craft the type \nof common strategy that a crisis of this magnitude \ndemands. \n At the same time, the United Nations must play \nan essential role in helping to manage the various \nramifications of the crisis. It can ensure dialogue and \nenable a coordinated response based on an inclusive \ndecision-making process. The United Nations \nConference on the World Financial and Economic \nCrisis and its Impact on Development, held in June, \nprovided a useful platform. Developing countries that \nare not part of the G-20 group were able to bring their \nconcerns to the international community and contribute \nto the search for solutions to the crisis.  \n We are encouraged by the candour of leaders \nfrom the major industrialized countries who expressed \ntheir commitment, with obvious sincerity, to effectively \naddressing the concerns of developing countries in \norder to help them cope with the crisis. We are seized \nwith a spirit of collectivity, and hope that this renewed \nmomentum will overcome all obstacles and translate \ninto tangible, targeted outcomes. \n The severity and complexity of the crisis is \nunderpinned by the interlinked and interdependent \nnature of the global financial system. The experience \nof the current crisis supports the case for strengthening \nfinancial regulation and supervision to address \nsystemic weaknesses in the global financial system.  \n Reform of the international financial architecture \nis long overdue. Urgent steps must be taken to reform \n \n \n19 09-52592 \n \nthe governance structure of the international financial \ninstitutions, including a review of the policy conditions \nattached to lending by the International Monetary \nFund. We are disappointed that there is as yet no \nvisible action on reform of the international monetary \nand financial systems. \n Jamaica is a trade-dependent country. We \ntherefore agree that there is an urgent need to conclude \nthe Doha Round of negotiations in a bid to revive \nglobal trade and to aid in global economic recovery. \nDevelopment must remain central to that agenda. Any \noutcome of our negotiations in the Doha Development \nRound must lead to clear benefits for our farmers, \nproducers, exporters and consumers. We must redouble \nour efforts in this critical area and resolve to transform \ninternational trade into an engine of growth. \n Progress has been made in the implementation of \nAid for Trade for developing countries. We must build \non that progress. There are outstanding commitments \nwith respect to the provision of technical and financial \nsupport to help strengthen the trading and production \ncapacities of developing countries. We look forward to \nfurther collaboration with our international partners \nand aid and development organizations in pushing the \nAid for Trade initiative to build on the supply-side \ncapacity and infrastructure of developing countries, so \nthat they can take advantage of trade opportunities and \nconnections with the global economy, particularly \nagainst the backdrop of this global recession. \n The threat posed by climate change must not be \nunderestimated. Urgent and effective global action on \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation is required to \navoid the catastrophic consequences of global \nwarming. \n The Alliance of Small Island States Climate \nChange Summit on 21 September, as well as the \nSummit on Climate Change held here a few days ago, \nreinforced this fact: the time for action is now. We \nwere heartened by the broad agreement that a \nsignificant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is \nnecessary to reduce global warming. What is now \nrequired is the necessary political will to take concrete, \ndecisive action so that we can address this clear and \npresent danger head on. \n As a Small Island Developing State that is \nvulnerable to the impact of climate change, Jamaica \nhas a vested interest in a successful outcome of the \nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference in \nCopenhagen in December \u2014 an outcome based on \nequity and differentiated burden-sharing. It is now \nclearly established that developed country emitters \nhave a historical responsibility for global warming and \nthat they should take the lead in reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions. \n Other major emitters also have a role to play in \nclimate change mitigation while taking into account \ntheir own development needs. To this end, we favour \nthe conclusion of a post-Kyoto framework wherein the \ncommitments agreed to by all the parties hold to the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities \nand respective capabilities. A successful outcome must \nalso include concrete commitments on adaptation, \nmitigation, capacity-building, technology transfers and \nthe provision of financial resources to assist \ndeveloping countries in addressing climate change. \n We recognize that action at the international level \nmust be complemented by urgent action at the national \nand regional levels. The necessary steps must be taken \nto integrate climate change into broader national \nsustainable development planning. Jamaica has \nembraced this approach. \n The pursuit of complete disarmament and nuclear \nnon-proliferation, with particular regard to weapons of \nmass destruction, must remain a shared goal. The \n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty provides an opportunity for \nrenewed commitment to strengthen the \nnon-proliferation regime. \n Restoring peace and promoting regional stability \nthrough peacekeeping operations is at the heart of the \ncontribution of the United Nations to international \npeace and security. However, as we have seen, \npeacekeeping interventions cannot by themselves \nproduce the desired outcome of sustainable peace. The \nPeacebuilding Commission, established in 2006, can \nassure such sustainability and make a difference in the \nlives of people in post-conflict countries. We are \ntherefore pleased that new arrangements have been put \nin place to make the Peacebuilding Fund more flexible \nas we seek to support peace efforts in countries \nemerging from conflict. \n In my own region, Jamaica remains committed to \nthe long-term stability, socio-economic growth and \ndevelopment of our sister country, Haiti. We recognize \nthe important role of the United Nations Stabilization \nMission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in helping to foster the \n  \n \n09-52592 20 \n \nenvironment necessary to ensure a sustainable future \nfor the Haitian people. \n We must increase our efforts to counter \ntransnational organized crime, narco-trafficking and \nthe illicit trade in small arms and ammunition, which \nthreaten the rule of law and democratic governance in \nmany countries, and fuel the spread of international \nterrorism. At the regional level, through joint \ncollaboration and approaches within CARICOM, we \ncontinue to tackle these security challenges, which \nthreaten the social and economic fabric of our \nsocieties. \n The challenges presented by the outbreak of \ninfectious diseases and the potential pandemics, such \nas HIV/AIDS and the H1N1 flu, call for common \nglobal strategies to ensure that developed and \ndeveloping countries alike can respond rapidly and \neffectively. As a result of the global economic crisis, \naccessibility and affordability of essential medicines \nare expected to deteriorate in developing countries. In \nthis regard, however, it is anticipated that developing \ncountries will have access to the forthcoming H1N1 \nvaccine at an affordable price. \n We end this first decade of the twenty-first \ncentury confronted by myriad challenges. These \nchallenges are not constrained by borders and cannot \nbe confronted by States acting on their own. They can \nonly be confronted through international cooperation \nand effective partnerships. But this can only be \nachieved through greater multilateralism, with \nequitable participation by all countries, both developed \nand developing. \n Jamaica firmly believes that the United Nations is \nthe only organization equipped to undertake this task \nof inclusive multilateralism. With all its imperfections, \nthe United Nations still enjoys legitimacy in the eyes \nof most people in the world. But the United Nations \ncannot, in its current form and structure, successfully \ntackle this task. It must be reformed to make it more \nresponsive to all its Members.  \n Multilateralism cannot work effectively if the \nGeneral Assembly, the most representative global body, \nis unable to assert itself as the central decision-making \nbody of the Organization. Nor can it work if the \nSecurity Council remains an exclusive club, \nunrepresentative of the wider membership of the \nUnited Nations. The goal of the intergovernmental \nnegotiations which commenced earlier this year should \nbe to come to a definitive conclusion on \ncomprehensive reform of the Council. \n The theme that the President has chosen for this \nsession is both apt and timely. It evokes the purposes \nand principles enshrined in the Charter. It calls on us to \nreaffirm and renew our commitment to joint \nresponsibility for development, the realization of peace \nand security and harmony among peoples. It is in this \nspirit that we look forward to the erection of the \npermanent memorial to honour the victims of the \ntransatlantic slave trade, which will remain an enduring \nsymbol of our collective resolve to eliminate \ndiscrimination, social inequity and prejudice. \n The United Nations must assert its unique \ncapability as the world\u2019s premier multinational \norganization to address the challenges and meet the \nneeds of the poor and most vulnerable. We need, \ntherefore, to urgently correct and reverse the tendency \ntowards inaction, inertia and indifference which has so \nfar frustrated efforts to address the development \nagenda. This would be in keeping with the ideals of the \nCharter and our shared vision for the fulfilment of the \nhopes, aspirations and expectations of all our citizens \nacross the globe. We dare not fail to live up to those \nexpectations, as to do otherwise would seriously impair \nthe very credibility and relevance of the United \nNations, particularly during this time of crisis."

        "file_text": "I would like \nto begin by congratulating Mr. Ali Treki on his election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. We are confident that the international \ncommunity will greatly benefit from his experience \nand wisdom on the political and human fronts, and at \nthe local and international levels. I also take this \nopportunity warmly to thank the Secretary-General and \nall Governments, international organizations and \npermanent members who have offered support and \nhave promoted peace and stability in Somalia, and who \nhave delivered to our country the aid necessary to \nprotect our sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity.  \n I wish to express our condolences to the families \nof those who have lost their lives in defence of peace \nand stability in Somalia. I would particularly like to \nthank the African Union, which has made tremendous \nsacrifices for the cause of peace in Somalia.  \n I would now like to talk about the efforts and \nprogress made by the Government of Somalia since it \ncame to power through the Djibouti peace process \u2014 \nprogress made despite the enormous difficulties and \nchallenges facing the Somali nation, particularly given \nthat it was established after 18 years of anarchy and \nchaos. My Government\u2019s priorities include improving \nthe security situation, promoting efforts towards \nreconciliation and providing essential humanitarian \nassistance to the displaced and the suffering in our \ncountry.  \n Unfortunately, however, the rebels are \nendeavouring to overthrow the Somali Government, \nwhich is still taking its first steps in achieving security. \nThese rebel elements have conducted a violent \ninsurrection against the Government, fuelled by the \nnegative effects and consequences of the past 18 years, \nwhich are further compounded by prevailing high \nunemployment and our country\u2019s weakness in the field \nof security. It is clear that extremist foreign elements \nhave joined the ranks of the insurgency and some of \nthese foreign extremists hold key rebel leadership \npositions. \n I would like to recall that we thwarted the \nattempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat perpetrated by the rebels against \nthe Government. We believe that we were able to \nprevail thanks, first and foremost, to God, and then \nthrough the efforts of our Government and people and \nthe help we received from the international community \nand the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). \nWe are currently endeavouring to promote and bolster \nthe Somali security forces, to create new naval forces \nand a new coast guard to tackle the problem of piracy, \nwhich continues to threaten international shipping in \nthe Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. However, \ndespite all our achievements we still have a long road \nto travel.  \n Rebellion in Somalia is a new form of insurgency \nthat is emerging in the world today. This rebellion is \nconducted by foreign and Somali extremists who are \nagainst Islam, against peace, against security and \nagainst stability. They are spoilers who sow destruction \nand take exploit the chaos and anarchy that have \nexisted in Somalia since 1991.  \n We suggest that what is happening in Somalia \nshould not be underestimated or taken lightly. The \ninternational community should take prompt and \ndecisive steps to ensure that our people are not held \nhostage by these extremist groups who are working \nagainst our freedom and our destiny. From this rostrum \nI would like to state that if the world does not \ncomprehend the gravity of what is happening in \nSomalia, then the consequences will be very harmful. \nThe troubles we are experiencing threaten to proliferate \ninto neighbouring countries and indeed throughout the \nworld.  \n The problem of international terrorism is not \nconfined to Somalia and this problem should be \naddressed at the international level.  \n \n \n19 09-52463 \n \n I turn now to the issue of piracy, which has \nrecently become a matter of major concern for the \ninternational community. The phenomenon of piracy is \nclosely linked to the current security situation in \nSomalia. As a result, as long as the security situation in \nSomalia remains unchanged, piracy will continue in \none way or another. We would like to say, however, \nthat there has of late been a reduction of piracy as a \nresult of collective international endeavours. Still, it \nremains essential to make additional efforts to combat \npiracy. \n Toxic waste sunk off the Somali coast, unlawful \nfishing and the pillaging of national wealth are a \nviolation of Somali sovereignty and cause considerable \ndamage, which has a negative effect on the \nenvironment through the pollution caused.  \n We are resolved to engage in a political dialogue \nthat is open to all Somali stakeholders, including the \narmed rebels.  \n We are determined to sit down at the negotiating \ntable with all parties, even those who are against the \nGovernment, any time and any place, in order to end \nthe conflict raging in our country. We will spare no \neffort to end the conflict and find a lasting political \nsolution. We will ensure the security of our people and \nprotect our sovereignty and territorial integrity. \nHowever, the extremists do not believe in the benefit of \nany manner of dialogue or negotiation; they believe \nonly in guns and cannons.  \n We are ready to establish a firm foundation for an \nopen, transparent and participatory democratic political \nsystem by creating sound democratic institutions that \nreflect the collective political will and the cultural \nvalues of the Somali people. That system will be based \non an institutional regime and constitutional \nmechanisms designed to protect human rights and the \nrule of law. \n Similarly, we will foster genuine Islamic \nprinciples that encourage tolerance, personal freedoms, \nrespect for individual rights and equal rights for all \nunder the law, without regard to gender, clan or ethnic \norigin. \n In addition, we will work tirelessly towards \nestablishing a free-market economic system to attract \nforeign direct investment and encourage private \nownership. The system we will introduce will have \nsound and effective financial institutions with strong \nbuilt-in anti-corruption mechanisms. \n We will use all available means to rebuild a \nnational Somali State that is at peace with itself, with \nits neighbours and with the international community. \nFurthermore, we intend to cooperate closely with the \ninternational community in the security sphere. \n At this trying moment in history, Somalia \nurgently needs the support and assistance of the \ninternational community, in particular in the form of \nsecurity and humanitarian aid. Since 1991, Somalia has \nnot enjoyed peace, stability or security. Thus, it has \nbeen difficult to achieve social and economic \ndevelopment and to protect human rights.  \n Security and stability may be established if \ncertain essential measures are taken, including \npromotion of the security and police components, the \njudiciary and administrative institutions. African Union \ntroops should be increased to a necessary level and \naugmented by other troops, provided that they are \nsufficiently funded, trained and equipped to carry out \ntheir task. In order to restore security in Somalia, those \nmeasures must be implemented decisively and as soon \nas possible. \nIn the context of humanitarian assistance, it must \nbe emphasized that the situation of refugees, both \nwithin Somalia and outside its borders, continues to \ndeteriorate. There are nearly 3.8 million people in the \ncountry requiring humanitarian assistance. Our people \nare experiencing a real humanitarian tragedy that is \ncompounded by several years of drought. Humanitarian \naccess to those in need is considerably hampered by \nthe security situation that has deteriorated as a result of \nthe conflict. \n In connection with Security Council resolutions \non the arms embargo, I urge the Council to reconsider \nthe matter and appeal to it to assist us in strengthening \nour security forces without which any endeavour to \nrebuild infrastructure and achieve security and stability \nin Somalia will be impossible. \n On the donors conference held in Brussels in \nApril 2009 pursuant to Security Council resolution \n1863 (2009), we wish to ask donor countries which \nhave made funds available to Somalia to speed up the \nallocation of additional funding. I also urge United \n  \n \n09-52463 20 \n \nNations Member States and Security Council members \nto take further measures to support the Republic of \nSomalia more effectively in order to end the \nintransigence of the extremists and to ensure that no \nfurther obstacles exist to rehabilitating Somalia and \nrebuilding its infrastructure so that we can bring an end \nto the genuine daily tragedy of the people in Somalia. \n We firmly believe that our progress on security is \nlikely to enable us to counter the negative economic \nand social impacts of the chaotic events of the past \n18 years. Somalia would be in a position to revive the \nentrepreneurial spirit of the people of Somalia. We \nhave already begun to make tangible progress with \nremittances from Somalis abroad. If Somalia enjoyed \nsome level of stability and security our economy could \nprogress reasonably in the coming years. In any event, \npeace, stability and development are all interlinked; \nthere can be no peace without development or \ndevelopment without peace and stability.  \n The worldwide economic decline has severely \naffected the people of Somalia and has placed an \nadditional burden on their shoulders. From this \nrostrum, we reiterate our appeal for joint, urgent action \nfor Somalia. I stand before the Assembly fully \nconfident in the future of Somalia. It is a country with \nvast natural and human resources. We believe and we \nare confident that, with support, we will be able to \nmake genuine and concrete progress."

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, Mr. Treki, permit me on behalf of Yemen and on \nmy own account to congratulate you on your well-\ndeserved election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am confident \nthat your long experience in the area of diplomacy, in \nparticular Arab and African diplomacy, will ensure \nyour skilful and able conduct of our proceedings. I \nwish you every success in carrying out your noble \nmission. I also wish to congratulate Father Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann, President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session, on his efforts, \nwhich ensured the success of the various Main \nCommittees of the Assembly. In addition, I thank the \nSecretary-General for his tireless efforts to consolidate \ninternational peace and security and advance the work \nof the Organization. \n The Republic of Yemen is facing complex socio-\npolitical and development challenges, to which a \nnumber of factors have contributed, including the \nworld financial crisis and its impact on Yemen\u2019s \neconomy, as well as an acute shortage of resources as a \nresult of declining oil production and low prices on \ninternational markets. We also face a growing \npopulation, combined with water shortages and limited \ncommitments by our development partners to help us \ncombat poverty by providing employment \nopportunities and decent livelihoods for the Yemeni \npopulation. Despite those difficulties, the Yemeni \ncitizen has the smallest share of official development \nassistance when compared with citizens of other least \ndeveloped countries. Undoubtedly, lack of \ndevelopment and rising unemployment and poverty \n \n \n7 09-52604 \n \nrates have created many challenges and difficulties for \nour Government.  \n The Government also faces other challenges, \nincluding, in particular, the rebellion by the Al-Hothi \nelements in the Sa\u00b4ada governorate, who abandoned \nthe Zaidi doctrine, which is the second most prevalent \nreligious sect in Yemen, to embrace the beliefs of the \nShi\u00b4ite Twelvers sect. Although they had the right to do \nso as Yemenis, they exploited it to gain Shi\u00b4ite support \nand sympathy after they had carried out an armed \nrebellion against the Government. These subversive \ngroups have committed terrorist and violent acts \nagainst citizens, targeted State institutions and facilities \nand hampered the work of local councils, calling for \nchanges in our democratic republican system in order \nto return Yemen to the days before the 26 September \nrevolution. The Government has been compelled to \ndeal with these destructive groups, channelling a \nportion of its limited resources allocated for \ndevelopment towards fighting the saboteurs and \nre-establishing governmental authority and the rule of \nlaw throughout Yemen. The destructive acts carried out \nby these rebellious groups before the recent military \noperations against them caused the displacement of \ntens of thousands of citizens from areas affected by \nviolence, which has recently increased as a result of \nmilitary clashes.  \n As a result of its concern about the situation of \ninternally displaced persons (IDPs), the Yemeni \nGovernment has addressed that humanitarian situation \nresponsibly and in cooperation and coordination with \ninternational and civil society humanitarian relief \norganizations, providing secure camps and meeting the \nneeds of IDPs for food and health care. Here, I wish to \nrecall that our Government has declared two cessations \nof hostilities during the most recent military \noperations, the second of which was in response to the \nappeal made by the Secretary-General and \nhumanitarian and international organizations for the \nopening of safe corridors for the provision of relief to \nrefugees. However, the saboteurs exploited that \nceasefire by increasing their attacks on our military \nforces, cutting off roads, planting mines and spreading \nfalse rumours about Government forces attacking the \nIDPs. The Government has established a committee to \ninvestigate the situation, although it is aware that there \nwas no IDP camp in the area but rather a camp used as \na supply centre and meeting place by the saboteurs, \nwho have violated five previous agreements and \nreturned to violent actions.  \n I wish to highlight our commitment to the \nprinciples of guaranteeing human rights, protecting \ncivilians from the effects of military operations and \nupholding the sovereignty of the Constitution and the \nrule of law in dealing with an internal situation caused \nby a group that is committing violent and terrorist acts \nin violation of the law and the Constitution. \n This challenge is growing, as can be seen from \nthe activities of Al-Qaida elements in Yemen and their \nattempts to consolidate their presence in Yemen and to \ntarget our country and other States in the region. \nAl-Qaida is supporting the saboteurs in Sa\u00b4ada, seeking \nto make their acts of violence and rebellion serve the \ninterests of Al-Qaida in Yemen and to spread anarchy \nand instability. This highlights the need for continued \nYemeni efforts to uproot terrorism and for continued \ninternational coordination among security and \nintelligence organs, so that extremism and terrorism \ncan be defeated. \n Meanwhile, a number of separatist elements are \nexploiting the atmosphere of democracy and freedom \nof thought and expression, the Government\u2019s respect \nfor human rights, and economic difficulties and a low \nstandard of living to promote their separatist agenda \u2014 \nwhich was rejected by the Yemeni people in 1994 \u2014 in \nan invitation to reject constitutional legitimacy and to \nconspire against the unity, security and stability of \nYemen.  \n The level of expenditure required for our \nGovernment to impose the rule of law and combat \nterrorism has reduced the number of employment \nopportunities, decent livelihoods and educational \nopportunities for our young people and the chance to \nfight poverty. Therefore, we urge the international \ncommunity, donor countries, international \norganizations and Yemen\u2019s partners to join an \ninternational alliance to combat terrorism. Once again, \nwe call upon them to shoulder their responsibilities and \nprovide generous support to Yemen in order to \nstrengthen our development programmes to combat \npoverty and provide job opportunities, since \ndevelopment and economic growth are important \nelements in combating terrorism, reducing \nunemployment and achieving development. From this \nrostrum, we call on Yemen\u2019s partners and donors to \n  \n \n09-52604 8 \n \nfulfil the pledges that they made at the November 2006 \nLondon conference in support of development. \n The Republic of Yemen continues to strengthen \nthe democratic principles of its political system, \nreflected in political pluralism, the peaceful handover \nof authority, freedom of expression, respect for human \nrights, growing decentralization, building local \ngovernment with broad powers, electoral and \nconstitutional reform and improving partnerships with \ncivil society organizations. Those involved in political \nwork in Yemen agreed to postpone for two years the \nparliamentary elections that were to be held next April \nin order to reform the election law and to introduce \nsome constitutional changes with a view to reforming \ngovernance. For its part, the Government has \nintroduced a system of broad local government \ninvolving the election rather than the appointment of \ngovernors with a view to bringing about further \ndecentralization of authority.  \n The difficult humanitarian situation of the \nPalestinian people under Israeli occupation should \nremind all in this Hall that the international community \nhas failed to secure the legitimate demands of the \nPalestinian people and to assist it in establishing its \nown State, and that it has ignored the suffering of the \nPalestinian people, the systematic violation of their \nhuman rights and the increase in illegal settlement \nactivities in the occupied Palestinian territories. The \nunjust blockade imposed on the Palestinians in Gaza \nmakes life a tragedy for the entire population of Gaza \nowing to the complete disregard of the practices of the \nIsraeli occupation in violation of the relevant \ninternational resolutions and instruments, and in the \nlight of the recalcitrance shown by the Israeli \nGovernment and its rejection of all initiatives aimed at \nmoving the peace process forward, in particular with \nregard to the course adopted by the United States \nAdministration to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. We \ncall upon our Palestinian brothers to show a spirit of \nnational responsibility towards their people living \nunder the yoke of occupation by unifying and putting \nan end to their differences so as to benefit the \nPalestinian issue and achieve their goals. \n The situation in Somalia calls for the \ninternational community to take more effective \nmeasures to achieve peace and security and to rebuild \nthe institutions of the Somali State by urging the \nTransitional Federal Government to act in such a way \nas to contribute to the strengthening of peace and \nstability in the Horn of Africa. Here, we welcome the \nefforts of the Transitional Federal Government to \nsecure peace and to extend its administration \nthroughout Somali territory. However, it urgently needs \nfurther support to enable it to serve the Somali people. \nWe call on all Somali parties without exception to end \ntheir differences, to participate in national dialogue and \nto achieve reconciliation, putting the interests of the \nSomali people above all else.  \n We call on the external parties to stop interfering \nin Somalia\u2019s internal affairs. Instability in Somalia is \nadversely affecting all States of the region. The \nphenomenon of piracy and the increasing flow of \nrefugees to neighbouring States, resulting from the \ninstability in Somalia, are creating socio-economic and \nhealth difficulties for Yemen, as it bears the burden of \ncaring for hundreds of thousands of those refugees. We \ncall on the international community to help the Somali \ncoast guard to protect the coasts and international \nmaritime trade. \n With regard to the situation in the Sudan and in \nDarfur, we welcome the mediation efforts of Qatar, \nLibya and Egypt to achieve peace in the Sudan. We \nsupport the efforts of the international community in \nbringing about the reconciliation of all opposing \nfactions, and we reiterate our call for the decision of \nthe International Criminal Court with regard to \nPresident Omer Al-Bashir to be overturned as it does \nnot respect the sovereignty of the Sudan and hinders \nthe efforts for peace in the Sudan.  \n Yemen condemns all acts of terrorism to which \nthe Iraqi people are subjected, and we call on them to \novercome their differences and to strengthen their \nnational unity.  \n Yemen welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral towards reforming the Organization. We \nreaffirm our position that the United Nations and its \nsystem should be reformed in order to achieve \nequitable representation and a better decision-making \nprocess that places the required emphasis on \ndevelopment, fighting pandemics, easing poverty and \naddressing environmental issues, which have a direct \nimpact on the standard of living of millions of people. \nWe must strive to bolster the Security Council\u2019s role in \nthe maintenance of international peace and security; at \nthe same time we must reform the Council and expand \nit to make it more representative, ensure that its \ndeliberations are more transparent and rationalize the \n \n \n9 09-52604 \n \nuse of the veto so as to avoid its abuse and double \nstandards. \n In conclusion, on behalf of the Government of \nYemen, I would like to extend our appreciation for the \ngood work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in \nmanaging this Organization and in improving its work. \nI reiterate my congratulations to you, Mr. President, \nand wish you every success.

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate \nMr. Ali Treki on his unanimous election to preside over \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. His \nelection is a deserved tribute to his personal qualities \nas a seasoned politician and diplomat and also to his \ncountry, Libya, with which Malta has long-standing \nties of friendship and cooperation. I am sure that under \nhis wise leadership and experience this august \nAssembly will be guided throughout his term to a \nsuccessful and fruitful outcome. \n My delegation\u2019s thanks and appreciation are \nextended to his distinguished predecessor, Father \nMiguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for the dedicated manner \nin which he presided over the work and activities of the \nsixty-third session. \n Malta would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend and thank the Secretary-General for his \nunstinting efforts in guiding our Organization in the \nmaintenance of international peace and stability \nworldwide. Under his leadership the United Nations \nhas made important strides in raising awareness and in \nmany instances responding effectively to the critical \nsituation of the poor and more vulnerable. It was \ntherefore of great satisfaction to my Government and \nthe Maltese people that we had the honour and \nprivilege to welcome him to Malta last April. \n This year Malta is marking three important \nanniversaries. The first is the forty-fifth anniversary of \nour country\u2019s independence, on 21 September 1964; \nthe second is the fifteenth anniversary of the coming \ninto force on 21 March 1994 of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change; and the \nthird is the fifteenth anniversary of the coming into \nforce on 16 November 1994 of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea. \n Over the past 45 years, Malta has made good on \nthe pledge it made when it joined this Organization. In \nthis regard, I would like to avail myself of this \nopportunity to renew today, on this forty-fifth \nanniversary of Malta\u2019s United Nations membership, \nour pledge and our unwavering faith and trust in the \nideals and purposes enshrined in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. \n One of the issues which in the coming weeks will \nbe at the top of the international agenda is the \nCopenhagen Summit. Two days ago, this Hall \nwitnessed one of the largest-ever gatherings of Heads \nof State and Heads of Government to debate the future \nof our planet Earth. During this unique summit we all \nagreed that the challenges posed by climate change \nhave become the most urgent and critical faced by \nhumankind. \n It will be recalled that in 1988, when Malta took \nthe initiative to formally submit the issue of climate \nchange as a political item on the agenda of the forty-\nthird session of the General Assembly, few of us would \nhave thought at that time that this issue of climate \nchange would become in the span of two decades one \nof the principal critical issues dominating the \ninternational environmental concerns of this new \ncentury. Throughout these 20 years, Malta has been in \nthe forefront of those ensuring that climate change \ncontinues to be one of the top-priority issues of our \ntimes. Our commitment of 20 years ago remains \nsteadfast and as strong as ever. As we have heard \nduring the past few days, the outcome of the \nCopenhagen Summit must signal a turning point. Malta \nstrongly believes that it is the duty of all countries, \nlarge and small, rich and poor, to contribute their fair \nshare to this concerted effort, which must be global if it \nis to succeed. \n  \n \n09-52425 54 \n \n On 16 November of this year, Member States will \ncommemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the coming \ninto force of the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea, which has been described as the \nconstitution for regulating humankind\u2019s activities \nrelating to the oceans. It was 42 years ago that, in this \nHall, Malta once again called on Member States to \nundertake a reform of the law of the sea, which \neventually culminated in the adoption of the current \nConvention on 10 December 1982. \n It is also necessary to see the 1982 convention in \nthe light of some pressing and contemporary problems \nwhich are either being addressed inadequately or not \nbeing addressed at all. Among these deficiencies are \nthe provisions dealing with piracy, illicit traffic in \nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, the rules \nrelating to the protection and preservation of the \nmarine environment and the rules dealing with \nsubmarine cables and pipelines. Examples of omissions \nare the trafficking of human beings, the safety and \nsecurity of navigation, the transportation of weapons of \nmass destruction, and climate change. \n In the light of the issues I have just mentioned, \nMalta feels that the time has come for the General \nAssembly to examine possible approaches to a review \nof the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. In this \ncontext, Malta would like to propose that the General \nAssembly, through its relevant bodies, undertake \nappropriate consultations among its Member States to \nrevise the Convention in view of the passage of time \nand the emergence of new and critical issues over the \nyears. My delegation will be ready to enter into \nconsultations with other interested Member States to \nadvance this proposal further. \n Just as it was necessary in 1948 to recognize the \nneed for a universal declaration of human rights as a \nfundamental condition for the enjoyment of freedom, \njustice and peace for all men and women around the \nworld, so it has become vital now to have a \nconcomitant declaration on human duties of the present \ngeneration, including our responsibilities towards \nfuture generations. We have the overall task of \nconserving the human species in the sacredness of its \nlife and in its continuity, as well as of preserving the \nenvironment, in all its manifestations. We believe that \nsuch a declaration emanates naturally from that \ndoctrine of the common heritage of mankind, which \nmy country first mooted before this Assembly in 1967 \nand which eventually led to the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea. \n Malta believes that human duties are intrinsic to \nthe personality, oneness and uniqueness of the human \nbeing, and are as inalienable as human rights. Those \nduties do not arise from laws or obligations but are \ninherent to the human being. Such duties relate to \nhuman beings themselves and to their fellow beings, \nand in a special manner to their family, to the \ncommunity at all levels and to the natural and cultural \nenvironment in which their life evolves. The envisaged \ndeclaration, strengthening and fulfilling the thrust of \nthe 1948 universal instrument, should mark the work of \nthis Assembly as a consummate service to the \ninternational community. It should stand out as a major \nachievement of the United Nations at the beginning of \nthe third millennium of our era. It is in this spirit that \nMalta proposes that consideration be given to the \ndrafting of such a declaration on human duties and \nresponsibilities. \n Conflicts around the world have continued to \naffect the political, economic and social development \nof many countries and a large part of our societies. It is \ntragic that in the past decade more than two million \ninnocent children were killed and six million seriously \ninjured in conflicts. The role of the United Nations in \npreventive diplomacy and support to peace processes \nmust enjoy strong and sustainable political backing \nfrom Member States. \n A number of hotspots, from Somalia and \nAfghanistan to the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nand the Middle East, continue to challenge our \ncollective search for peaceful and long-lasting \nsolutions for these war-torn countries and regions. \nMalta therefore welcomes our Organization\u2019s \nengagement through its peacekeeping missions and \npeacebuilding mechanisms to foster political dialogue \nand reconciliation among the warring parties. We \nbelieve that assisting countries emerging from conflict \nin the rebuilding of the lives of their populations would \ncontribute in no small way to providing the necessary \nsupport to nationally driven efforts in the achievement \nof sustainable peace and development. \n One of the long-standing issues of which the \nUnited Nations has been seized since its inception is \nthe question of the Middle East. Indeed, peace in the \nMiddle East continues to evade our ongoing efforts. \nMalta reiterates its vision of a two-State solution, with \n \n \n55 09-52425 \n \nboth States living in secure and guaranteed frontiers, \neach recognizing the other\u2019s sovereignty, and the right \nto peaceful coexistence. Malta calls in both parties to \nengage fully in resumed negotiations to this end, \nresulting in a viable Palestinian State on the basis of \nthe June 1967 borders. This is not a view which we \nhave adopted today. It is a vision that has been ours for \ndecades, believing as we do that peace in the Middle \nEast determines peace in the Mediterranean and \nbeyond. \n Malta\u2019s strategic geographic location in the \nMediterranean has placed it in the privileged yet \nresponsible position of building bridges between the \ntwo continents. In fact, Malta\u2019s vocation towards peace \nand security in the Mediterranean continues to occupy \nan important place of my Government\u2019s foreign policy \npriorities. During the past 12 months, Malta has \ncontinued to build on the achievements made so far by \nenhancing the dialogue between countries in the \nMediterranean region and the European Union and also \nwith the League of Arab States. It is with a strong \nsense of political commitment and direction that we in \nMalta bear the responsibility of hosting the liaison \noffice aimed at strengthening cooperation between the \nEuropean Union and League of Arab States, which is \ndue to be opened this coming October. Malta believes \nthat the liaison office will render a major contribution \nto deepening mutual understanding through practical \ncooperation between Europe and the Arab world, as \nwell as enhancing intercultural dialogue. \n Members will recall that last year I raised the \nissue of the influx of illegal immigrants who risk their \nlives in crossing the Mediterranean to seek a new \nbeginning. I had indicated that our size and our \nfinancial and human resources, which are very limited, \nmake it extremely difficult for Malta to cope with the \nlarge number of these unfortunate people arriving on \nour shores on their way to mainland Europe. Malta has \nalways dealt with this situation with great \nresponsibility, humanity and benevolence, paying due \nrespect to every human being without any exception. \nAnd we will continue to do so. At the same time, the \nproblem of illegal immigration is an international \nphenomenon driven by external factors which cannot \nalways be prevented or even mitigated by the countries \ndirectly affected by the problem. We therefore strongly \nfeel that the United Nations should address the issue of \nillegal immigration in a holistic way so as to find \nsolutions to a humanitarian problem that Malta and \nother like us, especially in the Mediterranean, are \ncurrently facing. Much more needs to be done, and all \nof us, including countries of origin and countries of \ntransit, need to step up our efforts in order to deal with \nthis challenge. \n My Government is deeply appreciative of those \ncountries that have come forward to assist us in coping \nwith this phenomenon, including the United States of \nAmerica, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, \nSlovenia and Slovakia. My Government also hopes that \nother countries will come forward to assist in \nalleviating the burden which Malta carries \u2014 a burden \nso acutely disproportionate to the country\u2019s population, \nwealth and land area. \n In his report on the work of the Organization, the \nSecretary-General has laid emphasis on the need to \nembark on a multilateral effort of immense magnitude \n\u201cthat draws upon the strengths and contributions of all \nthe countries of the world, as well as their citizens\u201d \n(A/64/1, para. 4). Malta believes that such an effort \nmust find its foundations in this Organization where all \nMember States are equal and where the many \nchallenges facing humankind can be addressed in a \ncohesive and coherent manner. The global challenges \nwhich the United Nations faces are our challenges. We, \nas Member States, have an obligation and the \nresponsibility to ensure that our Organization lives up \nto the commitments and decisions that we, as heads of \nState and Government, solemnly undertake to \nimplement in the best interests of our constituencies \nand societies. \n Allow me to conclude by stating that Malta \ncontinues to strongly believe that together, as Members \nof the United Nations, we can and should continue to \nsupport the Organization, our Secretary-General and all \nthose who contribute to making our world a better \nplace for present and future generations. I know that \nMalta intends to do so."

        "file_text": "Permit me \nto congratulate our brother and friend Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki on his assumption of the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Let \nme assure him of our delegation\u2019s assistance and \nsupport as he discharges his task. Given his wisdom \nand experience, we are certain that he will successfully \nfulfil the tasks assigned to him and further the \nobjectives of the United Nations. I would like also to \nthank his predecessor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, \nfor his presidency of the General Assembly during the \nprevious session. \n The current political process in Iraq, ongoing \nsince the collapse of the former regime in 2003, has \nproduced radical political change, pushing towards \nbuilding a unified, independent and democratic federal \nIraq with respected constitutional institutions. \nRealizing these objectives has not been easy and has \nnot been without challenges, chief among which were \ndomestic and regional forces attempting to return Iraq \nto the period prior to the change. These forces have \nused various means to attain that goal, including \ncommitting the worst of crimes, allying themselves \nwith organized crime and joining with networks of \ninternational terrorism to disrupt the security and \nstability of Iraq. \n Significant developments have taken place in Iraq \nsince I stood here last year. The most important of \nthem were the signing of the agreement with the \nUnited States on the withdrawal of its troops, \norganization of the American forces\u2019 temporary \npresence in Iraq and the signing of the Strategic \nFramework Agreement with the United States. Based \non that agreement, United States troops withdrew from \nIraqi cities at the end of last June, and Iraqi forces \nassumed responsibility for security throughout Iraq. \nThe security situation has greatly improved under the \nGovernment of National Unity, thanks to its tireless \nendeavours towards national dialogue and national \nreconciliation projects. These efforts seek to include all \npolitical parties and social groups, within the political \nprocess and outside it, that believe in the peaceful \ntransfer of power. The Iraqi Government is also \ncontinuing its policy of imposing law and order in \nconfronting terrorist groups, armed militias and \noutlaws, including those working to sabotage the \npolitical process and undermine security and stability \nin Iraq and the region. \n The year\u2019s great successes for Iraq have brought \nprogress in its external relations. This year witnessed \nhigh-level visits from Arab, regional and other \ninternational Powers, many of which reopened their \nembassies in Baghdad. This has taken place within the \nframework of the Iraqi Government\u2019s efforts to restore \nits international standing. The Iraqi Government will \ncontinue to deepen its good-neighbour policy of \nfriendship and cooperation in order to restore its role in \nthe Arab, regional and international communities, and \nto promote security and stability in the region. \n The economic situation also saw significant \nimprovement through a number of economic and \nfinancial laws enacted by the Iraqi Government, which \nled to increased personal income, purchasing power \nand social welfare services for our citizens. The Iraqi \nGovernment prepared an ambitious budget for this \nyear, aiming not only at reconstruction, but also at \nbuilding a sound and healthy economy to promote \nprogress and general prosperity. The Iraqi Government \nhas reviewed this budget and its economic programmes \nin the light of the financial crisis facing the world. \n Improvements in the economic sphere have \nencouraged a significant number of internally and \nexternally displaced Iraqis to voluntarily return to the \ncountry. The Iraqi Government has taken a series of \npractical measures and decisions aimed at facilitating \nthe voluntary return of displaced Iraqis because it \nbelieves that the best solution for them is to return to \ntheir homeland. We therefore call upon States hosting \nIraqi refugees and on international and civil society \norganizations aiding refugees to help promote a culture \nof voluntary return, because Iraq needs the capacities \nof all Iraqis to help build the future of their country. \n \n \n25 09-52425 \n \n The most important challenge we face in the near \nfuture is the round of legislative elections scheduled \nfor January 2010, for which the political parties have \nalready started preparations. Successful elections will \nsolidify the current political regime\u2019s basis in \ndemocracy, pluralism and the peaceful transfer of \npower. Successful elections will move the political \nprocess forward from this initial stage to one of \npermanence and stability and will promote stability and \nsecurity in Iraq. They will also help us build national \ninstitutions strong enough to support a State that is \nbased on law and order, that is at peace with its own \npeople and its neighbours and that is a solid force for \nsecurity and stability in the region. This in turn will \nimprove Iraq\u2019s Arab, regional and world relations and \nfoster its active return to the international community. \n The real danger currently facing Iraq is outside \ninterference in its internal affairs. The forces of such \ninterference have committed the worst crimes against \ninnocent Iraqis from many segments of society \u2014 men, \nwomen, children and the elderly. In an attempt to derail \nthe security and stability achieved in Iraq during 2008 \nand 2009, they have recently engaged in a series of \ncriminal bombings and terrorist attacks, the most \nrecent of which were the Bloody Wednesday \nexplosions of 19 August 2009, which targeted the Iraqi \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance \u2014 \nsovereign institutions of the country. These attacks \nkilled many innocent victims, including many \nGovernment employees, as well as foreign \nadministrators and diplomats.  \n These criminal acts claiming such large numbers \nof victims have reached the level of genocide and \ncrimes against humanity, which are subject to \npunishment under international law. We believe that \nacts at this level of organization, complexity and \nmagnitude could not have been planned, funded and \nimplemented without the support of external forces and \nparties. Indeed, preliminary investigations and \nevidence indicate the involvement of external parties in \nthese attacks. \n Therefore, the Government of the Republic of \nIraq wishes to place this important matter before the \nSecretary-General. Because of the nature and scope of \nthe crimes committed, which require an investigation \nbeyond Iraq\u2019s jurisdiction, we request the Security \nCouncil to form an international independent \ninvestigation commission to refer those responsible to \na special international criminal court. The Iraqi \nGovernment found itself obliged to turn to the United \nNations to protect its people and stop the \nhaemorrhaging of innocent Iraqi lives. We seek the \ninternational community\u2019s support and assistance in \nestablishing an independent international commission \nto investigate the crimes of terrorism against the Iraqi \npeople and to label those crimes as genocide. \n We look forward to improved cooperation and \ncoordination with neighbouring countries and other \nconcerned States to protect Iraq\u2019s borders, exchange \ninformation, coordinate efforts, and to thwart groups \nthat support terrorism and work against Iraq under any \ncover. \n We are currently working towards the settlement \nof issues regarding Iraq vis-\u00e0-vis the Security Council; \nthese were inherited from the former regime and led to \ncommitments which we are attempting to meet. Iraq \nwill continue to work with relevant parties and \nstakeholders at the United Nations to reach a \nsettlement satisfactory to all parties and without \nprejudice to our obligations under Security Council \nresolutions. \n As a result of major positive developments that \nhave taken place in Iraq since the fall of the former \nregime and the removal of the dictatorship, the current \nsituation is fundamentally different from the situation \nthat existed when the Security Council adopted \nresolution 661 (1990). \n Along with the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1859 (2008) and the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral pursuant to paragraph 5 of that resolution \n(S/2009/385), this shows that the time has come for the \nSecurity Council to act in response to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report pursuant to the aforementioned \nresolution, and on the basis of its responsibility for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. It \nshould review resolutions relevant to Iraq adopted \nunder Chapter VII, starting with resolution 661 (1990), \nwith a view to restoring Iraq\u2019s international standing. \n Here, I must point out that since the collapse of \nthe former regime in 2003, Iraq has been eager to \nrespect international legitimacy and to deal with \nSecurity Council resolutions relevant to Iraq and to the \nsituation between Iraq and brotherly Kuwait with the \nhighest degree of responsibility and respect. \n The current Iraqi Government inherited political \nand financial burdens and difficult commitments from \n  \n \n09-52425 26 \n \nthe former regime through dozens of resolutions issued \nagainst the former regime because of its domestic \npractices and foreign policies. The Iraqi people are still \nbearing the consequences. After more than six years of \nhard and continuous work with the United Nations and \nits agencies, and within the framework of international \nand bilateral cooperation, Iraq has proven its desire and \ndetermination to return to the international community \nwith all its resources and capabilities. \n Therefore, because the situation which \nnecessitated the adoption of the aforementioned \nresolutions no longer exists, we request a clear \nresolution by the Security Council to terminate all \nresolutions issued under Chapter VII which affected \nthe sovereignty of Iraq and gave rise to financial \nobligations that are still binding on Iraq. \n We and the Iraqi people look forward to the day \nwhen Iraq is released from Chapter VII sanctions. In \nthis regard, I must point to the positive role of the \nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) \nin providing advice and assistance. The promotion of \nmutual endeavours and cooperation between Iraq and \nthe United Nations, and improved results of that \ncooperation in many fields, pursuant to Security \nCouncil resolution 1770 (2007) and other resolutions, \nrequire that the United Nations agencies and \ninstitutions step up their presence in Iraq, undertake \nfield activities and re-open their offices in Baghdad, as \nother diplomatic missions have done. \n The Iraqi Constitution sets the basic principles of \nIraq\u2019s foreign policy, which focus on good-\nneighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs \nof other countries, the peaceful settlement of disputes \nand establishing international relations based on \ncommon interests and respect of Iraq\u2019s international \nobligations. These are the established principles of \nIraq\u2019s foreign policy. \n On this basis, we seek to establish the best \npossible relations with other Arab and Islamic \ncountries and are committed to the decisions of the \nLeague of Arab States and the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference. Accordingly, we endorse and \nsupport the struggle of the Palestinian people to uphold \ntheir inalienable rights, including the right to establish \nthe State of Palestine on the land of Palestine. \n We are also working to implement the legitimate \ninternational resolutions concerning the return of \noccupied Arab land. We consider the Arab Peace \nInitiative to be a practical step in the right direction \ntowards resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict in order to \nachieve security, peace and stability in the Middle East. \nWe call for the Middle East to be made a zone free of \nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction, so as to promote opportunities to achieve \npeace and security in the region. \n In this context, we call upon all States that have \nnot yet acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty to do so and to be bound by its provisions. \nFollowing years of isolation during the previous \nregime, Iraq seeks to form a new integrated economic \npartnership with the international community through \nthe International Compact with Iraq. The Iraqi \nGovernment, in cooperation with the United Nations, is \nworking towards convening the second review \nconference, to be held in Baghdad next November. We \nwill seek the greatest degree of international \nparticipation at the conference, following on from the \nsuccess of the first review conference, held in \nStockholm last year. \n The current political process in Iraq is aimed at \nbuilding a federal, democratic and unified Iraq where \nthe Iraqi people work under constitutional institutions, \nthe rule of law, protection of human rights and full \nrespect for all segments of society. We attach key \nimportance to our ability and potential, as a country \nrich in natural and human resources, to achieve these \ngoals. \n However, at this most critical stage, we need \npolitical and economic support and international \ncooperation to gain firm footing that will enable us to \nmove towards a future where we will be able not only \nto develop our country and our people but also to \ncooperate with the international community in \nachieving peace, security and sustainable development \nfor all peoples.

        "file_text": "We have \nassembled once again to discuss the situation in the \nworld, outline the problems our countries face and \npresent our views on the world we live in. The \nPresident of the General Assembly has offered a topic \nfor discussion, one which, I would say, perfectly \nreflects current circumstances and the tasks arising \nfrom them. \n What kind of world are we discussing here? A \nglobalized world? By all means. An interconnected and \ninterdependent world? Without any doubt. A world of \ngreat discrepancies and major threats? Certainly. In \nbrief, our world is such that there are practically no \nlonger regional problems and crises, since each and \nevery issue, no matter how much it may appear to be \nregional, reveals itself as global in terms of its \nconsequences. \n Our world is still dominated by developed and \nmost developed countries; while developing countries \nare desperately lagging behind, struggling with hunger, \nthe inability to educate their citizens and the lack of \neven the most basic health care. Can we be content \nwith such a world? Without any hesitation, I respond \nthat, no, we cannot.  \n In our world there are many States as well as \ngroups that are united in their inclination to use terror \nas a means of action and to resort to force to achieve \ntheir goals. Admittedly, confrontation between the \nblocs no longer exists. A balance of fear between \nsuper-Powers is non-existent, but our world has hardly \nbecome more secure, while peace has hardly become \nmore stable. Can we be content with such a world? \nAgain, without any hesitation, I respond that, no, we \ncannot. \n Our world is ultimately still dominated by an \neconomic model that is self-evidently exhausted and \nhas now reached a stage where it is itself generating \ncrises and causing hardship to millions of people. If \none attempts to save that already obsolete model at any \ncost, and if one stubbornly defends a system based on \ngreed and devoid of any social value worth \n  \n \n09-52425 50 \n \nmentioning, there can be only one result: social unrest \nharbouring the potential to erupt into social insurgence \non a global scale. \n Can we accept such prospects? I respond with the \nutmost resolution that, no, we cannot, and must not. It \nis up to us to embark now upon the enormous task of \ncreating a new world order \u2014 not returning to anything \nthat existed before, but creating something new: an \norder that will in the end provide a life worthy of \nhumankind for each person and equal chances for all, \nand not one that writes off those who are in dire need \nthrough no fault of their own and those who at the end \nof their lives are viewed as useless and therefore \nunworthy of any support. \n It is up to us to dispel prejudices more resolutely \nthan ever before, to stand up to discrimination on \nwhatever grounds, to say no to intolerance and to \npromote not only the idea but also the practice of \nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations. That \nis the only way towards building global peace, security \nand development as vital preconditions for lasting and \nstable peace. \n Fortunately, the world has emerged from a \npotentially very dangerous period of unipolarism and is \nnow on a path towards multipolarism. However, the \nworld is still in the process of learning that only \ndialogue can help us to build mutual trust and \nunderstanding. It is not yet ready to face the fact that it \nis not a crime to be different and that our future can be \nfound only in unity through diversity \u2014 of course, \nunder the condition of full equality and strict \nobservance of human rights and in line with the United \nNations conventions.  \n With the simultaneous drift from unipolarism and \na shift towards multipolarism, we have to understand \nand accept that though we have established a set of \nuniversal values, we have not, will not and cannot \nestablish a single model of social and economic \nrelations applicable to all. The specific features of \nindividual nations and civilizations must be respected, \nsince there is no reason why anyone should renounce \nsomething that is part of his cultural or traditional \nheritage. \n Finally, a world characterized by international \npeace, security and development is not possible \nwithout disarmament, in particular without renouncing \nnuclear weapons. This was the topic of my address in \nthe Security Council this morning. I would like to \nmention in addition the notorious fact that problems of \ndevelopment would become minor if the huge funds \ncurrently allocated for armament were channelled into \ndevelopment. \n I reiterate: the task before us is enormous. Let us \nshow courage and political will to grapple with it. The \nRepublic of Croatia, although a small country, is ready \nto make its contribution. Although my ten-year term is \nnearing its end and this is the last time I stand at this \nrostrum, I will just say that I shall continue to place my \nskills at the service of achieving this noble goal."

        "file_text": "I \nshould like at the outset to express my sincerest \ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session. I also wish to express the thanks \nof the delegation of Paraguay to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, President of the Assembly at its sixty-third \nsession, for the progress made during his tenure.  \n I wish to begin by discussing what is most \nimportant: life. I cannot forget that, while the first \nparagraph of the preamble of the Charter of the United \nNations states that our peoples, gathered together, are \ndetermined to save succeeding generations from the \nscourge of war, the murderous onslaught of warplanes \nhas continued to kill, mutilate and traumatize children \nin many civilian populations; in national coffers, \namounts allocated to the death budget, glibly labelled \n\u201cdefence expenditures\u201d, continue to swell; and the \nmilitary industries of the world\u2019s most powerful \ncountries continue to reap the most lucrative benefits \nwithout any questions from politicians or any outrage \non the part of the international news networks, in a \ngame of perverse hypocrisy that is undermining our \nfuture with lies disguised as imposed truths. \n We are very rigorous in estimating the high \nglobal costs of containing and providing public health \ninsurance for pandemics such as H1N1 influenza. But \nwe forget that our \u201cdefence expenditures\u201d, promoted \nby the great weapons industries from high, snow-\ncovered summits of complacency, end up exchanging a \ncontainer of vaccine for a rifle or a significant part of \nthe public health budget for a warplane.  \n The United Nations was born to promote peace \nand to eradicate war. However, the voracious traffic in \n \n \n31 09-52425 \n \narms continues to pass through our countries with its \nconvoys of machine guns, missiles and grenades. \nSelect regions of the world continue to be opportunistic \nenclaves for the trade of the merchants of death. \nConflicts that mutilate, destroy and kill neighbours and \ncondemn them forever to disgrace are at the same time \nopportunities for those who profit by, foment, create \nand manage the business of war. \n Who questions the bloodstained bank notes that \nlie untouched in the vaults of the most powerful bank? \nWe are face to face in this Hall, but truly we, the \nGovernments of the countries of the world, rich, poor \nand very poor, are face to face with history. If we could \njust for one minute believe in the great tenets of \nequality and the shared rights of the human race, it \nwould be time enough to ask ourselves the question: \nHow much longer will the warlords continue to \nmaximize their future income on the physical \nelimination of human beings? \n My country, Paraguay, declares before the world \nthat we are absolutely committed to peace. My \nGovernment is not prepared to spend the cost of a loaf \nof bread on weapons or war machinery. Any \ninvestment in defence must be the bare minimum \ncompared to the social expenditures of the \nGovernment. Paraguay will not pawn its daily bread to \ndance the blind waltz of the warlords.  \n We believe that, in the context of globalization, \nthere should be a call for the creation of a new world \neconomic order capable of eliminating the sharp \ncontrasts of the present and the clearly unequal access \nto the benefits of contemporary development. In that \nrespect, I should like to describe the reality of life in \nParaguay today. Our situation is essentially very \nsimilar to that of other countries that are also at the \nmercy of serious socio-economic problems.  \n A little more than a year ago, a historic transition \noccurred in Paraguay that left our economy in \ntatters \u2014 with backward and obsolete production \nmechanisms, weak democratic institutions rife with \ncorruption, barely credible political parties and a lack \nof channels for civic participation in the \ndecision-making process. Society was riven by serious \ncontrasts, including about 40 per cent of the population \nliving in poverty, tens of thousands of unemployed, \nhigh levels of migration, and unscrupulous minorities \nwho lived well and sought to perpetuate their \nillegitimate privileges.  \n Those traits are shared by the majority of \ncountries represented here, which, over and above their \nindividual circumstances, like Paraguay are facing the \nthreefold challenge of modernizing their economies, \nstrengthening their participatory democracies, and \neliminating serious and severe social inequities. As in \nParaguay, in all poor countries the causes of the \nscourges we have suffered can be traced to the \nentrenchment of systems without justice or equality \nthat ultimately widen the gaps between the rich \ncountries and the poor. \n We have sought in vain to mask the failures of the \npolicies of recent decades with ostensibly technical \nterms that do little to describe the pathetic global \nreality. For example, we speak of least developed \ncountries, middle-income countries and developing \ncountries when the simple fact is that today we live in \na world where there are countries that benefit until they \ncan benefit no longer from world growth, while others \nare left behind and condemned to poverty. \n Since the United Nations was established, our \nunavoidable obligation has been to proceed fearlessly \nto change that reality. We must give serious thought to \na new world economic order with simple and specific \naims. First, we must promote and strengthen small \neconomies based on the fair and equitable distribution \nof the benefits of the production of wealth. We must \nput an end to inequitable trade relationships and \ndevelop effective policies of solidarity with those \ncountries that endure adverse geographical or climate \nconditions.  \n Secondly, we must promote the healthy political \ndevelopment of all nations of the world and ensure that \nthe most powerful countries do not interfere in local \naffairs, above all when these interventions seek to \ndestabilize genuine democratic processes. I would like \nto clearly reaffirm my concern over events in the \nbrotherly Republic of Honduras following the savage \ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat that opened a gaping wound in the heart of \nour regional democracy. \n Thirdly, we must promote peaceful solutions to \ninternational conflicts, firmly resolved to reduce the \nalarming levels of militarization and armament.  \n Fourthly, we must advocate an end to the harmful \ncriminal attacks on the environment, including global \nwarming and the natural disasters that occur with \nincreasing frequency. We the peoples of the South are \npaying the growing and unsustainable social, \n  \n \n09-52425 32 \n \nenvironmental and financial costs of climate change. In \nthe meantime, those States that bear greatest \nresponsibility for global warming are not shouldering \ntheir obligations or the growing socio-environmental \ndebt that they generate. They are perpetuating and \naggravating a clearly unjust situation that must be \nreversed. As a matter of justice and urgency, we must \nheed the calls of the most vulnerable people on the \nplanet.  \n Fifthly and finally, we must promote gender \nequality and put an end to discrimination of all kinds \nbased on sexual, political or ideological preferences or \nracial, ethnic or religious differences. In sum, it is a \nmatter of developing a better and more humane world \non the way towards a kinder living environment that is \nmore supportive and much more in keeping with the \nfuture of humankind.  \n I am fully aware of the scope of the challenge \nthat I am suggesting. I am also completely aware of the \ndifficulties that we will encounter in this epic fight, but \nin the twenty-first century we cannot continue to \noverlook an in-depth and open debate on realities of \nconcern. \n I do not in any way underestimate the relevant \nrole that the United Nations has played in its relatively \nshort existence in promoting world peace and equitable \nsocial development, but we must not ignore the \ndecades of failure with regard to comprehensive \nmodernization, much less fail to creatively and \nresolutely make use of the greatest world forum of \ntoday. \n There is no time to lose. Historical justice and \nredress of the rich countries to the poor ones must be a \npriority on the agenda of the United Nations. In order \nfor the United Nations to meet that important goal, we \nmust support the General Assembly\u2019s adoption of the \nnecessary reforms, so as to reaffirm its inherent nature \nas a representative, democratic and equitable organ. We \nmust uphold the precedence of its bodies over other \ninternal organs of the Organization, such as the \nSecurity Council, in order to underscore the processes \nthat will help build that greatly desired social justice. \n The Security Council, as the organ entrusted with \nthe maintenance of world peace, must also be \nreformed, not only so as to give it greater legitimacy \nby increasing its representativeness, but also so as to \nadopt new working methods to reflect a new \nmulti-centred world order, founded on relations of \ncooperation, solidarity and peace, in which the \ncommunity and human dignity are at the centre of \nevery decision.  \n It is difficult to say this in such a hallowed Hall \nbut it is worth recalling that, at this very moment, \nthousands of people are dying of hunger in the world \nthat we shape. The ease with which television news \nswitches between pictures of pitiful children \noverpowered by appalling hunger and figures for the \nbrutal arms business of the industrialized countries \nexposes human indifference.  \n Once and for all, we must believe in \u2014 and \ncreate \u2014 a different planet that is able to retrieve its \nvast natural wealth, having put an end to the terrible \nhavoc wrought by petty interests. We must believe in a \nfairer and more balanced international economic \nsystem, in which the huge discrepancies are a thing of \nthe past. I believe in the great solidarity of human \nbeings. I believe in the dreams of great leaders who \ndefiantly changed the world. I believe in Jesus Christ, \nin Gandhi and in Martin Luther King. \n Before ending my comments, I would like to take \nthis opportunity to set out some clear positions on \npressing matters that affect us. \n First, I would like to say that the economic crisis \nthat began in the major Powers and spread worldwide \nhas had serious consequences in all countries. It has \nbrought about a rapid destruction of accumulated \nwealth. Unemployment has risen to unprecedented \nlevels. The number of poor has increased. The crisis \nhas jeopardized dozens of democratic political \nprocesses.  \n Secondly, I would like to resolutely state that the \nviolent rupture in the constitutional process in \nHonduras is a tremendous setback for the \nre-democratization of Latin America. Those involved \nin the coup who dealt a resounding blow to the \nhonourable face of the continent\u2019s democracy are \nresponsible for the human sacrifices and the \ntremendous social unrest that is taking place. I would \nlike to state my explicit solidarity and that of my \npeople with Manuel Zelaya and the people of \nHonduras, who are bravely standing up to the effects of \nthe coup. \n Thirdly, I would ask the peoples and the \nGovernments represented here to vigorously condemn \nthe trade embargo that the largest economy in the \n \n \n33 09-52425 \n \nworld imposes on Cuba \u2014 another intolerable chapter \nthat, while it lasts, undermines the credibility of any \ndiscussion on pluralism, tolerance and humanism in \nthese forums. We have complete faith in a new vision \nthat breaks with the past and its uncompromising \ndivisions. We believe that the hopes of Latin America \nand the Caribbean with regard to the humanistic \napproach towards Cuba of the new leadership of the \nmost powerful country on Earth will be met sooner \nthan later. \n Fourthly and lastly, I would like to state open \nconcern about the sinister currents circling in the world \nwith the unbridled arms race that can in no way be \njustified and can only be welcomed by the industries of \ndeath and barbarity. We must defuse the tensions that \nfoster that interest in weapons and we must urgently \nclarify the elements that obscure the prospect for peace \nthroughout the world.  \n I reaffirm the commitment of my small and \nhumble country to supporting any and all initiatives \nthat seek to build a better world for future generations."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \ndelegation of the Kingdom of Thailand, I should like to \nextend to you, Mr. President, our sincere \ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. You \nmay rest assured of the full support and cooperation of \nmy delegation. \n We live in one of the most challenging times in \nour history. As in the period before the founding of the \nUnited Nations more than 60 years ago, the world is \nagain facing great challenges. Conflicts and tensions \nremain in many parts of the world; terrorists attack; \npoverty, disease and hunger still affect many; our \nsupply of traditional sources of energy is dwindling; \nand climate change is transforming the very \nenvironment in which we all live. Added to this set of \nissues, the current global financial crisis makes for a \nfuture that seems bleak. But, like our forebears more \nthan 60 years ago, we also live in hope for a better \nfuture. And a large part of this hope today rests upon \nthe United Nations. \n Despite criticism, we must never doubt the fact \nthat the world has been better off with the United \nNations than it would have been without it. I say this \nbecause overcoming the challenges we have faced and \nare facing demands multilateral cooperation. The \nUnited Nations has been the bedrock of such \nmultilateral cooperation, as well as what the great poet \nLord Tennyson termed a \u201cparliament of man\u201d. And it is \nthis parliament of man which provides a forum in \nwhich we can meet and discuss remedies to common \nchallenges, as well as respond to the concerns of our \nconstituents \u2014 the citizens of the world. \n In the interdependent and interconnected world, \nno one nation, not even the biggest and the most \npowerful, can go it alone. But at the same time, no \nsingle nation should be left behind in our pursuit of \npeace, prosperity and the protection of human rights. \nJust as we join hands to face common challenges, we \nmust also extend our hand to those less fortunate, pull \nthem towards a brighter future and give them the \nopportunity to enjoy the fruits of globalization.  \n Thailand stands ready to extend a helping hand. \nWe stand ready to share our experiences and the \nlessons we have learned from our own financial crisis \nin 1997. We believe that our nation\u2019s remedies to our \nproblems can be shared and should contribute to the \nformulation of international remedies to common \nglobal challenges. Central to our belief is that peace, \nsecurity, development and human rights are intertwined \nand must reinforce each other so that all three pillars \nare sustainable. This view is also central to the United \nNations. \n Thailand believes that moderation is the key to \nsustainability. We want to see moderation instead of \nexcessive greed, which is the cause of the economic \ncrisis; we want to see moderation instead of \noverconsumption, which is the cause of environmental \ndegradation; and we want to see moderation instead of \nextremism and selfishness, which are the causes of \nconflicts around the world. We must therefore curb our \nexcesses, live within our means and use our resources \nwisely. \n This idea of moderation is an important pillar of \nthe \u201csufficiency economy\u201d philosophy of His Majesty \nthe King. This philosophy should not be understood or \nmisunderstood as advocating an inward-looking \napproach. Rather, it teaches us that economic \ndevelopment and modernization must be better \nbalanced and take into account the well-being of the \npeople and their economic, social, political and \n  \n \n09-52586 6 \n \nenvironmental needs, so that the country is resilient \nand protected from both external and internal shocks. \n His Majesty himself has applied his philosophy in \npractice, initiating numerous royal projects for the \nbetterment of his people and country. His Majesty has \nbeen rightly regarded by the international community \nas the \u201cdevelopment King\u201d. His Majesty received the \nUnited Nations Development Programme Human \nDevelopment Lifetime Achievement Award in \nrecognition of his achievements as well as of his \nsufficiency economy philosophy, which has gained \nincreasing resonance worldwide. And many of His \nMajesty\u2019s projects are being replicated in many parts of \nthe world. \n The recent global financial crisis has shown that \nsufficiency economy is not merely a philosophy, but \ncan also be translated into concrete action. Due to the \nlessons learned from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, \nmost of Thailand\u2019s financial institutions have escaped \nthe direct impact of the current crisis, thanks to their \nmore prudent style of investment. Entrepreneurs have \nmanaged to weather the storm through rational \ndecision-making and more careful risk management, \ntwo of the key principles advocated by His Majesty\u2019s \nphilosophy. \n My Government\u2019s socio-economic policy is \nguided by His Majesty\u2019s philosophy, which has been \nincorporated into our national economic and social \ndevelopment plan. Development for us is not just about \nthe rate of growth, but also about the quality of that \ngrowth. Not only have we boosted Government \nspending and investment to jumpstart the economy, but \nwe have also set up social safety nets, made \neducational reform a priority and upgraded our health \nand welfare services. \n We have prioritized investment programmes and \naction plan to increase strength and to provide greater \neconomic opportunities for people at grass-roots level. \nWe have also laid the foundation for long-term growth \nand competitiveness in Thailand\u2019s various sectors, \nincluding agriculture, health care, education and \ntourism. In short, we have made Thailand\u2019s \ndevelopment a people-centred approach and Thailand\u2019s \neconomy more immune from external shocks. \n As the Chair of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), Thailand has led regional \nefforts to address today\u2019s financial crisis and to create \nimmunity for East Asia as a whole. We are expediting \nthe multilateralization process of the Chiang Mai \nInitiative, under the ASEAN+3 framework, comprising \nASEAN member States, China, Japan and the Republic \nof Korea. The aim of this exercise is to build regional \nfinancial stability through a region-wide self-help \nsubstantive reserve pooling arrangement. This will \ncome into effect very soon. As a region, we have also \ncontinued to liberalize trade and reject all forms of \nprotectionism. We believe that these efforts can serve \nas examples for other regions to follow. \n Today\u2019s financial woes affect not only a nation\u2019s \neconomy but also the development and welfare of its \npeople. This crisis exacerbates the problems that \nalready exist, such as poverty, hunger and energy \nshortages. Nowhere is this more strongly felt than in \nthe developing world, and Thailand is no exception. \nAlthough we have already attained the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in hunger and poverty alleviation, \nmuch remains to be done. Thailand understands well \nthe challenges developing countries are facing and is \nprepared to share with others our experiences in \nmanaging and overcoming these challenges. \n As a major agricultural economy, Thailand stands \nready to contribute to the solution of the world food \nand energy crises. We are a major food exporter with \nstrong experience and capability in developing \nalternative energy, especially biodiesel and ethanol. We \naim to ensure a balance between growing energy and \nfood crops so that both needs are sufficiently \naddressed. \n Another pressing concern that can only be \nsuccessfully tackled through global cooperation is \nclimate change. My Government is convinced that the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange is the core for international negotiations and \ncooperation in this area, guided by the principles of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities and \nrespective capabilities. \n In this connection, Thailand is honoured to host \nthe United Nations climate change talks which will \ntake place next week in Bangkok. We will spare no \neffort in ensuring that this round of negotiations will \nmake tangible progress towards a successful \nCopenhagen Climate Change Conference in December. \n Earlier this week, the Secretary-General \nconvened the Summit on Climate Change. We welcome \nthe commitments expressed by major economies during \nthe Summit, in particular in setting clear goals and \n \n \n7 09-52586 \n \ntargets for their action. I am also pleased to see the \nGroup of 20 pledging itself to spare no effort to \nachieve a successful outcome in Copenhagen. \n For its part, my Government has vigorously \npursued environmentally friendly growth. That is why \nwe have announced alternative energy as our national \nagenda and invested significantly to boost development \nin this field, including in energy crops. Moreover, one \nof Thailand\u2019s hallmarks is its strong biodiversity, from \nwhich Thailand and its local communities have drawn \nbenefits through innovative economic activities and \nproducts. While we seek to benefit fully from our rich \nbiodiversity and natural resources, we also aim to \nensure that they are sustainable, regenerated and \nreplenished. \n It is not enough to ensure that the economic needs \nof the people are met. Their political needs are just as \nimportant. And there is no better political system than \ndemocracy to ensure the people\u2019s freedoms and rights. \nIt is my Government\u2019s clear policy to sow the seeds of \nsustainable democracy by strengthening our democratic \ninstitutions, engaging civil society, ensuring human \nrights and promoting good governance and the rule of \nlaw. Democracy is not just about majority rule, but also \nabout respect for minority rights. \n At the regional level, under Thailand\u2019s \nchairmanship, ASEAN has made great strides towards \nmaking people the centre of the organization\u2019s \ndevelopment, as enshrined in the ASEAN Charter. \nHuman rights issues are now at the forefront of \nASEAN\u2019s agenda. Collectively, we have played an \nactive role to create the ASEAN Intergovernmental \nCommission on Human Rights, which becomes active \nthis October. We are committed to doing our utmost to \nensure that that body fully lives up to expectations. \n Promotion of gender equality and the \nempowerment of women are also important to \nThailand. Besides our national effort on this matter, I \nam pleased to add that ASEAN is also in the process of \nestablishing an ASEAN commission on the promotion \nand protection of the rights of women and children. \nThis mechanism will play an important part in \nenhancing and strengthening the ASEAN human rights \nframework as a whole. \n At the international level, Thailand is party to \ncore international human rights conventions, and we \nare strongly committed to the principles enshrined in \nthe 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \nThailand\u2019s candidature for a seat on the Human Rights \nCouncil for the 2010-2013 term is further testament to \nour commitment to enhance human rights \ninternationally. \n Thailand has consistently rendered humanitarian \nassistance to those in plight wherever they may be. We \nhave steadfastly contributed to the World Food \nProgramme. We have offered our helping hand to those \nin need. Our humanitarian commitment was clearly \nevident during Cyclone Nargis that befell Myanmar, as \nThailand became the logistics hub for the massive \ninternational relief effort for that country. \n Sustainable economic, political and social \ndevelopment is not a mere goal in itself. It ultimately \nensures long-lasting peace and security. That is why \nASEAN is moving towards becoming not only a \npolitical-security community but also an economic and \nsociocultural one by 2015. These three pillars reinforce \neach other. Within this political-security community, \nThailand and its fellow ASEAN members are ready to \nenhance cooperation, from dispute settlement to \nconflict resolution and from peacekeeping to post-\nconflict peacebuilding, especially with regard to \ncooperation on training for emergency preparedness \nand humanitarian assistance. We hope that our regional \nefforts will help contribute to peace and security not \nonly regionally, but also internationally. \n Thailand itself has played a significant role in \npeacekeeping operations worldwide. In the past two \ndecades, Thailand has provided nearly 20,000 military \ntroops, police officers and civilian staff in support of \nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions on all \ncontinents around the globe, including Cambodia, \nTimor-Leste, Burundi and, soon, Darfur. We will \ncontinue to do so where our contributions can \nstrengthen the overall capacity of the United Nations. \n As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, \nThailand also strongly believes in building the right \nsocio-economic and political conditions for sustainable \npeace in countries emerging from conflict and internal \nstrife. We can play a greater role in ensuring \ninternational peace and security. That is why Thailand \nhas presented its candidature for a non-permanent seat \non the Security Council for the period 2017-2018. As a \nmedium-sized developing country, we can represent the \ninterests and concerns of developing countries not only \nin Asia, but worldwide. \n  \n \n09-52586 8 \n \n Over the past four days, we have heard \nstatements, one after another, which seem to point \ntowards one conclusion, that is, that we are living in a \n\u201cchallenging period\u201d. And perhaps it is a period in \nwhich multilateralism is once again being put to the \ntest. But we also have before us a historic opportunity \nto act together to right our past wrongs and to make the \nright decisions for the future. How we act today is \npurely our choice \u2014 a choice that will be judged by \nour children tomorrow and our grandchildren in years \nto come. \n Our forefathers chose to establish the United \nNations over six decades ago. We must now make sure \nthat the United Nations \u2014 a symbol of true \nmultilateralism \u2014 continues to be relevant, efficient \nand effective in responding to the evolving challenges \nas well as in ensuring development, freedom, human \nrights, and peace for all. In that regard, we support \nUnited Nations reform that will lead us towards those \ngoals. \n Let us use our gathering here to remind ourselves \nof what the United Nations stands for. And let us seize \nthis opportunity together to lay down a stronger \nfoundation for a new era of peace and prosperity for \nhumankind. "

        "file_text": "\nWith great pleasure I extend heartfelt congratulations \nto my brother, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki, Secretary of African Union Affairs of the Libyan \nArab Jamahiriya, on his unanimous election to the high \noffice of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfourth session. His extensive diplomatic experience \nand intimate knowledge of the United Nations will \nundoubtedly enable him to conduct the work of this \nsession with great effectiveness. \n I wish also to put on record my appreciation for \nthe efforts of the former President of the General \nAssembly, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann of \nNicaragua, for his able stewardship of the sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly and for the many \nenlightened proposals he made during his tenure to \nenhance and develop the Organization. \n My highest appreciation also goes to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless \nefforts to enhance the purposes and principles of the \nCharter and to promote the role of the Organization \nand enhance its efficiency in coping with new \ndevelopments and responding to the emerging needs of \nour peoples. \n Our belief in open-mindedness, tolerance, \ndiversity, non-violence and rejection of extremism \nrequires us first to free our minds of egoism and \nprejudice in order to replace conflict with dialogue, \ndisagreements with consensus and violence with \npersuasion, thus broadening our alliances and outreach \nefforts. We must exert greater efforts to show tolerance \ntowards those who do not necessarily share our values \nand ideas. Indeed, certain philosophical or \nargumentative issues can be tackled and resolved only \nif each party is open to the other, willing to coexist \nwith the other and ready to resist preconceived ideas \nand stereotypes. The presence of common ground and \nof mutual understanding can help to create a more \nprogressive and creative world and hence more secure, \nbased on tolerance, constructive dialogue and human \ncoexistence.  \n While the world has become a small village as \ndistances have been effectively abolished thanks to \ntechnological advances and the communications \nrevolution that has erased barriers and frontiers, it is \nstill dominated by political antagonisms, as States \ncontinue to pursue conflicting individual interests. This \nrequires us all to design pragmatic strategies for the \nfuture that safeguard everyone\u2019s interests. That can be \nachieved only through mindsets capable of assimilating \nthese transformations and processing them to serve \nhumanity and to ensure international security and \nstability.  \n It is clear that global security cannot be achieved \nthrough the sole efforts of the super-Powers, because \nthe challenges we face are more serious, daunting and \nmore widespread than ever before. This requires a \nbroader global alliance of United Nations Member \nStates as well as the support of the entire United \nNations system in the interest of the international \ncommunity as a whole. At the same time, it requires \nnational strategies to address the challenges, problems \nand issues through close and sustained coordination \namong nations. The task that burdens us today requires \nthat we discuss all the issues threatening our world, \nwhile taking into account the historical background and \nthe particular values, ideas and traditions of our \nrespective societies. At the same time, each party must \nbe ready to understand and appreciate the positions and \ncharacteristics of the other and be ready to collectively \nfight hatred and prejudice. \n The Kingdom of Bahrain has always been a \nmelting pot of diverse civilizations, cultures, religions \nand races and since time immemorial has adopted the \nconcept of tolerance and openness towards the other \nand coexistence; thus, we firmly believe that finding \ncommon ground between universal civilizations and \ncultures and building a culture of peace among peoples \nis necessary. In that context, the peaceful settlement of \nconflicts is deeply rooted in our values and our \ntraditions, which are guided by the principles of our \nIslamic faith.  \n The Arab-Israeli conflict of the past six decades \nhas had a great effect on our generation. It is a sad \nlegacy that has left behind misery and human suffering, \npoisoned international and regional relations and \ncontinues periodically to exacerbates tension, violence \nand military confrontation in the Middle East. We have \ntried repeatedly and in vain to find a solution to this \nchronic conflict. To be sure, one conference after \nanother has been held, and initiative has followed \ninitiative. But we have been unable to deliver our \nmessage to the minds, hearts and homes of the people \nof the region. That is the essence of the proposal that \nHis Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, \nCrown Prince of the Kingdom of Bahrain, presented in \nhis article published in The Washington Post on \n  \n \n09-52598 14 \n \n16 July, which makes a meaningful contribution to the \nadoption of a pragmatic approach to ending the \nconflict. His Highness wrote: \n \u201cOur biggest mistake has been to assume that you \ncan simply switch peace on like a light bulb. The \nreality is that peace is a process, contingent on a \ngood idea but also requiring a great deal of \ncampaigning \u2014 patiently and repeatedly targeting \nall relevant parties.\u201d \nCareful examination of this argument reveals the \ncorrect approach to addressing the Arab-Israeli \nconflict, namely, directly and expeditiously \ncommunicating our Arab Peace Initiative to the Israeli \npeople through their own information and news media. \nIn so doing, we will be in a better position to explore \nthe path to peace. \n Today, wisdom requires that we use available \ncommunications and media technology prudently and \nwith awareness in order to establish the channels and \nstructures that will enable us as leaders, Governments \nand civil society to establish the will and momentum \nnecessary to create an environment conducive to \nadvancing the peace that we aspire to. Because today, \ndialogue has become an omnipresent issue on the \nglobal agenda of the United Nations and other \ninternational forums, as shown by the many ongoing \ndialogues, including the dialogue among civilizations, \ndialogue of cultures and the interfaith dialogue. All \nthese processes aim at enhancing peaceful coexistence \nbetween nations and peoples and represent the \nprincipal course of action to eliminate the causes of \nconflict, tension and discord.\n The Middle East peace process requires that we \nall exert greater political and diplomatic efforts in \norder to achieve the two-State solution \u2014 Israel and \nPalestine \u2014 as part of a comprehensive and just \nsettlement based on equal security for all the nations of \nthe Middle East region. We believe that the failure to \nend this conflict is due simply to the lack of a \nmethodology based on justice and balance and to the \nabsence of a binding implementation mechanism. We \nare all aware that the Arab side went to great lengths to \nmake it clear that it supports peace as an irreversible \nstrategic option.  \n The Arab Peace Initiative unequivocally \nconfirmed that position. We therefore expect the \ninternational community, and particularly the most \ninfluential leading Powers, to exert effective pressure \non Israel to freeze and eventually dismantle all \nsettlements established in the territories occupied in \n1967, to ensure demarcation of the borders of the \nPalestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital, \npeacefully coexisting with Israel, and to withdraw from \nall the occupied Syrian Golan and Lebanese territories, \nin conformity with the relevant resolutions of \ninternational legitimacy and the requirements of the \nRoad Map and the Arab Peace Initiative. \n Here I would like to commend the speech of \nPresident Barack Obama, delivered from this very \nrostrum, which we consider a frame of reference for \nthe resumption of the Middle East peace process. \nPresident Obama explicitly affirmed the need to \nrelaunch negotiations on final status issues \u2014 notably, \nsecurity for both Israelis and Palestinians, boundaries, \nrefugees and Jerusalem \u2014 rejected the continued \nillegitimate Israeli settlement activity in Palestinian \nterritories and called for the creation of a contiguous \nand viable Palestinian State. \n Among the other challenges and concerns \nconfronting our region is the question of nuclear \nproliferation in the Middle East and the Gulf region. \nThe Iranian nuclear programme is undoubtedly among \nthe causes for this common concern; nonetheless, it \nshould be dealt with in such a way as to spare our \nregion the threat of confrontation. This can best be \nachieved through diplomatic means. It is in that spirit \nthat the Kingdom of Bahrain, pursuant to Security \nCouncil resolution 1887 (2009), renews its call on the \ninternational community to actively work towards \nmaking the Middle East, including the Gulf region, a \nzone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of \nmass destruction, thus ensuring the security and well-\nbeing of the peoples of the region and the world at \nlarge, and to call upon Israel to accede to the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty in order to achieve its \nuniversality. All nuclear facilities and activities in the \nMiddle East should be placed under International \nAtomic Energy Agency safeguards, while \nacknowledging the legitimate right of States to possess \nnuclear technology for peaceful uses in the areas where \nit has become vital for development and the \ndiversification of energy sources, in conformity with \nrelevant international agreements. \n \n \n15 09-52598 \n \n Other important regional issues are also a matter \nof concern to us. Foremost among these is the situation \nin brotherly Iraq, whose sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity it is important to affirm, while not interfering \nin its internal affairs. We should also condemn all \nterrorist activities perpetrated against Iraq with a view \nto destabilizing its security and rekindling sectarian \nhatred there. \n Also, in order to build confidence between the \nMember States of the Gulf Cooperation Council and \nIran, it is imperative to reach a settlement on the \nquestion of the occupied islands belonging to the \nUnited Arab Emirates, through either direct \nnegotiations or referral to the International Court of \nJustice. We also reaffirm the need for joint \ninternational and regional efforts to assist brotherly \nYemen, under the supervision of the United Nations, in \ncoping with the heavy refugee burden and focusing on \nits development efforts and the restoration of security \nand stability throughout its territory. Similarly, we \nstress the importance of preserving peace, stability and \nunity in the brotherly Sudan and we look forward to \nthe cooperation of all relevant parties to resolve the \nDarfur issue and to achieve the desired peace. \n We urge the international community to shoulder \nits responsibilities regarding security in Somalia, \nwhose internal troubles and fragile central Government \nhave led to the spread of maritime piracy in the Gulf of \nAden and the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, much to the \ndetriment of international navigation and trade. Also, \nthe Kingdom of Bahrain once again reaffirms its \nconsistent position concerning the sovereignty of the \nbrotherly Kingdom of Morocco over the its entire \nnational territory and calls on the international \ncommunity to support the negotiation process initiated \nby the Security Council, to maintain its momentum and \nactivate it. \n With peace and development the twin concerns of \nour world, it is only natural to feel frustration in the \nface of the prevailing environmental degradation, \npandemics, desertification, poverty, water scarcity, \ndepletion of the ozone layer, climate change and the \nworld financial crisis. These challenges represent an \nimminent threat both to our life now and to that of \nfuture generations. It is therefore no overstatement to \nsay that in the twenty-first century our destinies are \nintertwined, and that we need to redouble our \ncollective efforts to address these universal dangers \nthat daily threaten humanity and its health, food and \nsecurity. \n In this regard, the Kingdom of Bahrain, in \ncooperation with the United Nations and in the \npresence of the Secretary-General, hosted in May the \nlaunch of the 2009 Global Assessment Report on \nDisaster Risk Reduction. The report deals with issues \npertaining to the protection of lives and property in \nnatural disaster situations related to global warming, \nearthquakes, floods and rising sea levels. We hope that \nthe major industrial countries will play a key role in \nforging an agreement at December\u2019s Copenhagen \nClimate Change Conference, with a view to curbing \nharmful greenhouse gas emissions. It is our hope that \nthe necessary political will can be mustered to respond \nto this threat to humanity and to make our world safer \nand more sustainable. \n In this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain, in its \ncapacity as a small island developing State, wishes to \nexpress great concern at the evident causal relation \nbetween climate change and rising sea levels, which \nposes a serious threat to our world. We are in \nagreement with the other small island developing \nStates in their concern over the adverse impact of the \nincrease in average global temperature. \n In conclusion, the gravity that characterizes our \npresent session, as exemplified by the responsible \ndiscussions in the first week, notably at the  \n22 September Summit on Climate Change and the  \n24 September Security Council summit (see S/PV.6181), \nreconfirms our need to return to the spirit of the \nCharter: that the United Nations is the principal forum \nfor multilateral cooperation to address a wide range of \ncontemporary issues. The United Nations as an \ninstitution is not limited merely to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. Rather, it is the \nprincipal forum for the coordination of positions and \nefforts aimed at addressing the challenges threatening \nhuman beings and their environment, alleviating \npoverty, controlling pandemics and settling conflicts \nand wars through dialogue, negotiations and other \npeaceful means in a world guided by tolerance, \npeaceful coexistence and security for current and future \ngenerations."

        "file_text": "I must first \napologize for the absence of our head of Government, \nMr. Jaume Bartumeu Cassany, who, due to his \ninstitutional agenda, is unable to attend the general \ndebate. \n It is a great honour for the Principality of Andorra \nand the Government that I represent to speak in the \nGeneral Assembly Hall. We Andorrans are well aware \nof the significance of being a small State within the \nUnited Nations. We are not trying to make our mark on \ninternational politics, but we want to make clear our \nintention to respect and defend international law, \nstandards of good-neighbourly relations and the \nprinciple of solidarity between peoples. \n Europe is our natural frame of reference. We wish \nto be recognized in that way, not only in terms of \ncultural and historical affinity, but also in the legal and \neconomic fields. In brief, our conception of solidarity, \nboth domestic and international, and our notion of \ninternational relations are the same as those of the rest \nof Europe. \n Since 1993, we have had a constitutional framework \nthat allows us to translate all those principles into practice \nand to make them a reality. Supported by that \nconstitutional framework, on 10 August we presented a \nlaw for the exchange of information on fiscal matters, \nwhich, once debated and amended, was approved by \nthe parliament on 7 September. \n We have always been certain of Andorra\u2019s loyalty \nto the international community. Yet we thought it \nappropriate to dispel any doubts and to follow the \nrecommendations of the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development (OECD) and other \ninternational institutions, as expressed in meetings of \nthe Group of 20. \n That is the first example, but others will follow, \nbecause our Government\u2019s priority is to dispel any \ndoubts about our determination to adapt to the demands \nand expectations of our European neighbours and the \n \n \n49 09-52592 \n \nrest of the international community. We are convinced \nthat this and other steps will be appreciated and \nunderstood by all international stakeholders that may at \nany time have harboured doubts about our community \nspirit towards the rest of the world. We are also \nconfident that this new era will enable us to interact \nmore with Europe and other continents by \nstrengthening our international bonds and our \neconomic and human presence. \n In line with that legislation, our country has \nalready been in contact, and even signed agreements, \nwith some European countries. In the future, we will \ndo likewise with other countries, including the United \nStates of America, Australia and Argentina. Needless to \nsay, our priority has been to negotiate with France, \nSpain and Portugal, which are our closest neighbours. \n Incidentally, I would add that Andorra has \nsuffered from a lingering structural crisis for at least \nthe past four years. This has now been exacerbated by \nthe world economic crisis. The world cannot solve our \nparticular crisis for us. We must do it for ourselves. To \nconcentrate on the idea that interests us, I assure the \nGeneral Assembly that our Government\u2019s action \nfocuses on clearly demonstrating to the international \ncommunity that we are fulfilling our duties. We very \nmuch wish to cooperate, promote international ties and \ninstil confidence. \n The exchange of tax information will undoubtedly \nresult in the signing of double-taxation agreements. As a \nresult, we will boost our relations with countries with \nwhich previous links were somewhat weak. Indeed, is that \nnot one of the founding objectives of the United Nations? \n The legislation to which I have referred addresses \nissues that have been at the heart of OECD discussions \nfor the past few months. It will affect requests for \ninformation launched after the entry into force of tax-\ninformation exchange agreements or double-taxation \nagreements. \n Let us be clear, tax havens and fiscal opacity, \nwhich have been identified and condemned as two of \nthe major financial evils of the twentieth century, are \nmatters that all Andorrans would like to overcome \nsoon. Our strategic position is clear, and our \ncommitment is strong. \n At the same time, we are proposing a tax reform \nthat will allocate resources according to priorities that \nserve the general interest and provide guarantees to \nEurope and to the rest of the world that we want clear, \ntransparent and accountable relations. That reform will \noffer entrepreneurs and professionals an opportunity to \nexport goods and services from Andorra on an equal \nfooting. Only then will international companies \nseriously consider the possibility of investing in \nAndorra within a stable juridical environment. \n I sincerely hope that there will be no doubts \nabout my Government\u2019s desire to face the economic \nissues that have been at the heart of international \ndebates over the past few months. The need to move \nforward towards greater financial transparency in \nAndorra leads us to expect the same standards from the \ninternational community. We have understood and \nnoted that the system that governed the world economy \nin the twentieth century has become obsolete. \n International organizations and every political, \neconomic and social institution must make efforts to \nguarantee transparency. We believe that reform of the \ninternational economic system should be immediate, \nrigorous and credible. It should be led by the United \nNations, in close cooperation with the World Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Trade \nOrganization. \n However, in order to face that and other \nchallenges, we need to modernize the Organization, \nrevitalize the General Assembly and reform the \nSecurity Council. In our opinion, those objectives, \nalong with so-called system-wide coherence, must \ninclude the right to gender equality. \n We in Andorra thus understand that we need fair, \nclear and internationally recognized standards and \nregulations to instil confidence in Andorran \nentrepreneurs and employees alike. But we should also \nconsider the demands of the international financial \nsituation and the need to promote transparency and \nregulatory mechanisms for financial activities. \n Solving the international financial crisis is one of \nour main priorities. There should be no doubt about \nthat. However, we need to tackle other issues affecting \nthe international community. I am referring to climate \nchange. As has already been mentioned in the \nAssembly Hall, this is one of the most serious \nchallenges humankind has ever faced. \n We in the Principality of Andorra recognize the \nefforts of the United Nations to try to mobilize the \ninternational community. As French head of State and \n  \n \n09-52592 50 \n \nCo-Prince of Andorra Nicolas Sarkozy reminded us \nhere (see ), it is time that each State make a \nstrong commitment to solving this issue. Andorra\u2019s \ncommitment to combating the effects of climate change \nis real. Progress can already be seen in such efforts as \nour ratification of the Convention for the Protection of \nthe Ozone Layer. \n We hope that at Copenhagen in December it will \nbe possible to adopt a new climate agreement that is \nequitable, efficient and ambitious from a scientific \npoint of view. We believe that, to achieve a positive \nresult at the Conference, it is essential to involve all \nsociety, especially younger generations. \n We believe health to be a fundamental right that \nis necessary to achieve sustainable development in \nEurope and throughout the world. We face new \nchallenges in the health sector. The new influenza virus \nis one such challenge. The Andorran Government has \ndecided to fight it by making vaccination available to \nthe majority of our population. That decision was taken \nin cooperation with our neighbours and the World \nHealth Organization. On another matter, the \nPrincipalities of Monaco and Andorra have joined \nforces to finance a four-year project to reduce the \nvulnerability of women of reproductive age stemming \nfrom the food crisis affecting Madagascar. Those are \ntwo examples of fruitful and successful cooperation \nbetween international actors. \n The responsibility to protect populations against \ngenocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes \nagainst humanity serves to remind us once again of the \nneed for responsible cooperation. Neither world \nPowers nor mid-sized and small countries can abandon \ncooperation. We all are necessary, because we all are \ninhabitants of the Earth."

        "file_text": "My \nparticipation in this general debate, like that of more \nthan 100 heads of State and Government, confirms \nboth the seriousness of the choices we must make in \nthe face of the challenges confronting our States and \nthe unavoidable role of the United Nations in deciding \non the future of our planet and its inhabitants. \n More than ever before, the General Assembly \nmust be the \u201ccentre for harmonizing the actions of \nnations\u201d in the attainment of the common ends defined \nin Article 1 of the Charter. To remain the vital centre, \nthe Organization and its most representative body of \nthe community of nations \u2014 our General Assembly \u2014 \nmust better take into consideration the interdependence \nthat links our destinies and the opportunity presented to \nour sovereign States to bestow upon our fellow \ncountrymen a common vision marked by moral values. \n The financial storm that swept through the world \na year ago has caused too much suffering and too much \nharm to the global economy, at a time in our history \nwhen we are confronted with the major challenges of \nthe climate crisis and the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), for us not to \ndraw obvious conclusions. \n A year from now, we will meet again in this same \nforum to take stock of the progress we have made in \nthe implementation of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). The 2015 deadline \u2014 which already \nseemed compromised on the eve of this \nmultidimensional crisis \u2014 requires that we define a \nglobal vision for the future of humankind. Some will \ncall it solidarity or moral awareness. Whatever the \n \n \n11 09-52228 \n \nname, we need to clearly define and implement the \nMDGs to meet the basic needs of all human beings. \n If poverty eradication is to remain our priority, \nwe will have to get busy on fulfilling our obligations, \nfor the most destitute are also the ones who are hungry, \nwho suffer from malnutrition and who lack access to \nwater and to basic social and health services. Among \nthe main victims are women and children, 25,000 of \nwhom die each day, according to UNICEF. \n Several hundred thousand people today benefit \nfrom actions undertaken by my country in the \nframework of its international cooperation in the fields \nof health, education and the fight against poverty. This \nis why I requested that we continue our effort to \ncontribute 0.7 per cent of our GDP by 2015 to official \ndevelopment assistance. This assistance must not be \nsacrificed because of the present economic and \nfinancial situation. On the contrary, it must be \nstrengthened at a time when the most vulnerable are \nthe ones who need it the most. This development \nassistance must be accompanied by long-term \ninvestments aimed at strengthening the capacity-\nbuilding of developing countries, in particular through \nthe transfer of appropriate technologies with a view to \nrespecting the requirements of sustainable \ndevelopment. \n From this perspective, and in the light of the \nrecent food crisis, the time is right to restore \nagriculture to its proper place, because food security \ndepends on it. Today, it is up to us to forge for future \ngenerations a new destiny, \u201ca new deal\u201d. We must \nmove from being donors to become partners in a green \nrevolution in Africa, where food-producing agriculture \nadapted to the specific conditions of the continent must \nempower the local populations. \n The restoration of agriculture to the heart of our \ncivilization also raises the crucial issue of water. \nWhether regarding access to it for the survival of our \npopulations, for farming or for energy production, it is \nimperative to guarantee water security. Therefore, an \nintegrated management of water resources is needed. \nWe must be aware of the potential disasters and \nconflicts that would arise if we failed, and of risks \nlinked to poor sanitation that could cause outbreaks of \ninfectious diseases and pandemics. \n The phenomena of desertification and drought, as \nwell as the acidification of seas and oceans, are \nexacerbated by man-made climatic change. This is why \nfailure of the Copenhagen negotiations is not an option. \nMy commitment, and that of my worldwide \ncounterparts, as stated yesterday in the framework of \nthe climate change summit convened by the Secretary-\nGeneral, is unequivocal: we must, together \u2014 \ndeveloped countries, countries with high carbon \ndioxide emissions and developing countries \u2014 succeed \nin defining a post-Kyoto regime that will be decidedly \nin line with a low-carbon-emission future. \n For too long, we have neglected the scientific \nwarnings. More than 20 years ago, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was \ncreated by the World Meteorological Organization. \nDuring the third World Climate Conference at the \nbeginning of September which, with great pleasure, I \nattended, it was decided to establish a Global \nFramework for Climate Services, with a view to \nhelping populations meet this increasingly pressing \nchallenge. \n This Global Framework, which we fully support, \naims at improving the management of the risks of \nclimate fluctuations and climate change as well as \nadaptation to climate change at all levels, through \ndevelopment and the incorporation of science-based \ninformation and forecasting into policies and planning. \nThe unparalleled mobilization of public opinion \ncompels us to adopt innovative measures to slow \nglobal warming, whose consequences could be \ncatastrophic. \n The Trade and Development Report recommends \ndeep structural changes, which will not happen unless \nwe are willing to challenge our patterns of production \nand consumption. The setting up of a green economy \nmust be the basis of such a process. Our role, as \npolitical decision makers, is to ensure that the \nnecessary technology \u2014 which already exists \u2014 is put \nto use to reduce greenhouse gases. Sustainable \ndevelopment requires the globalization of green \ntechnologies and environmental assets. \n On behalf of the Principality, I reiterate our stated \nambition to become carbon neutral and our resolve to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by \n2020 and by 60 per cent by 2050. \n During these past few months, the world \neconomy has been sorely tried and tested. Signs of \nrecovery are beginning to show, but we must draw \nlessons from this grim year. The globalization of the \neconomy and the resulting interdependence require \n  \n \n09-52228 12 \n \nreform of the international monetary and financial \nsystem. \n Created 10 years ago, the Group of 20 (G-20) met \nfor the first time at the level of heads of State or \nGovernment last November, thereby acknowledging \nthe urgency of adopting measures to save the world \neconomy from a disaster worsened by the panic \nreigning in the financial markets. Monaco \nacknowledges that this group, which represents two \nthirds of the world\u2019s population and trade and close to \n90 per cent of the world gross domestic product, bears \nspecial responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the \ninternational community. \n We are confident of the capacity of the G-20, \ntomorrow in Pittsburgh, to lay the foundations for a \nnew era encompassing, inter alia, financial regulation, \nfinancial traders\u2019 income, governance and resources \nallocated to international financial institutions. The \nG-20\u2019s ability to bring together all States will give rise \nto the legitimacy necessary for renewed growth. \n For several months, my Government has been \nworking to fulfil the commitments it undertook and to \ncomply with the required norms of the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with \na view to improve transparency and exchanges of fiscal \nand banking information. That is why my Government \nhas already signed 12 bilateral conventions and has \nundertaken to conclude other agreements in this area. \nAs of today, Monaco has had its efforts acknowledged \nby the OECD and will thus now be included on its \nWhite List. \n But let us make no mistake: the breach of trust \nresulting from the financial disaster has made it more \nnecessary than ever before that the measures taken by \nthe G-20 be non-discriminatory and bring together all \nMember States. A consultative body would thus ensure \nthe legitimacy of any decisions made. \n We must, together, rebuild solid foundations for a \ncapitalism with a human face that promotes growth and \nsocial development. Current circumstances have \nprovided us the opportunity to create a green economy, \none which associates job creation with the transfer of \nnew technologies which will enable us to achieve a \nsustained recovery. \n The State must continuously adapt its role and the \nexpression of its sovereignty to new realities in order \nto remain the guarantor of the security and social well-\nbeing of populations. The United Nations cannot avoid \nthis either. Since its creation, the Organization has \nworked for the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity through operations led under its flag. It has \nalso played a prominent federative role in the field of \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. \n Human and material resources available to \npeacekeeping operations have reached levels that \nwould have not been conceivable only a decade ago. \nThe necessary consideration of this matter initiated \nwithin the Security Council and the Secretariat, as well \nas with Member States, is a priority and we support it. \n What is just as important is the strengthening of \nthe rule of law and of democratic institutions, \nguardians of sovereignty and the peaceful coexistence \nof States. In this respect, I wish to reiterate the support \nof my country for the implementation of the \nresponsibility to protect, which is symbolic of the \nstrengthening of multilateralism for the good of \npopulations. The responsibility to protect does not \naffect the exercise of responsible sovereignty, which \nplaces the individual at the forefront. Monaco will \ncontinue to work with its partners \u2014 that is, each and \nevery one in this Hall \u2014 to implement best practices in \nthe field of protection, international assistance and \ncapacity-building, with the sole objective of saving \nlives. \n The Principality will keep responding, in \nsolidarity, to emergency humanitarian situations, \nespecially when it comes to assisting women and \nchildren, whose vulnerability in crisis situations, \nunfortunately, no longer needs to be demonstrated.  \n In 2010, we will celebrate the International Year \nfor the Rapprochement of Cultures and the \nInternational Year of Biodiversity. These themes \nsymbolize, at the outset of the twenty-first century, the \nharmony that we must seek both among our people \u2014 \nwith acceptance of our differences \u2014 and between the \nhuman species and the other living species on Earth, \nwhich we have the duty to protect and save from \nextinction. \n I can assure the Assembly that my country will \ncontinue to tirelessly commit itself to processes likely \nto build and strengthen the ties between our societies in \norder to promote dialogue and cultural and religious \nunderstanding based on mutual respect, such as the \nUnion for the Mediterranean and the Alliance of \nCivilizations.  \n \n \n13 09-52228 \n \n I am convinced that the President\u2019s great \nexperience at the United Nations and his role in the \ncreation of the African Union are great pluses for the \nsuccess of his very sensitive mission."

        "file_text": "First, I \nwould like to warmly congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki on his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. I would also like \nto pay a well-deserved tribute to Father Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann, President of the Assembly at its \nsixty-third session, for the work he accomplished \nduring his mandate. And I reaffirm the confidence and \nsupport of my country for the Secretary-General as he \ncontinues his efforts as the leader of this Organization. \n Gabon has just gone through a critical phase in its \nhistory as a nation. With the loss of President Omar \nBongo Ondimba on 8 June, our country saw the start of \na delicate period of political transition, during which \nwe had to dig deep to find the strength necessary to \nconfront our destiny. Under the relevant provisions of \nour founding laws and the leadership of interim \nPresident Rose Francine Rogomb\u00e9, we were able to \nbring our electoral process to a successful conclusion, \nculminating in a vote on 30 August. As a result of this \nunprecedented election, Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba was \nofficially proclaimed the elected President of the \nRepublic by the Constitutional Court, which under the \nlaw has a month to examine claims or appeals resulting \nfrom the election before the elected President takes \noffice, given that nine unsuccessful candidates have \nappealed to the high court. \n \n \n63 09-52470 \n \n As members know, ensuring such an important \ndemocratic transition in the brief time allocated under \nthe law was very challenging for our country, and I am \nproud to say that we have met it, considering what was \nat stake and what we knew had to be done. I submit \nhere my own tribute to the people of Gabon, the \nmajority of whom have proclaimed their support for \nthe values of peace and democracy. I would also like to \nthank the peoples of Africa and of the entire world, as \nwell as the representatives of States and international \nand civil society organizations who came to observe \nthe elections in Gabon and to nourish our democratic \nprocess with their experience. As we open a new page \nin our march towards progress and development, we \nknow we can rely on the international community and \non the friends of Gabon all over the world to confront \nthe challenges of today and tomorrow. \n As regards those challenges, we are determined, \ntoday more than ever before, to spare no effort to \nestablish good political and economic governance and \nto consolidate our gains and our legacy in the areas of \nstability, peace and democracy. We are also motivated \nby our determination to pursue our endeavours in \nmaintaining regional and international peace, by \nstrengthening our links of solidarity and fraternity with \nall our neighbouring countries. \n The sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly \nis opening its deliberations in an international context \nmarked by a number of successive crises: economic \nand financial, food, energy and environmental. We \nmust bring urgent and lasting responses to these \nvarious crises by acting collectively to curb them and \nensuring that our peoples achieve the development they \ndesire with all their heart. The United Nations \nConference on the World Financial and Economic \nCrisis and Its Impact on Development, held in New \nYork from 24 to 30 June, was an important initiative, \nenabling us to express our concerns and declare our \ncommitment to fighting the crisis and its repercussions \nfor our countries. \n The unity we reached on measures to be taken to \ndeal with the crisis will require the complete and \nunified participation of our countries in developing \nappropriate solutions. Beyond the specifics relating to \neach country, we must make sure together that the \nmeasures and actions taken to fight the crisis be \nproportional in scope to its gravity and intensity. \n The food crisis was at the centre of our \ndiscussions during the sixty-third session of the \nAssembly and was the focus of two important \ndeclarations, one adopted at the High-level Conference \non World Food Security, held in Rome from 3 to 5 June \n2008, and one adopted at the thirteenth African Union \nConference of Heads of State and Government, held in \nSirte in July. We must now implement the declarations \nand measures adopted as a result of meetings held at \nthe international and regional levels. It is only through \nstrict adherence to our commitments that we will be \nable to identify the adverse effects of such crisis \nsituations on the development of our respective States. \n The challenge of feeding a planet whose \npopulation is growing is intimately linked to the \nquestions of the environment and climate change. The \nharmful effects of global warming on our ability to \nincrease agricultural production in such a way as to \nbring about a lasting solution to the food crisis are no \nlonger in doubt. I am pleased once again that this \nquestion was chosen as a theme for the recent high-\nlevel dialogue organized by the Secretary-General on \nthe sidelines of the current session, with a view to the \nforthcoming Copenhagen Climate Conference in \nDecember. In this regard, we reaffirm our support for \nAfrica\u2019s common position on climate change, adopted \nin Addis Ababa in August by the heads of State or \nGovernment of the African Union. \n My country, Gabon, whose forests are among \nthose that make up the great Congo basin, has adhered \nunreservedly to the various international conventions \nconcerning the struggle against climate catastrophe and \nthe protection of biodiversity. We have resolved to \nassume our share of responsibility by dedicating 11 per \ncent of our territory to humanity, by creating, among \nother things, 13 national parks. \n The interdependence of the crises the \ninternational community faces highlights, now more \nthan ever before, the need to breathe new life into \nefforts to ensure international peace and security, but \nalso to conduct collective action at the global level. It \nis with this conviction that Gabon has submitted its \ncandidacy for a non-permanent seat in the Security \nCouncil for the period 2010-2011, for which it was \nendorsed by the African Union at its thirteenth \nConference of Heads of State and Government, held at \nSirte in July. \n  \n \n09-52470 64 \n \n My country is also convinced that this \nOrganization cannot remain frozen, but must evolve in \norder to enable it to adapt better to the current \ninternational context. It is for this reason that world \nleaders, through the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2) and the 2005 World Summit Outcome \n(resolution 60/1), reaffirmed the need to strengthen the \nUnited Nations to allow it to fulfil its principal \nmissions more effectively.  \n In that regard, my country welcomes the progress \nmade since the 2005 World Summit in implementing a \ngreat many of the important recommendations of the \nOutcome Document in the framework of the United \nNations reform process. While pleased with these \nmajor advances, we must continue our efforts to bring \nthese reforms to completion. Building a more just and \nsecure world capable of responding to its peoples\u2019 \nprofound aspirations depends on it."

        "file_text": "I am honoured, Sir, to add \nGrenada\u2019s voice to the many warm congratulations \noffered you on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Grenada \nlooks forward to working with you and pledges to \nsupport your leadership as you exercise impartial \nstewardship over this fine institution. Equally, we \ncommend your predecessor, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, for his dedication and conviction in \npursuing the vision of the United Nations as a home for \nsocial justice for all, particularly those who carry the \ngreatest burden. \n Through you, Mr. President, Grenada wishes to \nhighly commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \nhis staff for their performance over the past year in \nadvancing the work of this Organization and \n\u201cdelivering as one\u201d. We thank the Secretary-General \nfor his interest and participation in the recently \nconcluded Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) \nClimate Change Summit, chaired by Grenada. We wish \nhim and the Secretariat every continued success. \n The challenges facing the global community are \nmirrored in our regional and national context. \nFortunately, we have no better place than within these \nhallowed walls to continue the long and important \njourney of building a better world. We cannot respond \nto one challenge and choose to ignore another, because \nall of them are interconnected. Indeed, working \ntogether is our raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2014 the essence of the \n\u201cunited\u201d in the United Nations. \n Climate change is rightfully described as the most \nurgent threat facing mankind, and, at least for the next \nseveral months, it will remain at the top of the global \ndiplomatic and negotiating agenda. But what is the \nchallenge of climate change if not a risk to \ndevelopment, security and peace? What is the threat of \nclimate change, if not a threat to the very notion of \nhuman survival and ecological balance? For small \nStates, this threat is particularly pronounced. \n Today, I address this Assembly on the heels of \ntwo very important responses to climate change \u2014 the \nAOSIS Climate Change Summit and the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s summit on climate change. What is clear \nfrom these very well attended global meetings is that \nfor developing countries such as Grenada, the alarm \nhas been sounded \u2014 the alarm that climate change is \nbearing down on our countries and undermining our \npotential for both economic recovery in the short term \nand economic growth in the longer term. \n It is hampering our efforts to attain sustainable \ndevelopment, as set out in the Barbados Plan of Action \nand the Mauritius Strategy for Further Implementation. \nIn the case of Grenada, this is due to our dependence \non our natural resource base, which supports \n \n \n09-53165 2 \n \nagriculture and tourism. Together, they account for \nmore than 40 per cent of our gross domestic product \n(GDP), and they are extremely vulnerable to the \nnegative impacts of storms, hurricanes and other \neconomically disruptive events induced by climate \nchange. Hurricane Ivan in 2004 brought home this \nreality, causing damage estimated to be equivalent to \n204 per cent of GDP at the time. The country is still \nrecovering from that event. Grenada is not unique \namong small island States around the world in \nexperiencing those impacts. \n The gap in terms of the experience of the reality \nof climate change between those Member States \nalready impacted and all others needs to be urgently \nbridged. If we fail to do that, the United Nations itself \nwill have to bear the consequences of the humanitarian \nand environmental crisis resulting from the fact that \nsome islands will no longer be inhabitable. \n When my Prime Minister, the Honourable \nTillman Thomas, addressed the Secretary-General\u2019s \nsummit on 22 September, he spoke on behalf of the \nmost vulnerable States. For these 80 or more poor \nisland and landlocked States, a rise in temperature of \ntwo degrees Celsius is unacceptable, for our safety and \nsurvival will most certainly be at risk. That is why we \ninsist on a global commitment to ensuring an average \ntemperature increase of no more than 1.5 degrees \nCelsius, accompanied by appropriate midterm targets \nof a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by more \nthan 45 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 and by more \nthan 95 per cent by 2050. These reduction levels \nrespond to our vulnerabilities, and surely, in a United \nNations system to which we all belong, it is \nunthinkable that known threats will be allowed to turn \ninto grave risks.  \n We must solve the climate change crisis and we \nmust solve it now. Estimates place the cost of financing \nadaptation and mitigation at about 1 per cent of the \nindustrialized world\u2019s GDP \u2014 that is a contribution of \n$10,000 for every million dollars of GDP. Given the \nmoral principle of historical responsibility, this is \naffordable by any measure. \n With the adoption of the AOSIS Climate Change \nDeclaration, small island States have said we will not \nstand by and watch our islands sink, see our \nlivelihoods disappear and witness our children made \nhomeless due to the effects of human-induced climate \nchange. We again call on the international community \nto stand in support of the most vulnerable, so as to \nensure that the targets set forth in the AOSIS Climate \nChange Declaration are agreed to in Copenhagen. \nGrenada will continue to play its part in highlighting \nthe needs of the most vulnerable while advocating for \nthe strengthening of their capacity for resilience. While \nit continues to chair AOSIS, Grenada will always \nadvocate for sustainable development goals as well as \nfor agreements in the Copenhagen negotiations that are \ncommensurate to the level of the threat. \n The financial and economic crises continue to \nundermine economies worldwide. The green shoots of \nrecovery need to blossom everywhere. Grenada \ncontinues to insist, as our Prime Minister Tillman \nThomas stated at the June summit on the crisis, that the \nglobal financial and economic architecture needs \nfundamental and far-reaching reforms (see \nA/CONF.214/PV.1). Changes are needed in its rules, \nregulations and governance in order to facilitate the \neffective participation of small economies, which \nsuffer the effects of the crises harder and longer. Here, \nwe wish to echo the call for reform of the international \nfinancial institutions, particularly the call for a review \nof the policy conditions attached to lending by the \nInternational Monetary Fund. \n Grenada continues to pursue sustainable \neconomic development and prosperity for our people, \nas they show resilience to economic setbacks. A study \nby the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations shows that Latin America and the Caribbean \nwas the most successful region before the surge in food \nprices in 2008. That affirms our efforts.  \n However, another study showed that in times of \ncrisis, social spending does not favour the poor and \ndevelopment goals are stymied. This is our fear, and it \nis also our reality. That is why the Government \nintroduced a package of measures, greatly supported by \nfinancing from the Trinidad and Tobago Petroleum \nFund, which has begun to lay the basis for developing \na low-carbon and rights-based economic development \nmodel. In this regard, we wish to thank the \nGovernment of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago \nfor its continued assistance to Grenada and to the \nCaribbean region through its contribution to this Fund. \nWe are also grateful for the Petrocaribe agreement with \nthe Government of the Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela, through which several Caribbean countries \nare able to purchase oil on softer terms. \n \n \n3 09-53165 \n \n Grenada has put in place strategic initiatives that \ninclude revitalizing the agricultural sector, increasing \nlabour productivity, diversifying the export-services \nsector, strengthening the national investment \nenvironment and modernizing our tax system. In \nimplementing those initiatives, we seek partnerships \nwith the international community and the United \nNations system. \n Trade continues to be of major importance to \nGrenada. We are experiencing severe setbacks from the \nloss of preferential treatment in agricultural markets. \nWe are among the smallest and most open markets in \nthe world. And yet larger countries contest whatever \nbenefits we receive to offset the disadvantages of our \nsmall economic size, which are compounded by high \ntransportation cost and energy prices. \n Grenada is pleased that the United Nations \nsystem continues to pursue economic growth and \ndevelopment. We support the perspective that any \noutcome in Copenhagen must be a development \noutcome, for each is connected to the other. We urge \nsupport for meeting the Millennium Development \nGoals. We have made progress by achieving 80 per \ncent primary school enrolment, by reducing violence \nagainst women and by scaling up access to \nantiretroviral drugs for persons living with HIV/AIDS.  \n All the same, Grenada is striving to achieve a \nfaster rate of poverty eradication. That goal, however, \nis hampered by the drop in revenue caused by the \neconomic downturn and by our heavy debt burden, \nwhich now stands at 107 per cent of GDP. That is why \nwe add our voice to the call for a review of the criteria \nfor determining middle-income status. For while we \nwelcome efforts to assist highly indebted poor \ncountries, States such as Grenada that are currently \nreferred to as highly indebted middle-income countries \ndeserve special attention. \n The Government of Grenada favours peace and \nreconciliation, aspiring to bring people together to \nwork for a common good. From that platform we \npursue true partnership for development, beginning \nwith the private sector, trade unions and civil society. \nTogether, then, as one nation, we face the international \ncommunity. \n Development is important in its own right. It also \nserves as a guarantor for peace and security. We urge \nthe United Nations to continue its efforts in \npeacebuilding and peacekeeping. My country continues \nto support those efforts in the Caribbean region, to \nwhich we have contributed a small number of officers. \n We welcome the reopening of the office of the \nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Barbados \nto serve the eastern Caribbean region, and we highlight \nthe need for more intervention to stop drug trafficking.  \n In our region, the proliferation of small arms is as \nlethal as nuclear weapons. So while we welcome the \nunanimously adopted Security Council resolution \n1887 (2009) on nuclear disarmament, shepherded by \nPresident Obama, we in the Caribbean call for an \nagreement on the small arms trade. \n Grenada again calls the Assembly\u2019s attention to \nthe need to ensure the protection of the Caribbean Sea. \nThe States of the Caribbean Community and members \nof the Association of Caribbean States depend on the \ntremendous benefits from the pristine waters of the \nCaribbean Sea. Yet those ocean-based resources are \nthreatened by the trans-shipment of nuclear and other \nhazardous waste materials through our waters. We look \nto the General Assembly to strengthen the resolution \non this issue and to ensure that the threat is removed as \nsoon as possible. \n In what United States President Barack Obama \ncalls the new era of engagement, we believe that we \nface three major undertakings. The first is to respond to \nwhatever threatens us at a level commensurate to the \nthreat; second, to strengthen the institutional capacity \nof the United Nations to enable it to respond; and third, \nthe sacredness of this grand institution to inspire \nhumanity. \n In this endeavour, Grenada is guided by its \nnational values, the principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and its participation in the hemispheric \nsystem and the Caribbean regional integration process. \nConsequently, we reject the removal of the duly elected \nhead of State in Honduras and call for the immediate \nrestoration of President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya to the \nposition to which he was legitimately elected. \n The maintenance of the 40-year United States \nembargo against Cuba and the failure to bring into \nbeing a homeland and State for the Palestinian people, \ndespite numerous United Nations resolutions on both \nissues, remain of deep concern, for they violate the \nspirit and letter of international law, on which this \nOrganization is founded. We join the entire Caribbean \ncommunity in calling for an end to the United States \n \n \n09-53165 4 \n \nembargo against Cuba and urge the normalization of \nrelations between the two countries. We call for a \nsincere engagement to resolve the long-standing \nPalestinian-Israeli and wider Middle East conflict. \nResolution of those entrenched conflicts will generate \nthe momentum needed for resolving similar conflicts in \nother regions in Africa and elsewhere. \n The United Nations plays a critical role in every \nfacet of global affairs. That is its strength. To become \nmore effective, the Organization must necessarily \nbecome stronger, and that is why the resolution on \nsystem-wide coherence is timely and has our support. \nLikewise, the reform of the Security Council must not \nbe put off for another 16 years. Reform must mean \ngreater democratization by removing the veto, \nenlarging permanent and non-permanent categories and \nmaking operating rules and procedures transparent. \n Grenada is proud to continue playing its role at \nthe United Nations. We support the pursuit of \ninternational peace and security, the rule of law and the \nfight against terrorism and for the eradication of \npoverty and the promotion of human rights. We support \nthe agenda of the Non-Aligned Movement, and the \nGroup of 77 and China. We support the just ambitions \nof Africa, and we proudly support the initiative of the \nGovernment of South Africa to mark and celebrate, \nacross the globe, 18 July as Nelson Mandela Day, a day \nof selfless giving. \n We welcome the United Nations support for the \ninitiative to establish the permanent memorial to \nhonour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \nslave trade: lest we forget. That memorial is addressed \nto all humanity so that we may draw the lessons of \nyesteryear for our empowerment. We thank all Member \nStates which have already contributed, and we \nencourage others to support the Permanent Memorial \nFund. \n Grenada continues to value the role of the United \nNations as the pre-eminent institution for effecting \nmultilateral diplomacy. We support its ability to ensure \ninternational peace and stability and to accord a voice \nto all sovereign States, as enshrined in its Charter. We \nhave made significant and meaningful progress in \nprevious sessions of the General Assembly. Let this \nsixty-fourth session be another outstanding forward \nmovement in meeting the most pressing global \nchallenges of our time."

        "file_text": "I wish to express the \nwarm congratulations of the delegation of Saint Lucia \nto Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to serve as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. With his vast diplomatic experience, we are \nmost confident that this session will yield significant \nresults in advancing the agenda of the international \ncommunity through this most universal of institutions, \nthe General Assembly, which has been rightly \ndescribed by his predecessor, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, as the \u201cGroup of 192\u201d. We express our \nappreciation for the work of Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann, \nwho succeeded in further elevating the Assembly so \nthat it could regain its rightful place as the parliament \nof the world. We pledge to work with Mr. Treki in the \nfurtherance of that approach. We also thank Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts on behalf \nof us all. \n When developing countries agreed to the \nambitious but necessary Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) and the internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals, few, if any, foresaw that the winds \nwould be contrary, the storms fierce and the course \nahead so challenging. We are more than halfway to the \n2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, and Governments in the \ndeveloping world are still struggling to meet their \nobjectives. That situation, of course, is the result of \ndeveloping countries facing unforeseen economic \nhardship as a result of crisis after crisis that for the \nmost part are not of our own making. While the \ndeveloped world appears to be in the infant stages of \nrecovery, the developing countries are still in the wake \nof this crisis and are struggling to find calmer waters. \n In that connection, it is important that the Doha \nRound of trade negotiations be reshaped as a \ndevelopment round, with emphasis on substantially \nreducing the tariff and non-tariff barriers that have \nbeen imposed by developed countries, especially \nregarding agricultural products. \n The matter of substantive debt relief to permit the \ndeveloping countries to utilize their limited resources \nfor national development must also be given the most \nserious consideration. The MDGs are still achievable, \nbut the developed countries must meet their agreed \ncommitments if those objectives are to be attained in a \nmanner consistent with the global timetable. \n While all of the MDGs are relevant to the \ndevelopment aspirations of the people of my country \nand of the region, we believe that education, poverty \nalleviation and the strengthening of institutions for \ngood governance are pivotal to this process. These \nmust form the bedrock for overall development. So, \ndespite sluggish advancement towards the achievement \nof all the Goals, we have made significant progress in \nthe areas of poverty and hunger, universal education \nand gender equality. My own country boasts gender \nparity in wage employment in the non-agricultural \nsector, a long-standing problem in our region.  \n Despite such progress, continued improvement is \nrequired in the other priority areas of reducing child \nmortality and promoting maternal health. \nUnfortunately, as I speak here, my Government is \ngrappling with the loss of a hospital on the southern \npart of the island that burned down two weeks ago, \nwith loss of life. We have launched an appeal for \nassistance and hope that those most able to do so will \nhelp generously. \n We in Saint Lucia are observing the current \nglobal state of affairs through bifocal lenses; we see \nboth challenges and opportunity \u2014 an opportunity to \ntake bold new steps and think outside the box in \ntackling the issues that confront us. The right mix of \nappropriate policy interventions, strong political will \nand strategic partnerships supported by development \nstakeholders is certain to help countries such as Saint \nLucia achieve the Millennium Development Goals in a \ntimely manner. Therefore, hope is not completely lost.  \n Higher prices for food, fuel and other essentials \nforced most Governments of developing countries to \ndivert already scarce resources in order to subsidize \nthose commodities for the poorest in our societies. That \nthen put pressure on their ability to repay debts and, \ntogether with mismanagement within the world \nfinancial sector, triggered a global financial and \neconomic crisis. \n The world conference held here at United Nations \nHeadquarters last June to assess the worst global \neconomic downturn since the Great Depression \nsucceeded in identifying immediate and long-term \nmeasures to mitigate the impact of the crisis, especially \non developing countries, and to begin the necessary \n  \n \n09-52604 24 \n \ninternational deliberations on the restructuring of the \ninternational financial architecture. Saint Lucia and the \nrest of the Caribbean Community welcomed the \ninitiative, and we participated fully in the deliberations.  \n Saint Lucia therefore supports the measures \ncalled for in the outcome document (resolution 63/303, \nannex) to sustain the initiative while also providing the \nmachinery necessary for the continued monitoring of \nthe world economy. To that end, we emphasize the \nimportance of strengthening the capacity, effectiveness \nand efficiency of the United Nations and of making the \ninternational financial institutions more compassionate \nin their responses and their assistance to national \ndevelopment strategies. We look forward to analysing \nthe report of the ad hoc open-ended working group of \nthe Assembly on the implementation of the mandate, as \nwell as the reports of the Secretary-General on the \nglobal food security crisis, the International Labour \nOrganization report on the Global Jobs Pact and the \ncontributions of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to the \nnew development financing agenda.  \n The most pressing issue and challenge facing \nSaint Lucia, and indeed the rest of the world, is climate \nchange. It has emerged as the most serious \ndevelopmental challenge facing mankind today \u2014 \nhence, the demands for collective action and an urgent \nresponse. We are extremely concerned that the adverse \neffects of climate change are constantly altering access \nto basic resources such as land, water and food. \nDecreased accessibility threatens social security, a \ndaily reality for many of us around the world. We may \nnot disappear, as the Maldives will, if nothing is done, \nbut it will certainly be expensive to survive. \n On 21 September 2009, heads of member States \nof the Alliance of Small Island Developing States \n(AOSIS) adopted a declaration on climate change that \nspelled out some of the pressing issues that need to be \naddressed by all States. Before that we had the 1994 \nBarbados Programme of Action; the final communiqu\u00e9 \nof the 1999 AOSIS Heads of Government Meeting; the \noutcome document of the General Assembly\u2019s special \nsession held in 1999 to review and assess the Barbados \nProgramme (resolution S-22/2), and the adoption in \n2005 of the Mauritius Strategy for Further \nImplementation. All represented extensive legislative \nauthority for concerted international action and clearly \nset forth the position of the most vulnerable States.  \n That extensive mandate provides the framework \nfor a strategy to arrest the impact of climate change \nthat can lead to the emergence of a sustainable world \nfor present and future generations. The 2007 high-level \nevent on climate change, held to discuss \u201cThe future in \nour hands: addressing the leadership challenge of \nclimate change\u201d, was also instructive in reinforcing the \nmandates of earlier sessions. Alas, it seems the rest of \nthe world has not seen the urgency for action. \n For our part, Saint Lucia and other Caribbean \nStates have pledged to take voluntary mitigation \nmeasures to ensure our collective survival. We are \nworking assiduously to formulate policies and review \nlegislation to develop our renewable energy potential \nin wind, solar and geothermal power. We will intensify \nefforts to preserve our limited forest cover, which \nserves to protect our water supply and biodiversity and \nis an important factor in carbon sequestration. For us \nthese are critical survival measures. \n Saint Lucia has joined with other CARICOM \nmember States to establish early-warning systems for \npredicting disasters such as floods and hurricanes. \nCARICOM heads of Government have also adopted \nthe Liliendaal Declaration on Climate Change and \nDevelopment, which expressed the commitment to \nprotect the region\u2019s marine resources and ecosystems \nand work towards fulfilling the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change objectives. \n While these sustainable development practices \nhave long-term benefits, the financial investment \nrequired to support them is very onerous for small \nisland developing States. We have indicated that our \nGovernments have been proactive; however, the small \nisland developing States still need financial support to \nenhance their capacity to respond to challenges brought \non by climate change. Let me reiterate that these \nproblems are not of our doing. Lack of access to cost-\neffective, affordable and environmentally sound \ntechnologies significantly threatens to stall or reverse \nprogress already made. Nor will mitigation be enough \nif not supported by adaptation measures. We therefore \nurge States to fulfil their commitment to the Adaptation \nFund, which will help us cope with changes that have \nmade life difficult for many peoples. \n We the small island developing States and least \ndeveloped countries have joined together to demand, \nappeal and even beg, if necessary, that the new \nCopenhagen climate agreement limit temperature \n \n \n25 09-52604 \n \nincreases to the attainable level of 1.5 degrees Celsius, \nas it is possible that anything above that will be \ndevastating to our very existence. We urge other \ninhabitants of planet Earth to be understanding and \ncooperative as we work to seal the deal in Copenhagen. \nIf we cannot reverse or slow the effects of climate \nchange, all other activities, as noble as they may be, \nwill be useless to mankind. \n Our efforts to advance our own development \nprogress are sometimes derailed because of a lack of \nresources and a peculiar grouping that excludes many \nStates from access to certain types of aid, loans and/or \ndevelopment assistance currently available only to \nleast developed States \u2014 ironically, because of our \nsuccess in managing our affairs. It would appear that \nwe are being punished for being prudent in the \nmanagement of our limited resources. \n Middle-income countries like Saint Lucia \ncontinue to face significant challenges in reducing \npoverty, servicing debt and achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. My Government is pleased to note \nthat the United Nations and the international financial \ninstitutions have recognized that there is a need to \naddress the development needs of middle-income \ncountries and to reinforce global support for their \ndevelopment efforts. We are cognizant that this group \nof countries is not homogeneous and that individual \neconomic and social circumstances must be taken into \naccount. However, as a group, we deserve greater \nattention from the donor community and the United \nNations system. We hope our pleas do not fall on deaf \nears, and that assistance will not come too late. \n While we bemoan the slow pace of assistance \nfrom the North, we appreciate the efforts of our \ntraditional friends \u2014 the United Kingdom, the United \nStates, Canada, France, the European Union, Japan, to \nname a few \u2014 to meet their official development \nassistance targets and agreed commitments. However, \nthe significance of cooperation among developing \ncountries cannot be overlooked. South-South \ncooperation has become an effective tool for economic \ndevelopment and foreign policy and constitutes one of \nthe most important dimensions of international \ncooperation for development, particularly in the \ncontext of globalization and liberalization. South-South \ncooperation is also an imperative to complement \nNorth-South cooperation and strengthen the \ninstitutional capacities of the countries of the South to \nengage in sustainable development practices. An ever-\nchanging global landscape has impelled developing \ncountries to take initiatives to safeguard one another\u2019s \ncommon interests, since they possess diverse assets \nthat can nonetheless be complementary. \n That has been our goal within CARICOM, and \nwe thank the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for \nso often leading the way on such matters. The \nGovernment of Saint Lucia also wishes to express its \ngratitude for the assistance provided by the Republic of \nCuba, whose international medical assistance \nprogramme has served the people of the region, the \nwider hemisphere and beyond. And we express our \nappreciation for the support we have received from \nother countries in our region, including the Latin \nAmerican States of Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela, to \nname a few. \n The historic cultural ties between Africa and the \nCaribbean are well known, and cooperation between \nour two regions is being strengthened through recent \ndevelopments such as the African Union Diaspora \nInitiative and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean \nStates Secretariat. We in Saint Lucia have received \nsupport from the Kuwaiti funds to assist in \ninfrastructure development. In short, we are reaching \nout to the world for cooperation and collaboration in \nthe advancement of our development efforts, within the \nframework of respect for each other and for \nhumankind. \n That is why the Government of Saint Lucia joins \nwith other delegations in extending our deep \ncondolences to the Government and people of Taiwan \nfollowing the devastation and loss of life caused by the \ndisastrous Typhoon Morakot in August. Taiwan has \nassisted Saint Lucia in the areas of education, \nagriculture, health and other fields critical to our \ndevelopment efforts. Their assistance in agriculture, \nespecially, has enabled us to improve our output and \nposition ourselves for breaking into the food export \nmarket. Taiwan has extended a helping hand to all \nthose who have requested it. It seeks only to be part of \nthe family of nations and to share its knowledge and \nexpertise with the rest of the world. That is not too \nmuch to ask. We are pleased to note that some positive \nsteps have been taken in this respect, and we hope they \nwill continue, with other agencies opening their doors \nto participation and thus to enable 23 million people to \nmake their contribution to their fellow human beings \nand to realize their aspirations, as we in Saint Lucia did \n30 years ago. \n  \n \n09-52604 26 \n \n We also extend our sympathies to the \nGovernment and people of the Philippines for the loss \nof life and destruction caused by Typhoon Ketsana \nthree days ago. \n Saint Lucia joins with other CARICOM countries \nin expressing profound concern and deep \ndisappointment with the decision by the Administering \nPower to dissolve the Government and legislature in \nthe non-self-governing territory of the Turks and \nCaicos Islands, an associate member of CARICOM. \nWe call for a speedy return to democratic governance, \nwithout which the territory\u2019s participation in the \nregional integration process will be in jeopardy. \n Economic diversification for small States is \ncritical to their ability to remain competitive in an ever \nmore globalized economy, and many small States have \ndeveloped vibrant financial service industries that have \nevolved as clean, competitive industries in a world \neconomy increasingly dependent on services. Clearly, \nthe competitiveness of tax rates and international tax \ncompensation are fundamental tools of globalization \nand represent one of the few areas where small States \nhave been able to enter this new economy from a \ncompetitive position. To this end Saint Lucia joined \nwith other CARICOM States last July in adopting the \nLiliendaal Declaration on the Financial Sector: A New \nFramework for Financial Regulation and Supervision \nin the Region. \n It is important to note that the regional policy \ncontains provisions for continued improvement in \nstandards for disclosure, transparency and corporate \ngovernance for both public and private companies. \nHowever, despite our best efforts, international \nfinancial centres in the Caribbean and elsewhere have \nrecently been under intense pressure from high-tax \nnations. Saint Lucia joins our regional partners in \ncontinuing to enhance transparency by the \nstrengthening of regulatory frameworks. We stand with \nour CARICOM colleagues in calling for equitable \ntreatment in accord with that granted to the developed \ncountries and other preferential jurisdictions. \n It matters little if we are rich if we are insecure in \nour homes and our country. And that is why in recent \nyears the issue of small arms and light weapons has \nemerged as a major source of concern to us. Small \ndeveloping States like Saint Lucia continue to be \nthreatened by the disturbing spread of small arms. The \nillicit introduction of those weapons into our societies \nhas created a heavy burden in our region, which has \nseen the emergence of an unacceptable level of gun \nviolence, worsened by the social distress caused by the \neconomic and financial crisis. Saint Lucia reiterates its \nsupport for the implementation of relevant General \nAssembly resolutions addressing the illicit trade of \nsmall arms and light weapons in all its aspects, most \nrecently resolution 63/72 of 2 December 2008. Saint \nLucia wishes also to express its continued support for \nthe full implementation of the international instruments \nto enable States to identify and trace illicit small arms \nand light weapons in a timely and reliable manner.  \n On top of all our financial problems it seems we \nare asked to bear an unfair burden in relation to world \npeace and security. While ensuring an effective funding \nmechanism is the collective responsibility of the \nmembership, we concur that the future scale of \nassessment should be constant, simple and transparent. \nWe fully support the view of the Committee on \nContributions that the scale should be based on gross \nnational income data, as that is the most accurate \nreflection of one\u2019s capacity to pay. \n In the face of all the challenges outlined above \nand in this present state of world affairs, it is no longer \npragmatic to utilize attenuated financial and technical \nassistance schemes designed many years ago. They \nhave given way to development challenges that are \noften of astronomical size as well as nebulous, \nnecessitating long-term, cumulative responses. In \nshort, the world is in crisis-management mode, and that \nis seriously affecting the ability of developing \ncountries to move forward and onward to progress. \n However, crisis management must be undertaken \nwith sustainable development in mind and integrated \ninto the policymaking processes by both donor and \nrecipient countries. Coordination and collaboration, \ntherefore, are essential within and among \nGovernments, organizations and local communities if a \nsustainable and forward-looking approach is to be \nachieved. \n We chose as our theme for this session of the \nAssembly \u201cEffective responses to global crises: \nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \ncivilizations for international peace, security and \ndevelopment\u201d. I hope that this body, made up of a \ndiverse group of countries, will work together towards \nachieving the goals to which we all aspire. \n \n \n27 09-52604 \n \n Like Jason in his good ship the Argo, fair Helen \u2014 \nSaint Lucia \u2014 will brave the seas, chart a new course \nand take our people to the heights of development and \ndignity that befit a country that has produced two \nNobel Laureates."

        "file_text": "I should \nlike at the outset to express my pleasure at seeing \nMr. Treki so brilliantly execute the lofty tasks of the \npresidency of the General Assembly on behalf of \nAfrica. I offer him my warmest congratulations and \nwish him every success in that office. I also take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for the sincere commitment that he has \nshown. \n The path laid down by the founding fathers of the \nUnited Nations for the achievement of its goals is that \nof dialogue and multilateralism. The United Nations \nwas created to harness the energies of the international \ncommunity to that end. Soon, we will have been at it \nfor seven decades. Where are we today? Painful \nfractures hinder humankind and threaten to \nconsiderably weaken our capacity for common action. \nThe multifaceted crises that have shaken the global \neconomy have been caused by its accelerated \nglobalization without agreed global governance. These \ncrises have mightily stricken the most vulnerable. \nFurthermore, they have exposed the planet to grave \ndangers, the signs of which are undeniably evident. \n We should accept the facts. The time for \nassumptions has passed. The time has come for \nproactive anticipation, as we now know the cost of \nindifference, inertia and passivity. We must restore the \ncapacity of the United Nations to fulfil its calling in the \npursuit of solutions to the global problems of \nhumankind. Through the dialogue of civilizations, we \nshould reconcile the specificities connected with the \ndiversity of our cultural heritage with the universal \nstandards that arise from the inviolability of human \ndignity. \n The dialogue of civilizations is without doubt an \nessential precondition for strengthening \nmultilateralism. It can help us return to the \nfundamental values of respect for life and for nature, \nawareness of our common destiny, the quest for mutual \nbenefit, and the sense of permanence, sharing and \nhonouring our responsibilities towards future \ngenerations. If we wish to reverse the dismal trends \nand outlook that scientists have described, we must \nconclude a new alliance between man and nature \u2014 a \nnew common agreement. That is how we can regain \ncontrol of the natural and anthropogenic phenomena \nthat affect our existence on Earth. The Copenhagen \nConference in December will be an excellent \nopportunity that we must not squander. \n Above all, we should create conditions to ensure \nthe responsible contribution of all to fully realizing the \npotential of humankind. To that end, we must eliminate \nall obstacles to its development. The State and public \nauthorities have a vital role to play in that regard. They \nmust at all times engage with social partners working \nin the service of freedom and progress. \n The independent Commission on Legal \nEmpowerment of the Poor has shown us the virtues of \ngradually eliminating old practices that violate the \nintegrity of the individual both as a living being and as \na legal and social entity. That is a fundamental \nprecondition to guaranteeing the responsible access of \nall to the benefits of modernity and shared prosperity. \nThat is why Benin has committed to organizing the \nregional conference on revitalizing the major \nrecommendations of the independent Commission. \n To that end also, my country has declared a \nresolute war on female genital mutilation through an \nawareness campaign, the retraining of practitioners and \nthe vigilant enforcement of unambiguous legislation, \nbolstered by a new family code that establishes the \nequal rights of men and women. That is also why \nBenin worked for the proclamation of 2009 as the \nInternational Year of Human Rights Learning. The \nmain objective of the Year is to promote the necessary \nchange in thinking to ensure that humankind moves \ntowards full and complete adherence to the universal \nvalues enshrined in the United Nations Charter. \n The United Nations must be more effective in \nsupporting national policies to achieve international \nstandards. The Beninese Government has decided to \nentrust the rationalization of its efforts in favour of \nwomen to a recently established women\u2019s institute. To \nthat end, we are very pleased to welcome the imminent \nestablishment and operationalization of a composite \nentity within the United Nations system for the \nadvancement of gender equality. It will make it \npossible to ensure the coherent and efficient support of \nthe United Nations system for the efforts of Member \nStates. \n In the context of Africa\u2019s resolute march towards \na new beginning, the Beninese Government has \nadopted strategic measures based on the elimination of \n  \n \n09-52470 56 \n \npoverty and on reinvigorated economic growth that \nwill make Benin an emerging country by 2025. The \nchallenges to be met are huge since nearly one third of \nthe population of Benin currently lives below the \npoverty line in a country vulnerable to the threats of \nnatural disasters and where food security is not fully \nguaranteed. \n The measures implemented in particular by the \nGovernment of Mr. Boni Yayi, in place since April \n2006 thanks to scrupulous respect for our Constitution, \nmark our resolve to move forward. Our economic \nperformance in 2006 and 2007 proved that our strategic \nchoices were correct. These measures included \npromoting microfinancing as an effective means of \nfighting poverty and social exclusion, especially that of \nwomen, by granting microcredit to the poorest \u2014 \nespecially women, who are the most important pillar of \nsociety although economically disadvantaged; \npromoting entrepreneurship and youth employment; \nand the launching of multiple training programmes in \norder to integrate young people into the fabric of our \nsocio-economic structure. We are also working on \nmechanizing agriculture, promoting education by \noffering free and mandatory primary education, and \nmaking free Caesarean sections available as a better \napproach to reproductive health. \n These social measures were implemented at the \nsame time that major work was begun on \ninfrastructure. However, the ongoing economic \nrecession and the worsening harmful consequences of \nclimate change threaten to seriously jeopardize the \nconsiderable progress made in implementing this \npivotal national project. \n Only one year ago, the International Monetary \nFund predicted that the gross domestic product of \nsub-Saharan African countries would increase by \n6.7 per cent on average in 2009. Those forecasts were \nrevised downward a few months later to 5.1 per cent, \nthen to 3.5 per cent and last March to 3.25 per cent, \nand nothing guarantees that the growth rate will not \ndecline further. \n This decline in the growth rate has aggravated the \ndanger of serious budgetary difficulties. We must \nmaintain our rate of progress despite being subjected to \nthe gruelling external shocks of the successive crises of \nthe world economy in full recession. We are making \nconsiderable efforts to mobilize our internal resources. \nWe welcome the good work done by the United \nNations to mobilize additional resources from \ndevelopment partners in order to help pilot countries, \nincluding Benin, to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. These decisions were taken in the \ncontext of implementing the commitments made by the \nGroup of Eight at Gleneagles, the Millennium \nDeclaration, the 2001 Brussels Declaration on least \ndeveloped countries, and all of the statements that we \nwarmly welcomed and applauded at the recent Summit \non Climate Change convened here by the Secretary-\nGeneral. \n The consequences of climate change considerably \ncomplicate the deal. Benin is among the most \nvulnerable countries and those least equipped to \naddress climate change. In addition to torrential rains \nthat are concentrated in just a few weeks of the year, \ncoastal erosion due mainly to the rise in sea level has \nalready been observed in Benin and neighbouring \ncountries. We also have long and recurrent droughts \nand other natural disasters that are affecting our \npeoples. Scientists predict that, among other events, the \ncoastal areas of West Africa will be submerged due to \nthe rise in sea level of the Atlantic Ocean, whereas \nnorthern countries have already gained land along their \ncoastlines. \n We therefore need help to acquire the \ntechnologies and means necessary to combat coastal \nerosion because we cannot sit idly by while this \ndisaster unfolds. In order to counter the coastal erosion \nalready engulfing our cities and coastal lands, major \nwork on infrastructure is crucial. Actions to be taken \nwill be effective only if undertaken at the level of the \nentire subregion so as to ensure that all of the West \nAfrican coastline is protected. To that end, we must \nmobilize vast resources. Perhaps we should consider \nestablishing a multilateral investment fund, under the \nauspices of the United Nations and the African Union, \nto finance the major construction work that will be \nneeded. \n We need a United Nations able to coordinate the \nresponse to these major development challenges, raise \nthe necessary resources to respond to the financial \nneeds, and supervise the transfer of resources to be \nused by the international community to help the most \nvulnerable countries, including the least developed. We \nneed a United Nations with the moral authority to \ninvolve the affluent countries in thorough reform of the \narchitecture of governance and of economic and \nfinancial globalization in order to improve the capacity \n \n \n57 09-52470 \n \nof the international financial system to promote \nequitable development in all regions of the world. \n The initiatives of the Group of Twenty in this \narea are laudable and must continue to ensure a \nthorough reform of the international economic system \nthat will allow all countries to be integrated into the \nvirtuous cycle of economic growth and sustainable \ndevelopment. We need a United Nations able to help \nemerging countries fully to shoulder the international \ncommitments linked to their new status and to exploit \ntheir strengths to promote South-South and triangular \ncooperation in order to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and to better adapt to climate \nchange. Convinced that another name for peace is \ndevelopment and that peace and development are \nessential to our survival on Earth, we must find the \nessential means to promote peace through and for \ndevelopment. \n We need a United Nations able to assure the \neffective prevention of armed conflict, if necessary by \nfielding robust peace or development missions to \nconduct operations for economic stabilization and the \nelimination of extreme poverty. We need a United \nNations that makes full use of the opportunities for \ncooperation with regional organizations. In that \nconnection, Benin calls for consistent implementation \nof the proposals made in the Prodi report (S/2008/813, \nannex) on cooperation between the United Nations and \nthe African Union on modalities for support to African \nUnion peacekeeping operations. \n We need a United Nations with strengthened \ncapacities to contribute to the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes, inter alia, through mediation and the \npromotion of judicial settlements. We need a United \nNations capable of rising to the challenges involved in \nsettling the Palestinian question definitively; \npromoting disarmament and the regulation of the \nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; \npromoting the rule of law at the national and \ninternational levels; promoting fair trade; countering \nterrorism and organized transnational crime; exercising \nthe responsibility to protect; fighting impunity by \nstrengthening international justice; and protecting \ncivilians, in particular children, women and the elderly \nin situations of armed conflict; and so on. \n United Nations reform must be undertaken \nwithout hesitation in order to strengthen its \neffectiveness, legitimacy and credibility. Security \nCouncil reform through expansion in both categories of \nmembership is, among other things, an unavoidable \nnecessity of our times, as the Chairman of the African \nUnion affirmed from this rostrum a few days ago. \n The time has come to grant all peoples of the \nEarth their due place in the concert of free and \nprosperous nations. Benin is ready to cooperate \nwithout reservation in finding the most appropriate \nways to redress the injustices of the past and to \nestablish a new world order in the Security Council. \nSuch an order must enable humankind to forge its \ncommon destiny in our common house, namely, the \nEarth. We have a sacred duty towards our planet, which \nincludes behaving in a manner that serves to preserve \nits habitability for current and future generations. Yes, \nwe need a United Nations that is more just and better \nable to respond to today\u2019s urgent needs as well as to the \naspirations of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people."

        "file_text": "I wish to add my voice to \nthose who have spoken before me on the need for \neffective responses to global crises and for \nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \ncivilizations for international peace, security and \ndevelopment.  \n I believe that there is no longer an excuse for \nworld leaders to be reluctant to move closer together \nand stimulate debate on how multilateralism and \ndialogue could be strengthened. We need to strengthen \ncollaboration so that the international community \nresponds effectively to such global challenges as \nclimate change, the financial and economic crisis, food \nand energy crises, armed conflicts, terrorism and, \nabove all, poverty reduction. \n \n The first item on the multilateralism agenda is to \nreach a global consensus on reforming multilateral \ninstitutions, including the United Nations, to ensure the \nequitable and geographical representation of developed \nand developing countries alike. It is imperative that \ndeveloping nations have an effective voice on matters \nthat concern them. Therefore, the United Nations \nshould promote dialogue that ensures the inclusiveness, \ntransparency and accountability that are needed to \nattain genuine global peace, security and development. \n The Security Council must be made flexible to \nallow the countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and \nthe Middle East to have fair representation in that \nbody. The continued monopoly of that body by the \nsuper-Powers is no longer justifiable. Developing \nnations cannot continue to be silent spectators in \nmatters that affect them. Every sovereign nation is an \nintegral part of the global village. Gone are the days \nwhen conflicts, wars and economic crises in Africa, \nSouth-East Asia, the Middle East and Latin America \nwere the concerns only of the peoples and \nGovernments in those areas. \n The second agenda item for multilateral dialogue \nis the attainment of world food security. Food \nshortages threaten the foundations of democracy and \ngood governance. The United Nations cannot sustain a \nworld system where huge populations live permanently \nwith hunger and starvation. This world body must find \na formula whereby the world can produce enough food \nfor all at affordable prices. I believe that it is possible \nunder the auspices of the United Nations to achieve \nglobal food security. \n Malawi has a well-organized agricultural \ndevelopment strategy and can contribute to United \nNations efforts in this matter. Malawi has, within a \nshort period of time, transformed itself from being a \nfood-deficit and hungry nation to a food-surplus \nnation. Malawi now produces enough food for all its \npeople, and we are able to export to neighbouring \ncountries. \n The key factor behind this success story is that \nMalawi has allocated huge budgetary resources and \nheavy investment to the agricultural sector. We have \nalso successfully introduced an agricultural input \nsubsidy programme that enables poor and low-income \nhouseholds to buy fertilizer, seeds and chemicals at a \nheavily subsidized price. As a result, poor smallholder \nfarmers have become more productive. At the same \ntime, there are visible signs of improvements in the \nstandard of living of the people, particularly in rural \nareas. \n The third agenda item for multilateral dialogue is \nto manage climate change. Malawi is happy that this \nmatter will be fully discussed at the Copenhagen \nConference later this year. At the national level, \nMalawi is responding to the challenge of climate \nchange through intensive irrigation farming and by \nmoving away from dependence on rain-fed agriculture. \nThe Government has introduced the Green Belt \nprogramme that will irrigate up to 1 million hectares of \nland for small-, medium- and large-scale farmers by \nharnessing water sources from the rivers and lakes to \nprovide extensive irrigation. We shall grow a broad \nrange of food crops, such as rice, wheat, maize, beans \nand lentils, as our way to contribute to resolving the \nworld food crisis. \n The threat of climate change is real. I believe that \nthe price of complacency will be much higher if we fail \nto act today. For Africa and developing countries \nelsewhere, we need to adequately address the issue of \ndeforestation, environmental degradation and \nagricultural productivity. We need to act now. \n Let me conclude by stating that we also need a \nglobal dialogue on democracy, good governance, \nhuman rights, the rule of law and the fight against \nterrorism in all its manifestations. We also need a new \nunderstanding of how developing nations can cope \nwith the shocks of global financial crises and \nescalating fuel prices. \n I believe that, working together, all nations of the \nworld, rich or poor, powerful or powerless, can \nstrengthen multilateralism and dialogue for lasting \ninternational peace, security and development. We live \nin one world. We have the same destiny. "

        "file_text": "\nBefore anything else, allow me to congratulate His \nExcellency Mr. Ali Treki of Libya, a country with \nwhich we maintain excellent relations of brotherhood, \nfor his election to the important post of President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, which \nrole he will certainly carry out with his usual level of \nexcellence. I would also like to congratulate His \nExcellency Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for his \nexcellent work on the world economic crisis during his \npresidency at the sixty-third session. \n A year has passed since the opening of the \nAssembly\u2019s sixty-third session, and yet we have still \nnot recovered from the full effects of the global \neconomic crisis, despite enormous efforts on the part of \ndeveloped countries. The same distortions in the \nworld\u2019s economy remain.  \n But it is not just economic and financial problems \nthat we face. Our biggest challenge today is \nguaranteeing the future of our planet, not just in the \neconomic sense, but also resolving climate change \nissues that threaten the very survival of small island \nnations like Sao Tome and Principe. Though our carbon \nemissions are insignificant and our forests play a key \nrole as part of the world\u2019s lungs, rising sea levels are \nalready causing coastal erosion around our country. \n Time is no longer on our side but has become our \nunforgiving judge. There is no time for more \nunfounded justifications for the non-fulfilment of the \nKyoto Protocol. We cannot continue evading these \n \n \n09-52320 16 \n \nessential environmental issues, which are not a \nquestion of developing countries against developed \nones. We need urgent measures that are global and \nconcrete to save us from this crisis. \n The report of the Secretary-General on the work \nof the Organization (A/64/1) contains some important \npoints to which we have given considerable attention, \nbecause my country shares similar concerns. I am \nreferring to the urgent need for reform of the United \nNations system. Africa, especially its small countries \non the periphery, continues mired in the deepest \npoverty. Our problems are particularly difficult to solve \ndue to a combination of adverse factors that deserve an \napproach from the international community that is \nmore systematic, more diligent and more coordinated. \n There have been several crises in 2009, and we \nhave to re-think together the future of the new world \neconomic order. Those crises affect all countries and \ndemand a global response. Sao Tome and Principe is a \nmicro-State with a micro-economy, and thus it is poor \nand vulnerable. As such, it is not immune to the effects \nof those crises. \n We need to reinforce the merits of multilateralism \nas an instrument through which the international \ncommunity can promote peace and development. \nTherefore, Sao Tome and Principe wants to \ndemonstrate its support for the institutionalization of \nthis agenda within the framework of the United \nNations. In a world confronting a global economic and \nfinancial crisis, along with the negative impact of \nclimate changes, there is a need to guarantee food \nsecurity and energy security, to deal with migrations \nand pandemics and numerous regional conflicts of \nincreasing complexity and associated risks.  \n The only way we can face these crises is through \nactive multilateralism, based on international law and \non the principles of the United Nations Charter, and \nthrough reaffirming our commitment to achieving the \ngoals set out in the United Nations 2005 World \nSummit. We are well aware that we will achieve those \ngoals only through a renewed multilateral system, \nintegrated in a world organization that is stronger, \nmore egalitarian and with more solidarity. \n In this framework we call for support for the oft-\nrepeated proposal for reforming the United Nations \nsystem, and particularly the issue of permanent \nmembers of the Security Council. We believe that this \nissue cannot be endlessly put off. There must be more \njustice in the context of the United Nations. The \nAfrican States must have a voice and cannot be ignored \nin this process of reform of our Organization. That is \nwhy I want to state my complete agreement with what \nwas said from this tribune yesterday, at the \n3rd meeting, by the President of the African Union, our \nbrother-leader Qadhafi, reclaiming better participation \nby the African countries as permanent members of the \nSecurity Council.  \n We are beginning the last five years in the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). The past five years have presented us with \nthe biggest challenges facing global society: poverty, \npandemics, environmental degradation \u2014 everything \nthat galvanized the world\u2019s position that was translated \ninto the declaration that we heard yesterday. The goals \nand hopes that this declaration embodies need \nattention. I can say that in Sao Tome and Principe we \nhave made determined efforts, especially to achieve the \nGoals in the areas of health and education. We are \nalmost there, although we are yet not completely \nsatisfied. \n The biggest debates related to global warming \nconcentrate on substitutions for fossil fuels in order to \nreduce carbon emissions that contribute to the \ngreenhouse effect. This debate has gone on as \ntemperatures have risen, causing the glaciers and polar \nice caps to melt, which in turn has already caused a rise \nin the sea level. As I mentioned earlier, that is \nthreatening our country. \n These environmental changes present a strategic \nchallenge for countries, with increasing global \ninsecurity caused by the effects of violent storms, \ndroughts, massive migrations and pandemics, which \nlead to an increase in poverty, environmental \ndegradation and weakening national Governments. \nExperts in this field call our attention to the fact that \nthese climate changes may result in an unprecedented \nneed to provide emergency food aid, which could cause \na crisis of sustainability for the international \ncommunity.  \n The negotiations in the framework of the United \nNations are aimed at creating a substitute for the 1997 \nKyoto Protocol, which establishes limits on greenhouse \ngas emissions by 2012 for 37 countries in the \ndeveloped world and is an attempt to profoundly alter \nthe world climate situation. \n \n \n17 09-52320 \n \n We hope the 2020 objectives can be formalized \nduring the Copenhagen summit. Even in the meetings \nthis week, at the Assembly\u2019s current session, we have \nseen growing concern on the part of the international \ncommunity, at the level of the Secretary-General and in \nthe Alliance of Small Island Developing States, with \nregard to the success of this process. \n Whenever I speak before the General Assembly, I \nconclude by mentioning two continuing cases of \ninjustice: that of the Republic of China on Taiwan and \nthat of the trade embargo against Cuba.  \n Despite everything, there are positive signs on the \ninternational scene, for which we are grateful. We \nwelcome the recent positive developments between the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. We continue to support increased \nparticipation at the United Nations for the Republic of \nChina on Taiwan. In that regard, we welcome the \nadmission of that nation of 23 million people as an \nobserver at the World Health Organization. We hope \nthat other United Nations agencies, such as the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nand the International Civil Aviation Organization, can \nalso take advantage of the valuable contributions that \nthat developed country can make with respect to the \nurgent needs of the Organization. \n Unfortunately, however, while we can express a \ncertain satisfaction concerning the issue of the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan, we cannot do so with \nregard to the trade embargo against Cuba; indeed, we \nare greatly disappointed in that area. But we dare to \nremain hopeful that the new United States \nAdministration will have the courage and \ndetermination to shortly address this issue in the same \nmanner as it has dealt with that of Guant\u00e1namo.\n I wish to stress that the road ahead of us is very \ndifficult and long. There must be global cooperation in \na context of availability and responsibility to ensure \nsustainable development for all countries. I therefore \nappeal for greater cooperation between donor and \nbeneficiary countries and greater consultation not only \nwith Government institutions, but also with institutions \nmore familiar with the needs of people on the ground. I \nam referring specifically to rural communities, \nteachers, doctors, nurses, farmers, fishermen and all \nthose in the productive sectors of our countries.  \n For the Government and the people of Sao Tome \nand Principe, the United Nations remains an \nindispensable Organization where there should be no \ndifferences among Member States. The United Nations \nmust continue its mission of maintaining peace and \nsecurity and promoting international development. \nThose are the Organization\u2019s objectives to ensure the \nbetterment of our world."

        "file_text": "At \nthe outset, I would like to address to Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki my warmest congratulations on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session. I wish him every success in \nmeeting this challenge. \n My country is proud of its historic commitment to \ntolerance, fostering rapprochement and confidence-\nbuilding in international debates. Romania has always \ndemonstrated its resolve to enhance multilateralism, be \nit by bringing parties in conflict together, overcoming \nartificial boundaries or promoting cooperation between \ndeveloped and developing countries. \n I take this opportunity to pay tribute to an \nimportant event for Central and Eastern Europe, which \nwe are commemorating this year. It has been 20 years \nsince the autumn of change that reshaped Europe and \nopened the way to historic opportunities for the former \nEastern bloc. Two decades have passed since the fall of \nthe iron curtain, and we now recognize that the power \nfor change that democracy represents is one of the \nmost potent European values. It remains the hope of \nmillions of young people throughout the world who \ndefend freedom of expression, multi-party systems, \nrespect for diversity and freedom of the press. We must \nnever forget our history. After two decades of \ndemocratic change, we must never forget where we \nstarted. That is what now strengthens the values that \nare shared throughout Europe and that allow us better \nto understand democracy\u2019s transformational sweep \nthroughout the world. \n We now face the most important challenges \nhumanity has ever faced. The negative impact of \nclimate change has only been exacerbated by the global \nfinancial and economic crisis, the food crisis, the rise \nin energy prices and pandemics. The world is \nexperiencing increasingly tense situations that make \nour efforts to meet the challenges of the new century \neven more sensitive. We have now to address terrorism, \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nprolonged conflicts, failed States, food and energy \ninsecurity, migration, poverty and the violation of \nhuman rights. \n I hope that, in the face of not just of one but of \nmany challenges, Member States will make this \nsituation an opportunity for visionary change. Through \nthe implementation of solutions to the economic and \nfinancial crisis and responses to the negative effects of \nclimate change, we can aspire to create greener \neconomies and jobs, societies more responsible in their \nuse of energy, improved infrastructure, and financial \ninstruments strong enough to support such a transition. \n(spoke in English) \n I would like to refer to a key topic on the United \nNations agenda: climate change. I do not intend to \nreiterate all its negative effects or the danger it poses to \nthe very existence of humankind. Members are well \naware of all of them, and we have been speaking about \nthem extensively over this past week. However, I do \nwant to stress the principles that underpin Romania\u2019s \napproach to this issue and that we would like to invite \nMembers to consider as well. \n Nature is part of our daily life. If we respect \nnature, we can take long-term benefits from it, making \nus better prepared to design and build our future. \nRespect is essential. We are all affected by climate \nchange. There is no boundary to protect a certain \ncountry or a certain area. It is not as if something \nhappening in the Pacific is not also the business of \nsomebody living in a developed European capital. That \nmeans that we all have a common responsibility \ntowards others. We must be aware that everything we \ndo and any decision we take has an impact on others. \nThat is why it is so important to base our decisions on \nsuch values as human respect, solidarity and \nresponsibility. \n \n \n41 09-52592 \n \n We commend the Secretary-General for his \ndedication and commitment in dealing with this issue. \nBy bringing us together as world leaders seeking \nconsensus on what is to be done about climate change, \nhe has rallied us to work towards the Conference in \nCopenhagen. We expect an ambitious agreement to be \nreached in Copenhagen. \n Another challenge that affects us all is that of the \nglobal financial and economic crisis. Again, solutions \nmust be to the benefit of all. We need to join forces \nrapidly to resume economic growth and development, \nreform financial instruments and preserve international \nstability. The world financial system no longer meets \nthe needs and realities of our time. The institutions \nmonitoring that system have to be reformed. We need \nto create an early prevention and early warning \nmechanism, and the United Nations should be \nentrusted with more resources and prerogatives as the \nmain coordinator for the delivery of global public \ngoods. Our task will be to ensure discipline and \npredictability within the system, while preserving the \nfreedom of the market as the main engine of economic \ngrowth. We welcome in this respect the commitments \nundertaken at the summit of the Group of Eight to \ndiscourage protectionism and ensure the conclusion of \nthe Doha negotiations by 2010. \n We need a twenty-first century multilateralism \nthat is both innovative and pragmatic. Romania is \ndevoted to that cause and seeks to expand its \ncooperation with the United Nations in ever more \ncreative and pragmatic ways. To illustrate Romania\u2019s \ninterests and its more concrete contributions to the \nUnited Nations system, I am proud to point to just two \nmajor projects that came to fruition this year. The \nopening of the first emergency transit centre for \nrefugees in Timisoara, the first such body in the world, \nwas the result of excellent cooperation with the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and the \nInternational Organization for Migration. The second \nproject is the signing, here in New York, of a \nmemorandum of understanding between the \nGovernment of Romania and the United Nations \nregarding the training of United Nations close \nprotection personnel within the Centre for Excellence \nof the Romanian Protection and Guard Service, to be \nopened soon in Bucharest. \n In all our endeavours to identify a stronger \nmultilateral approach to guaranteeing a safer and more \nsustainable system, we should all consider at least four \nessential elements. The first is managing the current \neconomic crisis so as to secure sustainable \ndevelopment and growth. The second is staying \nfocused on the demanding and interconnected issues of \nclimate change, poverty, food security, health, energy, \nmigration and the lack of democracy in some parts of \nthe world, while maintaining international peace, \nsecurity and stability. The third element concerns the \nconsolidation of international law. The fourth concerns \nstrengthening and increasing the efficiency of \ninternational institutions. \n The United Nations and its bodies must be at the \ncentre of this renewed multilateralism with what the \nOrganization does best \u2014 promoting development and \nsecurity while advancing democracy, human rights, the \nrule of law and social development. At the Millennium \nSummit, we all pledged to boost the role of this unique \nand indispensable Organization. Indeed, in recent \nyears, the United Nations has undergone a wide-\nranging process of realignment and reform. However, it \nis also very evident that reform of some of the most \nimportant United Nations bodies is still slow and \ninconsistent. I hope that, in the months and years to \ncome we will see more progress in this respect. \n Romania continues to share the view that the \noverarching goal of reforming the Security Council \nshould be to achieve a more effective, transparent and \nrepresentative body, and will join in any effort to that \nend. Since the intergovernmental negotiations in \nFebruary, the reform process has shifted into a higher \ngear, allowing us to pursue the mandate set forth at the \n2005 World Summit. \n Another significant decision contained in the \n2005 Outcome Document (resolution 60/1) concerns a \ncrucial issue: the responsibility to protect. A few \nmonths ago, the General Assembly held a very \nconstructive debate on how to implement this concept. \nThe responsibility to protect is one of the most \nimportant conceptual evolutions for the United \nNations. This path should be thoroughly explored by \nMember States, as it holds tremendous preventive \npotential. \n Solutions to the challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury should also make more use of efficient regional \nmechanisms. I am referring to organizations such as \nthe African Union, the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \n  \n \n09-52592 42 \n \nand NATO, which are either cooperative bodies or ones \ndirected towards regional integration. \n The potential of smaller, knowledgeable groups \nof States to address the problems of a region is high. If \nsupported, such regional groups can more easily muster \npolitical will and the capacity to act. This is \nparticularly true in situations related to peace and \nsecurity, where swift and decisive action is often \nrequired. \n While serving its mandate in the Security Council \nin 2005, Romania promoted the Council\u2019s resolution \n1631 (2005), which sought to strengthen cooperation \nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \nin maintaining peace and security. Since then, a lot has \nbeen done in this respect, but the potential for action \nunder Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter is \nstill to be fully unleashed. \n Unfortunately, there are still crises around the \nglobe that cannot be resolved by regional means alone. \nWe continue to face protracted regional security \nchallenges, such as those in the Middle East and \nvarious parts of Africa, as well as the South Caucasus \nand the Black Sea region. Reconstruction efforts in \nAfghanistan are turning out to be more complex and \ndifficult than we all initially thought. Such situations \nrequire our undivided attention and comprehensive \nefforts. \n My country is investing a great deal in the \nstability and security of the world. More than \n1,500 Romanian troops serve in United Nations-\nmandated and -authorized missions in all areas of the \nglobe, from Kosovo to Afghanistan, from Bosnia and \nHerzegovina to the Sudan. In recent years, Romania \nhas been honoured to be able to participate, along with \nits allies and partners, in the stabilization and \nreconstruction of Iraq. At the end of June, Romanian \ntroops concluded their mission there, leaving Iraq with \nthe satisfaction of an accomplished mandate. The Iraqi \nsecurity framework has improved significantly. The \nsame could be done in Afghanistan. By keeping its \ncommitment steady and deepening it when needed, it \nwill be possible for the international community to \nsucceed in consolidating a sovereign Afghan nation. \n Among the perils that threaten us most, terrorism \nand the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nremain of major concern. Nuclear proliferation is of \nparticular concern, given the increasing accessibility of \ntechnology capable of large-scale destruction. In this \ncontext, we urge those Member States that are \nconsidering nuclear programmes to fully heed the \nconcerns of the world community and to abide strictly \nby international norms and regulations. \n Lately, there have been encouraging signs in the \nrealm of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. \nWe highly appreciate the recent agreement of the \nPresidents of the United States and the Russian \nFederation for nuclear arsenal cuts, confirming the \ncommitments undertaken by those two States. As there \nhave also been positive indications from the United \nStates with respect to its ratification of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the \ninternational community can now feel confident that \nthe biggest nuclear Powers are determined to advance \nthe nuclear disarmament process. \n(spoke in French) \n It has been said that violence begets violence, but \nto ignore or not take into account the basic principles \nof human rights would be to do the same. In the same \nway, intolerance fuels further intolerance. We can \ndebate historical themes, but we cannot deny history \naltogether. The tragedies, crimes against humanity and \ngenocides are sins of the past, but they should also be \nlessons for the present and the future. \n We have already demonstrated our willingness \nand capacity to accept our past in a critical way. \nRomania reiterates its commitment to combating \nextremism, xenophobia and all forms of racism and \ndiscrimination. At the same time, my country actively \npromotes diversity and multiculturalism, as well as \nintercultural and interreligious dialogue in the \nframework of the International Organization of la \nFrancophonie and the Alliance of Civilizations. \n Unfortunately, democracy is too often a slippery \nterm in the diplomatic framework of the United \nNations. But we cannot have a stable world and meet \nthe challenges that face us without promoting certain \nvalues \u2014 freedom, democracy, the rule of law and \nrespect for human rights \u2014 that have been of proven \nbenefit to humanity. We must continue to help the men, \nwomen and children of the world to choose their future \nfreely, enjoy decent employment and trust the authority \nof law and justice. \n Democracy and the rule of law constitute the \nimmune system of human society. Just as it is \nimpossible to fight off disease when the immune \n \n \n43 09-52592 \n \nsystem is weak, poverty spreads in a degraded \nenvironment. Whether it is a matter of creating equality \nin the areas of gender and health, achieving education \nfor all or ensuring a clean environment, it is not merely \na matter of funding, it is just as much about \nestablishing the basic principles of human rights and \ndemocracy. \n I should like to conclude by expressing my \nconviction that there is no challenge too great for our \ncountries as long as we remain united. No threat is too \npowerful to destroy us if we succeed in mobilizing our \nwisdom and our capabilities."

        "file_text": "On \nbehalf of Ukraine, I congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki of Libya on his election to preside over the sixty-\nfourth session of the General Assembly. I wish him \nevery success in his activities. \n Every year we all gather here at high level in the \nGeneral Assembly to present our own national views \non the life of our planet and its peoples. We strive to \nget the feeling of the overall emotional setting and \npulse of human energy, ideas and quests. The \nemotional setting of Ukraine is open, principled and \ntolerant. \n We have gathered here not to offend each other or \nexchange insults, but to resolve our common problems. \nI call upon all of us to use tolerance against bigotry, \nmalignancy and arrogance. I say this on behalf of a \nnation whose last lustrum is unique in terms of \nchallenges and progress. \n We in Ukraine live in an atmosphere of \nstrengthening freedom. This process is both grand and \ncomplex. Its difficulties discourage idealists and \nnurture authoritarian forces, yet they are another alpine \npeak for all who are enlightened to ascend. The \nmilestone at which our nation stands today is the basis \nfor moving forward to a free and safe life, to revive our \nown millennium-old tradition and its interrupted ties \nand to be again an active part of global civilization. \n Our democratic choice is irreversible. As a free \nnation, we shall not accept any forms of interference in \nthe internal affairs of sovereign States, any pressure on \nthem or manifestations of authoritarian thinking in \ninternational relations. We remember the price paid by \nour fathers for our freedom, for the freedom of Europe \nand the world, and for the future independence of \nUkraine. \n We shall soon commemorate the sixty-fifth \nanniversary of the victory over fascism. This joint \nvictory of the anti-Hitler coalition is sacred. The \nmission of all countries which remember the horrors of \nfascism is to avert any hint of a restoration of \ntotalitarian ideology and its derivative: the policy of \nimperial ambitions, neglecting the value of human life \nand violating the right of peoples to sovereign national \nexistence. \n I raise this issue because we are witnessing the \nre-emergence of very disconcerting signals from the \npast, ranging from questioning the very existence of \nnewly independent States to denying nations\u2019 own \nviews on their past and future. We are concerned about \nthe substitution of concepts and approaches. \nCooperation, openness and friendship between nations \nare being explicitly confronted by aggressive national \negotism, which ignores the interests of close partners \n \n \n41 09-52228 \n \nand dictates the right of the powerful. Unconcealed \ninformation wars, energy blackmail and economic \nblackmail, as well as interference in sovereign affairs, \nfall outside the civilized framework. \n Most important, we strongly condemn and shall \nnot accept any violations of fundamental international \nprinciples \u2014 in particular, territorial integrity and the \ninviolability of the frontiers of all sovereign States. \n It is axiomatic for us that all United Nations \nMember States, and especially the permanent members \nof the Security Council, must be exemplary in abiding \nby the principles of international law, of equality of \nnations and of neighbourliness, for our Charter, which \nremains unbroken, entrusts the Security Council with \nthe primary responsibility for maintaining international \npeace and security. \n Ukraine acts in strict compliance with the goals \nand principles of the United Nations, and expects the \nsame from its partners and neighbours. \n Today I have the honour to confirm Ukraine\u2019s \nresolve to become a Security Council member in 2016-\n2017. \n Our country has been and will always remain a \nreliable partner of the United Nations in all  peace and \nsecurity matters and in collective actions fostering \nstability in every region, especially in Africa. This year \nI approved the strategy of Ukraine\u2019s international \npeacekeeping activity, which will consolidate our \ncontribution and participation in this field. \n Safety of peacekeepers has been constantly the \nfocus of Ukraine\u2019s attention. As one of the initiators of \nthe Convention on the Safety of United Nations and \nAssociated Personnel, we propose that the General \nAssembly consider additional measures to strengthen \nthe legal protection of participants in peacekeeping \noperations. \n Almost 15 years ago Ukraine voluntarily gave up \nthe third largest nuclear potential and acceded to the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear \nState. We welcome the steps taken by the United States \nand the Russian Federation to elaborate a new \nagreement to replace the Treaty between the Union of \nSoviet Socialist Republics and the United States on the \nReduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, \nof 31 July 1991, which expires this year. \n At the same time, Ukraine continues to count on \nthe support of the Security Council permanent \nmembers for our proposal to enhance security \nassurances for non-nuclear States, in particular for \nthose which have voluntarily renounced nuclear \nweapons or their development. That will become an \nimportant incentive for many countries. \n Ukraine will continue to act responsibly and \nconstructively in matters of military and security \ncooperation. \n We strictly abide by Security Council resolutions, \nand adhere to all established international regimes. Our \nposition in this sphere is consistent with all our \ninternational obligations. It is verified, balanced and \nunchangeable. \n I wish to dwell on an issue of the utmost \nimportance for Ukraine: the global fight against \nmaritime piracy. We value all the efforts of the United \nNations and the International Maritime Organization \n(IMO) in this regard. However, the measures taken so \nfar have not been sufficient. \n Almost 60,000 Ukrainian citizens are employed \non ships under foreign flags. Any developments on the \nhigh seas affect us directly. In the last seven years \nalone pirates have attacked 18 vessels with Ukrainian \nsailors on board, and in the last nine months alone \n35 Ukrainian sailors have been taken hostage. It is no \nlonger a local problem; it has become very dangerous \nand threatens us all. We shall not turn a blind eye to it. \n Ukraine was among the sponsors of IMO \nresolution A.1002 (25), entitled \u201cPiracy and armed \nrobbery against ships operating in waters off the coast \nof Somalia\u201d, which laid the ground for further Security \nCouncil resolutions in that regard. We strongly support \nthe elaboration of uniform, clear rules to fight pirates \nand to protect sailors. We are convinced that the \nGeneral Assembly has to become a coordinating body \nfor the efforts of all specialized institutions in this \nfield. We call for a more active stance by those United \nNations Members which are main countries of origin of \nmarine workers and by those States and organizations \ncapable of making an impact on the safety of \ninternational maritime navigation. \n On behalf of Ukraine, I propose to examine \ncarefully the idea of establishing in one of the African \ncountries a regional centre under the United Nations \naegis which would bring under its umbrella specialized \n  \n \n09-52228 42 \n \nagencies, programmes and funds, as well as political \noffices, to counter piracy. I want to be clear: Ukraine \nwill be actively engaged in all international \nendeavours, and we intend to join the European Union \nAtalanta anti-piracy naval operation. \n As President of Ukraine, I urge the General \nAssembly to debate these very critical issues in a \nseparate meeting. \n We face manifold challenges that we can resolve \nonly by concerted efforts. I am convinced that one of \nthe most acute problems for us all is the global \nfinancial crisis. Ukraine welcomes decisions of \nmultilateral forums, in particular those of the Group of \n20, as the leading instrument to counter the crisis. \n In this process, our Organization can and should \nplay its role in preventing the financial perturbations \nfrom spinning out into social upheavals. Perhaps it is \ntime to revisit the idea, put forward earlier by Ukraine \nand recently by a number of other countries, of the \ncreation of a United Nations economic security \ncouncil. The large scale of this proposal should not \nprompt us to shelve it or reject it altogether. \n In addition, decisions on the financing of United \nNations activities within regular reviews of the scale of \nassessments must be taken with due account of the \nglobal crisis. \n The principal and most important objective for \nour universal Organization and for each of our \ncountries is to protect common people from the crisis \nand to prevent the decline of their living standards.  \n Despite all the economic difficulties, Ukraine is \naware of its responsibility to support other countries \nthat have suffered even more. This year Ukraine has \nbecome a World Food Programme donor. We hope that \nour contribution will save millions of lives in Africa. I \nsay to our dear partners that Ukraine understands very \nwell your needs, and we shall strive to save people \nsuffering from hunger.  \n We have gathered here today to get the feeling of \nthe overall emotional setting of our planet. Ukraine\u2019s \nemotional setting is resolute, persevering and \nbenevolent. \n We believe in our Organization. We are capable \nof great achievements. I am firmly convinced of our \nstrength to move forward confidently for the benefit of \nthe world, our peoples and countries."

By the same token, I \nconvey our great appreciation to Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his leadership and his commitment to \nthe work of the Organization at a time when our world \nis facing numerous grave challenges. \n In recent years, the international situation has \nundergone rapid changes and faced various challenges. \nThe United Nations, a unique world body, has been \nplaying an increasingly important role in maintaining \ninternational peace and security and promoting the \npeaceful settlement of disputes and international \ncooperation for development. In this rapidly changing \nworld, it is our common duty and responsibility as \nMembers of the United Nations to ensure that the \nOrganization carry out its mandate effectively. To this \nend, United Nations reform is crucial and should be \ncomprehensive, transparent and balanced, while the \nOrganization should maintain its intergovernmental, \nuniversal and democratic character, consistent with the \nCharter. \n The revitalization of the General Assembly, \nreform of the Security Council and the strengthening of \nthe Economic and Social Council and specialized \nagencies should be guided by the principles of \ndemocracy, transparency and accountability with a \nview to making this universal Organization a body that \ntruly represents the interests of all Member States and \nseeks their benefit. In this context, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic welcomes the launching of \nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \nreform and will continue to contribute to these \nimportant efforts in this new phase of the Security \nCouncil reform process. \n The ongoing impasse within the multilateral \ndisarmament machinery continues to undermine \ninternational peace and security. The existence of \nnuclear weapons remains a grave threat to the existence \nof all humankind. It is therefore vital to reaffirm the \nimportance of States honouring their nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation obligations. The \nupcoming 2010 Review Conference will be a great \nopportunity for the States parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to demonstrate \nstrong political commitment by making a collective \neffort to resolve the current stalemate on the \nnon-proliferation and disarmament agenda. In this \nregard, it is encouraging that the third session of the \nPreparatory Committee for the 2010 Review \nConference successfully adopted the agenda and all \nsignificant procedural decisions, which will \nundoubtedly lay an important foundation for a \nproductive and successful Review Conference in 2010. \n In conjunction with arms reduction and nuclear \ndisarmament, the issue of explosive remnants of war, \nincluding cluster munitions and unexploded ordnance \n(UXO), continues to threaten and pose serious \nobstacles to socio-economic development and poverty \neradication efforts in more than 80 countries across the \nworld. Among these, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic is the most affected. The victims of cluster \nmunitions in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \u2014 \nwhere approximately 300 victims have been recorded \nevery year for the 30 years since the war ended \u2014 \naccount for 50 per cent of the global total of cluster \nmunitions victims. This is due to the fact that 37 per \ncent of national territory remains contaminated by \nUXO. Enormous financial resources would be needed \n \n \n39 09-52586 \n \nto resolve this problem, and it would take a great \nlength of time to clear UXOs from those areas needed \nmost for development and the everyday livelihoods of \ncommunities. However, a precise estimate has yet to be \nmade as to how many hundreds of years it would take \nto clear all UXO-contaminated areas across the \ncountry. \n In light of the adverse impact of cluster \nmunitions, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nattaches great importance to the Convention on \nbanning and eradicating cluster munitions. In this \ncontext, we welcome and commend those countries \nthat have signed and ratified the Convention, and hope \nthat other countries that have not done so will follow \nsuit so that Convention may enter into force as soon as \npossible. In order to prepare for the future \nimplementation of the Convention, the Lao \nGovernment has offered to host the first conference of \nStates parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions \nafter it enters into force. We hope that our offer will \nreceive broad support from all countries and \ninternational organizations. \n Despite the fact that peace, development and \ncooperation are the lodestars of our times, tensions, \nconflicts, violence, terrorism and threats to security \npersist in various parts of the world. The Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic is deeply dismayed by the \nprolonged conflict in the Middle East, which continues \nto inflict immense suffering on millions of people in \nthe region, in particular the Palestinian people, who \nhave been struggling to exercise their legitimate and \ninalienable rights to self-determination and statehood. \nAlthough we have heard in the course of our general \ndebate many expressions of encouragement and \nrenewed hope for addressing the Middle East problem, \nthis can be realized only if all parties concerned \ndemonstrate their commitment to addressing the \nimpasse with a view to realizing the vision of two \nStates, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace \nand security within recognized borders, in accordance \nwith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. \n We also remain concerned over the decades-long \neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \non the Republic of Cuba. It is now time to end these \nsanctions. \n Climate change continues to be a pressing \nconcern and to pose enormous challenges to the \nsurvival of humankind. Against this backdrop, global \nmeasures that conform to the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibility are urgently required. To \nthis end, the integration of the three pillars of \nsustainable development \u2014 economic development, \nsocial development and environmental protection \u2014 \nshould be enhanced with a view to effectively \nimplementing the Bali Action Plan.  \n In this context, we highly commend the \nSecretary-General for his initiative to convene the \nhigh-level Summit on Climate Change on \n22 September 2009, at which world leaders had the \nopportunity to discuss concrete measures and potential \nsolutions to the consequences of climate change, as \nwell as to prepare for the Climate Change Conference \nto be held in Copenhagen, Denmark. Furthermore, \nworld leaders have made strong commitments to taking \nthe necessary action to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, promote the green economy, provide \nmitigation and adaptation assistance, and generate \nalternative energy, including through technology \ntransfer from developed to developing countries, in \norder to enable the latter to adapt to the consequences \nand impacts of climate change. \n The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic welcomes \nand supports the recommendation to launch a new \nGlobal Compact entailing a green New Deal, which \nwould no doubt provide an excellent platform for \naddressing the current global challenges, promoting \ninvestment in the green economy, laying the \nfoundations to deal with the crucial long-term issues, \nand helping to create a future based on a low-carbon \neconomy, renewable energy and energy efficiency. \n The multiple global crises, especially the \nfinancial and economic crises, have had many adverse \neffects on developing countries, in particular on the \nmost vulnerable groups. This is due primarily to the \nlack of basic infrastructure, access to markets, \nresources and modern technology, and to the fact that \ncapacity to provide financing and investment remains \nlow. In response, various forms of consultation and \napproach have been undertaken in an attempt to \nmitigate the long-term impacts of the crisis. In this \nregard, we welcome the initiatives of the Group of \nEight, the Group of 20 and other international forums \nto build a mechanism that will help find solutions to \nthe crisis, including the recommendations of the high-\nlevel Conference on the World Financial and Economic \nCrisis held here in June this year. \n  \n \n09-52586 40 \n \n As one of the most vulnerable countries in the \nworld, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is of the \nview that all initiatives and measures undertaken must \nbe implemented effectively and in a timely manner. In \nparticular, it is important to address the \nunpredictability and vulnerability of commodity \nmarkets, provide preferential treatment to goods from \ndeveloping countries, especially those from the most \nvulnerable ones, ensure the smooth resolution of debt \nissues, improve technology transfer mechanism and \nreform the international financial system.  \n The fourth United Nations Conference on the \nLeast Developed Countries, to be held in early 2011, \nwill provide a good opportunity for the international \ncommunity to review its responsibilities and \ncommitments pledged to the least developed countries, \nas well as to identify obstacles and constraints and seek \npossible solutions to them, particularly in the wake of \nsuch a profound economic and financial crisis. \n The solid political stability and social order in the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic have provided \nfavourable conditions for national economic \ndevelopment. Nevertheless, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic has also been adversely affected \nat a certain level by the recent global economic and \nfinancial crisis. The crisis has caused a slowdown in \neconomic development, with growth of the main \neconomic sectors such as industry, services and \nagriculture decreasing by 2 to 3 per cent. The trade \nsector was also affected, with exports dropping by \n28 per cent.  \n Against this backdrop, the Lao Government has \nundertaken urgent action by identifying eight measures \nand 80 priority areas to address. As a result of such \naction, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has been \nable to mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis to a \ncertain degree. However, owing to the uncertainty of \ntoday\u2019s global economy, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, like other developing countries, remains \nvulnerable and still needs the support and cooperation \nfrom the international community to respond to the \ncrisis, with a view to preventing long-term impacts, \nwhich may occur at any time, and to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals and our ultimate \nnational goal of being removed from the list of least \ndeveloped countries by 2020. \n Today, more than ever, the international \ncommunity has the responsibility, as well as the \nopportunity, to promote solidarity and strengthen \ninternational cooperation in jointly addressing these \nglobal problems, as no country can weather alone the \nthreats and challenges confronting it. In this spirit, the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic reiterates its \nunshakable commitment to continue full cooperation \nwith the international community in pursuit of a world \nfree from fear and want, rooted in a new, just and \nequitable order. I believe that, with great solidarity, we \nwill be able to achieve the aforementioned goals."

        "file_text": "As you, Sir, \nassume the presidency of the General Assembly at this \nsixty-fourth session, my delegation wishes you all the \nbest in your endeavours and looks forward to working \nwith you to address the many challenges facing the \nglobal community. \n Every year, anticipation surrounds the General \nAssembly in the hope that Governments will be able to \nfind points of agreement on the persisting problems \nthat afflict humankind and to adopt a common \ndirection for resolving them in a peaceful manner for \nthe well-being of all. Understandably, the deliberations \nof the preceding session of the General Assembly were \ndominated by preoccupation with the world financial \nand economic crisis. It is only fitting that this year \ndelegations have been asked to focus on the theme \n\u201cEffective responses to global crises: strengthening \nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for \ninternational peace, security and development\u201d. \n In view of a political and cultural dialogue \noriented towards the harmonious evolving of the world \neconomy and of international relations, we would do \nwell to revisit the Preamble of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, where it affirms that \u201cWe the peoples \nof the United Nations determined \u2026 to reaffirm faith \nin fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth \nof the human person, in the equal rights of men and \nwomen and of nations large and small\u201d.  \n The various world crises that have intertwined in \nthe past months bring to the discussion presuppositions \nof thought and principles of individual, social and \ninternational behaviour that extend well beyond the \nfinancial or economic fields. The idea of producing \nresources and assets \u2014 which is the economy \u2014 and \nstrategically managing them \u2014 which is politics \u2014 \nwithout seeking together with the same actions to carry \nout also the good \u2014 which is ethics \u2014 has been proven \nto be a naive or cynical and fatal delusion. The more \nsolid and profound contribution that the General \nAssembly must make to the solution of international \nproblems lies in promoting the principles contained in \nthe Preamble and in Article 1 of the Charter of this \nOrganization in a manner that such high human and \nspiritual values serve to renovate the international \norder from within, where the real crisis lies. \n A first element of truth is found precisely in the \nphrase \u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d. The \ntheme of peace and development, in fact, coincides \nwith that of the relational inclusion of all peoples in the \nunique community of the human family that is \nconstructed in solidarity. Evident in the various Group \nof Eight, Group of 20, regional and international \nmeetings, held in parallel with the work of the \npreceding General Assembly, was the necessity to give \nlegitimacy to the political commitments assumed and \nto confront them with the thoughts and needs of the \nentire international community so that the solutions \ndevised would reflect the points of view and the \n \n \n43 09-53165 \n \nexpectations of the populations of all continents. That \nis why efficacious modes must be found to connect the \ndecisions of the various groupings of countries to those \nof the United Nations, where every nation, with its \npolitical and economic weight, can legitimately explain \nitself in a situation of equality with others. \n It is in that context of truth and sincerity that the \nrecent appeal of Pope Benedict XVI can be seen in \nperspective. As he notes in his encyclical \u201cCharity in \nTruth\u201d, in the face of the unrelenting growth of global \ninterdependence there is a strongly felt need, even in \nthe midst of a global recession, for an urgent reform of \nthe United Nations, and likewise of economic \ninstitutions and international finance, so that the \nconcept of the family of nations can acquire real teeth. \nSuch reform is urgent in order to find innovative ways \nof implementing the principles of the responsibility to \nprotect and of giving poorer nations an effective voice \nin shared decision-making. \n Admittedly, building the United Nations as a true \ncentre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the \nattainment of those common ends is an extremely \ndifficult task. The more the interdependence of peoples \nincreases, the more the necessity of the United Nations \nbecomes evident. The need to have an organization \ncapable of responding to the obstacles and increasing \ncomplexity of the relations between peoples and \nnations thus becomes paramount. \n As we consider the nature of development and the \nrole of donor and recipient countries, we must always \nremember that true development necessarily involves \nan integral respect for human life, which cannot be \ndisconnected from the development of peoples. \nUnfortunately, in some parts of the world today, \ndevelopment aid seems to be tied rather to the recipient \ncountries\u2019 willingness to adopt programmes that \ndiscourage demographic growth by methods and \npractices disrespectful of human rights and dignity. \n In that regard, it is both cynical and unfortunate \nthat frequent attempts continue to be made to export \nsuch a mentality to developing countries, as if it were a \nform of cultural progress or advancement. Yet such a \npractice is by its nature not one of reciprocity but \nimposition, and to predicate the decision to give \ndevelopment aid on the acceptance of such policies \nconstitutes an abuse of power. \n Every human being has the right to good \ngovernance, that is, the right to participate in all social \nactions, at the national and international level, whether \ndirectly or indirectly, as a guarantee for all persons a \nfree and dignified life. At the same time, it is an \nessential part of that dignity that everyone takes \nresponsibility for his actions and actively respects the \ndignity of others. \n Rights always exist inseparably from \nresponsibilities and duties. This applies to individual \nmen and women and, by analogy, to States, whose true \nprogress and affirmation depends on their capacity to \nestablish and maintain responsible relations with other \nStates and to express a shared responsibility for world \nproblems. \n The implementation of the principle of the \nresponsibility to protect, as formulated at the 2005 \nWorld Summit and approved by the unanimous \nconsensus of all United Nations Member States, \nbecomes a touchstone of the two enunciated principles \nof truth in international relations and of global \ngovernance. \n The recognition of the core objective and \nindispensability of the dignity of every man and \nwoman ensures that Governments always undertake \nwith every means at their disposal to prevent and \ncombat crimes of genocide, ethnic cleansing and any \nother crimes against humanity. Thus, by recognizing \ntheir interconnected responsibility to protect States will \nrealize the importance of accepting the collaboration of \nthe international community as a means of fulfilling \ntheir role of providing responsible sovereignty. \n The mechanisms of the United Nations for \naddressing common security and the prevention of \nconflicts were developed in response to the threat of \ntotal war and nuclear destruction in the second half of \nthe last century, and for this reason alone they deserve \nperennial historical remembrance. Moreover, the work \nof peacekeepers have stabilized and ended innumerable \nlocal conflicts and have made related reconstruction \npossible. \n Nevertheless, it is well known that the number of \nconflicts that the United Nations has not been able to \nresolve remains high and that many of them have \nbecome occasions of serious crimes against humanity. \nThat is why the acceptance of the principle of the \nresponsibility to protect and of the underlying truths \nthat guide responsible sovereignty can be the catalyst \nfor the reform of the mechanisms, procedures and \nrepresentativeness of the Security Council. \n \n \n09-53165 44 \n \n In this context, my delegation would like to recall \nhere the Honduran people, who continue to suffer \nfrustration and hardship from the already too long \npolitical upheaval. Once more, the Holy See urges the \nparties concerned to make every effort to find a prompt \nsolution in view of the good of the people of Honduras. \n This session of the General Assembly began with \nthe special Summit on Climate Change, and in \nDecember there will be the Copenhagen Climate \nConference. The protection of the environment \ncontinues to be at the forefront of multilateral \nactivities, because it involves, in consistent form, the \ndestiny of all the nations and the future of every \nindividual man and woman. \n Recognition of the double truths of \ninterdependence and personal dignity also requires that \nenvironmental issues are taken as a moral imperative \nand translated into legal rules, capable of protecting \nour planet and ensuring future generations a healthy \nand safe environment. \n In closing, I would like to say that in these \nchanging times the international community \u2014 \u201cwe, \nthe peoples\u201d \u2014 has the unique chance and \nresponsibility to ensure full implementation of the \nUnited Nations Charter and thus greater peace and \nunderstanding among nations.

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by \nextending my warm congratulations to you, Sir, on \nyour election to the presidency of the Assembly at its \ncurrent session. As an incumbent Vice-President, I \nassure you of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation in the \ndischarge of your responsibilities. I also take this \nopportunity to place on record our appreciation for \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, the outgoing President, \nfor his exemplary leadership during the sixty-third \nsession.  \n I thank the Secretary-General for his \ncomprehensive report on the work of the Organization \n(A/64/1). We appreciate his efficient stewardship on \nvarious issues of critical global significance and on the \nreform of the United Nations. He also deserves our \nthanks for supporting the nationally driven peace \nprocess of Nepal. \n I bring greetings and good wishes from the \npeople and Government of Nepal, a country that \nexpresses unswerving commitment to the ideals of the \nUnited Nations. We look to the Organization as a true \nadvocate and upholder of the universal values of peace, \njustice, equality, freedom and human dignity. As was \nso aptly recognized in the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2), the United Nations is indeed the \nindispensable common house of the entire human \nfamily. A more efficient and stronger United Nations is \nobviously in the interest of us all. \n Sovereign equality, territorial integrity, political \nindependence, non-interference and the peaceful \nsettlement of international disputes have become the \nbedrock of inter-State relations. These principles, \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter more than six \ndecades ago, represent the highest ideals of \ncontemporary international relations. They have stood \nthe test of time and proved to be timeless and \nuniversal. They provide the basis for the smooth and \nharmonious conduct of international relations among \nStates that are sovereign, independent and \ninterconnected. As we march towards increasing \ninterdependence through globalization, these well-\nestablished principles and norms of inter-State \nrelations assume even greater relevance for us. \n History stands testimony to the fact that human \ncivilization has no linear progression. We live in \nchanging times. Today, the nature, speed and scope of \nsuch changes are astounding. New opportunities and \nunforeseen challenges always await us along our way \nto peace, progress and prosperity. We often find \nourselves at the crossroads of stability and peace, on \nthe one hand, and conflict and domination, on the \nother. It is only with principled stands and \ndetermination that we have moved towards peace and \ndevelopment throughout history. Whenever we have \ndigressed from these principles, perils and catastrophes \nhave visited us. International solidarity and a true spirit \nof global partnership are therefore indispensable, and \nmultilateralism offers the best means and opportunity \nto address the global problems of our times. \n Nepal is currently in the midst of a great political \ntransition. With the signing of the Comprehensive \nPeace Accord in November 2006, our decade-long \narmed conflict ended and a nationally driven peace \nprocess is now in progress. The Constituent Assembly, \nconsisting of 601 members elected through a mixed-\nproportional system, has been writing a new, \ndemocratic and republican constitution. It is one of the \nmost inclusive and representative elected bodies in the \nhistory of Nepal. Almost one third of the Constituent \nAssembly members are women, and a fair number \nrepresent the country\u2019s various ethnic minorities. \nThematic committees on various aspects of the new \nconstitution have been preparing their respective \nreports following a process of broad consultations with \nthe Nepali people. We are determined to take the peace \nprocess to a positive and meaningful conclusion, as \nenvisaged in the Comprehensive Peace Accord, by \nbuilding consensus among the political parties through \ndialogue and consultations. \n We are a multi-ethnic, multilingual and \nmultireligious country. As we have opted for a Federal \nDemocratic Republic, we are now restructuring the \nState by organizing it into federal units, as desired by \nthe people of Nepal. We believe democracy is more \nmeaningful when it is closer to the people. We believe \nthat reconfiguring the State into federal units is one \nsuch significant step towards deepening the roots of \ndemocracy in our country. \n My Government has four major tasks at hand: \ntaking the peace process to its positive and meaningful \nconclusion, writing a new democratic constitution \nthrough the Constituent Assembly within the stipulated \ntime frame, speeding up the country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment to lift it up from poverty, and meeting the \n \n \n33 09-52586 \n \nrising expectations of our people in a new democratic \nenvironment. We have been doing our best to \naccomplish these tasks through dialogue, consultations \nand consensus among the country\u2019s major political \nparties. \n Looking at the overall progress we have made \nover the past three years, there is reason to be forward-\nlooking and optimistic about Nepal\u2019s peace process. \nWe have come a long way in terms of our transition \nfrom the decade-long violent conflict. As in every \npost-conflict situation, there have been ups and downs \nalong the way. Managing the legacy of the violent past \nwith justice and reconciliation and mainstreaming all \nthe forces involved into a democratic order are the \nmajor challenges before us. \n We are for democratic order, peace and stability. \nThere is no place either for extremism or for permanent \ninstability in Nepal. The Government is doing its best \nto ensure moderation in order to institutionalize \ndemocratic rules and ideals and to leave conflict \npermanently behind. I am sure that there is a common \nunderstanding on this issue within the country and \namong our friends in the international community. The \ndesire to avoid a relapse into conflict and to fulfil the \nhopes and aspirations of the people has constantly \nprodded us to move forward with dialogue, consensus \nand unity of purpose. We know that we still have far to \ngo, and we are determined to reach our destination \u2014 a \npeaceful, prosperous and stable Nepal. \n In achieving that, we know we must be alert to \nthe desire of our people for both freedom and \ndevelopment. Freedom rings hollow when there is no \ndevelopment. Development loses its soul if it is not \naccompanied by freedom. These are our twin goals, \nand my Government is committed to pursuing them \nwith clear vision and commitment. \n I am confident that we will have the continuous \nsupport and cooperation of the international \ncommunity in achieving these goals. Needless to say, \nany failure to address the rising expectations of our \npeople and to provide peace dividends to those affected \nby the conflict at the grass-roots level, may have \nunintended consequences that challenge the peace and \ndemocratization processes in Nepal and elsewhere. \nTherefore, to promote the positive conclusion of the \npeace process and to institutionalize our hard-won \ndemocracy, the Nepali people deserve support for \nrehabilitation, compensation and reconstruction arising \nfrom the damage that occurred during the conflict. I \nrequest special support from development partners in \naddressing our post-conflict development challenges. \n We are fully committed to the protection and \npromotion of human rights. Since the end of the \ndecade-long armed conflict and the beginning of the \npeace process in 2006, the human rights situation in the \ncountry has improved significantly. The Government is \ndetermined to establish a truth and reconciliation \ncommission and a disappearance commission as part of \nensuring transitional justice and restoring social \nharmony and peace. We already have our National \nHuman Rights Commission, which is a constitutional \nbody with full autonomy in its area of work. \n We appreciate the continued support of the \nUnited Nations to Nepal\u2019s ongoing peace process \nthrough the United Nations Mission in Nepal. We are \ndetermined to bring the peace process to a positive and \nmeaningful conclusion as early as possible. As we \nourselves are now undergoing a post-conflict situation, \nwe understand the importance of peacebuilding in \npost-conflict societies. Nepal is pleased to contribute to \nthe work of the Peacebuilding Commission as a new \nmember of its Organizational Committee starting this \nyear. We understand that a review of the activities of \nthe Commission is slated for 2010. That would provide \nan opportunity to assess its activities and also to \nexplore ways to make peacebuilding a more effective \nand innovative mechanism. \n Whether it concerns issues of peace, conflict, \nterrorism, climate change, the financial crisis, food \nsecurity, development challenges or other vulnerabilities, \nwe are so interconnected that no country can escape \ntheir impacts. The global village has become a palpable \nreality before us. Global problems thus require global \nsolutions. In that context, I welcome the selection of \nthe theme \u201cEffective responses to global crises: \nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \ncivilizations for international peace, security and \ndevelopment\u201d for this year\u2019s general debate. \n The economic and financial crisis that swept the \nworld within a relatively short span of time is the most \nrecent reminder of the vulnerability inherent in the \nprocess of globalization and its global implications. If \nwe look around, we will see that climate change is \nanother issue staring at us. Regional conflicts are yet \nanother global issue of concern to us all. \n  \n \n09-52586 34 \n \n The least developed countries (LDCs) and \nlandlocked developing countries, among others, are the \nmost vulnerable with regard to all those issues. Their \nspecial needs call for more specific and an enhanced \nlevel of international support in terms of their concerns \nand challenges. At the same time, the outcome \ndocument of the United Nations Conference on the \nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on \nDevelopment (resolution 63/303, annex), held here in \nNew York in June this year, should be implemented in \nall earnestness. We also stress the early implementation \nof the outcome document of the International \nConference on Financing for Development (resolution \n63/239, annex), held in Doha last year. \n While the global financial and economic crisis \nwreaked havoc on the already fragile economic health \nof the least developed countries, that unanticipated \nshock has also brought into sharper relief the urgent \nneed for an enhanced level of understanding, resources \nand a policy space for the developing countries to \nmitigate its impact and to avoid its recurrence. \n The global crises have posed a serious challenge \nto the fight against poverty in the LDCs. The \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) can still be \nachieved if all of us in the international community act \ntogether, and act urgently. The proposed review of \nprogress in the implementation of the MDGs should \nprovide us a renewed opportunity to reinvigorate our \ndevelopment agenda. We urge the developed countries \nnot to let the economic and financial crisis become an \nexcuse for curtailing their aid commitments with \nregard to the MDGs and other internationally agreed \ndevelopment agendas. \n Indeed, as recognized at the Group of 20 Summit \nin London earlier this year and as so consistently \nemphasized by our Secretary-General, the people of \ndeveloping countries, especially the LDCs, need their \nown international financial rescue package to ensure \nthat we do not backtrack on programmes towards \nachievement of the MDGs. \n Nepal is a country with young mountains and a \nfragile ecosystem. Global warming, one of the most \nruthless signs of climate change, has led to \nunprecedented melting of the Himalayan snow. Nepal \nexperienced an annual temperature increase of \n0.06  Celsius degrees between 1977 and 2000. With \nthat, the threat of glacial lake outbursts has increased. \nFlash floods have become more frequent and more \ndestructive. Delayed and insufficient rainfall has \naffected crop production. The poorest of the poor \nfarmers have suffered the worst from all those effects. \nAgriculture, health, livelihoods and infrastructure are \nall being affected by them. \n Nepal recently hosted a high-level regional \nconference on climate change focusing on the \nHimalayan region in order to highlight the seriousness \nof the problem of global warming and its impacts on \nthe Himalayan range. The unprecedented snow melt in \nthe Himalayas could jeopardize the lives and \nlivelihoods of over 700 million people downstream and \nin the coastal regions. The conference produced a \n10-point understanding that emphasizes, among other \nfactors, the need to put into practice the principles of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities and the \nrespective capabilities and historical responsibility of \nthe developed countries, as envisaged in the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as \nwell as a financing mechanism on adaptation and \ntransfer of technologies to sufficiently meet the urgent \nand immediate financial needs of the region in a \npredictable, easy and direct manner. \n Concrete actions that match the level of the threat \nare needed. The other day, we had a fruitful discussion \nat the Summit on Climate Change, convened by the \nSecretary-General. While I thank the Secretary-General \nfor that important initiative, I urge all to continue that \nspirit of positive thinking and to work together to \nconverge all our efforts to find a just and effective \nsolution to the ever-increasing problem of climate \nchange. \n The Copenhagen Climate Change Conference \nshould be able to seal the deal and work out a new \nglobal compact to address the problem of climate \nchange beyond 2012 in keeping with the principle of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities, with \nspecial consideration given to the characteristics, \nvulnerabilities and weaknesses of the least developed \nand other developing countries. \n The LDCs have particular vulnerabilities \nassociated with their structural constraints, systemic \ndeficiencies and historical socio-economic factors. The \nbottom half billion people face the daunting task of \nimproving their living standards despite persistent \nefforts and commitment. Their plight is further \nexacerbated by the global problems that affect them \ndisproportionately because they do not have cushions \n \n \n35 09-52586 \n \nor alternatives. Therefore, their plight deserves special \nconsideration by the international community. \n As we prepare for the fourth United Nations \nConference on the Least Developed Countries, we need \nto seriously consider the implementation status of the \nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed \nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010, and endeavour to \ntackle all existing obstacles in our way through a \ncommitted and collaborative partnership. We would \nalso emphasize the need for full implementation of the \nAlmaty Programme of Action for landlocked \ndeveloping countries. \n Nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament \nand the proliferation of small arms are matters of \nglobal concern. We welcome Security Council \nresolution 1887 (2009), adopted on 24 September 2009, \nwhich seeks to contain proliferation, ban nuclear tests \nand bring about further cuts in nuclear weapons.  \n Disarmament being a comprehensive issue, we \nare of the view that promoting regional discourse on \ndisarmament would help build confidence and prepare \nthe groundwork necessary for realizing our eventual \ngoal of general and complete disarmament. In this \ncontext, we see an important role for the United \nNations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in \nAsia and the Pacific, which has been operating from \nKathmandu since last year. We urge Member States to \nbe generous in extending financial support to the \nCentre for conducting its programmes and activities. \n In spite of sustained and concerted efforts on the \npart of the international community, terrorism \ncontinues to pose a serious threat to international peace \nand security. Nepal strongly condemns terrorism in all \nits forms and calls for early conclusion of a \ncomprehensive convention against terrorism. We \nreiterate our commitment to combating international \nterrorism, including through the implementation of the \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy (see resolution \n60/288) adopted on 8 September 2006 and of various \nSecurity Council resolutions, such as resolutions 1373 \n(2001) and 1540 (2004). \n After more than 60 years, there is no denying that \nthe United Nations needs institutional reform and \nreinvigoration to maintain continued relevance and \neffectiveness. In this context, we hope that the \nintergovernmental negotiations started by the General \nAssembly can lead to significant reform of the United \nNations system \u2014 including the Security Council, by \nadding new members in a fair and equitable manner in \nsuch a way as to reflect the current realities of the \ncontemporary world. \n In an increasingly globalized and interconnected \nworld, the issue of migrant workers has become \nprominent. Remittances have become one of the major \nsources of earned foreign currency for almost all the \nleast developed and other developing countries. We \ntherefore urge the international community to adopt a \ncomprehensive approach and policy towards migration, \nincluding regarding protection of the rights of migrant \nworkers in the face of the current economic crisis. \n We are concerned about the continued deadlock \nin the World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha Development \nAgenda negotiations, as well as about the new waves \nof protectionism that are built into the inward-looking \nstimulus packages being adopted to deal with the \nglobal financial and economic crisis. Given the \nexceptional vulnerabilities of the least developed and \nlandlocked developing countries, developed countries, \nin accordance with international compacts and \ncommitments such as the 2002 Monterrey Consensus, \nshould immediately make available to them duty-free \nentry for their exports, debt-relief packages and other \ncapacity-building measures. Such resources are very \nimportant to the fight against poverty, hunger, illiteracy \nand disease in all the least developed countries, \nparticularly those affected by conflict, which encounter \nhuge development challenges in post-conflict recovery. \n While peacekeeping remains one of the core \nactivities of the United Nations, its multidimensional \nnature has posed new managerial and logistical \nchallenges in recent years. Peacekeeping evolved out \nof necessity, and it has to be adapted to match the new \nand emerging challenges inherent in today\u2019s \nincreasingly complex peacekeeping missions. In this \ncontext, we appreciate the Secretariat\u2019s \u201cNew Horizon\u201d \nnon-paper, aimed at engaging and ensuring broader \nsupport from Member States and troop-contributing \ncountries. Let me recall here that Nepal has been one \nof the longest-standing continuing partners in United \nNations peacekeeping missions. Today, we are the fifth \nlargest troop-contributing country. Our commitment to \ninternational peace remains as strong as ever, and our \nsupport for the United Nations in its peacekeeping \nactivities will continue unabated. \n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Nepal\u2019s \nabiding faith in the principles and purposes of the \n  \n \n09-52586 36 \n \nUnited Nations Charter. We stress the need for \nintroducing timely reforms in the United Nations and \nits operational mechanisms, in order to enhance the \nOrganization\u2019s role and relevance in the emerging new \nglobal order of the twenty-first century. Nepal is \nalways willing to contribute in whatever ways it can to \nthe attainment of the noble objectives of international \npeace, security, development and prosperity for all. \n As a least developed country, engaged in a peace \nprocess and in rebuilding post-conflict, Nepal has \nmany challenges to face. My Government is making \nevery effort to meet these challenges and appreciates \nthe support extended by the United Nations. At the \nsame time, we would like the international community \nto be more generous in assisting us in our national \nendeavour to institutionalize peace and democracy, \nrebuild our infrastructure and enhance our economic \ngrowth."

        "file_text": "I would like to \nbegin by extending my congratulations to Mr. Ali Treki \non his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at this sixty-fourth session and by wishing \nhim every success in the execution of his term of \noffice. Allow me also to pay tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless work and for the \nremarkable devotion that he has demonstrated at the \nhelm of our Organization. \n Like each year, we are asked during this session \nto look at the state of the world, to consider together \nthe current problems and to recommend appropriate \nsolutions to them. In that regard, as we know, the \ninternational community remains under the impact of a \nglobal financial and economic crisis that has spared no \ncountry. \n The extraordinary mobilization that it has aroused \nreflects its scope and extent, as well as the gravity of \nthe threat that it poses to the stability of the global \neconomy. We must welcome that strong mobilization, \nled by the major industrialized countries. It was \nprompt, resolute and consistent. Without doubt, it has \ndemonstrated the international community\u2019s capacity to \nrespond fully when it is driven and underpinned by real \npolitical resolve. \n That is certainly a good example of solidarity, the \nkind of international solidarity that we seek and that \nwe would like also to see in the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals, in our common \nconcern to narrow the gap between the North and the \nSouth, and in our daily struggle against poverty, hunger \nand pandemics. \n In other words, if we have been able to mobilize \nourselves so vigorously to contain the effects of the \nfinancial crisis, we can do the same to address the \nother challenges confronting us, namely the poverty \nand underdevelopment in which so many human beings \nthroughout the world still live. For, while the crisis has \nspared no continent, there is no doubt that its effects \nvary depending on the country, region and level of \ndevelopment. \n Africa, in particular, which in no way contributed \nto the unleashing of the crisis, today, paradoxically, \nfinds itself among the worst affected victims. Among \nthe most alarming effects, we therefore condemn the \ndecrease in remittances to our countries; the severe \ndrop in the prices of our products; the marked fall in \ninvestment; worsening budget deficits; and the \nslowdown in economic activity \u2014 all of which, among \nother things, also have severe social consequences, \nsuch as a rise in unemployment. Furthermore, there is \nreason to fear that the continuation of the crisis will \nonly increase the debt of developing countries. \n We find ourselves facing new difficulties just as \nwe are emerging from lengthy years of economic \nrecovery efforts under rigorous structural adjustment \nprogrammes, resolutely implemented by our States in \ncooperation with the international financial \ninstitutions. Neither our efforts nor our sacrifices have \nbeen in vain, and we believe that our gains, which are \nthe fruit of the commendable efforts of our peoples, \nmust unquestionably be preserved and supported. \n The President took the Chair. \n That is why we believe that, faced with the \nharmful effects of the crisis, it is important that we all \nwork together towards a global, coordinated and \nsignificant response for the benefit of the weakest \neconomies. In our view, that response should lead to \nthe provision of substantial financial resources free, as \nfar as possible, of conditionality and aimed at \nmitigating or even compensating for the consequences \nof a crisis that we could not avert. \n Without such support, our developing countries \nrun the risk of seeing their economic activity decrease \n \n \n15 09-52470 \n \nand the signs of the revival that they could reasonably \nhope for disappear. It is evident that, over and above \ndevelopment and improved living conditions, the peace \nand stability of our countries depend on it. That also \nholds true for international peace and security, \ninasmuch as the numerous problems confronting the \nworld today \u2014 be it, for example, illegal immigration \nor trafficking of every kind \u2014 arise partly from a real \nlack of cooperation and solidarity, and thus call for \ngreater justice in international relations. \n In that connection, I welcome the fortuitous \ndecision taken in London in April by the Group of 20 \nto recommend that the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) support the weakest economies through more \nand softer loans, possibly with less conditionality. \nMoreover, in that context, my country, Cameroon, \nbenefited from substantial financial support from the \nIMF under the Exogenous Shocks Facility. I welcome \nthat support, and take this opportunity to thank \nInternational Monetary Fund officials. That timely \nsupport will strengthen the anticyclical measures that \nwe have adopted at the national and subregional levels, \nfully aware that foreign aid is merely a buttress that \nshould not replace our own efforts.  \n Accordingly, in Cameroon, we have, inter alia, \nstrengthened the productive sectors and taken action to \nreduce the prices of basic commodities and improve \nthe business climate. In the subregion, member \ncountries of the Central African Economic and \nMonetary Community have agreed to adopt tax \nincentives and to establish a support fund for the \nsectors most affected by the crisis. Thus, while \nwelcoming assistance from the international \ncommunity, we are aware that it can bear fruit only if \nbased on stringent management and good governance \ncentred on the primacy of the public interest.  \n Moreover, it was in that spirit that a few years \nback I recommended from this rostrum the \nestablishment within the United Nations of a global \nethics committee, for it is a combination of moral drift \nand serious ethical deviations that is at the root of the \ncurrent global financial crisis. We trust that, in the near \nfuture, we will surmount the crisis through collective \nawareness and mobilization.  \n However, alongside with the financial and \neconomic crisis, we are concerned about other \nimportant matters. The food crisis is still ravaging \nmany developing countries. The poverty reduction \nstruggle is far from being won. Global peace and \nsecurity are still threatened worldwide, particularly in \nAfrica. Climate change is each day becoming \nincreasingly worrisome, with visible consequences in \nevery country.  \n Regarding climate change in particular, Africa, \nlike other continents, has been hard hit despite its low \nlevel of greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming, its \nmost salient feature, affects many socio-economic \nsectors, including energy, health, agriculture, livestock \nproduction, ecosystems and rapid desertification. In \nthis regard, the spectacular drying up of Lake Chad, the \nsurface of which has shrunk from 26,000 square \nkilometres in the 1960s to 1,500 square kilometres \ntoday, clearly requires significant collective action of \nthe Central African States which, in our opinion, needs \nstrong support from the international community. One \nthing is certain: African countries are individually and \ncollectively pulling their full weight in the activity \nnecessary at the national, subregional and global levels \nto provide concrete solutions to the challenge of \nclimate change.  \n Such participation is significant. In Cameroon, it \nhas taken the form of numerous actions, including the \nestablishment of a national environmental management \nplan and the adoption at the subregional level of a \nconvergence plan for the sustainable management of \nthe Congo basin forest which, we are all aware, is the \nworld\u2019s second largest. \n The implementation of all these measures is very \ncostly, especially in terms of acquiring adapted \ntechnologies, and requires our people to accept huge \nsacrifices. Furthermore, without denying the fact that \nthe fate and future of the planet are everyone\u2019s \nbusiness, it seems legitimate, in my opinion, to ask that \nthe peoples of Africa be duly compensated by the \ninternational community for their efforts and sacrifices. \nIn this regard, we hope that the Copenhagen climate \nconference scheduled for December will provide \nsatisfactory answers to the particular case of Africa. \n Regarding world peace and security, we continue \nto deplore the persistence of numerous conflicts or \nhotbeds of tension, despite significant progress towards \na return to calm. I refer to the situations in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Darfur and Somalia, \namong others. Cameroon is playing an active role, \nincluding by dispatching Cameroonian contingents, in \n  \n \n09-52470 16 \n \nthe efforts to find lasting solutions to these conflicts, \nwhich have lasted too long. \n In this respect, I wish to hail the role of the \nUnited Nations, which is making tireless efforts to \nstabilize all these situations. However, if it is to be \nmore effective, the United Nations requires \ncommensurate human, financial and material resources. \nFurthermore, the United Nations should be able to \nreflect the common will of all its Members, large and \nsmall, in order to ensure its effectiveness and \ncredibility. It must more clearly assert and further \nstrengthen its role as the crucible par excellence of \nmultilateralism, that is, a forum for the exchange of \nideas, solidarity, equity and equality where all the \nvoices and opinions of developed and developing \ncountries alike are expressed and taken into account. \n These values go hand in hand with the dialogue \nof civilizations proposed for our consideration at this \nsession. Such a dialogue should not ignore differences, \nbut rather promote diversity so as to foster knowledge \nand mutual understanding among peoples. From this \nperspective, the dialogue of civilizations or cultures \nadvocates tolerance and mutual respect and rejects all \nforms of fanaticism that threaten international peace \nand security. \n That is the dual role that the United Nations, a \nproving ground for multilateralism and crucible of the \ndialogue of civilizations, must assume if it seeks to \nembody the noblest and deepest aspirations of \nhumankind and satisfy our peoples\u2019 expectations with \ncomprehensive and relevant solutions. \n But the question is, how can the United Nations \nfulfil this role if it does not adapt to the current trends \nand changes in international relations? That is the \npurpose of the recommendations we have been making \nfor the reform of the Security Council, the \nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the \nstrengthening of the means of action of the Secretary-\nGeneral. We therefore need to fast-track the overhaul \nof an Organization that, through its universal nature, \nsymbolizes our common destiny and seeks to be our \ncommon abode. For only a renewed United Nations \nthat is more democratic, more credible and more \nefficient will be able to inspire peoples\u2019 hopes and \ntrust."

        "file_text": "My delegation and I are \nhonoured, for the second time, to address the General \nAssembly on behalf of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf \nand the Government and people of Liberia. We \ncongratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki and his country, \nthe Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, on his \nelection as President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. We are convinced that, as a consummate \ndiplomat, Mr. Treki will bring his wealth of experience \ninto play as we tackle the complex issues on the \ncurrent session\u2019s agenda, while entertaining hopes for a \nresounding success. In this context, my delegation and \nI assure the President of our full cooperation. \n Permit me, therefore, to seize the opportunity to \npay a well-deserved tribute to the preceding President, \nHis Excellency Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann of the \nRepublic of Nicaragua, for the very able and effective \nmanner in which he steered the affairs of the \nAssembly\u2019s sixty-third session. His sound and shrewd \nleadership was critical in steadying the turbulence \noccasioned by the severe global economic and \nfinancial crisis. Likewise, we commend the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, a visionary \nstatesman, for the unfaltering efforts with which he \ncontinues to administer the affairs of this Organization. \nHis renewed dynamism and sense of purpose serve as \nan impetus to our collective aspirations for the \nattainment of global peace, security and development. \n Liberia continues to make steady progress under \nthe excellent, indefatigable leadership of Her \nExcellency President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Since her \ninauguration in January 2006 as the first \ndemocratically elected woman head of State of an \nAfrican country, the Government has undertaken a \nnumber of important initiatives aimed at enhancing \nnational dialogue and reconciliation.  \n On 30 June 2009, the Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission submitted an unedited report, which did \nnot gain the unanimous consent of the Commission, \nsince two members issued dissenting views. \nNonetheless, since its release the report has spurred \nnational debate, and the President has committed \nherself to working with all stakeholders towards \nimplementation of the recommendations, which must \nbe in consonance with the Commission\u2019s mandate, the \nwishes of the Liberian people and the laws of our \ncountry. \n In order to protect the fundamental rights of the \nLiberian people, the President has also nominated the \nmembers of the Independent Human Rights \nCommission, which will have the responsibility of \nmonitoring the implementation of the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission report. Under the Liberian \nConstitution, the nominees must meet the consent of \nthe Liberian Senate, and that process is currently under \nway. We have also established the Land Commission, \nand its Commissioners have been appointed to address \nthe explosive issues of land disputes and the need for \nland reform. \n We note with satisfaction the achievement of the \nnational disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation \nand reintegration programme, carried out in \nconjunction with the United Nations Mission in Liberia \n(UNMIL). That programme was successfully \nconcluded in July of this year. However, high \nunemployment, especially among the youth, remains a \nmajor challenge.  \n Liberia is pleased with the progress being made \nin the reconstitution of its armed forces, which \nincludes the training of the 2,000-strong army with the \nassistance of our development partners, particularly the \nUnited States of America. We continue to encourage \ngender sensitivity in this important area of our national \nendeavours, considering that at present there are only \n58 women in the new force. \n Improvements have also been registered in the \nperformance of the reorganized Liberia National Police \nforce, with the establishment of an emergency unit. \nThe police, however, continue to face difficulties in \nachieving full operational capability in the areas of \ninfrastructure, equipment, logistics and other \nrequirements. Two weeks ago, successful partnership \nconsultations were held at United Nations \nHeadquarters here in New York on the strategic plan \n \n \n25 09-52470 \n \nfor the Liberia National Police. The responses of our \npartners, especially India, were encouraging. The \nobjective of the strategic plan is to introduce an \nintegrated programme that would ensure a consistent \ndoctrine and training philosophy to enhance continuity. \nA similar strategic plan is also required for the Bureau \nof Immigration and Naturalization to improve its \nefficiency and effectiveness in border control. \n We are pleased to report that Liberia has \ncontinued to make significant strides in the \nadministration of justice and rule of law, in spite of \ndaunting obstacles. We have established a special \nsexual and gender-based violent crimes court, which \nhas begun hearing cases and encouraging victims to \ncome forth and report on those crimes in the spirit of \nconfidentiality and justice. Concomitantly, the \nGovernment has further adopted several gender-\nsensitive policies and frameworks in pursuance of \nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000). \n Post-conflict reconstruction and development \nrequire all Liberians to participate in the ongoing \nrecovery and sustainable development efforts. The \nGovernment is therefore promoting and encouraging \nwomen\u2019s involvement at the leadership level and in all \nother spectrums of society, with emphasis on the \neducation of the girl child.  \n In this connection, I wish to refer to the \nInternational Colloquium on Women\u2019s Empowerment, \nLeadership Development, International Peace and \nSecurity, which was co-convened by the President of \nLiberia, Her Excellency Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, \nand the President of Finland, Her Excellency Madam \nTarja Halonen, in Monrovia on 7 and 8 March 2009. At \nthat event, the Monrovia Declaration was adopted, \ncalling for action on resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \npeace and security, and on climate change and gender. \nWe want to thank all our partners and friends of the \ninternational community, including the institutions of \nthe United Nations system and UNMIL, who \ncontributed to the success of the programme. \n In that regard, we reaffirm that resolution 1325 \n(2000) on women, peace and security recognizes that \nwomen, as civilians in conflict situations, are not only \nvictims but also powerful agents for peace and the \nsecurity for their communities. \n We also recognize that Security Council \nresolution 1820 (2008) is an important component of \nresolution 1325 (2000) with regard to rape and sexual \nviolence against women and girls. Therefore, we \nrecommend that the Secretary-General appoint a \nspecial envoy on women, peace and security who \nwould galvanize Member States to implement \nresolution 1325 (2000) and ensure that the path \ntowards its tenth anniversary is well prepared in a \ncoherent manner. \n As a follow-up to the Monrovia extraordinary \nmeeting, a side event to this sixty-fourth session of the \nGeneral Assembly was jointly hosted yesterday by \nthose two exemplary women leaders, here at United \nNations Headquarters, to focus on the implementation \nof resolution 1325 (2000) and climate change. In \ncommending them for their excellent work, we join in \ntheir appeal to all Member States, Governments and \nnon-governmental organizations to support the \nMonrovia Declaration. Liberia wishes to thank all the \nparticipants at that historic event for renewing their \nsupport of the Government of Liberia and for reform of \nthe United Nations system, including the urgent need \nfor gender equality in its organs and related agencies. \n Liberia\u2019s economic revitalization is shaping up to \nbecome a post-conflict success story, due to the \ncombination of the disciplined leadership and prudent \npolicies of Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson-\nSirleaf and the very constructive partnership with the \ninternational community. We remain cognizant of the \nfact that no amount of foreign assistance can transform \na nation in the absence of sound moral leadership and \ntechnical competencies and of the commitment to \nimprove the well-being of its citizens. It is out of this \nrealization that we formulated the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy and have cultivated a \nstrategic partnership with friendly countries and \norganizations within the international community. \n The country experienced 7 per cent growth in \n2008 and is expected to register 5 per cent this year, \nlargely as a result of the negative impact of the global \neconomic meltdown on demand for our major \ncommodities and decreased capital inflows. National \nrevenue collection rose by 25 per cent last year. We \nhave improved our business and investment climate by \nestablishing the \u201cOne Stop Shop\u201d concept to spur \nprivate sector growth and create jobs.  \n We have rehabilitated a total of 674 miles of \nprimary and secondary roads to link communities that \nwere isolated from the central administration as a result \nof the 14-year civil crisis. A robust and comprehensive \n  \n \n09-52470 26 \n \ncivil service reform strategy has been instituted as a \ncritical component of the public sector reform. \nMoreover, the President has promulgated a policy of \nmandatory free and compulsory primary education, \nwith a special emphasis on girls, who are often victims \nof institutionalized bias and abuse. \n We have undertaken several economic reform \ninitiatives and have set up the Liberia Anti-Corruption \nCommission to create a transparent and predictable \nbusiness and investment climate as well as to \nencourage greater foreign direct investment. \n Liberia has also made noticeable progress \ntowards reaching the targets for relief under the \nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. \nQualifying under this process will open up the country \nto borrowing on the international financial markets and \naccepting loans. \n While Liberia has made and continues to make \nimpressive progress towards consolidating peace, the \ngains remain fragile. In post-conflict situations such as \nours, stability is linked to development. Weak \ninstitutional capacity in the area of the rule of law, \ncoupled with the absence of employment opportunities, \nespecially for the youth, continue to threaten sustained \nprogress.  \n As we expect to hold general elections in 2011, \nsuccessful conduct of these undertakings will set the \nnation firmly on the path of stability and democracy. It \nis therefore envisioned that continued, sustainable \nsocio-economic development will serve as the catalyst \nfor a smooth electoral process. \n The Mano River Union countries of Liberia, \nSierra Leone, Guinea and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire continue to \nhost significant numbers of each other\u2019s refugees in the \nsubregion. For instance, more than 65,000 Liberian \nrefugees are reportedly spread throughout West Africa, \nposing humanitarian challenges that require urgent \naction for cross-border movements. This is why we \ncontinue to urge the fast-tracking and relaxation of the \nstringent conditions for development assistance, if \nLiberia is to truly remain a model for post-conflict \nreconstruction and democracy. \n In this connection, Liberia requires the empathy \nand support of the international community for its \nyoung democracy as it improves the human rights \nsituation, transparency, anti-corruption and good \ngovernance, which are important priorities of the \nGovernment. \n In this vein, we wish to express the heartfelt \ngratitude of the Government and people of Liberia to \nthe Security Council for extending the mandate of \nUNMIL for another year and further requesting it to \nprovide a conducive security environment for the \nholding of general and presidential elections in 2011. \nThe crucial nature of this democratic transition cannot \nbe overemphasized as we commend the gallant men \nand women of UNMIL for their courageous and \nsacrificial services in keeping the peace. \n The issue of cross-border movement mentioned \nabove demonstrates that the security and stability of \nthe countries of the Mano River Union subregion are \ninextricably linked and that progress in one country \ncannot be divorced from progress in any one of the \nmember States. Elections are soon to be held in \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Guinea. As Chair of the Mano River \nUnion and a member of the International Contact \nGroup on Guinea, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf is \nurging the United Nations and the international \ncommunity to stay constructively engaged with Guinea \nwhile urging adherence to the original agreement so as \nto ensure a smooth transition to democratic rule in that \ncountry. \n Cross-border movements among the Mano River \nUnion countries have become more complex and \nproblematic due to the growing number of cases \ninvolving illicit drug trafficking, human trafficking and \nother organized transnational crime in the West African \nsubregion and beyond. These problems necessitate the \nurgent need for collective international action to tackle \nthese criminal activities, which are a menace to \nregional peace and security. \n Liberia supports the decision of the leaders of the \nSouthern African Development Community on the \nlifting of United Nations sanctions against Zimbabwe. \nWe are encouraged that the power-sharing agreement \nbetween the parties continues to hold as the country \ntries to recover. \n As regards Somalia, we note with regret the \ncontinuing deterioration of the situation in that country. \nIn view of the unfortunate state of affairs there, Liberia \ncalls for renewed commitment by the international \ncommunity to provide logistical and financial support \nto the African Union peacekeeping initiatives to restore \npeace in that country. Liberia, as a beneficiary of \n \n \n27 09-52470 \n \npeacekeeping operations, registers its strong \ncondemnation of the recent barbaric killings of \n17 African Union peacekeepers in Somalia.  \n On Darfur, we are heartened by the expressed \nwillingness of all the parties to end armed hostilities \nand to find a political solution to the problem that will \nensure lasting peace for all people in that region. \n Liberia welcomes the just-ended Summit on \nClimate Change convened by the Secretary-General. \nWe firmly believe that urgent action is needed to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help all \nMember States, particularly developing countries, \nadequately respond to the harmful effects of this global \nphenomenon. \n Liberia continues to join in the call for a \ndemocratic Security Council that reflects the realities \nof the twenty-first century. The world today is far \ndifferent from and more complex than that of the \n1940s, when this Organization came into being. \n Liberia supports peacekeeping operations to put \nout the flames of war. However, we wish to underscore \nthe benefits of establishing an early warning \nmechanism that will deal with potentially explosive \nsituations before they escalate into full blown \nconflagrations that present only ghastly choices. \n Additionally, it is important that the international \ncommunity provides special assistance and \ndispensation to post-conflict countries to shield them \nfrom shocks in the worldwide system, such as the \ncurrent global financial crisis. These upsets often have \nthe effect of reversing the gains made in restoring \npeace to countries emerging from conflict. \n That is why Liberia welcomes the empathy and \nsupport of the international community in rebuilding its \ninstitutions destroyed by protracted civil conflict. The \ncurrent global financial crisis is impregnated with the \npotential to undermine donor support to our national \nrenewal agenda, thus threatening much needed foreign \ndirect investment and delivery of social services. \n The result of the Government\u2019s inability to \nprovide these basic services to its people has the \npropensity to provide fertile ground for acts of \ndestabilization from internal and external sources. It is \ncheaper to prevent these risks than to have to mobilize \nalready diminishing resources at much higher cost, \nsometimes involving human lives and enormous \nresources, to react to them. \n In conclusion, we pledge our unstinting support \nto your leadership and entertain the hope that together, \nwe can advance the cause of humanity and make the \nworld truly a better place to live."

Indeed, tragic events occurred \nyesterday in a country in West Africa, of which Cape \nVerde is a part: soldiers once again fired on a crowd. \nAs a neighbouring, friendly and long-standing partner \ncountry of Guinea, I wish, on behalf of my country, to \nexpress my deep sympathy and the unequivocal \ncondemnation of an act that disgraces the entire \ncontinent. I am referring to a challenge to the brave \npeople of Guinea and to the international community. I \npay tribute to the numerous victims of this odious act, \nwhich threatens stability and peace in the entire \nsubregion. I am pleased to congratulate Ambassador Ali \nAbdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I also \ncongratulate his predecessor, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, for his involvement, dedication and \ncourage, which left an important imprint on the work \nof the sixty-third session. To Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, Cape Verde expresses its confidence that he \nwill continue to further our aspirations and consolidate \nthe foundations of this Organization he leads that is \ndedicated to the common good. We thank him for his \ndetailed report on the work of the Organization \n(A/64/1).  \n Peace, security and development are public assets \nthat are essential to the progress of humanity. However, \nthey have never before been as threatened as they are \ntoday. Therefore, I would like to share with the \nAssembly some of my country\u2019s concerns in that \ncontext.  \n During the Assembly\u2019s sixty-second session, the \nPrime Minister of Cape Verde, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Maria Neves, \nsaid: \n  \u201cWe are living at a time when problems and \nthreats are of concern to all. They are not \nconfined to a single State or region. Nor can there \nbe local solutions to the global threats of our \nera.\u201d (A/62/PV.11, p. 2) \nHe was referring to terrorism, organized crime and \nhuman trafficking and to weapons and drugs that in \ncertain instances threaten the foundations of the \ndemocratic rule of law. He said that these phenomena \n\u201ccorrupt values, compromise development and thwart \nthe most legitimate expectations of peoples\u201d who are \nexposed to them and that \u201cResponses to these issues \nwill be ineffective unless they are undertaken within a \nrobust, balanced and fair multilateral perspective\u201d \n(ibid.). \n I quote these remarks by the head of Government \nof Cape Verde because they are quite current and \nbecause the themes they address have been the object \nof increasing attention by the international community. \n Cape Verde and other West African States are \nfacing organized crime, which has found fertile ground \nfor its activities in our region because of our fragile \neconomies, the vulnerability of our emerging \ndemocracies and, in general, our States\u2019 weak \ncapacities to respond to this major threat. With the \nsupport of the United Nations, in particular the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime and the logistics \ncapabilities of our partners, we, the States members of \nthe Economic Community of West African States are \npooling our capabilities to confront this tremendous \nchallenge that has engulfed our subregion.  \n In Cape Verde we believe that a small country \ncannot allow itself to be poor, vulnerable and unstable \nall at once. We therefore seek to reinforce our \nadvantages, reduce our weaknesses and diversify our \npartnerships, in addition to strengthening our relations \n \n \n09-53165 18 \n \nof solidarity for the benefit of peace, stability and \nprogress in our subregion. \n Therefore, at the October 2008 conference on \ndrug trafficking in our region and at the April 2009 \nround table on Guinea-Bissau security sector reform, \nboth held in Praia, the capital of Cape Verde, we \nsought to define together the parameters of our actions \nin these areas. We will continue to pay special attention \nto this threat, as we are convinced that the zone of \npeace we are building in the South Atlantic must \nbecome a tangible reality if we wish to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals and, in general, the \nlife of peace and progress that we wish for all. \n In this context in which States and democratic \nprocesses are threatened by exogenous elements, \nmultilateralism appears as an indispensable shield and \nan essential resource. There is no doubt that this \nconfluence of wills and means among the most diverse \ncountries and the most widespread regions at the heart \nof the international community constitutes the path to \nfollow, not only for strengthening cooperation among \nthe entities of international life and for the timely \nresolution of differences in the framework of the \nprinciples and values of the United Nations, but also \nfor the strengthening of international law, which is \nindispensable for strengthening peace and security in \nthe world.  \n The United Nations, in this context, remains the \ncentral element of the collective conscience of the \ncommunity of nations. Thus the revitalization of the \nUnited Nations system emerges as a necessity of our \ntime, giving priority to the participation of all, to the \ndetriment of unilateralism, strengthening efficiency for \nthe benefit of common interests and seeking solutions \nthat meet the aspirations of the most vulnerable and of \npresent and future generations. \n Cape Verde is contributing to that framework as \none of the eight pilot countries testing the Delivering \nas One process on the ground, which is successfully \nunder way as a unique programme with a unique \nbudgeting plan, a single purpose and single leader. This \nprocess has had positive repercussions on cooperation \nbetween the Government and the agencies, funds and \nprogrammes of the United Nations working in Cape \nVerde, thus enhancing the coherence of this \nprogramme, reducing transaction and administrative \ncosts and benefiting all. \n According to the United Nations Conference on \nTrade and Development, it is expected that the global \ngross domestic product will shrink by more than \n2.5 per cent in 2009. The growth of developing \ncountries will decrease from 5.4 per cent in 2008 to 1.3 \nper cent in 2009, which means a reduction in the \naverage per capita income. In light of the stagnation \nand reduction of economic growth, the developing \ncountries have seen an increase in poverty, \nunemployment, the cost of essential goods and \nmalnutrition. With the drastic reduction in investment, \nthere is a strong likelihood that the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals will not be achieved. \n It is expected that in 2009 world trade will be \nreduced by at least 11 per cent in real terms and by \n20 per cent in dollar terms. For the African continent, \nthe prognosis points to a significant deceleration of the \ngrowth of production in 2009. However, it will remain \npositive and drop to 3 per cent in North Africa and \n1 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. The medium- and \nlow-income countries in this context will certainly \nrequire more support in the form of a coordinated \neffort at the international level to increase official \ndevelopment assistance.  \n The perspective of a solution to the crisis is \nsignificant. It requires, among other things, a new \npolitical strategy that includes regulation of the \nfinancial market. The recent meeting of the Group of \n20 in Pittsburgh offers some elements of response. \nIndeed, management of the crisis in the context of \nglobalization and interdependence requires an \nintegrated response of the parties as well as a change in \nthe global financial system, more efficient institutions, \ncountercyclical policies, better monitoring of risk and \ninstitutional regulation. The outcome document \nadopted by consensus at the United Nations \nConference on the World Financial and Economic \nCrisis of 24 to 26 June 2009 (resolution 63/303, annex) \ncontains recommendations to fight economic recession \nand establishes viable and safe financial practices, in \naddition to indicating important areas of intervention.  \n Cape Verde, despite the difficult situation created \nby the economic and financial crisis, seeks to preserve \nthe gains already made in the various areas of the \nMillennium Development Goals, thanks to a prudent \nand pragmatic policy and taking its partners into \naccount to help diminish the impact of the crisis on the \narchipelago. \n \n \n19 09-53165 \n \n We think all international partners must \nimplement joint efforts to minimize the impact of the \neconomic deceleration, especially for developing \ncountries, and enable all to achieve more inclusive, \nequitable and balanced development, oriented towards \neconomic sustainability, to help overcome poverty and \ninequity in order to avoid an unprecedented human \ncrisis. \n The Summit on Climate Change organized by the \nSecretary-General last week was an undeniable \nsuccess. The Member States wished to participate in \nlarge numbers to reaffirm their determination to see \nthis vital problem treated in a convincing, urgent and \ngenuine manner. The head of State of one of the heavy-\nemitting countries declared that if we do not act now, \nno one will ever be able to do so, reinforcing what \nscientists have been demonstrating for some time: that \nour planet is at serious risk of not being able to assure \nlife in all its fullness because of the consequences of \nclimate change. And the time to act is now. \n The participants departed the Summit convinced \nthat there is no more time for evasion. The moment has \ncome for concerted, coherent and systematic action to \nachieve a convincing and meaningful reduction of \ngreenhouse gases, to slow global warming and avoid \nraised sea levels likely to endanger vast coastal regions \nthroughout the world, particularly the small developing \nisland States. Such States are increasingly vulnerable \nand suffer the most from the consequences of a \nsituation created to a large extent by emitter States. At \nits summit here in New York on 21 September, the \nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), of which \nCape Verde is a member, adopted a declaration \nclarifying its position on various points being \nnegotiated within the framework of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \n Cape Verde is a small archipelago with a small \npopulation, in a geographic location that leaves it \nsimultaneously isolated in the ocean and dangerously \nexposed to the effects of climate change and global \nwarming. As a Sahelian State, it has long faced \ndrought, desertification and a serious lack of water. \nThose phenomena aggravate the population\u2019s poverty, \nhinder Government efforts and strongly affect actions \nin the areas of environmental preservation and human \ndevelopment. \n In Cape Verde we are making efforts to make the \nbest possible use of our river basins, saving water \nwherever possible and adopting modern irrigation \nmethods with the help of new technologies. We are \nimplementing an active policy in that area. A dam on \none of our islands is energizing the local agricultural \nsector and allowing us to promote better subsistence \nmethods among farmers, while helping us develop \nrenewable power sources throughout the country with \nthe goal of providing electricity to 95 per cent of the \ncountry by 2011. A research and development centre \nfor renewable energies aimed at serving the entire West \nAfrican region is under construction in Cape Verde. \n The international community, and the developed \ncountries in particular, must strive to support the \nspecific dynamics of those States in the areas of \nadaptation to and mitigation of the effects of climate \nchange and to enable them to minimize the risks that \nburden them today, given that some of those States are \nalready facing issues of mass dislocation and forced \nmigrations. \n For the people of Cape Verde, the ocean is more \nthan a nurturing mother or a demanding lover \u2014 it is \nour vital source of civilization and inspiration. We \nwant to protect it; we want to preserve it. But equally, \nalong with the coastal nations of the Atlantic Ocean, \nparticularly in its southern half, we want to see it be an \narea of exchange, not speculation, a realm of active \nsolidarity, not unruly competition. Far from making it \none more focus of human greed, let us preserve its \nunique value as a precious cradle of life and the \nrepository of the hopes of our planet."

        "file_text": "Before I deliver the \nstatement I have prepared I should like to support one \naspect of the long speech made by the Chairman of the \nAfrican Union, brother Muammar Al-Qadhafi, which \ntouched on so many issues, and that is reform of the \nUnited Nations system and fairer representation for the \nAfrican Union in the Security Council. That is an \nAfrican position and I support it. \n It is said in the Holy Bible, in the book of \nDeuteronomy, chapter I, verses 2 and 3, that it was an \n11-day journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to \nKadesh-barnea on the border of Canaan, yet it took the \nIsraelites, coming out of slavery in Egypt, some \n40 years to complete it. It was a journey of only \n11 days, but it took them 40 years. \n In Deuteronomy, chapter VIII, verse 2, it also \nsays:  \n \u201cAnd you shall remember that the Lord your God \nled you all the way these 40 years in the \nwilderness, to humble you and test you, to know \nwhat was in your heart, whether you would keep \nHis commandments or not\u201d. \n Similarly, Africa, especially black Africa, has \nbeen wandering in the desert of underdevelopment for \nmuch of the 40 years following independence. As it \nsays in the Book of Common Prayer, one cannot help \nbut wonder whether it was because we had \u201cleft \nundone those things which we ought to have done\u201d, \nand we had \u201cdone those things which we ought not to \nhave done\u201d, and there was \u201cno truth in us\u201d. On the \nother hand, the Asian countries \u2014 South Korea, \nSingapore, Thailand, Malaysia, India, et cetera \u2014 did \nnot similarly wander in the desert of \nunderdevelopment. That is not to mention the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. \n Fortunately, in the past 15 to 20 years, Africans \nhave also grasped the development compass. We have \nstarted to do what we had left undone for a long time, \nand the truth is now beginning to be in us. Uganda\u2019s \neconomy has grown at a rate of 6.5 per cent per annum \nfor the past 23 years. During the last financial year, \nUganda\u2019s rate of growth was 7 per cent, in spite of the \nglobal recession, which affected us all. In the current \nfinancial year of 2009-2010, our rate of growth will be \nin excess of 7 per cent. In the financial year 2007-\n2008, our rate of growth was 9.8 per cent, before \nadjusting for inflation. \n We achieved these reasonable rates of growth \ndespite the fact that we have not yet dealt decisively \nwith three strategic infrastructure elements: electricity, \nroads and railways. While we have achieved peace, \nmacroeconomic stability, education for all, some \naspects of health for all, economic integration in the \nregion, international market access, democratization \nand scientific research, we have been slow on these \nthree: electricity, roads and railways. This slowness \nwas the result of dependence on foreign funding, which \ntends to be frivolous and erratic. We depended on \nforeign funding because our tax collections were \ninitially very low, but they have now grown in tandem \nwith the growth of the economy. \n Uganda is, therefore, now able to fund road, rail \nand electricity projects on its own, although of course \nwe welcome foreign investment. We can no longer, \nhowever, be held to ransom by foreign funding for \nthose vital foundational elements of infrastructure. It is \namazing and, indeed, shameful to see the low levels of \nelectrification in Africa. In the United States, kilowatt-\nhours per capita are 14,124. In Africa, on the other \nhand, the figure is only 547 kilowatt-hours per capita. \nSome African countries have as low as 9 kilowatt-\nhours per capita. How could we expect growth and \ntransformation in such a situation? \n The whole of Africa needs to wake up on this \nissue and cooperate to find a solution. The same goes \nfor our high transport costs due to poor roads and poor \nor non-existent railways. In China, it costs $12 to \ntransport a ton of cargo between Beijing and Shanghai \nby rail. In East Africa, on the other hand, transporting \nthe same cargo over a comparable distance would \nrequire $65. We are aware of these bottlenecks, and we \nare dealing with them one by one. \n There are two other bottlenecks that we often talk \nabout: the export of raw materials, and the failure to \ntransform subsistence and traditional farming into \nmodernized agriculture. The haemorrhage that is the \nexport of raw materials, for which we get only 10 per \n \n \n29 09-52179 \n \ncent of the final processed product, has been \nrecognized by many of us as modern slavery.  \n In Uganda we are transforming traditional \nsubsistence agriculture into modern agriculture. This \ninvolves using improved seeds, fertilizers, tractors, \nirrigation, breeding stock and agricultural practices. \nHowever, we know that we cannot do all of this \nsustainably if we continue to neglect the environment. \n Therefore, our development and transformation \nmanifesto and action plan in Uganda entails the \nfollowing: peace; democracy; education for all; health \nfor all; macroeconomic stability and economic \nliberalization; electricity generation and distribution to \nbanish the very low levels of kilowatt-hours per capita; \nmodernization of roads; rebuilding and modernization \nof railways; commercialization and modernization of \nagriculture away from traditional subsistence farming; \nadding value to our agricultural and mineral products \ninstead of just exporting raw materials, including \npetroleum and gas; regional integration to widen \nmarkets as well as accessing international markets; \nenvironmental protection; and scientific research \u2014 we \nare already supporting a quantity of innovative \nresearch by Ugandan scientists. \n Ugandans and other Africans in our region who \nhave been chronically underconsuming in the past are \nnow helping our economy to stay afloat in spite of the \nglobal recession, because they now have greater \ncapacity to purchase what we produce. Their \nconsumption is going up, thus supporting our \nregionally oriented industries. We think that we have at \nlast graduated from wandering in the desert of \nunderdevelopment and are now marching towards \nsocio-economic transformation. We are finally doing \nthat which we ought to have done and the truth, this \ntime, is in us. The phase of what the French scholar \nRen\u00e9 Dumont called \u201ca false start\u201d in Africa, or, in this \ncase, Uganda, is over. We are entering the phase of \ngrowth and transformation. Thus, we believe, our \neconomy will soon take off. \n Thus, Uganda\u2019s response to the global crisis has \nbeen fair, because of regional trade. It would have been \nfairer if we had already dealt with the three \ninfrastructure elements I have talked about: roads, \nelectricity and railways. This would have enabled us to \nlower the costs of doing business in Uganda and, thus, \nincrease the profitability of enterprises. \n Africa has great potential for growth that is not \ntapped. The current global crisis was caused by certain \nlaxities in the management of some of the economies \nof the world. Those laxities need to be rectified \nthrough multilateral action, as some heads of State \nhave already noted. We need to stop money-laundering \nand strengthen regulation. Multilateral action would \nalso be welcome in unlocking the dormant potential of \nAfrica. In the case of Uganda and many other African \ncountries, we have a double challenge: first, the \nstruggle to transform our economies from a \npre-industrial to a modern state; secondly, to cope with \nthe problems caused by others, such as the present \nglobal financial crisis and environmental degradation. \n There are, however, a few questions I keep asking \nmyself. Is the present profligacy of some of the \ndeveloped countries sustainable if we all join in that \nlifestyle? Or was it only possible when a tiny minority \nof humanity was enjoying affluence? Is there a need \nfor a more rational modern lifestyle? \n The need for dialogue among civilizations is long \noverdue. That dialogue could help us deal with some of \nthe headaches and dilemmas confronted by humanity."

        "file_text": "To the powers, to the \nvoices, to the four winds: I greet you all.\n I have addressed the Assembly in Te Reo Maori, \nthe indigenous language of New Zealand, and I bring \nwarm Pacific greetings from all New Zealanders. \n I am deeply honoured to lead New Zealand\u2019s \ndelegation to the General Assembly for the first time. \nLike every New Zealand Prime Minister since 1945, I \nstand here today to reaffirm my country\u2019s commitment \nto the United Nations and the United Nations Charter. \n The founding Members of the United Nations \ngathered in San Francisco in 1945 to create this \nOrganization out of the ashes of the most destructive \nwar and the most debilitating depression in modern \nhistory. They believed in the larger freedom of a world \nwhere collective action might avert common crises. \nThey believed in the rule of law, by which all States \nwould be held to a universal standard, and in a world \nwhere all peoples, faiths and cultures could flourish. \nThey believed in a future in which every human being \nwould be free from want and free from fear. And they \nwanted an international Organization and architecture \nthat could deliver those benefits.  \n New Zealand was active among those founding \nMembers in San Francisco. And, as a small, \nindependent and diverse country in the Pacific, New \nZealand still has a stake in the United Nations \u2014 this \ngreat meeting place for all States. \n I have benefited personally from efforts to secure \nthose ideals. My family fled persecution in Europe, and \nI was privileged to grow up in a new world where a \nchild of immigrants is now accorded the extraordinary \nprivilege of leading his country and addressing this \nAssembly on its behalf. \n We meet at a time of many challenges. With \n130 heads of State and Government assembled here \nthis week, the present session of the General Assembly \nrepresents our greatest opportunity since the 2005 \nWorld Summit to reaffirm our collective resolve. New \nZealand embraces that opportunity. Today, I will focus \non some of the most pressing issues demanding \ncollective responses from us. \n The crisis in the global economy continues. We \nmust remain resolute in our efforts to stabilize the \nglobal economy in order to permit a return to \nsustainable growth. New Zealand welcomes the actions \nof the Group of 20 (G-20) over the past year. But, in \ncommending those efforts, we call on the G-20 to heed \n \n \n31 09-52470 \n \nthe voices of the world\u2019s small economies and to \nensure that they are also heard in global decision-\nmaking. \n Free and fair trade will be the principal engine for \ndriving developing countries out of poverty and \nbringing greater prosperity to all. An essential \ncomponent in our response to the global economic \ncrisis must therefore be a balanced and ambitious \nconclusion to the Doha Round of world trade talks. A \ngenuinely global agreement that reduces tariffs, \neliminates export subsidies, reduces domestic subsidies \nand increases market access will see benefits flow to \nall States. At a time when all countries are suffering \nfrom the brunt of the current economic crisis, further \ndelay is inexcusable. \n As one of the world\u2019s first truly open economies, \nNew Zealand has an unwavering commitment to trade \nliberalization and to the pursuit of bilateral, regional \nand global free trade agreements. We support the call \nof the Secretary-General for the immediate suspension \nof price controls and other agricultural trade \nrestrictions, in order to reduce soaring food prices and \nhelp millions cope with the highest food prices in \n30 years. \n Therefore, I call on all those States and groupings \nthat have broken their undertakings and reintroduced \nprotectionist measures to reconsider. Those actions are \nas harmful as they are unacceptable. Agriculture, which \nis so important for developing countries in particular, is \none of the sectors most affected. \n The escalation of poverty is a result of the \neconomic crisis. New Zealand is, naturally, proud of \nthe efforts of the United Nations Development \nProgramme to strengthen its focus as the largest United \nNations development agency on poverty and the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  \n For its part, New Zealand pledges to continue to \nincrease its official development assistance, with a \nclear focus on the Pacific Islands region. Aid \neffectiveness is just as important as the quantum of aid. \nThat is why, last month, we committed to the Cairns \nCompact, which will strengthen development \ncoordination in the Pacific islands. \n The major focus of the General Assembly this \nyear must be on the challenge of climate change. \nClimate change demands innovation and a global \nresponse. The world cannot afford to contemplate \nfailure at Copenhagen. Political leadership is needed, \nand it is on display.  \n At the Summit on climate change this week, the \nleaders of the world\u2019s three biggest economies showed \ntheir determination both to make Copenhagen a success \nand to take action themselves. All countries must take \naction that reflects our individual circumstances, \nresponsibilities and capabilities. \n For our part, New Zealand is committed to \nsecuring a durable and meaningful agreement on \nclimate change \u2014 an agreement that is both \nenvironmentally effective and economically efficient. I \nhave set a target for New Zealand of reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 10 to 20 per cent below \n1990 levels by 2020, if there is a comprehensive global \nagreement. That amounts to a per capita drop of 35 to \n42 per cent since 1990. \n New Zealand is acutely conscious that most of \nour greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock \nmethane emissions, which so far no technology can \nreduce. At the same time we are proud of our role as a \nfood producer to the world and the contribution we can \nmake to assuring food security for the world\u2019s people. \n Our challenge is to find a way to balance growth \nin agricultural production with the need to reduce \nemissions and reach climate change targets.  \n That is not just a challenge for New Zealand, but \none for the world. Agricultural emissions make up \n14 per cent of all emissions worldwide. As demand for \nfood rises, so will those emissions. Yet so far the only \nknown way to achieve emission reductions from \nagriculture is through reductions in output, which is \nnot an acceptable response \u2014 not for New Zealand, \nand not for a growing world that seeks freedom from \nhunger. \n A better response to this challenge must be found. \nIn my view, the response must draw on the power and \npossibility of science. Just as New Zealand is proud of \nits agricultural producers, so are we proud of our role \nin agricultural research. This research has resulted in \nscientific and technological advances that have \nimproved production and fed virtually millions of \npeople. \n But advancing research in the area of emission \nreduction requires a commitment so broad that it is \nbeyond the capacity of any one individual country. \n  \n \n09-52470 32 \n \nThat is a challenge that requires collective action, and \nit is collective action that I call for today. \n New Zealand has developed a proposal for a \nglobal alliance on the reduction of agricultural \nemissions. This alliance would undertake international \nresearch and investment into new technologies and \npractices to help reduce agriculture-related emissions \nand would seek to achieve greater coordination of \nexisting efforts. \n Through a global alliance we can find solutions \nfaster, make better use of the money that is being spent \naround the world and encourage all countries and \ncompanies to do more. We have been delighted with \nthe interest that our proposal has received so far, and \nwe will continue working with others to explore the \nconcept. Today, my call to other agricultural producers \nof the world is to rise to this challenge and join New \nZealand in this research effort.  \n I now want to address some of the security crises \nthat we confront. Yesterday I had the honour to observe \nthe high-level Security Council meeting on \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. As a country with a \nproud record of promoting nuclear disarmament and \nnon-proliferation, I was heartened by the expressions \nof support for a world free of nuclear weapons. We \nmust all take full advantage of this historic moment to \nadvance the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation \nagenda. We owe it to our generation and to those who \nfollow us to move our vision for a world free from \nnuclear weapons forward. As a proudly nuclear-free \nnation and a country that has been at the forefront of \nthat debate since the 1970s, New Zealand stands ready \nto play its part.  \n We are optimistic about the prospects for \nprogress. Last week, New Zealand presided over the \nGeneral Conference of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency in Vienna, Austria. Preventing the spread of \nnuclear weapons through the implementation of \nsafeguards under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \nis a fundamental pillar of the Agency\u2019s work. Next year \nsees the quinquennial review conference of the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty. \n New Zealand will actively work with our New \nAgenda Coalition partners for a meaningful outcome at \nthat conference to bring us closer to a truly secure \nworld.  \n We will also continue to address the humanitarian \nharm caused by conventional weapons. We will work \nfor a robust, action-oriented outcome later this year at \nthe second review conference of the Ottawa \nConvention on Landmines. \n Looking back, I am proud of the role that New \nZealand was able to play in the negotiation of the \nConvention on Cluster Munitions. The Government \nattaches priority to passing legislation to enable us to \nratify this very significant treaty. New Zealand also \ncontinues to play its part in maintaining and promoting \ninternational peace and security. \n Peacekeeping remains one of this Organization\u2019s \nmost essential tasks and most solemn responsibilities to \nits Members. While United Nations peacekeeping has \nbeen significantly strengthened since the testing it \nunderwent in the 1990s, the demands now being placed \non it are severe. \n I want to express my profound gratitude to those \ncivilians and military personnel who place their lives at \nrisk to support peace and live up to the ideals of the \nCharter of the United Nations. Ensuring that United \nNations peacekeeping is as effective and responsive as \npossible must therefore remain one of the \nOrganization\u2019s most urgent priorities. \n The United Nations provides the legal mandate \u2014 \nand often the operational effectiveness \u2014 for our joint \nefforts to achieve and maintain peace and security. New \nZealand is firmly committed to supporting United \nNations peacekeeping \u2014 both its own operations and \nothers that it has mandated, such as those in which we \nare involved in Afghanistan, the Solomon Islands and \nTimor-Leste. \n All too often, however, the United Nations has \nfound itself unable to respond to emerging crises. New \nZealand therefore strongly supports the concept of \nresponsibility to protect. I am pleased at the solid \nfoundation that the General Assembly\u2019s recent debate \non that responsibility has laid for its implementation. \n New Zealand also strongly supports the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). It is a fundamental \ntenet of our domestic legal systems that wrongdoers \nmust be brought to justice. The ICC is the mechanism \nfor applying that same principle to persons accused of \nthe most serious international crimes. \n New Zealand takes very seriously its \nresponsibilities for creating and maintaining peace and \n \n \n33 09-52470 \n \nsecurity in its region and in the world. I am therefore \npleased to confirm New Zealand\u2019s candidature for the \nUnited Nations Security Council for 2015-2016 in the \nelections to be held in 2014. In advancing its \ncandidature, New Zealand does so as a State committed \nto upholding the international rule of law and to \nproviding a strong and principled Pacific voice on \nbehalf of small States like ourselves with an interest in \na fairer and more secure world. \n We all have a stake in a world where peace and \nthe rule of law prevail, where all States are secure and \ncan prosper and where all people are guaranteed the \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms promised \nthem in the Charter.  \n But we also know that solutions to the problems \nwe collectively face do not lie with inspirational goals \nand promises that can be \u2014 and far too often are \u2014 \nquickly and quietly forgotten and ignored. Hard, \npragmatic decisions must be made. Enforceable \nsolutions must be implemented. \n We know that effective, collective action is in \nevery country\u2019s long-term, national interest. That is \nwhat New Zealand believed in 1945, and I recommit \nnow to taking action to live up to the ideals of the \nUnited Nations Charter, here, in this great Hall, this \nevening."

        "file_text": "\nMr. President, on behalf of the African continent, allow \nme at the outset to congratulate our sisterly country, \nLibya, and you personally, on your assumption of the \npresidency of the General Assembly, and to express our \nconfidence that your leadership will lead to achieving \nthe success to which we aspire. I would also like to \nreaffirm the full support of Egypt and the Non-Aligned \nMovement for you in the fulfilment of your mission. \n Our session this year convenes against the \nbackdrop of international crises unprecedented in their \nnature and scope. The list of global challenges we are \nfacing, such as climate change, the food crisis and the \ncrises in international peace, is supplemented by \nadditional emerging global challenges that make it \nessential for us to redouble our efforts in a coordinated \nand collective manner.  \n The global financial crisis, together with the \nspread of diseases, such as the H1N1 virus, threatens \npublic health worldwide. Meeting this challenge \nrequires a high degree of conscientious collective work \nand a shared awareness of the effect that such a crisis \ncould have in many of our countries on stability in the \neconomic, social, even political, and perhaps security \nspheres. \n With regard to collective work on the \ninternational level, we should not overlook the fact that \nthe current international structures designed to manage \nthe realities of the global economy must reflect a \nbalance between the present and future. Therefore, \nthose structures must be subject to change, so as to \nbecome more compatible with current reality.  \n The change I refer to here is a gradual and \nstrategic shift, one which would make membership in \n \n \n41 09-52586 \n \nsuch structures accessible to a larger number of \ndeveloping countries and would grant them a stronger \nand more effective voice in determining the course of \nthe world economic order and its future. \n A few days ago, we all took part in the climate \nchange summit, convened upon the initiative of the \nSecretary-General, and listened to all the pledges made \nand the concerns expressed. While Egypt is aware of \nthe seriousness of the phenomenon in question and the \ngravity of the challenges that climate change is \nimposing on all of us, we believe in the possibility that \ncollective work could provide new opportunities for \nadvancing development in developing societies in a \nmanner that would allow the agreed sustainable \ndevelopment principles to be fulfilled. In this respect, \nwe look forward, as was stated by President Mubarak \nat the L\u2019Aquila summit in Italy in July 2009, to \narriving at a fair and balanced deal at the upcoming \nCopenhagen conference in December that would take \ninto consideration the aspirations and rights of \ndeveloping countries and, at the same time, address all \ncrucial issues, including mitigation, adaptation, \nfinancing and technology transfer.  \n A fair and balanced deal should further ensure the \nfulfilment of commitments by developed countries, and \nenable our developing countries to implement their \nvoluntary commitments within the framework of \nhonest application of the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibility. \n The world financial crisis did not originate in, nor \nwas it caused by, developing countries. However, they \nare all suffering from its consequences in different \nforms and at different levels as a result of the decrease \nin the volume of international trade, the tightening of \ninternational credit terms and the decline in tourist \ninflows and monetary remittances.  \n The current international economic recession has \nno doubt negatively affected most States. However, \nStates of the South remain the most affected, due to the \nnegative repercussions of the recession on public \nspending in health care, education and sustainable \ndevelopment in general. The parallel economic, \nfinancial and food crises that we are still confronting \nundoubtedly compound the hardships faced by the \ncountries of the South in particular, and place \nenormous burdens on us in terms of preserving \neconomic and social security in our countries.  \n To confront such challenges, serious and genuine \ninternational support and solidarity are required, based \non enhancing agricultural development with a view to \nincreasing production and productivity. Furthermore, \nthere is an urgent need to launch an international \ndialogue between exporting and importing countries in \nthe developing and developed worlds alike, in order to \nagree on an international strategy to confront the crisis, \nand to formulate an international code of conduct to \nreview the policies that govern the use of biofuels. In \naddition, we must reach an agreement under the \numbrella of the World Trade Organization that \neliminates agricultural subsidy programmes that are in \noperation in some developed countries. \n To confront the energy crisis, it is important to \nhave a genuine, broad dialogue among the relevant \nparties to identify the best available options. The \nsituation requires securing increased development \nassistance and further investments in the markets of \nenergy-producing developing countries, as well as \nconfronting irresponsible speculation on international \nmarkets. \n In this context, Egypt hopes that the 2010 high-\nlevel meeting to follow up on the implementation of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will \nexpedite renewal of international commitment and \nsolidarity towards achieving the Goals. A \ncomprehensive assessment of what has been achieved \nthus far in the implementation of the MDGs must be \ncarried out and a mechanism established to follow up \non implementation. This should lead to full \nimplementation by 2015, particularly in Africa, which \nis witnessing low implementation rates, an issue which \nneeds to be effectively addressed. \n Undoubtedly, all of these challenges oblige the \ncountries of the South to strengthen mutual \ncooperation. As current Chair of the Non-Aligned \nMovement, Egypt will work to enhance South-South \ncooperation in coordination with the Group of 77 and \nChina. We look forward to a successful United Nations \nconference on South-South cooperation, to be held in \nKenya later this year, aimed at further strengthening \nthis cooperation. \n Having spoken of the interlinked crises facing the \nworld today, I would like to address an important issue \nrelated to the human rights architecture of the United \nNations system. Despite the radical reform ushered in \nby the establishment of the Human Rights Council, \n  \n \n09-52586 42 \n \nEgypt is still dissatisfied with respect to the \npoliticization of human rights issues. This \npoliticization weakens the potential to reach consensus \non a variety of issues that should not be subject to \ndifferences as they are of concern to us all and affect \nthe credibility of the work of the United Nations in this \nvital field. Hence, Egypt is determined to exert its \nutmost effort to engage with other States in order to \nbring divergent views closer together and to establish \ncommon ground to restore the international consensus \nthat binds us all, which forms the basis for our actions \nin this important area in the Human Rights Council and \nin the General Assembly. \n In that context, we look forward to a greater role \nfor the Human Rights Council. Every one of us should \naddress the issue of the incitement of religious hatred \nand racism under the pretext of freedom of expression. \nWe look forward to, and in fact have already begun to \nseek, commonly agreed language for a draft resolution \non freedom of expression, to underscore the \nimportance of this freedom as an indispensable \ncornerstone of any democratic society, while avoiding \nthe depiction of acts of incitement to religious, racial \nand other forms of hatred as legitimate acts of freedom \nof expression. We categorically reject such a depiction. \n Turning to issues of international peace and \nsecurity, I will begin with disarmament. Egypt attaches \ngreat importance to a successful conclusion of the 2010 \nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in the \nhope that nuclear disarmament and the nuclear \nnon-proliferation regime will be put back on the right \ntrack. This will depend on dealing effectively with the \ndecisions and the resolutions of the 1995 and 2000 \nReview Conferences, in particular the resolution on the \nMiddle East.  \n It is crucial that the international community as a \nwhole support the current active momentum in the \ninternational arena with regard to disarmament issues, \nespecially in the light of developments in the positions \nof the main nuclear-weapon States, in particular the \nUnited States. We have listened to their statements, in \nparticular the address by President Obama to the \nAssembly on 23 September (see ), and we \nhope that these evolving positions will provide an \nopportunity for making historic progress in this regard. \n In the same context, it is necessary to effectively \ndeal with the issues of regional stability and security, \nmainly through eliminating the incomprehensible and \nunjustified lassitude in dealing with the issue of Israeli \nnuclear capabilities and the persistent threat they pose \nto security and stability in the Middle East. This is \nespecially true in the context of intensified efforts to \nexpand the commitments of the non-nuclear States \nparties to the NPT, without due regard for the need to \nachieve the Treaty\u2019s universality \u2014 and if there is no \ncommitment, there should be no universality \u2014 and to \nsubject all nuclear facilities in the Middle East to the \ncomprehensive safeguards regime of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Egypt will continue its \ndiligent work to address this situation in all relevant \ninternational forums and to highlight the risks, with the \naim of effecting changes in the situation. \n The situation in the Middle East region is still \ndominated by considerable tension, a tendency towards \nconfrontation and lack of stability. Notwithstanding the \ntireless efforts exerted to stabilize the situation, many \nparties still consider it beneficial to exacerbate that \ntension. \n The question of Palestine clearly remains far \nfrom being resolved, despite international concern and \nall the serious efforts, pressure, contacts, visits and \nmeetings. Since I questioned in this Assembly last year \n(see A/63/PV.13) the existence of genuine Israeli \ndetermination to achieve a just peace with the \nPalestinians, events have thus far justified our \nscepticism.  \n Throughout this year, Israel has shown a lack of \nthe political will necessary to engage in serious and \ncredible negotiations that aim at reaching a final \nsettlement to the conflict, a settlement which \nencompasses all the elements, tracks and topics and \nwhich leads to the establishment of an independent \nPalestinian State on the complete Palestinian national \nterritory, occupied since 1967, with East Jerusalem as \nits capital. \n In this respect, I would like to sum up the \nEgyptian view of the situation with the following \nelements, including what we hope to achieve.  \n First, intensive work during the coming period is \nnecessary in order to resume the negotiating process as \nsoon as possible. The international community should \nput forward a formula for a final settlement to the \nconflict \u2014 the so-called end game \u2014 cognizant of the \nneed to waste no more time in studying details that \n \n \n43 09-52586 \n \neveryone knows will not help to realize the desired \nsettlement. \n Secondly, Israel\u2019s commitment to completely \nfreeze settlement activity in all occupied Palestinian \nterritories, including East Jerusalem, must be secured, \nnot only because such activity is contrary to \ninternational law and should be halted, but also in \norder to build a climate of trust between the two \nparties, thus allowing final-status negotiations to bear \nfruit. Such Israeli commitment would pave the way to \nrestoring lost credibility in efforts to achieve peace. On \nthe other hand, any retreat from that commitment \nwould inflict severe harm on the prospects for peace in \nthe coming period. \n Thirdly, the freeze of Israeli settlement activity \nshould occur simultaneously and in parallel with the \nnegotiations, in order to bolster Palestinian trust in \nIsraeli intentions.  \n Fourthly, if an agreement is reached on the final \nborders of the State to be established on the Palestinian \nnational soil occupied in 1967, on the understanding \nthat the State\u2019s borders are essentially those of 1967, as \nhad been agreed by both parties during the 2008 \nnegotiations with the participation of the United States, \nthat agreement could be gradually implemented at a \npace to be agreed upon by both parties and within a \ntime-bound framework.  \n Fifthly, East Jerusalem is an integral part of the \noccupied Palestinian territories. As one of the issues to \nbe included in final status negotiations, it should under \nno circumstances be excluded from any future \nnegotiations. \n Sixthly, Israel\u2019s engagement in a serious, \ncredible, clear and time-bound negotiating process \nwould restore the situation on other issues to that \nwhich prevailed in the 1990s in terms of Arab \ninteraction with Israel, with a view to enhancing \nmutual trust and thus boosting negotiating efforts as a \nwhole. \n Egypt is closely following the situation in sisterly \nSudan with the same high level of interest, not only \nbecause of the historical bonds between our two \npeoples and nations but also out of concern for the \nSudan\u2019s future, stability and territorial integrity and our \nawareness of the numerous threats facing it. Egypt is \nworking earnestly with all Sudanese parties, foremost \namong which is the Sudanese Government, and in \ncoordination with influential regional and international \nstakeholders to resolve existing problems. Our sons \ntake part in the United Nations forces in South Sudan \nand in Darfur, and we contribute \u2014 out of our limited \nresources \u2014 to efforts to support development and \nprovide health care to our brothers and sisters in the \nsouth and west of the Sudan. We hope that the \nSudanese people, in their wisdom and with the support \nthey receive from their neighbours and international \npartners, will be able to weather the upcoming critical \nphase, so that the Sudan\u2019s unity can withstand all \nfuture tests and so that unity becomes the first and the \nmost attractive option for all Sudanese. This is an \nimportant objective, which Egypt is working diligently \nto achieve. \n We cannot conclude our comments on the Middle \nEast without referring to security in the Arab Gulf \nregion, which is among Egypt\u2019s main interests and at \nthe top of its foreign policy priorities. This focus is not \nonly based on the strong bonds that connect us with the \nmember States of the Gulf Cooperation Council \n(GCC), but also on our firm conviction that Egypt \nrepresents a strategic asset for its Arab brothers in the \nGulf area. For this reason, Egypt will work with GCC \ncountries to ensure Arab regional security and that any \nsecurity arrangements that are being contemplated by \ninternational or regional parties will correspond fully \nto the needs and concerns of the Arab Gulf States. \n In conclusion, the fifteenth Summit Conference \nof Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned \nCountries, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on 15 and \n16 July 2009, adopted four main declarations. The first \nis the Sharm el-Sheikh Declaration, which contains our \nmember States\u2019 clear vision on the most critical current \nissues that constitute a priority for our work within the \nUnited Nations. These include in particular the issues \nof disarmament and international security, \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding, human rights and \ndemocracy, the right of peoples to self-determination, \nthe situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian \nquestion, the reform of the United Nations, unilateral \nsanctions, the global financial and economic crisis, \ninternationally agreed development goals, food \nsecurity, Africa\u2019s special needs, diseases and \npandemics, the role of civil society, climate change, \nenergy, human trafficking, international terrorism and \ndialogue among civilizations and religions. The second \ndeclaration is on the necessity of ending the economic, \ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \n  \n \n09-52586 44 \n \nUnited States of America against Cuba. The third is on \ndesignating 18 July as International Nelson Mandela \nDay. The fourth is a declaration on Palestine. These \ndeclarations will be issued as official documents of the \nUnited Nations. \n Last July, following the chairmanship of the \nfriendly country of Cuba, Egypt assumed leadership of \nthe Non-Aligned Movement for the next three years. \nWe are determined to implement the provisions of the \nSummit\u2019s final document according to the priorities set \nout in those declarations. We shall put forward at this \nsession the pertinent draft resolutions and decisions to \nimplement those documents. The delegation of Egypt \nwill be pleased to work with all Member States in a \nspirit of openness and determination to make this \nsession a success. We extend a hand to all States with \nan open mind and the resolve to achieve success on the \ninternational agenda before us."

        "file_text": "I feel highly honoured to \naddress the Assembly once again. I would like to start \nby congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-fourth session and to assure him of my \ndelegation\u2019s support and cooperation as he performs \nthe demanding task of presiding over our deliberations. \nThrough him, I would also like to convey my sincere \ngratitude to His Excellency Monsignor Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann for the efficient and effective \nmanner in which he conducted the previous session. In \naddition, my appreciation goes to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his comprehensive account of the work of \nthe Organization and his analysis of the challenges \nfacing the global community. \n The theme for this year\u2019s session is apt and \ntimely. It is only through dialogue among the various \n \n \n09-52320 18 \n \ncivilizations of the world represented in this \ndeliberative body and the strengthening of the \ninstitutions and architecture responsible for promoting \nsuch dialogue that we can effectively meet the \nchallenges posed by the current global crisis. Dialogue \npromotes understanding; understanding enhances \ncooperation; and cooperation gives vitality and \nlegitimacy to the institutions and mechanisms that have \nbeen structured to meet our common challenges and \ngoals. \n Civilizations began as magnificent blueprints for \nmeeting challenges that were specific to particular \nregions of the world, but advances in technology and \ncommunications have made problems no longer \nspecific to particular regions. Climate change; the \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and swine flu pandemics; the \nfood and fuel crises, including the present global \neconomic meltdown; terrorism; nuclear proliferation; \nand drug trafficking are all beyond the capacity of any \nof the world\u2019s civilizations to tackle without \ninternational cooperation. While the major causes of \nthose challenges may arise from particular regions, \ntheir impacts are global and affect the lives and \nfortunes of peoples of all civilizations. Dialogue \namong civilizations will create the synergies required \nto tackle the causes and impacts of the global crises. \n My Government fully subscribes to and supports \nthe promotion of dialogue, as well as the facilitation of \nmechanisms that will help to ameliorate the impact of \nthe global crises. Among some population groups, that \nimpact may be on the size of their bonuses; among \nothers, it may be on whether they acquire a second car \nor not. But for the vast number of people \u2014 \nparticularly in Africa \u2014 the impact of the crises is \ncreating life-threatening situations.  \n Years of conflict had increased the number of \npoor and vulnerable people in my country. However, \nstable economic growth, remittances and international \nfinancial and security support were increasing \nprospects for ameliorating the situation, but the present \nglobal crisis has suddenly decreased those prospects, \npushing greater numbers of our people into extreme \npoverty. \n We in Sierra Leone are saddled with the effects of \ntrade imbalances in international commerce. Our \neconomy continues to be vigorously challenged by the \nfalling prices of our exports in the international market. \nThis includes diamonds and cash crops. The effect of \nthis intractable problem is that we are not able to \ngarner enough foreign exchange to meet the basic \nimport requirements for our sustenance. We are on the \nthreshold of the tenth year of the implementation of the \nMillennium Declaration and yet the prospects for \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 \nremain dismal for Africa. \n Many countries in Africa, including mine, have in \nthe last few years registered important improvements \nin the essential areas of governance and economic and \nsocial indicators. My country, Sierra Leone, is putting \nin place mechanisms to ensure a stable democratic \nregime. Worldwide indicators show that we have made \nextremely fast progress in political stability. Our \neconomic growth remains strong at 6 to 9 per cent. My \nGovernment has firmed up the aspirations of our \npeople in an Agenda for Change that sets out four clear \npriority areas: agriculture, energy, infrastructure and \nreforms to improve delivery of health and education \nservices. We are already delivering results in our \npriority areas. Key roads are under construction, we \nhave completed a hydroelectric project that is \nsupplying clean, affordable power to Freetown for the \nfirst time, and our reforms have ensured that we are the \nbest performer among neighbouring countries \naccording to the Doing Business Index. \n My Government could not sustain these results \nwithout multilateral support. On 18 and 19 November \nof this year, we are organizing a Consultative Group \nMeeting on Sierra Leone in London to dialogue with \ninvestors, donors and other partners, and to mobilize \nsupport for our efforts in tackling the many challenges \nfacing our country. We see the Sierra Leone conference \nas a problem-solving dialogue; we aspire to a \nconference that will build an action-oriented \nmultilateral framework for meeting the challenges we \nface. My country believes in multilateralism; we \nbelieve in dialogue among nations as the most effective \nmeans of tackling our problems. We call upon all \ncountries to ensure that the current financial crisis does \nnot deny the many African nations only recently \nremoved from violent conflict the security and prospect \nof prosperity that we have all worked so hard to \nachieve. \n I would like to address another issue my \ndelegation takes very seriously, one that is interwoven \nwith the financial crisis, poverty and development \u2014 \nthe serious threat that climate change poses to human \ndevelopment in general and African nations in \n \n \n19 09-52320 \n \nparticular. Despite the scientific consensus that the \nearth is warming at an alarming rate, progress in \nreducing greenhouse-gas emissions and limiting global \nwarming to below an increase of 2 degrees Celsius \nper year has proved elusive. Today, the poorest nations, \nwhich contribute the least to the phenomenon, are the \nmost vulnerable. The recent torrential rainfall in \nFreetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, left scores of \npeople dead, homeless or seriously injured. Drought, \nhurricanes, floods, changing rainfall patterns, rising sea \nlevels and low crop yields rank high among the key \nchallenges facing the world\u2019s poor. Unfortunately, \nthose nations with the least resources are the most \nunprepared for such challenges. \n It is our obligation to reverse the alarming rate of \nenvironmental destruction and depletion of our natural \nresources. It is in this regard that I wish to reiterate \nAfrica\u2019s common position on climate change, which, \namong other things, urges developed countries to cut \ngreenhouse-gas emissions by 40 per cent. This is \ncertainly not an ambitious goal. It is the least that we, \nthe most vulnerable, deserve. \n We believe that in addition to the necessity of \ninvesting in clean development mechanisms, the \nworld\u2019s developed countries must take a leadership \nrole, providing adequate and predictable financial and \ntechnical support for less developed countries to foster \neffective adaptation as well as mitigation measures. We \nshare the Secretary-General\u2019s vision that the Climate \nChange Summit in Copenhagen represents a unique \nand powerful opportunity at a critical moment in \nhuman history to steer humankind towards a safer, \nmore stable and more sustainable future. \n A final threat critical to the future stability of \nnations around the world is the increasing proliferation \nof small arms and light weapons, which, as former \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan recently emphasized, \nare tantamount to weapons of mass destruction in slow \nmotion, capable of destabilizing countries and entire \nregions. Given that many African countries routinely \nface political instability and violent threats, we need to \nstrengthen the national, regional and subregional \nconflict-resolution mechanisms through which it \nbecomes possible for Africa to control small weapons. \nPeace and development can be achieved in Africa, in \npart, by exploration of the peace and security \narchitecture evolving within the African Union, the \nEconomic Community of West African States, the \nSouthern African Development Community and the \nPeacebuilding Commission. \n Against this background, I wish to reiterate that \ncollaborative efforts among members of the \ninternational community are crucial to addressing our \nglobal problems, and that international support remains \ncritical for the consolidation of hard-won gains by \nnations emerging from war. It is our hope that the \nUnited Nations and our development partners will \ncontinue to be our steadfast allies in our ongoing \nstruggle for economic progress and development. In \nthis regard, I urge that we continue to forge enhanced \ncooperation between the United Nations and the \nAfrican Union, as well as subregional organizations, \ncooperation that goes beyond rhetoric and translates \ninto concrete efforts. \n As I intimated before the Assembly at the sixty-\nthird session, we have come a long way, thanks to \nmultilateral and bilateral efforts in favour of our \nsurvival as a nation. The ongoing peacebuilding \nefforts, spearheaded by the United Nations \nPeacebuilding Commission, continue to strengthen the \npeace-consolidation process in the country. I am \npleased to announce that, in return and in a spirit of \nreciprocity, Sierra Leone has joined the ranks of the \ntroop-contributing countries of United Nations \npeacekeeping operations. \n Multilateralism is vital for international \ncooperation and for responding to global crises. In the \nbid to promote effective multilateralism, my \nGovernment has continued to urge the international \ncommunity to effect various reforms aimed at \nstrengthening our intergovernmental organizations, \nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions, with a view \nto making them more inclusive, transparent and \ndemocratic in their decision-making processes.  \n An effective, legitimate and democratic United \nNations cannot be achieved without a true reform of \nthe Security Council. The ongoing intergovernmental \nnegotiations on the question of equitable representation \non, and increase in the membership of, the Security \nCouncil and other matters relating to the Council have \nprogressed through three informal plenary rounds at \nthe last session of the General Assembly. We in Africa \nhave consistently demanded that the historical injustice \nthat is rooted in our underrepresentation and \nnon-representation in the non-permanent and \npermanent categories of the Council be addressed \n \n \n09-52320 20 \n \nwithout any further delay. It is in this respect that we \nhave continued to negotiate in good faith and mutual \ntrust. I am hopeful that the outcome of these \nnegotiations will lead to a meaningful reform of this, \nthe principal decision-making organ of the United \nNations in the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity. We in Africa stand ready, willing and \nprepared, as always, to resume negotiations during this \nsession. \n Let us promote multilateralism and strengthen our \ncollaborative efforts to contain the rising threats to our \nplanet."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I should like to express our \ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \nelection to preside over the General Assembly. We \nwish him the best for his work in leading the Assembly \nat its sixty-fourth session. \n Given the sweeping changes occurring at all \nlevels of global development, the role of the United \nNations as a universal international forum is difficult to \noverstate. The contribution of all Member States to \nincreasing the effectiveness of the United Nations can \nconsiderably contribute to strengthening international \npeace and security, development, human rights, \nenvironmental protection and sustainable development. \n We believe continuing United Nations reform to \nestablish an efficient mechanism to address \ncontemporary challenges and threats is important for \nthe further strengthening of the Organization\u2019s \ncapacities and credibility. We call for broader \nrepresentation in the Security Council and for \nimprovement in its working methods. We propose \nexpanding the number of permanent members of the \nCouncil by giving seats to Asia, Africa, Latin America \nand the Caribbean. \n I would like to confirm that my country, being \ncognizant of our full responsibilities, is for the first \ntime nominating itself as a candidate to become one of \nthe non-permanent members of the Security Council, \nfor the period 2012 to 2013. The Kyrgyz Republic, \nlocated in the heart of Central Asia, is taking an active \npart in maintaining peace and security, economic \ncooperation and environmental stability at both the \nglobal and regional levels. We are prepared to \ncontribute as much as we can to the work of that key \nbody of the United Nations. \n The election of the Kyrgyz Republic to the \nHuman Rights Council in 2009 illustrated the \ninternational community\u2019s recognition of our \nachievements in building a developed society. I should \nlike to take this opportunity to thank Member States for \ntheir support of the candidacy of the Kyrgyz Republic. \nI assure them that Kyrgyzstan stands ready to make \nevery effort to promote issues related to the protection \nof human rights and respect for the rule of law and \n \n \n11 09-52586 \n \ninternational law, as well as other issues on the \nCouncil\u2019s agenda. \n The Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the decision of \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon to visit the Central \nAsian countries. We look forward to great results from \nthat visit. \n The overall situation in Central Asia remains \ncomplicated. In many respects, it depends on \ndevelopments taking place in neighbouring \nAfghanistan. No one would today dispute the fact that \nthere is a need to work out and apply fundamentally \nnew comprehensive and viable approaches in the \nhumanitarian, politico-anthropological and \nsocio-economic sectors, which will ultimately \ncontribute to the building of a strong and prosperous \nAfghan State. It does not appear to be possible to \nachieve a final and complete stabilization of \nAfghanistan by military means alone. \n On 4 March 2009, President Kurmanbek Bakiev \nof the Kyrgyz Republic announced an initiative to \nestablish at Bishkek, capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, a \npermanent forum and centre for hosting international \nconferences on security and stability in Afghanistan \nand Central Asia. This was called the \u201cBishkek \ninitiative\u201d. We are convinced that this \u201cBishkek \ninitiative\u201d will become a forum of practical \ncooperation in the area of security, with priority on the \nproblems of jointly bringing about peace, security and \nstability in the region, combating terrorism, separatism \nand extremism and countering illegal drug trafficking \nand cross-border organized crime. \n Along with global challenges, every country \nfaces its own specific problems. Addressing them will \nensure that we move steadily towards the achievement \nof the Millennium Development Goals. \n At the same time, in this era of globalization, \nexisting problems have proven to be very closely \ninterrelated. The Kyrgyz Republic, as a landlocked \nmountainous country and one of the world\u2019s \ndeveloping nations, believes that the world community, \nunder the leadership of the United Nations, can and \nmust more actively assist in using the foreign-debt-\nswap mechanism to achieve sustainable development. \n With respect to Kyrgyzstan, given the global \neconomic crisis, we propose considering several \noptions, namely, a swap of the Republic\u2019s debt for \nproviding assistance to Afghanistan in pursuit of its \nsocio-economic development, and a debt swap for the \nsustainable development of poor mountainous \ncountries and the rehabilitation of uranium tailing \nponds. \n The Kyrgyz Republic calls for the active \ninvolvement in Afghanistan\u2019s recovery of neighbouring \nStates that possess relevant scientific, industrial and \nagricultural capacities. Kyrgyzstan stands ready to take \npart in the restoration of communications, construction \nand the training of medical, educational and \nagricultural specialists. We are pleased to inform the \nAssembly that our country and the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) signed an \nagreement on the development of a customs centre in \nthe city of Bishkek for training Afghan specialists. \n The General Assembly has adopted a number of \nresolutions on mountainous countries that contain \nanalyses of their socio-economic situations and \nrecommendations to international financial institutions, \nrelevant United Nations agencies and Governments on \nhow to assist them in overcoming obstacles to their \nsustainable development. The delegation of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, one of the initiators of a draft resolution on \nsustainable mountain development, would be grateful \nfor support for that draft at the sixty-fourth session of \nthe General Assembly. \n We discussed problems related to planetary \nclimate change at the high-level Summit of the General \nAssembly. Kyrgyzstan shares the opinion that \nenvironmental and ecological security problems are \nposing new challenges and risks in the twenty-first \ncentury. Kyrgyzstan will give highest priority to active \npreventive measures in the sphere of environmental \nprotection as a foundation of its sustainable \ndevelopment and to maintain the balance between \nhuman rights, society, nature and the preservation of \nunique natural sites for our descendants. \n The numerous uranium tailing dumps containing \nlarge volumes of the toxic waste of uranium production \nand other harmful technological wastes are of great \nconcern to our region. They pose a grave danger to the \nhealth of the people and to the cleanliness of \ntransboundary river basins and arable lands. \n Kyrgyzstan is working tirelessly with other \ncountries of Central Asia to draft international legal \ndocuments on the prevention of radiation pollution in \nCentral Asia. Two framework documents have been \nadopted within the framework of the Treaty on the \n  \n \n09-52586 12 \n \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \u2014 one on the \nenvironmental danger of tailing dumps and the other on \nthe creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central \nAsia. I would like to inform the Assembly that the \nTreaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia \nentered into force on 21 March 2009, and we appeal to \nnuclear Powers to support this Central Asian initiative \nand to sign the protocol on negative security \nassurances. \n I am pleased to note that the High-Level \nInternational Forum held in Geneva on uranium \ntailings in Central Asia demonstrated a new model of \neffective regional cooperation aimed at practical \nresolution of this urgent issue. The great interest and \nconcern expressed by all participants \u2014 including \nrepresentatives of Central Asian and other States, \ninternational organizations and donors at the national, \nregional and international levels \u2014 give us cause for \noptimism. I take this opportunity once again to express \nmy gratitude to all our partners at the Forum, the \nUnited Nations system, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, the European Commission, the \nEurasian Economic Community, OSCE and the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \n In furtherance of the Forum agreement, the \ncountries of Central Asia shall submit a draft resolution \nfor consideration by the General Assembly on the role \nof the international community in the prevention of the \nradiation threat in Central Asia. We hope for timely \naction on the part of our international partners, donors \nand international organizations to address the problem \nof uranium tailing dumps and to provide sufficient \nfinancial, technical and other assistance to the region. \n The challenges facing the United Nations are \ncomplex and demand consolidated efforts from all \nStates. The representatives of the United Nations \nprovide broad assistance to countries on a wide variety \nof issues. We appreciate their constructive cooperation \non and support for Members\u2019 initiatives. The United \nNations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for \nCentral Asia, established in Ashgabat in December \n2007, has already proven itself in a short period of \ntime. The issues raised by the Centre are relevant and \nrequire prompt responses. We support the intention of \nthe Centre to expand its representation in each country \nof Central Asia and request the appropriate committees \ntake our views into consideration. \n Central Asian countries pay considerable \nattention to water and energy problems. Despite the \nactivities to increase the effectiveness of water and \nenergy regulation in Central Asia, pursued within the \nframework of integration organizations and regional \nstructures, rallying countries around this issue remains \nthe most pressing problem in our region.  \n We believe that mutually beneficial cooperation \nis the basis for long-term intergovernmental \ncooperation in the water and energy spheres. It is \nessential to create conditions to improve incentives to \nstore water in reservoirs during the winter and then to \nmake it available for irrigating fields in the summer. If \nthis proposal were pursued, the largest reservoir in \nCentral Asia, on the Naryn and Syr Darya Rivers, the \nlargest watershed of the region, would have the \nrequired stocks of water in times of drought and be \nable to provide water at least to maintain food and \nenergy security for all the countries of Central Asia. \n If decisions are taken only for short-term benefit, \nand water is depleted and regulating capacities are lost, \nthat would inevitably have dangerous consequences for \nthe entire region. These strategic issues can be solved \nonly by merging the irrigation and energy schedules for \nsupplying water and providing compensation fuel \ndeliveries that should be the subject of \nintergovernmental cooperation among stakeholders. \nWater conservation technologies should also be \nexploited.  \n In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm the \nadherence of the Kyrgyz Republic to the goals and \nobjectives of the United Nations aimed at ensuring \npeace and security and the welfare of all nations and \npeoples on the Earth."

        "file_text": "I should \nlike at the outset to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session and to express my \nappreciation to his predecessor, Father Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for his efforts. I should also like \nto thank in particular His Excellency the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his comprehensive \nannual report on the work of the Organization (A/64/1) \nand for the special attention that he has consistently \ndevoted to the concerns of Lebanon and its people. \n Lebanon closely follows all political, economic, \nsocial and legal issues on the agenda of the General \nAssembly, and we are hopeful and confident that we \nwill be elected as a non-permanent member of the \nSecurity Council for the period 2010-2011, with the \nfull support of brotherly and friendly nations in that \nregard. Lebanon looks forward to that election with \ngreat confidence, because we are a founding member \nof this universal international Organization and \ncontributed significantly to the drafting of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.  \n For thousands of years, the people of Lebanon \nhave made vital contributions to the development of \ncivilization, including innovations that have promoted \ncommunication, interaction and dialogue among \nnations and peoples. These are the same people who set \nsail in search of new horizons of cooperation and \ncommunication and have played a vital role in \nspreading the values of freedom and democracy, \nreinforcing the concept of Arab nationalism and \nestablishing the pillars of the intellectual and literary \nrenaissance of the Arab world. \n Today, from this rostrum, Lebanon reaffirms its \ncommitment to the Charter of the United Nations and \nto the resolutions of international legitimacy, in \nparticular Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), as \nwell as its willingness to contribute seriously and \nresponsibly to the deliberations and resolutions of the \nCouncil for the coming two years, especially those \naimed at ensuring peace and security in the Middle \nEast. Furthermore, Lebanon will give special \nconsideration to the deliberations on reform of the \nUnited Nations and its organs that will enable it to \nbecome more effective in addressing the challenges of \ntoday\u2019s world. \n Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the \nLebanese Constitution, which was adopted in 1926, \ntwo decades before the United Nations was established, \nstipulates that \u201cThere shall be absolute freedom of \nconscience. The State ... shall respect all religions and \ncreeds and guarantees under its protection, and the free \nexercise of all religious rites\u201d.  \n  \n \n09-52463 16 \n \n The model of coexistence embodied by Lebanon, \nwhich allows various confessional communities to \nparticipate actively in its political life in an \nenvironment of democracy and freedom of thought and \nexpression, runs counter to all trends towards ethnic or \nreligious cleansing and doctrines of the single-thought \ntheory. That is why, last year, I called for the \nestablishment of Lebanon as an internationally \nrecognized centre for dialogue among civilizations, \ncultures and religions, in keeping with our role as a \nbridge of communication between East and West and \nour message as a country in which 18 different \ncommunities interact in a unique and exemplary \nmanner. \n One of the primary tasks entrusted to the Security \nCouncil is to strive to maintain international peace and \nsecurity. Indeed, it is very unfortunate that the Arab \nMiddle East, a region that gave rise to the three \nmonotheistic religions, has been an area of tension, \nconflict and war ever since the Nakba, the tragedy that \nbefell Palestine in 1948 and displaced its people. \n Any settlement of the Middle East crisis must be \nbased on a predetermined and comprehensive plan \nwhose basic elements have been set out in the \nresolutions of international legitimacy, at the Madrid \nPeace Conference and in the Arab Peace Initiative. \nAbove all, such a settlement requires the genuine \npolitical will of the parties to commit themselves to \npeace and its obligations.  \n However, the Israeli side has not demonstrated \nsuch will, because the soundness and usefulness of a \njust peace are still being discussed both by the \nGovernment and at the grass-roots level in Israel. \nFurthermore, Israeli threats of attacks and wars \ncontinue as ways to exert control and hegemony and \nimpose a fait accompli, if not to bring about expansion, \ndisplacement and further encroachment on the rights of \nPalestinians and Arabs. Meanwhile, Arab countries \nhave together introduced a comprehensive Peace \nInitiative, which was unanimously adopted at the 2002 \nArab League Summit, held in Beirut.  \n It is thus essential that the international \ncommunity take appropriate measures to compel Israel \nto fulfil its international obligations under the peace \nprocess within a specific and reasonable time frame, in \naccordance with the Declaration of the recent Arab \nLeague Summit held in Doha, Qatar. How can we \npersuade our peoples that the international community \nis capable of achieving a just and comprehensive peace \nand thus of putting an end to the various aspects of the \nMiddle East conflict, including through an Israeli \nwithdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and the \nestablishment of an independent and sovereign \nPalestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital, if it \ncannot force Israel to halt its settlement construction, \nlift its unjust siege on Gaza and stop the Judaization of \nJerusalem? \n In that context, it is important to note that people \nhave the right to reclaim their occupied territories by \nall legitimate and available means, in accordance with \nthe provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and \nthe relevant United Nations resolutions. Everyone here \nknows how Lebanon was able to liberate most of its \nterritories occupied by Israel in the spring of 2000 after \nIsrael had refused to implement resolution 425 (1978), \nwhich called for its immediate and unconditional \nwithdrawal from all Lebanese territories. That \noccupation lasted 22 continuous years. \n Our meeting this year coincides with the sixtieth \nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations \nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \nNear East (UNRWA). On this occasion, Lebanon would \nlike to stress that the Palestinian refugees\u2019 solution is \nfirst and foremost a political solution. We fully support \nall efforts aimed at reinforcing the programmes and \ncapabilities of UNRWA, enabling it to improve the \nliving standards and human conditions of the refugees, \nin collaboration with the host countries, until a just and \nfinal solution to the tragedy of the Palestinians has \nbeen reached. \n Clearly, such a just and final solution for the \nPalestinian refugees cannot deny them their natural and \nlegitimate right of return to their lands and homes, nor \ncan it be achieved without the host countries\u2019 \nparticipation or in violation of their sovereignty, their \nspecial circumstances and their national interests. This \nis why Lebanon rejects any form of settling Palestinian \nrefugees on its territories, for by such rejection it \nupholds the Palestinian refugees\u2019 right of return, in \naccordance with Lebanon\u2019s Constitution and national \npact. Let it be clear that such a position will not be \nreversed. Nor will it be subject to compromise or \nnegotiation. I take this opportunity to express our \ngratitude to the countries that have lent their support to \nthe Lebanese position on this issue and shown a \nwillingness to defend it. \n \n \n17 09-52463 \n \n Throughout last year, Lebanon was able to \nmaintain its internal stability and dismantle many \nIsraeli spy networks and terrorist cells while striving to \nimplement resolution 1701 (2006) and strengthen its \nrelations with brotherly and friendly countries. \nFurthermore, Lebanon was able to hold parliamentary \nelections. The world witnessed the transparency and \nintegrity of those elections, and the results were \naccepted by all competing parties. Lebanon has also \nbeen able to improve its credibility, avoid the aftermath \nof the global financial crisis, attract many tourists and \ninvestors, and raise its economic growth rate to almost \n6 per cent. It is now preparing to host the sixth \nFrancophone Games in a few days. \n While parliamentary consultations are taking \nplace in accordance with constitutional provisions and \nthe requirement to forge a national consensus, we are \nlooking forward to forming a national unity \ngovernment very soon. Such a government would \nreinstate government dynamics and launch the \npolitical, administrative and judicial reform process the \nLebanese people aspire to. The fruits of such a process \nwill serve the people and the authorities, thus ensuring \nits success and continuity. \n In parallel, and on the third anniversary of the \nadoption of resolution 1701 (2006), Lebanon stresses \nthat Israel should be forced to comply with all the \nprovisions of that resolution, especially its withdrawal \nfrom all the Lebanese occupied territories, including \nthe Shaba\u2019a farms, the Kfarshouba hills and the \nnorthern part of the village of Ghajar, to stop its daily \nviolations of Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty and its persistent \nthreats against Lebanon, its institutions and \ninfrastructure. \n In this context, Lebanon would like to commend \nthe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) \nfor the role it is playing in the south of the country, in \naccordance with the rules of engagement agreed upon \nand in full coordination with the Lebanese Army. In \naddition, Lebanon would like to reaffirm that it \nremains keen to preserve the safety of this Force and \nreiterates its appreciation for the efforts deployed by its \ncommander and soldiers and for their sacrifices in the \nservice of peace and stability. \n Lebanon will pursue its international efforts to \nforce Israel to pay due compensation for the enormous \ndamage it caused through its repeated acts of \naggression against Lebanon, including the damage \ncaused by the oil slick resulting from the Israeli \nbombardment of the Jiyeh power plant in the summer \nof 2006. \n The experience acquired over the past 61 years \nhas confirmed a set of truths. First, the Palestinian \ncause is at the core of the Middle East conflict. \nSecondly, Israel\u2019s resorting to force to impose a fait \naccompli is futile and will weaken neither the will nor \nthe determination of the Arab people to restore their \nrights. Thirdly, partial and unilateral solutions will not \nachieve genuine peace, and unjust solutions are short-\nlived. \n Since the middle of the last century, the world has \nwitnessed fundamental political, intellectual and \nideological shifts that have had a profound impact on \nnations and their interactions, along with a troubling \naccumulation of economic, social and environmental \npredicaments. No matter how local or regional some \nconflicts and crises have been in the past, in the current \nera of globalization they have become global in nature \nor acquired a global dimension. Such has been the case \nfor the phenomenon of international terrorism, the \nglobal financial crisis and the contagious diseases that \nare spreading across continents. \n In ancient times, and now in the modern world, as \ntold in the fiercest epic tales, wars beget tragic and \npainful events and give rise to costly and horrific \nexperiences where endless blood and countless tears \nare shed and disappointment and tragedies prevail. We \ntherefore hope that the United Nations, which from the \noutset was established to prevent wars and resolve \nconflicts through peaceful means, will persist in its \nendeavour to achieve righteousness and establish \njustice through active and unbiased international \nefforts."

        "file_text": "A few weeks \nago, the Empire State Building was lit up in orange, the \nnational colour of the Netherlands. The reason was \nthat, precisely 400 years ago, the Dutch East India \nCompany commissioned Henry Hudson to find a \nshorter sea route to Asia via the north. After a brutal \nvoyage filled with hardships, Hudson decided to \nchange course. He never found his shortcut to Asia, but \nhe did become the first person to map the area around \nthe river that would one day bear his name, including \nthe place where we are gathered today. Ever since then, \nthe origin of the great city of New York has been \nclosely linked with the courage and resolve of Henry \nHudson. Today more than ever before, we must make \nthose qualities our own.  \n In the past year, we have faced the harsh reality \nof a financial and economic system on the brink. The \ncrisis has been so severe and so rapid that courage and \nresolve are now required of us all \u2014 the courage to \nplace shared values and interests above narrow self-\ninterest, the resolve to adapt existing global \ngovernance structures to a new reality and the courage \nto make decisive choices that take account of all \ninterests, especially those of the world\u2019s weakest and \npoorest people. That is my clear message to the \nGeneral Assembly. \n The Dutch Government has no doubt that a \nstrong, decisive and efficient United Nations will be \nvital to that process. Only an integrated global \napproach will deliver the stability, solidarity and \nsustainability that the world needs so badly. The last \nfew days in New York and Pittsburgh have shown that \nthere is a clear realization that the world has changed \nand that we must work together more closely than ever \nbefore. Our interdependency gives us a shared \nresponsibility. We can see now that the problems we \nface are too big for any single nation.  \n There is therefore strong will to address the \nunderlying causes of the economic crisis, to work on \nsystemic imbalances and to once again make finance a \ntool for growth. The agreement we reached in \nPittsburgh on a framework for strong, sustainable and \nbalanced growth is a big step forward. It shows that \nthere is a widely shared conviction that we have much \nto gain from stability, solidarity and sustainability, both \nas individual countries and collectively. I would like to \nsay a few words about each of those core concepts. \n \n \n9 09-52586 \n \n The current crisis offers clear proof that in a \nglobalized world instability anywhere is a threat to \nstability everywhere. The international policy response \nhas shown that that is widely understood in the \nfinancial and economic context. That is a positive sign, \neven if there is still a long way to go. The Pittsburgh \nagreement on compensation systems should end a \nbonus culture that has grown out of control. We cannot \nallow the greed of a few to endanger the jobs of many. \nWe must therefore prevent that kind of crisis from ever \nhappening again. \n Mr. Valero Brice\u00f1o (Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela), Vice-President, took the Chair. \n Institutional reform should not stop with the \nfinancial and economic sector. There is a clear need for \nnew arrangements that will allow us to manage a range \nof global governance issues at the same time. In the \nlong term, the greatest threat to a stable world order is \nto allow the crisis to push the world\u2019s other great \nproblems into the background: climate change, for \nexample, the energy and food crisis or the pressing \nissues of peace and security, poverty and human rights. \nWe cannot let that happen. In some cases, we simply \nhave to honour commitments that we have already \nmade, such as the Millennium Development Goals. In \nothers, we need the courage to see beyond this crisis to \nthe world of tomorrow, as we must show at the climate \nsummit to be held in Copenhagen.  \n In any event, the current situation demands that \nwe place our common global values and interests \nabove our acute domestic problems, however serious \nthey may be. Therefore, now more than ever, we need a \nstrong, decisive and efficient United Nations. We need \nit here in New York, but we especially need it on the \nground. In that context, I would highlight the vital \nimportance of the One United Nations Initiative, which \nneeds follow-up, and soon. \n Stability cannot be achieved without respect for \nhuman rights. As friends of the Iranian people, we are \nconcerned about the worsening human rights situation \nand the violent crackdown on popular protests. The \nIranian nuclear issue represents a major challenge to \ninternational peace and security, to regional stability \nand to the non-proliferation regime. The recent \nrevelation of a nuclear facility that was long kept secret \nis additional reason for great concern. It calls for a \nstrong reaction by the international community and for \ntotal transparency by Iran. Iran must regain the trust of \nthe international community, comply with relevant \nSecurity Council resolutions and contribute to peace \nand stability in the Middle East. \n In June of this year, the United Nations showed \nleadership by holding a major conference here in New \nYork on the effects of the crisis for developing \ncountries. The Netherlands fully supported that \ninitiative, as there can be no stability without \nsolidarity. After all, there is nothing more destabilizing \nthan poverty, hunger and a future without hope. The \neconomic crisis and rising food prices are threatening \nto sweep away a great deal of hard-won progress. In \n2009 alone, the number of people forced to live on less \nthan $1.25 a day will grow by at least 55 million. \n There is a real danger that those who had no part \nin causing the crisis will be the people who suffer most \ndeeply. In rich countries the crisis means the loss of \njobs and assets. In developing countries it means rising \nchild mortality and rising hunger. Therefore, in rich \ncountries the crisis is serious; in poor countries it is a \nmatter of life and death. \n Let the donor countries honour an old promise \nand set aside at least 0.7 per cent of their national \nincome every year for development aid; and let the \ncurrent crisis also inspire recipient countries to use the \nfunds as effectively as possible. Now more than ever, \npublic support for development aid depends on \ntransparency, good governance and an effective fight \nagainst corruption.  \n I would also add that international solidarity is \nnot simply a question of development budgets. It also \nconcerns the private sector. More and more businesses \nnow recognize the importance of corporate social \nresponsibility. I believe there is still a world to be won \nin that regard, not only for society but also for \ncompanies themselves. Corporate social responsibility \nmakes good business sense. \n My third subject, sustainability, is essentially \nabout making choices and sacrifices, not for our own \nsake but for future generations. This session of the \nGeneral Assembly is our last major stop on the road to \nCopenhagen. We should be aware that the progress we \nmake there will affect the lives of our children, our \nchildren\u2019s children and so on, down through the \ngenerations. That must be our main motive for seeking \na radical change in the way we live. \n  \n \n09-52586 10 \n \n In Copenhagen we must reach an ambitious, fair \nand comprehensive agreement. We must be ambitious \nand set our sights high. Therefore, at Copenhagen the \nNetherlands will call for worldwide carbon dioxide \nemissions to be halved from 1990 levels by 2050. We \nshould be fair to developing countries. Every country \nshould contribute to the common goal according to its \nmeans. Every country will be expected to play its part. \nBut those that need help in designing and \nimplementing sound adaptation policies must receive \nit. That is why the Netherlands has set aside \n\u20ac500 million to promote the use of renewable energy in \ndeveloping countries. \n Comprehensive also means that we should not \nsimply pave the road ahead with good intentions, but \nwith concrete agreements \u2014 for example, agreements \non developing the global carbon market, on sharing \nknowledge and on financial arrangements. We simply \ncannot fail at Copenhagen.  \n The world is much smaller than it was in the days \nof Henry Hudson, but it is far more complex as a \nresult. Any solution to the issues I have raised today \nstarts with recognizing our mutual dependence and \nresponsibility. Within the concepts of stability, \nsolidarity and sustainability we will find the shared \nvalues and interests that should guide us on the road \nahead. It is a road that requires courage. But to echo \nthe words I heard recently from the Italian Nobel Prize \nwinner and senator for life Rita Levi-Montalcini, on \nher one-hundredth birthday, \u201cDon\u2019t fear difficult \nmoments. The best comes from them.\u201d Let us go \nforward in that spirit."

        "file_text": "I come to the Assembly, as \nAustralia has each year since the first session of the \nGeneral Assembly in 1946, and I come in the same \nspirit, to seek solutions to the great challenges of our \nage and together help give those solutions effect. \n The challenges are not new. They are reflected in \nthe Preamble to the Charter which we, as an \ninternational community, crafted together: \u201cto save \nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d, to \nadvance economic growth and social progress for all, \n\u201cto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights \u2026 in \nthe equal rights of men and women and of nations large \nand small\u201d. All those great undertakings were to be \nreflected in a new body of international law. \n Two thirds of a century later these great \ninternational values remain constant, while the \nchallenges to which we apply them are subject to \ncontinuing change. It is on the current challenges \nfacing the global order that I wish to speak to the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session today: the \nglobal financial crisis, the unfinished business of the \nDoha Round, the unfolding crisis of the planet itself, \nunresolved questions of nuclear weapons 20 years after \nthe end of the cold war, and the future of global \ngovernance itself. \n Just on a year ago, just down the road from here, \na destructive chain of events triggered the worst global \nfinancial crisis in three quarters of a century. It was \njust on a year ago that I addressed the Assembly for the \nfirst time, 10 days after the collapse of Lehman \n \n \n45 09-52228 \n \nBrothers, to reflect on the challenges which lay ahead \nfor the proper regulation of global financial markets. \n That reform programme is now under way, \nthrough the Group of 20 (G-20), the Financial Stability \nBoard and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But \nthere remains much work to be done to prevent the \nunrestrained greed of unregulated financial markets \nthat has wrought such economic carnage across the \nworld in the past 12 months from sowing the seeds of \nfuture financial crises. \n The global financial crisis has been a wake-up \ncall to the international community to reform the \ninstitutions of global governance, and a wake-up call \nthat our system of global governance today is in need \nof radical reform. Because the truth is that the failure \nof these institutions is not just a matter of concern for \nGovernments and for diplomats and for economists; the \nprice of the failure of these institutions has been paid \nby working people and their families right across the \nworld.  \n The events on Wall Street spread rapidly and \nindiscriminately to every corner of the globe, from \nLondon to Lima, from Beijing to Barcelona, from \nMelbourne to Mumbai, to developed and developing \neconomies. This global financial crisis and its ensuing \neconomic and employment crisis has been no respecter \nof national boundaries, and no respecter of peoples. \n Australia has been no exception. The global \nfinancial crisis saw the Australian stock market fall by \n55 per cent. It wiped around A$ 150 billion from the \nretirement savings of Australian workers. And it led to \ntens of thousands of Australians losing their jobs. We \nexpect more job losses to follow. Behind each of these \nstatistics lie the faces of working Australians, who \nhave seen their savings diminished, their financial \nsecurity eroded and their job security threatened.  \n I think of places like Liverpool in Sydney, where \nthe decline in its light manufacturing base has led to an \nincrease in unemployment of 4.5 per cent over the past \nyear, and where now 19,000 local people are without \nwork; like the tourist destination of Cairns in far North \nQueensland, where unemployment has risen by 3.7 per \ncent over the past year, meaning that 13,300 people are \nnow out of work in that area; and like the south-eastern \nsuburbs of Perth, where unemployment has risen by \n3.3 per cent in the past year, leaving 12,800 people in \nthat community without a job as well.  \n In communities like those across Australia the \nglobal recession is hurting in very real ways, just as in \ncommunities like them across the world the global \nrecession is hurting in very real ways. We can never \nforget these men, these women, and their families, as \nwe seek to find a path out of this global recession.  \n While our global economic system failed \ncomprehensively to prevent the crisis, the G-20 \nGovernments have rallied to reduce the damage and \nprevent systemic collapse. Through the agency of the \nG-20, for the first time involving heads of Government \nfrom the major developed and developing economies, \nGovernments acted in concert to provide around \n$13.6 trillion-worth of support to directly stabilize the \nglobal financial system; to inject $5.5 trillion-worth of \nfiscal stimulus into the global economy; to provide \n$1.1 trillion in resources to the international financial \ninstitutions, to give markets confidence that any \nsubsequent collapses could be dealt with; to develop \nalso an integrated framework of toxic asset \nmanagement to repair the balance sheets of many \nmajor banks; and to initiate a comprehensive financial \nmarkets reform programme, through the Financial \nStability Board.  \n The IMF has assessed that these extraordinary \ninterventions succeeded in breaking the fall in what \nwas an economic crisis spiralling out of control. \n But the truth is that our global economic recovery \nis far from certain, and that many twists and turns lie \nahead. Furthermore, the institutions of global economic \ngovernance are facing new challenges. First, the \nfinancial market reform programme must be completed \nand implemented to prevent a future crisis. Secondly, \nin anticipation of global economic recovery, we must \nagree on a framework for the coordinated withdrawal \nof our emergency interventions. And, thirdly, and most \ncritically, we must articulate a new framework for \nsustainable future economic growth, a framework that \ndoes not simply return to business as usual, based on \nunsustainable financial imbalances and excessive \nconsumption, fuelled by consumer and corporate debt \nand irresponsible risk-taking in systemically significant \nfinancial institutions. \n One of the failures of the old growth model of the \nlast decade was the lack of effective global economic \ncoordination. This allowed imbalances to grow \nunchecked and financial institutions to remain \ninadequately supervised. As we move towards \n  \n \n09-52228 46 \n \nrecovery, we must build a framework to foster both \ngrowth and balance in the global economy. The IMF \nestimates that effectively implemented coordination \nbetween major economies could add significantly to \nglobal growth \u2014 an additional 10 per cent to global \noutput, or around $6 trillion over a five-year period. To \nachieve this coordination dividend the G-20 will need \nto build on the structures of cooperation that have been \nestablished during the crisis and apply them to the new \nchallenges of the global recovery.  \n In Pittsburgh we have a historic opportunity to \nagree on a framework to deliver effective coordination \nof our national economic policies. This framework \nshould have four key elements.  \n First, G-20 members should agree on a common \nobjective to achieve balanced and sustainable growth. \nSecondly, G-20 members should outline their own \nnational economic strategy and identify how it \ncontributes to our common objectives. Thirdly, the IMF \nshould analyse individual national economic plans to \ndetermine whether they are consistent and collectively \nadequate to achieve sustainable and balanced global \ngrowth. And, fourthly, this report should be submitted \nto the G-20 to form the basis of peer review, which \nwould identify specific risks and vulnerabilities for the \nfuture. This framework should be consistent with, and \nan important input to, the development of a set of \nglobal principles, such as the current proposal from \nGermany for a charter for sustainable economic \nactivity. \n The other great global challenge of our age is \nclimate change. With only 74 days remaining until \nCopenhagen, the Governments of the world are far \nfrom agreement. Enough has been said about the need \nfor action on climate change, but as of today not \nenough action has been taken. Our collective political \nwill to date has not been adequate to meet the task. For \ntoo long discussions between developed and \ndeveloping countries have degenerated into mutual \nrecrimination, with developing countries accusing \ndeveloped countries of failing to meet their obligations, \ngiven their undeniable responsibility for the bulk of \ngreenhouse gas emissions already in the atmosphere, \nand developed countries warning the major emerging \neconomies that unless they take action global warming \nwill increase to unacceptable levels, based on emerging \neconomy emissions alone.  \n The trouble is that both arguments are right. What \nis required globally is the leadership to embrace this \ntruth and respond to it accordingly, because the truth is \nthat all our Governments need to reach beyond their \nself-interests and instead fashion a grand bargain \nbetween the developed and the developing countries of \nthe world: a grand bargain on climate change which \nembraces both historical and future responsibility; a \ngrand bargain which is anchored in the science of \nclimate change and the need to keep temperature rises \nwithin 2 degrees Celsius to avoid catastrophic climate \nchange; a grand bargain embracing the three great \nchallenges of climate change which we are yet to \nresolve.  \n Those three challenges are to answer these \nquestions: what binding targets and commitments must \ndeveloped and developing countries adopt to keep \ntemperature rises within 2 degrees Celsius; what public \nand private climate change financing arrangements are \nnecessary to support the mitigation and adaptation \nmeasures we need to implement in the future; and what \ntechnology transfer do we need to undertake in \nrenewable energy, in carbon capture and storage, in \nenergy efficiency and in the avoidance of deforestation \nand forest degradation to bring about real reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions?  \n In the period ahead, the grand bargain we must \nstrike needs to resolve all three of those challenges, as \neach is inextricably dependent on the other. We must \nmake use of all available mechanisms for international \ncooperation, including the Major Economies Forum \nand the G-20, to achieve success in the negotiations. \nFor us all, this will be a test of our leadership, \nleadership which seeks to lift our collective vision \nbeyond today and instead focus on the needs of \ntomorrow.  \n But time is short. As Chair of the Pacific Islands \nForum, I know that time is already running out for the \nisland States of the Pacific. Coastal inundation is not a \nprospect; it is a reality. Fifty per cent of the population \nof those island States reside within 1.5 km of the coast. \nThe South Pacific is part of the human face of climate \nchange. And that is why Australia, nationally, \nregionally and globally, stands ready to play its part in \nacting on this great moral, environmental and \neconomic challenge of our time. \n This Organization was born in the shadow of \nnuclear weapons; that shadow remains today. One truth \n \n \n47 09-52228 \n \nremains absolutely clear: the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons can never make any country more secure. The \nnuclear test by North Korea this year was rightly \ncondemned across the international community. It \nreiterates that the only path to safety is through the \neventual elimination of nuclear weapons. Australia is \nencouraged by the commitment of the United States \nand Russia to further reduce their nuclear arsenals, but \nthe international community must also progress the \nbroader disarmament and non-proliferation agenda.  \n The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has played a \ncrucial role in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, \nbut the Treaty today is under grave challenge. We must \nwork to ensure that its global security benefits are \nreinforced by a successful Review Conference in 2010. \nTo reinvigorate global consensus and activism ahead of \nthat Conference and beyond, Australia and Japan last \nyear established the International Commission on \nNuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, which in \nthe next few months will produce its final report. Its aim \nis to chart a practical and realistic course to achieve a \nstrengthened non-proliferation disarmament regime, \nleading to the ultimate elimination of nuclear arsenals.  \n Tomorrow\u2019s Security Council summit on \nnon-proliferation and disarmament is important for us \nall. We must not miss the opportunity it offers to \nsummon the political resolve to move towards a \nnuclear-weapons-free world. \n The challenges of global governance extend \nbeyond the global financial crisis, climate change and \nthe threat of nuclear weapons. The realization of the \nMillennium Development Goals is fundamental to the \nelimination of extreme poverty. It remains an obscenity \nthat in 2009, after an age of unprecedented global \nprosperity, 1.5 billion of our fellow human beings are \nliving in extreme poverty. That is a core reason why \nthe Australian Government has committed to \nincreasing official development assistance to 0.5 per \ncent of gross national income, to help close the \ndevelopment gap which has been widening in many \nPacific island countries, while also helping, where  \n \n \npossible, to deal with poverty elsewhere in Asia, \nAfrica, Latin America and the Caribbean. \n Parallel to the Millennium Development Goals, \nthe Doha Development Round has now been going for \neight years. This is too long. The negotiating gap \nbetween us all is not wide, but the deficit in political \nwill to conclude the Round seems vast. As the world \nsearches for a new growth formula to sustain long-term \neconomic recovery, surely Doha represents one critical \nelement? Australia, as one of the lead negotiators \nwithin the Doha Round, remains ready to help bridge \nthe negotiating gap. \n Let the Assembly also not forget the continuing \ncritical work of the United Nations across the full \nspectrum of global governance \u2014 issues concerning \ninternational peacekeeping operations, humanitarian \noperations, food security, women, health, children and \nrefugees \u2014 all hallmarks of a civilized global order. \n The United Nations is not a place; it is not an \ninstitution. The United Nations is us, \u201cWe, the peoples \nof the United Nations\u201d, as the Charter begins. It is we \nwho must find solutions to the problems we face, build \nconsensus around those solutions, and implement them. \nThis Organization had its beginnings not in an act of \nwill, though will was certainly needed, but in an act of \nimagination, an idea of what the world should and \ncould be. This is the challenge of leadership: to \nimagine a future worth having and then craft that \nvision into a practical and present reality. \n That was the challenge to which our forebears \nrose in 1945. That is the challenge to which our \ngeneration must now rise for the future."

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, allow me to convey the warm greetings of the \nHead of State, Government and people of Togo on the \noccasion of the sixty-fourth session of the General \nAssembly. I also wish to add that the Minister for \nForeign Affairs of Togo, who unfortunately is absent \nfrom New York, asked me to read out the following \nstatement : \n  \u201cFrom this rostrum, where the leaders of the \nentire planet have expressed their views on the \nmajor questions of the time, I should in turn like \nto share with this Assembly the following ideas, \nprompted by the developments in our world over \nthe past 12 months.  \n  \u201cBefore performing this duty, however, I \nwish to convey to you, Sir, the warm \ncongratulations of the Government and the people \nof Togo on your well-deserved election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at this \nsession. I can assure you of my delegation\u2019s \nwillingness to work with you to carry out your \nmandate, the success of which will do honour to \nAfrica and in particular to your country, the \nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, with which Togo \nmaintains friendly relations of solidarity and \ncooperation. \n  \u201cAlso I wish to convey to your predecessor, \nFather Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, my \ncongratulations on his work and in particular for \nthe commendable initiatives he undertook \nthroughout his mandate to restore the General \nAssembly to its due place and role under the \nUnited Nations Charter. To His Excellency \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, I convey our \n \n \n35 09-53165 \n \ncongratulations for the dynamic and pragmatic \nmanner with which he has guided our \nOrganization.  \n  \u201cI hereby forcefully reaffirm Togo\u2019s full \nadherence to the ideals of peace, security and \ndevelopment that are at the centre of the priorities \nof our Organization. My country also endorses \nthe approaches adopted by our Organization in \nrecent years to further sustainable development \nby promoting peace and security and by \nmobilizing international solidarity in the \neconomic, social and cultural arenas. \n  \u201cPolitical, administrative and economic \ngovernance remains essential to the consolidation \nof peace and security in our countries and \nundoubtedly helps to speed up achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. However, no \nharmonious and lasting development is possible \nwithout a climate of peace and national concord. \nThat is why the Government of Togo spares no \neffort to create conditions conducive to bold \nreforms and to lay the foundations for a new \nrepublican pact and national reconciliation. \nIndeed, since 2005, the Government, under the \nguidance of the Head of State, has worked \ntirelessly for a policy of openness, the promotion \nof democracy, the strengthening of the rule of law \nand the reduction of poverty. A number of \nreforms have been undertaken in this regard, \nespecially in the political, constitutional, \ninstitutional and socio-economic areas. \n  \u201cPolitically, the Head of State has engaged \nin dialogue as an instrument of political \nconsensus. This approach, based on a politics of \ncomplete openness, culminated in the signing in \nAugust 2006 of the Global Political Accord, \nwhich in turn led to the formation of a \nGovernment of national unity, facilitated by His \nExcellency Blaise Compaor\u00e9, President of \nBurkina Faso. I recall that the implementation of \nthe Global Political Accord and the 22 \ncommitments undertaken with the European \nUnion led to the holding of free and democratic \nlegislative elections in October 2007, which were \nwelcomed unanimously by the international \ncommunity. In the same spirit, a Truth, Justice \nand Reconciliation Commission has been set up, \nthe members of which were appointed on 29 May \n2009. Its purpose is to shed light on the political \nacts of violence that occurred in Togo between \n1958 and 2005 in order once and for all to banish \nimpunity from our country and to reconcile the \npeople of Togo with their history. \n  \u201cWith regard to constitutional reform, \nsignificant progress has been made. In August, \nthe National Assembly adopted a law modifying \nthe electoral code, relaxing the eligibility \nconditions for presidential elections, and allowing \nfor the establishment of a national independent \nelectoral commission and its reconfiguration in \norder to adapt it to current political realities. At \nthe same time, discussions of certain questions \ncontinue with the firm resolve of the Government \nto carry out the rest of the reforms on the basis of \nconsensus, since we have made concerted action \nand dialogue the foundation of our political \naction in Togo. \n  \u201cIn the institutional area, we have striven to \nreconstitute the Constitutional Court, the National \nHuman Rights Commission and the High \nAuthority for Audiovisual and Communication. \nSimilarly, the Government of Togo has \nestablished a court of audits and adopted statutes \nfor the army, the security forces and the \nopposition. It has also made arrangements for the \npublic financing of political parties and the \norgans of the private press. \n  \u201cAs concerns the judiciary, our vast \nmodernization programme of the judicial system \ncontinues in a satisfactory manner, with a view to \ninvolving the people more closely in the \nadministration of justice. In this regard, the \nGovernment has taken measures to guarantee \ncitizens freedom of expression, for example, by \ndecriminalizing press offences. Furthermore, to \ndemonstrate its desire to respect human dignity \nand defend human rights, our Government \nsubmitted to the National Assembly a bill \nabolishing the death penalty. This law, adopted \nunanimously on 24 June, is the outcome of a \nconstitutional provision that requires the State to \nguarantee the physical and mental integrity, life \nand security of all persons living on our national \nterritory. \n  \u201cThe efforts undertaken by the Government \nin the areas of health, education and employment, \nparticularly for young people, have also seen \n \n \n09-53165 36 \n \nconsiderable progress. In the field of health, we \nhave established a national health development \nplan for the years 2009 to 2013, at a cost of \n317 billion CFA francs, reflecting the will of the \nTogolese Government to respond effectively to \nour people\u2019s health needs. With regard to \neducation, Togo\u2019s educational system has suffered \nfrom the financial constraints afflicting the \ncountry for the past 15 years due to the \nsuspension of cooperation. This situation, \ncompounded by a high demand for education, has \nresulted in a decline in teaching conditions and \nserious structural problems. In the face of these \nconstraints, the Government has committed to \nestablish a sectoral education plan that will allow \nthe country to launch a fast-track initiative in \n2010 to ensure education for all. \n  \u201cTo put a new face on public administration \nand make it a genuine instrument for the \nreconstruction and modernization of our country, \nwe have undertaken broad reforms that require, \ninter alia, the recruitment of new officials. Thus, \nthousands of young people have found work in \nthe public and private sectors thanks to the \ncreation of better production conditions for the \neconomic and social development of the country.  \n  \u201cWith regard to the economic sector, \nappropriate measures have been taken to put \npublic finances on a sound footing, create a \nfavourable framework for business and attract \ninvestment, particularly from abroad. In this \ncontext, I take this opportunity to once again \nmake an urgent appeal to all our bilateral and \nmultilateral partners, particularly the European \nUnion and the Bretton Woods institutions, to help \nTogo in its efforts towards socio-economic \nrecovery. \n  \u201cIn the opinion of my delegation, the \ndevelopment and proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction represent a growing threat to \ninternational peace and security, and thus a reason \nfor us to give these questions the highest priority. \nIn this regard, my country welcomed the Security \nCouncil summit held on 24 September, under the \npresidency of the United States, on nuclear \nnon-proliferation and disarmament. While we \nreaffirm that multilateralism is the fundamental \nprinciple governing our consideration of \ndisarmament and non-proliferation, Togo hopes \nthat the Security Council summit will lead to a \nnew approach to this crucial question. With regard \nto light arms, Togo reiterates its desire to see the \ncurrent session of the Assembly commit to \nstrengthening the implementation of the project \naimed at negotiating a treaty on the traffic in light \narms, as has been done by the Economic \nCommunity of West African States in this area. \n  \u201cConcerning terrorism, an obstacle to peace \nand lasting development, my country feels that it \nhas become imperative to improve and globalize \nthe international legal framework in order to \ncombat this scourge, which has assumed a new \nform in modern times. In this regard, the \ncompletion within a reasonable time frame of \nnegotiations on a draft comprehensive convention \nagainst international terrorism would be salutary \nand in the interests of all.  \n  \u201cSimilarly, the phenomenon of drugs, and in \nparticular the illicit traffic in drugs along the west \ncoast of Africa, has become a true danger and a \ndestabilizing factor for the region. In light of the \nscale of this scourge, it is beyond a shadow of a \ndoubt that no country can combat or hope to put \nan end to it alone. Togo therefore appeals for \ninternational cooperation, and in particular for \nassistance from the wealthy countries and \ncompetent organizations, in eradicating this \nphenomenon and thereby restoring the climate of \nsecurity so essential to development. For its part, \nin spite of its scarce resources, Togo has \nundertaken a relentless struggle against drug \ntraffickers and is cooperating with its neighbours \nin order to contain the scourge. \n  \u201cAs we all know, international peace and \nsecurity continue to be threatened and the \nstability of certain countries disturbed by \nconflicts, terrorism and underdevelopment, all of \nwhich are largely man-made. Indeed, in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Chad, the \nCentral African Republic and Darfur, where \ncrises continue, our Organization should continue \nto engage in a search for solutions that will allow \nthose countries to recover the peace and security \nnecessary to their development.  \n  \u201cIn Somalia, despite the initiatives \nundertaken in April 2009 by the international \ncommunity and by the African Union in July \n \n \n37 09-53165 \n \n2009 in support of security institutions and the \nAfrican Union Mission in Somalia, the situation \nremains precarious and disturbing. That is why \nmy country urgently appeals for other urgent \nmeasures to be taken to prevent that country from \nsuccumbing to chaos for good. \n  \u201cRegarding C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, we note with \nsatisfaction the positive evolution of the political \nsituation in that country since the Ouagadougou \nPolitical Agreement. Consequently, we call on the \nstakeholders to display the political will to \norganize the presidential election. \n  \u201cWith regard to Guinea, it would seem \nappropriate and timely to encourage the political \nclass to find, through dialogue and consultation, \nways and means of ensuring a rapid return to \nconstitutional order. \n  \u201cAs to the situation in the Niger, where the \nrevision of the Constitution has provoked a crisis, \nmy country hopes that the parties concerned in \nthe Niger will strive to restore dialogue and \nconsensus in order to maintain a climate of peace \nand harmony in that sister country. \n  \u201cOutside the African continent, in the \nMiddle East, a theatre of violence and desolation, \nan equitable and final settlement of the conflicts \nbetween the countries of this region should be \nfound as soon as possible. To that end, the \ninternational community should encourage the \nvarious actors to find a peaceful solution to their \nconflicts. In this regard, my delegation reaffirms \nthat the solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \nrequires the creation of a Palestinian State living \nside by side with the State of Israel within secure \nand internationally recognized borders.  \n  \u201cFurthermore, my country deplores the \ncontinuing acts of terrorism that have afflicted \nthe peoples of Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan and \nundermined the efforts of these countries to \npromote development. That is why we urge the \ninternational community to increase its assistance \nto the Governments of those countries in their \nfight against terrorism in order to promote peace \nand reconstruction.  \n  \u201cAfter two decades of economic stagnation \nresulting from policies of budgetary austerity \nimposed on developing countries, the latter are \nnow facing new challenges from the food, \nfinancial, energy and environmental crises. In the \nlight of this situation, it is imperative to work to \nmitigate the financial shock and to pursue bold \npolicies to increase the agricultural and energy \nproduction capacities of the developing countries. \nAt the same time, we need to consider overall \nstructural reform of the world economic and \nfinancial system in order to prevent a resurgence \nof such crises.  \n  \u201cMy country therefore welcomed the high-\nlevel Conference on the World Financial and \nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, \nheld from 24 to 26 June, which illustrated the \nneed for international solidarity in the face of the \ncrisis in order to ease the suffering of the peoples \nof developing countries. \n  \u201cIn that context, Togo welcomes the early \nimplementation, in April 2009, of one of the \npledges made at the G-20 meeting in London, \nconcerning the establishment of the Global Trade \nLiquidity Programme amounting to $50 billion \nfrom 2009 to 2011, $15 billion of which are \nallocated to the African continent. Similarly, my \ncountry welcomes the initiative taken in March \n2009 by the African Development Bank to create \na special $500 million funding mechanism for \nAfrican trade. \n  \u201cFurthermore, my delegation is pleased that \nthe United Nations, at the initiative of the \nSecretary-General, has taken the measure of the \ndanger posed to humanity by the problem of \nclimate change and the degradation of the \nenvironment. In this regard, the high-level \nmeeting that took place a few days ago in this \nvery body was an opportunity to analyse the \nsituation and to clear the way for the Climate \nChange Conference in Copenhagen in December. \nTo paraphrase a great man, we have inherited the \nEarth and we should not destroy it. Living \ncreatures come and go, but the Earth remains.  \n  \u201cIn the face of the questions that my \ndelegation has just raised, it is imperative to \nintensify partnerships of all kinds if we wish to \nprevent a situation in which, 64 years after its \ncreation, our shared Organization should find \nitself still facing the same challenges. It is to be \nhoped, therefore, that Member States, in whose \n \n \n09-53165 38 \n \ninterest it is that the United Nations should be \nmore democratic, strong and effective, should \ndetermine to give it the resources necessary to \npermit it to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals and thereby to meet the challenges that our \nworld faces today.\u201d "

        "file_text": "I \nwould like to extend our warm congratulations to \nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his well-deserved election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. I would also like to pay a special tribute to \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann for his able leadership \nof the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. \n The global financial and economic crisis that \nbegan last year is showing tentative signs of abating. \nHowever, many countries large and small still face \ndaunting challenges. The crisis originated in the \ndeveloped countries, but the developing countries have \nbeen the hardest hit. The nascent economic recovery \nhas yet to begin to lift the low-income countries from \nthe trough. \n It is commendable that the developed countries \nhave played a leading role in addressing the crisis. The \nviews of the developing countries should also be taken \ninto consideration, together with those of the members \nof the Group of Eight and the Group of Twenty. \nMeasures that could have adverse effects on the \neconomic growth of developing countries must be \navoided. The developing countries have worked long \nand hard to combat poverty and achieve favourable \nconditions for economic growth. Low-income countries \nrequire development aid beyond existing pledges of \nofficial development assistance (ODA) if they are to \nmeet the challenges posed by the global economic \ndownturn. The developed countries should increase \ntheir ODA to the developing countries. We welcome \nthe reaffirmation by President Hu Jintao of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China in his statement to this \nAssembly that his country will increase support for \nother developing countries hard hit by the economic \nand financial crisis. \n Climate change is the most pressing major threat \nfacing our planet. It is a global challenge that requires \na global response. No country can be insulated from \nthe consequences of climate change. The rapid pace \nand scale of climate change requires the global \ncommunity to respond immediately and effectively. \nThe United Nations Summit on Climate Change \nconvened by the Secretary-General last week \n \n \n9 09-52598 \n \nunderlined the magnitude of the problem and the need \nto redouble our efforts in addressing climate change. \n We look forward to the Climate Change \nConference in Copenhagen in December. We hope that \nthe negotiations will be fruitful and result in a new \nagreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, to go into \neffect in 2012 when the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s first \ncommitment period expires. To be effective, any deal \nmust be comprehensive and consistent with the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities. \n The global financial and economic crisis and the \nclimate change crisis have compounded the problems \nwe have faced in recent years. These include rising \nfood prices, high energy prices and the spread of \npandemic diseases. No single country can effectively \novercome these problems alone. The global community \nmust work together to meet its common challenges. In \nthese trying times for our planet, multilateralism is \nmore important than ever. Dialogue among nations of \ndifferent religious and cultural backgrounds can \ncontribute to international peace, security and \ndevelopment. \n The United Nations is the single world \nOrganization dedicated to peace and development that \nenjoys almost universal participation. In recent years, \nsteps have been initiated to reform the Organization in \norder to make it more democratic, effective and \naccountable and enable it to meet the challenges of the \ntwenty-first century. Regrettably, progress has been \npainfully slow. \n If the United Nations is to make decisions in a \nmore democratic manner, it is essential that the role of \nthe General Assembly \u2014 in which all Member States \nare represented \u2014 be enhanced. Security Council \nreform is also important. For many years, the General \nAssembly has debated the matter but made little \nheadway. In addition to the focus on the vexed issue of \nenlarging the Council, we would like to see \nconstructive changes in its procedures and working \nmethods, particularly those that would make it more \ntransparent and accountable. \n The continued existence of weapons of mass \ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons, poses the \ngreatest threat to mankind. Myanmar believes that the \ntotal elimination of nuclear weapons is the sole \nabsolute guarantee against the threat or use of those \nweapons. Accordingly, we have called on nuclear-\nweapon States to undertake a step-by-step attenuation \nof the nuclear threat with a view to achieving the total \nelimination of those weapons. \n We believe that, pending the total elimination of \nnuclear weapons, we should pursue efforts towards the \nconclusion of a universal, unconditional and legally \nbinding instrument on security assurances to \nnon-nuclear-weapon States. We support the \nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the \nbasis of arrangements freely arrived at among States of \nthe regions concerned. Nuclear-weapon-free zones \nenhance global and regional security and contribute to \nreaching the objectives of nuclear disarmament. \n It is our hope that all nations of the world will \ncontinue to work together to eliminate nuclear weapons \nso that the power of the atom can be harnessed \nexclusively as a tool for the benefit of mankind and not \nas an instrument of self-destruction. At the same time, \nevery nation has the right to the peaceful use of nuclear \nenergy. Nuclear technologies have widespread \napplications in such areas as food, agriculture, health \ncare, industry and science. We welcome last week\u2019s \nsummit meeting of the Security Council on nuclear \nnon-proliferation and disarmament and its reaffirmation \nthat the international nuclear non-proliferation regime \nshould be maintained and strengthened to ensure the \neffective implementation of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \n Some powerful nations have resorted to economic \nsanctions to pressure developing countries. Their aim \nis to influence the political and economic systems of \nthose countries without taking into account those \ncountries\u2019 historical and cultural backgrounds. \nSanctions have no moral basis, as they not only hinder \nthe economic and social development of peoples, but \nalso interfere in matters that are essentially within the \ndomestic jurisdiction of the country concerned. As \nsanctions are indiscriminate and a form of violence \nper se, they cannot legitimately be regarded as a tool to \npromote human rights and democracy.  \n Sanctions are being employed as a political tool \nagainst Myanmar and we consider them unjust. I would \nlike to state that such acts must cease. Myanmar \npractises a market economy based on agriculture. We \nare self-sufficient in terms of food and able to \ncontribute to food security in the region. We have made \nconsiderable progress in improving socio-economic \nconditions thanks to the combined efforts of the \nGovernment and the people. Without the economic \n  \n \n09-52598 10 \n \nsanctions imposed on us, progress would be even \ngreater. \n Following Cyclone Nargis, which hit Myanmar in \nMay 2008, the Myanmar Government, the United \nNations and the Association of Southeast Nations \nestablished the Tripartite Core Group (TCG) to \nundertake relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction in \nthe affected areas. The success of the TCG has been \nduly recognized by the international community and \nacknowledged as an exemplary mechanism for future \ndisaster relief and rehabilitation.  \n The Post-Nargis Recovery and Preparedness Plan \n(PONREPP) has been established for the period 2009 \nto 2011. Further plans have also been adopted to \neffectively respond to similar natural disasters in the \nfuture. We will implement the projects diligently. \nPONREPP will require $691 million over a period of \nthree years. To date, only half of that amount has been \npledged by the international community. We have \ncarried out many rehabilitation activities relying on our \nown funds and resources. If more funds were \nforthcoming and donors fulfilled their pledges, the \nrehabilitation process would be speedier and more \neffective. \n The Myanmar Government and the people of the \naffected areas will always be grateful to the \nindividuals, organizations and the international \ncommunity at large that came to our assistance in our \nhour of need. \n Domestic peace and stability and the successful \nholding of democratic elections are essential to the \ndemocratization process in Myanmar. A new State \nConstitution was approved by 92.48 per cent of eligible \nvoters in a nationwide referendum held in May 2008. \nMultiparty general elections will be held in the coming \nyear. Subsequently, Parliament will be convened and a \nGovernment formed in accordance with the new \nConstitution. \n The country will have a bicameral legislature. \nThe Constitution provides for a presidential system of \ngovernance. It is envisaged that the President will be \nelected by a presidential electoral college. The State \nwill be composed of seven states, seven regions, five \nself-administered zones, and one self-administered \ndivision. The capital, Nay Pyi Taw, will be designated \nunion territory. In keeping with the State structure, the \nConstitution also establishes 14 State and regional \nlegislative bodies. \n The transition to democracy is proceeding. Our \nfocus is not on the narrow interests of individuals, \norganizations or parties, but on the larger interests of \nthe entire nation. We have urged all citizens, whether \nthey agree with us or not, to participate actively in the \nprocess without losing sight of the democratic goal. In \nthis way, the aspirations of the people will be fulfilled. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n The Government is taking systematic steps to \nhold free and fair elections. Electoral laws will be \npromulgated and an election commission created so \nthat political parties can be formed and contest the \nelections. On 17 September 2009, 7,114 prisoners were \nreleased for good conduct. They, too, will be able to \nparticipate in the general elections next year in \naccordance with the law. \n The holding of a multiparty general election is a \nsignificant step in our transition to a peaceful, modern \nand developed democratic State. Democracy cannot be \nimposed from the outside, and a system suitable for \nMyanmar can be born only out of Myanmar society. It \nis the citizens of Myanmar who can best determine \ntheir own future. They can judge the merits of \ndemocracy and make adjustments as they see fit. The \ninternational community can best assist Myanmar\u2019s \nemergence as a new nation, based on the principles of \njustice, freedom and equality enshrined in the new \nState Constitution, by demonstrating understanding. \n Global issues that require the attention of all \ncountries will increasingly come to the fore in the \nyears to come. Firm political will and commitment of \nall countries will be needed to overcome the \nchallenges. Previous speakers have emphasized the \nneed for collective efforts to find solutions to those \nproblems and challenges. I fully share their views and \naffirm that Myanmar will do its part."

        "file_text": "Please permit me to \ncongratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, on behalf of \nthe Prime Minister, Government and people of Belize, \non having assumed the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session and to wish him \nevery success in his stewardship. Permit me also to \nextend my Government\u2019s thanks to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann for his excellent stewardship of the work \nof the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. \n Belize is pleased to discharge its obligation by \nparticipating in the general debate of the sixty-fourth \nregular session of the General Assembly on the theme \n\u201cEffective responses to global crises: strengthening \nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for \ninternational peace, security and development\u201d. \n Just over one week ago, we celebrated the \ntwenty-eighth anniversary of our independence. \nJoining us in the celebrations were members of the \ndiplomatic core drawn from the four corners of the \nglobe. And even as we made merry, our collective \nminds were silently cogitating upon the crises that are \nthreatening to destroy our collective way of life and, \nindeed, the very planet which sustains us. \n All indications are that the aftershocks of the \nglobal economic crisis have now begun to affect \nBelize\u2019s real economy. We are experiencing declining \nlevels of revenue, a worrying reduction in productivity, \ndiminishing remittances, crushing debt-servicing \nobligations, unrelenting budgetary pressures and a \ndrying up of resources on which to draw.  \n These challenges are aggravated by other ills that \nplague our day-to-day existence. Annually, we are \nthreatened by hurricanes and floods of ever greater \nintensity, which reduce the yields of our farmers, erode \nour beaches and wash away vital infrastructure. \nWarmer seas damage our great barrier reef and impair \nits capacity to incubate and nurture the fish and other \nmarine organisms that depend upon a healthy reef \nsystem for their survival. Illicit traffickers in drugs and \narms penetrate our borders at will, leaving drug \naddicts, broken families, violence, death and \ndestruction in their wake. Our population is also being \nravaged by HIV/AIDS. Other non-communicable \nchronic diseases are approaching pandemic \nproportions. All these crises have placed the attainment \nof the Millennium Development Goals in Belize in real \njeopardy. \n The globalization that was the tide to lift all boats \nhas not been so even. Its networks of interdependence \nhave compounded how we as national Governments \ncan secure the basic needs of our people. Its evolving \nsystem of global governance is unresponsive to the \ncares and concerns of middle-income countries like \nours, for despite the devastating impact it is having \nupon our economies, we are yet to be invited to the \ntable to participate in the discussion on the global \neconomic crisis. Our pleas for an ambitious climate \nagreement are yet to be honoured with serious \ncontemplation in the current negotiations, although the \n  \n \n09-52598 38 \n \nviability of our countries hangs in the balance, and the \nglobal commitment of a development-oriented trade \nround seems to have been perfunctorily relegated to the \nannals of trade-negotiating history. Our demands, \nalthough ceremoniously acknowledged in countless \nresolutions and declarations, remain unceremoniously \nunmet. \n If we are to define an effective global response to \nthe converging global challenges that confront us, we \nmust first examine how we are governed. While we, as \nMember States of the United Nations, have endorsed \nthe principle of sovereign equality, it is apparent from \nthe structural relationships engendered in our \ninstitutions that the principle is honoured more in the \nbreach than in the observance. The United Nations has \nits Security Council and the Permanent Five; the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank have \ntheir weighted voting and the World Trade \nOrganization has its green room. In the larger global \narena, we have a proliferation of convenient \ngroupings \u2014 the Group of Six, the Group of Seven, the \nGroup of Eight, the Group of Twenty and the Major \nEconomies Forum, to name but a few. The club model \nof cooperation is deeply entrenched in our multilateral \nsystem. \n While we cannot deny that this model has \nfacilitated some decisions and agreements, we also \ncannot ignore the costs associated with that facilitation. \nThis model of global governance has progressively \naccumulated a debt of trust and confidence among the \nwider international community not only as a result of \nits manner of exclusive decision-making, but also \nbecause of the lack of implementation of global \ndecisions and agreements. The club model of \nmultilateral cooperation suffers from a crisis of \nlegitimacy. \n If we accept that we operate as sovereign equals, \nwe cannot continue to acquiesce to governance by a \nfew. We must accept nothing less than equal \nrepresentation. In that regard, we recognize and \napplaud our brothers from the South who have, through \ntheir economic prowess and political deftness, taken \nthe mantle of leadership in some international issues. \nWe are all entitled to be heard and, what is more, we \nare all entitled to have the decisions that are made \nreflect our concerns if not our demands. \n We need a new model for multilateral cooperation \nframework in which all nations have meaningful input \ninto the decision-making process on issues that have a \ndirect impact on their interests. This requires \nfundamental structural reform and not mere cursory \nefforts for technocratic coherence. Given the far-\nreaching geopolitical consequences that the global \neconomic crisis has touched off, we now have the \nperfect opportunity to redress the shortcomings of the \nexclusive club model, thereby restoring trust and \nconfidence in our multilateral institutions. The time for \ninclusive multilateralism is now upon us. \n Allow me to now address some of the issues that \nbear upon the immediate interests of my people and my \ncountry, Belize. Belize falls within the World Bank \ncategory of middle-income countries. Middle-income \ncountries play a pivotal role in the global economy and \nin global politics. We account for some two thirds of \nthe world\u2019s population. Our economies provide \nimportant and growing sources of export demand and \ninvestment opportunities. Some economies of middle-\nincome countries are now even big enough to create \nsystemic risks in global financial markets. On strategic \nissues, middle-income countries have not infrequently \nemerged as key players, and one half of the world\u2019s \nprotected areas are to be found in our countries.  \n Still, poverty remains prevalent in our countries. \nSome three quarters of the world\u2019s poor live in middle-\nincome countries. We also account for an estimated \n47 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions.  \n Given the aforementioned, it is evident that \nwhatever happens in middle-income countries affects \nthe entire world for better or for worse. For this reason, \nif for no other, it is in the interest of the world \ncommunity that middle-income countries remain \nviable, vibrant and dynamic. \n In order for that to happen, however, bilateral and \nmultilateral institutions must redefine the terms of \nengagement with our countries. Rather than focusing \non per capita income, a needs-based analysis is \nnecessary. Financing arrangements that tend towards \nthe short and medium term must also be revisited. In \norder to build capacity, improve our institutions and \nspur economic growth, we need direct fiscal and \nbudgetary support. Moreover, in view of the high ratio \nof debt-to-gross-domestic-product (GDP) in many of \nour countries, which has been further exacerbated by \nthe recent global economic crisis, the need for \nconcessionary financing and debt relief is ever more \ncritical. \n \n \n39 09-52598 \n \n During the 1980s and 1990s, the integration of \nmarkets spurred significant growth in high-income \nnations, while low-income nations exploited their \ncomparative advantage in cheap labour. However, \nmiddle-income countries had neither advantage in \nknowledge nor low-wage products and consequently, in \nreal terms, experienced economic stagnation. Many of \nus were forced to embark upon a process of \ndiversification to ensure our continued growth and \ndevelopment. \n Therefore, in the early 1990s, Belize made rapid \nstrides in building up its international financial services \nindustry. We did so in accordance with the best \npractices of the industry internationally, and we were \nguided every step of the way by the recommendations \nof the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD). As a country whose GDP is just \nover $1 billion, the contribution of this industry to our \neconomy is significant. A large percentage of the \ndeposits from the international banking sector has been \nused to finance development projects, support our \ncitrus industry and commercial free zone and export \nprocessing zone businesses, which account for some \n$1 billion worth of investments in our country.  \n Furthermore, since this sector finances only \nforeign exchange earning businesses, it enables the \ngeneration of millions of dollars in foreign exchange \nthat directly supports our fixed exchange rate system. \nIt is also a source for the creation of relatively high-\nquality jobs for many Belizeans. On the whole, in 2008 \nthe international financial services industry accounted \nfor some 9 per cent of Belize\u2019s GDP and 10 per cent of \nits gross imports. \n Considering the vital role that this industry plays \nin the Belizean economy, ensuring its integrity is in our \nbest interests. We have developed a regulatory \nframework and enacted legislation for its \nreinforcement. We have also made commitments to the \nOECD to improve transparency and establish an \neffective exchange of information. But now, in the \nmidst of an economic crisis that had its origin in the \nfinancial markets of the developed world, the Group  \nof 20 (G-20) finds it convenient to reactivate its \nharmful tax initiative at the expense \u2014 and to the \ndisadvantage \u2014 of an industry we have so \npainstakingly and carefully groomed into a productive \nsector of our economy. \n Beyond the calls for reform, we have heard some \nG-20 members call for a complete annihilation of the \nindustry. If that were to occur, I shudder to think of the \nsuffering and hardship it would occasion for our \ncountry and people. We are convinced that a more \nequitable and effective way to address the issue of \noffshore financial services is through a mechanism for \nmultilateral cooperation in which all States participate \non an equal footing. \n Climate change poses perhaps the most serious \nthreat to our sustainable development and viability. I \nneed not remind the Assembly of the emerging \nscientific evidence, which prognosticates more rapid \nclimate change and sea-level rise. Let me take this \nopportunity to applaud the Secretary-General for \nmaking climate change a priority and for convening \nlast week\u2019s Summit. The urgency of a global response \nto this issue is inescapable. We welcome the various \nnational and regional efforts to construct mechanisms \nto address climate change and its impact. In our region, \nBelize hosts the Caribbean Community Climate \nChange Centre, which has benefited from the support \nof the international community and has been \nrecognized as a centre of excellence.  \n However, we know all too well from the impacts \nwe are observing today that piecemeal action is not \nsufficient. In fact, notwithstanding national and \nregional action, global greenhouse gas emissions \ncontinue to increase. We can only begin to respond \neffectively to this problem by agreeing to implement \nambitious mitigation targets and increasing our support \nfor adaptation. Considering that small island \ndeveloping States and other particularly vulnerable \ncoastal countries are already experiencing dangerous \nclimate change, avoiding adverse effects on these \nespecially vulnerable countries should be the \nbenchmark for determining our targets and our levels \nof support. In that regard, the prophetic words of the \nPresident of the Maldives resonate with good reason: \n\u201cIf you can\u2019t save the Maldives today you can\u2019t save \nyourself tomorrow.\u201d \n Building upon the momentum of the much-\nproclaimed new era of engagement, we are hopeful that \nlongstanding issues on the international peace and \nsecurity agenda may achieve progress. In some cases, \nchange is already afoot. Cross-Strait relations between \nTaiwan and China have improved and, for the first \ntime, Taiwan has participated as an observer at the \nWorld Health Assembly. Haiti held elections earlier \n  \n \n09-52598 40 \n \nthis year, in a relatively peaceful and orderly fashion. \nAfter 47 years, the Organization of American States \nhas now lifted Cuba\u2019s suspension from that body. \n We welcome these developments and expect that \nthey signal a change in approach that will allow for the \nfull integration of our sisterly nations of Taiwan, Haiti \nand Cuba into their rightful place in the international \ncommunity. However, for that integration to occur, we \nmust find an appropriate way for Taiwan to participate \nin the activities of the specialized agencies of the \nUnited Nations, we must sustain our support for Haiti \nand we must urge that efforts be made to end the \nanachronistic embargo against Cuba. \n In cases where processes have stalled, let us \nrenew our engagement. We cannot fail in realizing the \nvision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by \nside within secure and recognized borders. We also \ncannot fail in resolving the political stalemate in our \nneighbour country of Honduras. Peace and security are \nnot options, they are imperatives. \n My Government is committed to securing just \nand lasting peace for our people. Last year, we happily \nconcluded a special agreement with Guatemala that \nwill pave the way for the referral of the Guatemalan \nterritorial claim to our country to the International \nCourt of Justice. A preliminary and critical phase is \nupon us, in which we must prepare our people to \ndetermine by referendum whether the case shall be \nreferred. My Government is beginning a \ncomprehensive public education campaign to raise \nawareness and ensure that, when our people decide, \nthey will do so having been fully informed of the \nissues. We are approaching what could be a definitive \nmoment in our history. \n I began my statement by addressing the \ngovernance dilemma \u2014 to govern and to be governed. \nWhat is consistent in the demands that we  \nas developing countries \u2014 and small States in \nparticular \u2014 have made is that we want to have a \nmeaningful role in the governance of our affairs at the \ninternational level. We want to have meaningful input \ninto the solutions that are being crafted for the \nproblems that we face and of which, in some cases, we \nbear the disproportionate burden.  \n For us, the model of multilateral cooperation \nmust be imbued with legitimacy. For that to happen, \nwe must work for a more inclusive process. Twenty-\nfirst century challenges require a new dynamic for \ninternational relations, one that must be inclusive and, \ndare I say, democratic. The United Nations Charter is \nfounded upon the premise of democracy. \u201cWe the \npeoples of the United Nations\u201d assert our \ndetermination not only to be governed by the principles \nset out in the Charter but also to govern by these \nprinciples. \n As such, the Charter itself vests in us a role in our \nown governance. We in Belize accept that role, and we \nare thus empowered, notwithstanding the pressing \nchallenges in satisfying the basic needs of our people, \nto return our country to a path of sustainable \ndevelopment. No effort will be spared to draw upon \nour limited resources as well as other available \nresources to invest in our human resources, to improve \nour political and legal institutions, to support \ntraditional and niche industries, to practise fiscal \nresponsibility and to protect and preserve our \nenvironment for present and future generations. \n We solemnly agree that our development is our \nown responsibility. We welcome the support of the \ninternational community in the spirit of multilateral \ncooperation as we take action to achieve our high \naspirations."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the theme \nthat you have chosen for this session of the General \nAssembly \u2014 \u201cEffective responses to global crises: \nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \ncivilizations for international peace, security and \ndevelopment\u201d \u2014 is both timely and relevant.  \n We meet against the backdrop of some of the \nmost serious challenges mankind has confronted in a \nlong time. The financial and economic crisis, climate \nchange and issues of international peace and security \nare but some of these challenges. No other organization \nis better placed than the United Nations to find \nsolutions to them. \n In June, your predecessor, Mr. President, \nconvened a high-level Conference on the World \nFinancial and Economic Crisis. We all had the \nopportunity then to identify and agree on the causes \nand effects of and solutions to this crisis. I shall not \nrevisit the deliberations of that Conference. Suffice it \nto say that it seems obvious that Governments can no \nlonger abdicate their responsibility of oversight and \nregulation of the global financial systems to financial \ninstitutions. \n The least developed and developing countries \nhave been the hardest hit by the financial crisis. Their \nexports have been severely reduced and their capital \nflows choked. The impact of the crisis is felt in all \naspects of life, be it in the increase in unemployment, \nilliteracy or the incidence of HIV- and AIDS-related \ndeaths due to the unavailability or unaffordability of \ndrugs. \n Lesotho, as a small economy, is highly vulnerable \nto external shocks and is therefore one of those \nadversely affected by the financial crisis. Demand for \ntextile exports has dropped dramatically, resulting in \nunprecedented loss of livelihoods and erosion of the \ngains we had made in eradicating poverty. \n However, all is not lost. I note in this regard the \nefforts of the Group of Eight, which has pledged a \nstimulus package of $1.1 trillion, the major part of \nwhich will be made available to developing countries. \nMy concern is that this initiative seems to have stalled \nand it is unclear how the funds will be distributed. It \nwill be fair only if the disbursement is informed by the \nneeds of individual countries, and I hasten to add that \nthe disbursement should be free of quotas and \nconditions. While I remain optimistic that the pledge \nwill see the light of day, I appeal for the fulfilment of \ncommitments that have been made regarding overseas \ndevelopment aid. I further appeal for the requisite \npolitical will to complete the Doha Round of \nnegotiations as a matter of urgency. These negotiations \nare the anchor of our hope for the dawn of a fair and \nequitable international trade regime. \n I congratulate the Secretary-General on \nconvening the just-ended Summit on Climate Change, \nat which we were unanimous in our belief that the \nchallenges posed by climate change are beyond the \ncapacity of any individual country to deal with alone. \nResponse to the impact of climate change must be a top \npriority for the whole of mankind, for at stake here is \nthe preservation of the very elements responsible for \nthe sustenance of human life on our planet. \n Lesotho is hopeful that the Copenhagen \nConference will usher in a new global agreement that \nwill result in the reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions. We must never forget that at the forefront of \nthose most affected by the impact of climate change \nare the poor and the innocent. Our call for the \nindustrialized nations to help improve developing \ncountries\u2019 capacity for mitigation and adaptation is \ntherefore not misplaced. Those who are responsible for \ncausing pollution of the environment have the \nresponsibility to make cuts in harmful emissions and to \nhelp those adversely affected. We acknowledge that \nclimate change may not be our collective fault, but it is \nsurely our collective responsibility. \n  \n \n09-52586 30 \n \n Another challenge confronting us is that of \ninternational peace and security. This challenge is a \nmatter of utmost interest to my delegation, for it \nreminds Governments of their obligation to protect \ntheir peoples from mass atrocities, including genocide, \nethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity. I am referring here to the principle of the \nresponsibility to protect. \n The Rwanda genocide is still fresh in our minds. \nThough the wounds may have healed, the scars remain \npronounced and serve as a painful reminder of man\u2019s \ninhumanity to man. They also serve as a sad reminder \nof how the international community can fail a people. \nBeyond Rwanda, and I dare say even post-Rwanda, we \nhave witnessed mass atrocities committed with \nimpunity against the most innocent and vulnerable \npopulations. And sadly, the Security Council, in whose \npurview the power to act is centralized, has failed to \nact, thereby incapacitating the international \ncommunity\u2019s ability to act also. \n In our resolve never to fail any population again, \nwe adopted the principle of the responsibility to protect \nat our 2005 World Summit. This principle seeks to \nrestore the confidence of populations in the United \nNations system. In July, the General Assembly held a \ndebate on the Secretary-General\u2019s report on \nimplementing the responsibility to protect (A/63/677). \nLesotho welcomes that balanced report, especially the \nproposed practical measures for its implementation. We \nview the report as a good basis for negotiations in the \nGeneral Assembly on how to implement the principle. \nIt is true that the scope of the principle is narrow and \nlimited to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \ncrimes against humanity. I would nonetheless \ndiscourage any reopening of the debates on paragraphs \n138 and 139 of the World Summit Outcome Document \n(resolution 60/1). \n I find a linkage between this principle and other \ncritical issues that continue to feature on our \ninternational agenda. Among these are reform of the \nUnited Nations, especially the Security Council, \ndisarmament and the International Criminal Court. \nNeedless to say, the principle of the responsibility to \nprotect is meaningful only if it is grounded in \nmultilateralism and collective action by the \ninternational community. The forums through which \nthe responsibility to protect may be achievable is the \nSecurity Council and, beyond that, the General \nAssembly. Unfortunately, the Council, as presently \ncomposed, is not capable of exercising effective \nleadership in this area. \n The Security Council reflects the situation that \nobtained 64 years ago. It is not a true reflection of the \ncurrent membership of the United Nations. Its \ncomposition is therefore irrelevant and undemocratic. \nFor all intents and purposes, the Council lacks \nlegitimacy. For as long as it remains undemocratic, it \nwill continue to fail the vulnerable and defenceless. It \nwill continue to use double standards and remain a tool \nof the foreign policies of certain States. The desired \nmultilateral path will continue to give way to the \nunilateral one. It is imperative, therefore, to hasten the \nUnited Nations reform process. The intergovernmental \nnegotiations that were held during the sixty-third \nsession of the General Assembly have advanced the \nreform process a step or two. However, more still \nneeds to be done and rather urgently. \n The United Nations was formed on the ashes of \nthe two World Wars. Its main purpose was and still is \nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of \nwar, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold \nmisery to mankind. But the continuing possession and \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons cast doubt on whether \nthis objective can indeed be realized. At a time when \nthe world is hungering for nuclear disarmament, why \nshould some countries be testing, modernizing and \nproducing new generations of nuclear weapons? \n It is our obligation as the international \ncommunity to strive for a world free of nuclear \nweapons. We remain disappointed in those countries \nthat are engaged in the testing of nuclear weapons. We \nmust, however, reiterate the right of every country to \nthe development and use of nuclear technology for \npeaceful purposes. The peaceful use of nuclear \ntechnology can be beneficial to all mankind. \n We are delighted that the third session of the \nPreparatory Committee for the 2010 Review \nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has adopted the \nagenda for the 2010 Review Conference. This historic \nachievement strengthens our optimism that our \ncommitment to the disarmament process will gain \nrenewed momentum and enthusiasm. \n In 1998, the Statute establishing the International \nCriminal Court was adopted in Rome. The Court is, \ninter alia, an answer to war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity. It safeguards the rule of law in the \n \n \n31 09-52586 \n \ninternational arena and is therefore well placed to \ncomplement the implementation of the principle of the \nresponsibility to protect. Consequently, we should, as \nthe international community, unconditionally extend \nour support to the Court. We must preserve its integrity \nand independence. There should be no State or organ of \nthe United Nations that interferes with the Court\u2019s \nprocesses. Most importantly, the Court must uphold the \nhighest standards of impartiality, integrity and fairness. \nLesotho supports the principle of universal jurisdiction. \nHowever, we reject selective application of that noble \nprinciple because it erodes its acceptability and \ncredibility. \n During the past year, we witnessed a resurgence \nof piracy off the coast of Somalia. This development \nhas had a negative impact on maritime security and \nsafety. There is a need for the international community \nto adopt a comprehensive approach to tackling the \nphenomenon of piracy off the coast of Somalia and \nbeyond. In this regard, Lesotho joins the voices of the \nheads of State and Government of the African Union in \ncalling for the convening of an international conference \nto discuss the adoption of an international convention \non the phenomenon of maritime piracy and to eradicate \nits underlying causes. \n I would be remiss not to refer to the plight of the \npeoples of the State of Palestine, the Saharan Arab \nDemocratic Republic and the Republic of Cuba. These \nare peoples who continue to experience untold \nsuffering, ranging from war to political, economic and \nsocial injustices. We call on Israel to cease all \nsettlement activities, including the so-called natural \ngrowth in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. By the \nsame token, we call on both sides to cease all acts of \nhostility and attacks. In particular, Palestine must halt \nthe indiscriminate launching of rockets on Israeli \ncivilians, while Israel must desist from the use of \ndisproportionate force against Palestinian civilians.  \n We welcome the intensified efforts of the Quartet, \nthe Arab League and other members involved in \nbrokering peace in the Middle East. We are mindful of \nthe fact that the quest for peace in the Middle East \nshould be the responsibility of all of us. We express our \nsolidarity with the people of Palestine. At the same \ntime, we reiterate the inviolability and, indeed, the \nright to exist of the State of Israel. \n The struggle of the Saharan people is a struggle \nfor self-determination based on the principles of \ndecolonization and sovereignty of nations. Both the \nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council have \nrecognized the inalienable rights of the Saharan people \nto self-determination and independence. We urge the \nSaharan Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom \nof Morocco to continue with their negotiations on an \nequal footing and without any conditions. The \naspirations of the Saharan people to self-determination \nmust take paramount priority in these negotiations. \n We also hope that the positive signals of \nengagement between the Republic of Cuba and the \nUnited States of America will bring an end to the \nunfortunate financial and economic embargo imposed \non the Republic of Cuba. Lesotho shall continue to \nsupport the call for the lifting of the economic embargo \nagainst the people of Cuba as a matter of principle and \nof urgency. \n I wish to conclude by saying that no obstacle can \nbeat the might of the United Nations. We must continue \nto pursue and indeed to cherish the purposes that have \nbrought us together. The responsibility to secure the \nfuture of mankind relies heavily on our ability to use a \ncollective approach to resolving the challenges of the \nworld. We cannot ignore our responsibility to build a \nbetter and more united world, for the future \ngenerations."

On 23 August 1989, more than 1 million people \njoined hands in a 600-kilometre-long human chain \nacross the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and \nLithuania. That event was dedicated to the fiftieth \nanniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between \nthe Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The Pact \nwas another mile marker leading to the Second World \nWar and the occupation of the three Baltic States. \n The Baltic Way served as a powerful symbol of \nthe drive for democracy and freedom in our three \nStates. The importance of the Baltic Way was so \nsubstantial that the United Nations Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization added it to the \nMemory of the World Register. The message of the \nBaltic Way is very clear, namely, that if people and \ncountries truly commit to a common goal, and if they \njoin their efforts, even the most difficult challenge can \nbe met successfully. \n A look at today\u2019s world reveals that never before \nhas international cooperation been so important. Never \nbefore have we faced such a multitude of simultaneous \ncritical challenges of global significance. Many phrases \nhave been coined to describe the most severe problems: \nthe \u201cthree Es\u201d crisis, for energy, economy and \nenvironment, and the \u201cthree Fs\u201d crisis, for finance, \nfood and fuel. But no matter what name we use we \nmust remember that those global issues require urgent \nand concerted action at the global level. \n Since we met here last year, the financial crisis \nhas turned into a global economic crisis. It has struck \nthe world with its full strength. Consequences are \nbeing felt by every State and by every economy. They \nhave an effect on international policy and make us \nreconsider domestic policies as well. Latvia has \nundertaken painful but necessary adjustments to the \ndownturn. We have learned our lessons. I am confident \nthat our economy and the entire global economic \nsystem will come out of the crisis stronger than before. \n Current realities are serving to underline the \nvalues of inclusiveness, tolerance and compassion, not \nonly domestically but also in the international arena. It \nis self-evident that we can tackle the challenges only \nby joint efforts. We should use the crisis as a catalyst \nfor looking beyond our individual gains. We should \ntherefore use it to look at how we can promote an open \ninternational trade system. We hope for the prompt \nconclusion of the long-overdue round of talks on the \nDoha Development Agenda. \n Development is hard in times of crisis. \nDeveloping countries are particularly severely affected \nby its negative effects. We are well aware of the risk of \njeopardizing what has been done in achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. We must not give up. \nLatvia is honouring its commitments to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n Climate change is a global challenge that needs to \nbe tackled at the global level. The United Nations \nSummit on Climate Change has demonstrated that it is \nimportant to reach a comprehensive and fair agreement \non future global climate policy at the Copenhagen \nConference, to be held in December of this year. Such \nan agreement should follow the principle of common \nbut differentiated responsibilities. Every country \nshould contribute according to its capabilities, but the \npolitical will of every nation is what matters most. \n The stability and security situation in a number of \ncountries and regions of the world is of particular \nconcern to the global community. Afghanistan is \ncertainly one of them. The holding of presidential \nelections in a fragile security situation was a \nsignificant achievement by the Afghan people. It is \ncrucial to pursue balanced international involvement in \n \n \n21 09-52425 \n \nAfghanistan, which should include both a civilian \nsurge and military efforts. We must continue our \nassistance to Afghanistan and other countries in the \nregion in order to prevent the threat of festering \nterrorism. It is important to understand that the value \nof local knowledge of the situation and of regional \ninvolvement cannot be overestimated. We remain \ncommitted to the rebuilding process in Afghanistan \nwhile paying special attention to upgrading its \ninfrastructure and strengthening its economy. Latvia \nhas contributed both military and civilian assistance to \nthe development of Afghanistan. \n Achieving peace in the Middle East is another \nissue that remains at the top of the international \nagenda. The two-State idea will become a reality only \nwhen the Israeli Government sincerely works to make \nit one. It will become a sustainable reality only when \nPalestinian leaders settle their own differences in the \ninterests of their people. This year, Latvia provided a \nrehabilitation programme for 18 Palestinian boys and \ngirls. They came to Latvia to participate in our \nrehabilitation programme for traumatized children \nfrom the Gaza Strip. Those children came to overcome \nthe psychological impact of the conflict they \nexperienced earlier this year. \n Latvia would like to reiterate its firm support for \nthe security and stability of Georgia, which must be \nbased on full respect for the principles of \nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity as \nrecognized by international law. The security situation \nin and around Georgia is still very fragile. We regret \nthat the Security Council failed to agree on the \ncontinuation of the United Nations Observer Mission \nin Georgia. Unfortunately, despite all the efforts by the \ninternational community, the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was forced to close \nits Mission in Georgia. \n As a result, this year we lost two important \ninternational instruments for promoting stability and \npeaceful conflict resolution in Georgia. Latvia strongly \nbelieves that the international community should \ncontinue to look for a solution. We should work to \nsecure a full and effective United Nations and OSCE \npresence in Georgia, including in Abkhazia and South \nOssetia. Meanwhile, it is ever more important to \nstrengthen the only remaining international mission, \nnamely, the European Union Monitoring Mission in \nGeorgia, which has convincingly proven its pivotal role \nin stabilizing the situation on the ground. We would \nalso like to stress the importance of the resolution on \nthe status of internally displaced persons and refugees \nfrom the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South \nOssetia. The resolution is an important show of \ncommitment to fundamental humanitarian principles. \n Choosing leadership is the right and the \nresponsibility of the people. We recently witnessed the \npost-electoral crisis in Iran. We are concerned about \nthe deteriorating human rights situation and the violent \ncrackdowns there. If the Iranian Government seeks \nrecognition as the representative of its people, it should \nrespect human rights. If the Iranian Government seeks \nthe respect of the international community, it should \ncomply with the relevant resolutions of the Security \nCouncil. By doing so, Iran could become a genuine \ncontributor to peace and stability in the whole region. \n Latvia has been steadfast in the global efforts to \ncombat the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. We are sure that the 2010 Review \nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will be an \nimportant milestone in that process. Latvia is \nconvinced that it will promote the aims of \nnon-proliferation, disarmament and the use of nuclear \nenergy for exclusively peaceful purposes. \n This fall we will celebrate the sixtieth \nanniversary of the four Geneva Conventions. The \ncharacter of armed conflict is constantly changing, and \nnew challenges, such as terrorism, arise. Still, the \nGeneva Conventions remain the bedrock of \ninternational humanitarian law. Unfortunately, the \npolitical will to fully implement the Conventions \nremains insufficient. Violations of the provisions of the \nConventions and the norms of human rights law still \noccur. \n Latvia therefore strongly supports the \nInternational Criminal Court. It is a mechanism \ndesigned to fight impunity and to promote compliance \nwith the norms of international law. Latvia commends \nthe work of the Court. We also call on all States to \nfully cooperate with it.  \n Mr. Gomes (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n The concept of the responsibility to protect was \nagreed upon at the 2005 World Summit. Latvia \nsupports that concept. It is important to work towards \nits implementation. It would help us to create a world \n  \n \n09-52425 22 \n \norder where inactivity in the face of mass atrocities \nbecomes a thing of the past. \n Three years ago, the General Assembly decided \nto establish the Human Rights Council. The Council \nhas already achieved some results. The Universal \nPeriodic Review mechanism is one of its most notable \nsuccesses. However, we believe that that process can \nbe further improved to avoid abuse of its shortcomings \nin methodology and practice. The Human Rights \nCouncil will undergo a review in 2011. We believe that \nthe Council can become even more credible, as well as \nan effective body for the promotion and protection of \nhuman rights. \n Latvia has a long-standing commitment and \nexperience with promoting human rights. We are ready \nto share our experience in that area with the \ninternational community. Latvia has therefore put \nforward its candidacy for the Human Rights Council \nfor the year 2014. \n Latvia has always supported the strengthening of \nthe United Nations. The reform of the Security \nCouncil, aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and \nlegitimacy of its work, is an important part of the \noverall reform of the United Nations. The composition \nof the Security Council must reflect the realities and \ndynamics of today\u2019s world. Latvia welcomes the \nbeginning of intergovernmental negotiations on \nSecurity Council reform. We also emphasize the \nimportance of continued progress in that area. \n We note with concern that, at a time of global \nrecession, the United Nations budget is increasing \nconsiderably. It is important to prioritize activities and \nto continue the reform of the United Nations. We \nwould also like to see more transparency and budgetary \ndiscipline in the process of budget planning and \nimplementation. \n Latvia is a candidate for next year\u2019s elections to \nthe Economic and Social Council. We are willing to \nshare our experience in addressing global challenges, \nsuch as sustainable development, poverty eradication, \nthe implementation of good governance and the rule of \nlaw, fundamental freedoms and environmental stability.  \n Latvia is already building up its expertise on the \nfunctional commissions and activities related to the \nmandate of the Council. We are an active participant in \nthe United Nations Forum on Forests, the Commission \non Science and Technology for Development, the \nStatistical Commission, and the Commission on \nSustainable Development. \n The United Nations is the only truly universal \nforum for dialogue and action. All States, big and \nsmall, have the responsibility to contribute to the \nfruitful work of the United Nations. Let me assure the \nPresident that Latvia is ready to work closely with him \nand all Member States to make the sixty-fourth session \nof the General Assembly a successful one."

        "file_text": "On \nbehalf of my delegation and in my own name, I would \nlike to offer the President our warmest congratulations \non his brilliant election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. It would \nbe remiss not to express our pride and our pleasure at \nthe election of the representative of a neighbour \ncountry, brother and friend of Chad. I am referring to \nthe brother Ali Treki of the great Libyan Arab \nJamahiriya. With his qualities and his long and rich \ndiplomatic experience, he will find it easy to lead our \nwork with tact. Through me, the Chadian delegation \nassures him of its full cooperation in discharging his \ndifficult but very lofty task. \n I would also like to express our gratitude to his \npredecessor for having led the work of the sixty-third \nsession with skill and perception. Allow me also to pay \ndue tribute to our Secretary-General, His Excellency \nBan Ki-moon, for his tireless commitment to the work \nof defending and promoting the ideals of our \nOrganization. \n From this rostrum, delegations at the sixty-third \nsession deplored the food, energy and financial crises \nthat had struck our countries, the consequences of \nwhich were felt differently according to each country\u2019s \nlevel of development. What conclusions should we \ndraw after a year of intense mobilization, cooperation \nand work to overcome those crises? \n For us poor States, those crises remain genuine \nobstacles to achieving the Millennium Development \n  \n \n09-52604 18 \n \nGoals to which we all committed, in particular for the \nfinancing of our development strategies. Despite the \ngreat international mobilization, there is a risk that the \npoor countries will fail to meet the 2015 deadline. That \nis all the more worrying as the situation persists and \nremains the focus of international debates. The \nsituation continues to also generate consequences that \nendanger the implementation of the Monterrey \nConsensus, in particular official development \nassistance, commercial trade, the debt of the countries \nof the South and world trade.  \n We cannot say it often enough: the developing \ncountries will continue to pay dearly for an economic \ncrisis that they did not cause. The international \ncommunity must therefore urgently step up its efforts \nto alleviate the difficulties that those countries face. \n Another major issue of concern, one no less \nsignificant, is the negative impacts of climate change \non the world in general and on developing countries, in \nparticular the most vulnerable. There too our countries \nare victims of a phenomenon caused by the major \ngreenhouse gas producers, which are the industrialized \ncountries. We feel those effects daily as the greatest \ndisaster for our environment, our agriculture, our \nlivestock farming \u2014 in short, for the life of our \npopulations in the form of famines and all kinds of \nillnesses. \n The most significant example is the risk of the \ncomplete disappearance of Lake Chad if the \ninternational community does not resolutely commit to \nhelping us save its world heritage. In 40 years, the \nsurface area of Lake Chad has shrunk from 25,000 to \nless than 3,000 square kilometres. The countries of the \nLake Chad Basin Commission expect the international \ncommunity to come to the support of their plan to save \nthe lake, including by implementing the project to \ndivert the waters of the Oubangui River in the Central \nAfrican Republic to feed Lake Chad.  \n At the initiative of His Excellency the President \nof the Republic, the Head of State, Chad has committed \nto planting 10 million trees a year to fight \ndesertification. That programme, which is part of the \ntranscontinental project of the Green Great Wall \ninitiated by the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, \nneeds the international community\u2019s support. \n Turning to the issue of the settlement of disputes, \nwhile we welcome the progress made here and there, \nthat is unfortunately not the case for the situation \nprevailing in Darfur, which is of serious concern to my \nGovernment. Regarding the African continent, we \nreaffirm our support and our readiness to contribute to \nall joint actions of the African Union and the United \nNations for the peaceful and lasting settlement of those \nconflicts. Indeed, we welcome the initiative recently \nundertaken by the Leader of the Libyan Revolution, \nPresident of the African Union, to convene in Tripoli a \nspecial meeting devoted to the consideration and \nsettlement of conflicts in Africa. \n With respect to the question of Palestine, we urge \nand encourage our Organization to continue with \ngreater resolve its efforts towards backing the \nconclusion of a peace agreement providing for the \npeaceful coexistence of two sovereign States, in \naccordance with the principles of international law and \nof the United Nations Charter. This is an opportunity to \nwelcome the commitment of the new American \nAdministration, under the leadership of President \nBarack Obama, to restoring peace to that region long \ntorn by war. \n The new approach to international relations \nadopted by the American Administration should also \nlead to a new attitude towards Cuba, burdened for \ndecades by an economic, trade and financial embargo \nthat is no longer justified today. That is why Chad \nwishes the United States of America to rapidly lift the \nembargo, which runs counter to the new vision of the \nworld and to the great principles championed by our \nOrganization.  \n Turning now to the crisis in Darfur and our \nrelations with the Sudan, we would again like to draw \nthe Assembly\u2019s attention to the seriousness of the \nsituation, which hangs over the security of our borders \nand threatens regional peace and security. The \nrepercussions of that crisis for security in the camps for \nrefugees and displaced persons in the east of my \ncountry, for the environment, which is already \nvulnerable in that part of the country in particular, and, \nin general, for the social and economic development of \nmy country are quite evident. \n The other consequence of that crisis, and not a \nminor one, is the phenomenon of child soldiers, who \nare very often recruited against their will by the \nvarious armed groups that hold sway in the region. \nDuring its various campaigns, the Chadian national \narmy succeeded in freeing hundreds of such children \nand entrusted them to UNICEF for care and reinsertion \n \n \n19 09-52604 \n \ninto civilian life. An inspection and awareness-raising \ncampaign has been undertaken in varying barracks \nthroughout the country in collaboration with UNICEF, \nthe United Nations and a number of diplomatic \nmissions present in N\u2019Djamena to prevent this \nphenomenon and curb it where is already exists.  \n These are the reasons that lead Chad to cooperate \nclosely with the United Nations and the international \ncommunity to find a solution to that situation, which \nhas lasted much too long. At the same time, this shows \nhow wrong it is to believe that my country fuels the \nwar in Darfur by giving support to Sudanese rebels \nthere. \n Additionally, we would like to reiterate our \ncomplete availability to cooperate with the United \nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \nChad (MINURCAT) for the fulfilment of its mandate \nin the east of our country. We condemn the delays in its \nfull deployment in the field and the ensuing difficulties \nin ensuring effective security for vulnerable \npopulations such as refugees, displaced persons and \nhumanitarian workers. It is essential that parties \ninvolved in this Mission step up their efforts to make \nup for those delays, whose prolongation means daily \ndanger for the populations that all of us must protect. \nWe are very concerned by the uncertain future of \nMINURCAT, and we wonder what the national \ncapacities might be to remedy the situation by \nstrengthening the operations for maintaining order and \nsecurity in zones covered by its mandate. \n Regardless of MINURCAT\u2019s efforts, or the \nefforts of my country to improve the security of camps \nfor refugees and displaced persons, a genuine \nsettlement of the Darfur crisis can be only political in \norder to enable refugees and the displaced to return to \ntheir ancestral homelands. \n That is why my country welcomes all initiatives \nundertaken by the international community in this \nregard. My Government has backed, and continues to \nback, the Qatar process and welcomes the untiring \nefforts by brother-leader Muammar Al-Qadhafi to \nsecure a political settlement of the crisis and, more \nrecently, to relaunch the Doha process. Along the same \nline, we also welcome the recent American and \nEgyptian initiatives. \n The efforts of the international community to \nnormalize relations between our country and the Sudan \nare also welcome. A great many agreements have been \nsigned by my country and the Sudan. All that remains \nnow is to implement them. \n The fact that we have welcomed refugees fleeing \nthe war in Darfur and have facilitated actions of the \ninternational community to assist them should not be \nused as an alibi by our neighbour in any attempt to \ndestabilize us. \n At the national level, the Government of Chad, on \nthe impetus provided by Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, \nPresident of the Republic, Head of State, continues \npolitical dialogue with the democratic opposition on \nthe basis of the 13 August 2007 agreement. In this \nclimate of shared trust we have just concluded a \npopulation census with a view to organizing free and \ntransparent elections. A national independent electoral \ncommission composed of representatives of the \nGovernment and the opposition has just been formed \nand has already started its work. \n Despite repeated attacks by mercenaries and \narmed movements with support from abroad against \nour territorial integrity and the democratically elected \ninstitutions, the Government continues to advocate \nreconciliation and national understanding. A number of \narmed groups have regained legal status through \nimplementing the Sirte Agreement of 25 October 2007. \nA great many others have committed themselves to this \npath, which we welcome. \n In conclusion, I would like to express the support \nof my country for the appeal to this Assembly by the \nPresident of the African Union for a just and fair \nreform of the Security Council, a reform that would \ntake into account the legitimate aspirations of the \nAfrican continent and the evolution of the history of \nrelations among States.

        "file_text": "Since the last session of the General \nAssembly, we have witnessed various actions and \ndevelopments that have left their negative impact on \ninternational joint efforts to address the threats and \nchallenges that still face our world, particularly in the \nareas of security, stability and sustainable \ndevelopment. \n Among the most notable implications of those \nchallenges, whose consequences transcend national \nborders, are the international financial crisis, \ndeterioration of the environment, the increase in \nunemployment and poverty, the outbreaks of infectious \ndiseases, lack of security and stability in a number of \ncountries, and the stalemate in the Middle East peace \nprocess. \n The United Arab Emirates would like to seize this \nopportunity to express its pride that the international \ncommunity has selected Masdar City in Abu Dhabi as a \nseat for the International Renewable Energy Agency. In \nthat context, we renew our commitment and readiness \nto cooperate fully in providing all facilities and \ntechnical resources required for the success of this \ninternational agency. \n We wish to stress that the United Arab Emirates\u2019 \ninterest in developing a programme for the peaceful \nuses of nuclear energy stems from its desire to meet its \ngrowing energy needs in the future. By developing a \npeaceful nuclear energy model that complies with the \nhighest standards of operational transparency while \nfulfilling the highest requirements of nuclear safety \nand security and non-proliferation, in cooperation with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency and other \nresponsible and experienced States, the United Arab \nEmirates hopes that a new course will be charted for \nthe safe and beneficial use of nuclear energy. \n The United Arab Emirates\u2019 commitment not to \nenrich uranium and reprocess fuels locally is among \nthe most salient features of this model, which is one \nsupported by enhanced international transparency and \ncooperation mechanisms. \n The United Arab Emirates renews in this forum \nits disappointment at the continued occupation by the \nIslamic Republic of Iran of the three United Arab \nEmirates islands: Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu \nMusa since 1971. The United Arab Emirates demands \nthe return of those islands under conditions of full \nsovereignty, including their regional waters, airspace, \ncontinental shelf and their exclusive economic zone as \nintegral parts of the national sovereignty of the United \nArab Emirates. \n The United Arab Emirates also affirms that all \nmilitary and administrative measures taken by the \nIranian Government on those islands are null and void \nand have no legal effect, regardless of how long the \noccupation might last. In that context, we call upon the \ninternational community to urge Iran to respond to the \npeaceful and sincere initiatives of the United Arab \nEmirates. These initiatives were supported and adopted \nby the Gulf Cooperation Council and the League of \nArab States, and they call for a just settlement of that \nissue. \n This could be done either through direct and \nserious negotiations between the two countries or by \nreferring the issue to the International Court of Justice, \nin accordance with the United Nations Charter and the \nprovisions of international law. \n We also hope that the Iranian Government will \nrespond positively and fairly to this sensitive and \nimportant issue. Such action would strengthen good-\nneighbourly relations and create a base for confidence-\nbuilding measures in the Arab Gulf region. \n  \n \n09-52592 24 \n \n We note with satisfaction the gradual withdrawal \nof foreign troops from Iraq and the extension of the \nnational authority of its Government over all its \nterritory. In this context, we reaffirm our long-standing \nsupport to the people and the Government of Iraq. In \nparticular, we support their efforts to expedite the \nrebuilding of their security, legislative and economic \ninstitutions as well as their efforts to achieve national \nreconciliation.  \n However, we are also deeply concerned at the \ndeteriorating security and humanitarian situation in \nIraq, and we strongly condemn the recent terrorist \nbombings in that brotherly country. In that context, we \ncall for respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty \nand independence of Iraq and non-intervention in its \ninternal affairs. Its Arab and Islamic identity must be \nupheld; we condemn all attempts to divide or \ndismember the Iraqi State. \n The United Arab Emirates expresses its \ndisappointment at the state of the peace process in the \nMiddle East, which has deteriorated owing to \ncontinuing Israeli aggression against and occupation of \nPalestinian and Arab territories. This includes the harsh \nblockade imposed on the Palestinian people, in \nparticular in Gaza, the ongoing confiscation of land, \nproperty and homes of the Palestinian people, and the \nbuilding of more settlements and the separation wall in \nthe occupied territories. That is all carried out with a \nview to Judaizing occupied East Jerusalem and \nchanging its Arab identity in flagrant violation of \ninternational law and resolutions of international \nlegitimacy. \n The United Arab Emirates welcomed the positive \npositions expressed by United States President Barack \nObama in this Hall on 23 September. We believe that \nhis address (see ) set out a firm basis for \nnegotiations between the Palestinians and the Israeli \nGovernment. We hope that Mr. Obama will continue to \nclosely pursue that important issue. \n We also welcome the cautious positions stated by \nthe European Union, the other members of the Quartet \nand the international community regarding the Israeli \nsettlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. \nHowever, we believe that those positions are not \nsufficient. More effective efforts are needed in order to \nresume serious negotiations with the Palestinian \nAuthority. \n In that context, we emphasize that the \nachievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace \nin the Middle East requires an end to the Israeli \noccupation of all occupied Arab and Palestinian \nterritories and the establishment of an independent \nPalestinian State, with Al-Quds as its capital, based on \nthe principle of land for peace and in accordance with \nthe Arab Peace Initiative and resolutions of \ninternational legitimacy. \n The United Arab Emirates will continue to stand \nby the Palestinian National Authority and the \nPalestinian people and to support their just cause. In \nthat context, we commend His Excellency President \nMahmoud Abbas for his tireless efforts to restore the \nlegitimate rights of his people, to establish a \nPalestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital and to \nachieve development and peace there. The United Arab \nEmirates also supports all ongoing efforts, particularly \nthose undertaken by the sisterly Arab Republic of \nEgypt, with a view to achieving national reconciliation \nin Palestine. \n The United Arab Emirates attaches particular \nimportance to African countries. It is strengthening its \ncooperation and partnerships with those countries in \nline with the United Nations Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2), with special focus on goals to combat \npoverty and to ensure that Africa, which represents the \nlargest part of the South, receives a fair and equitable \nshare of global prosperity. The United Arab Emirates \nreiterates its decades-long energy policy, which is \nbased on maintaining the volume and flow of its energy \nsupplies without restriction or political or non-political \nimpediment. \n Furthermore, the United Arab Emirates has long \nand consistently been pursuing a foreign policy based \non the principles and purposes of the United Nations, \nin particular with regard to the settlement of \ninternational disputes by peaceful means, \nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of States and the \nprotection of national sovereignty. In that context, we \naffirm our continued commitment to the one-China \npolicy. \n The United Arab Emirates, as an active member \nof the international community, is always ready to \nreiterate its commitment to respecting the principles of \nhuman rights in the light of its human values and \nnational principles and in line with the provisions and \nmachinery of relevant international conventions. The \n \n \n25 09-52592 \n \nuniversal periodic review on the United Arab Emirates \nwas adopted by the Human Rights Council in Geneva \nlast December. \n The United Arab Emirates attaches great \nimportance to the conditions of migrant workers and \nthe protection of their full rights, in accordance with \nthe constitution of the United Arab Emirates, national \nlegislation and the standards of the International \nLabour Organization. My Government has recently \nadopted a set of policies and measures aimed at \nenhancing many aspects of labour protection. It has \ntaken steps to intensify regional cooperation among \nlabour-exporting and labour-importing countries in \nAsia with what is known as the Abu Dhabi Dialogue, \nwhich aims to promote the protection of workers at all \nstages of contractual labour. Also, the United Arab \nEmirates actively participates in the International \nForum on Migration and Development and supports its \nactivities and research work. The forum was initiated \nby the High-level Dialogue on International Migration \nand Development, held on the sidelines of the General \nAssembly in the autumn of 2006. \n Women and children occupy an important place \namong the national priorities of the United Arab \nEmirates Government, in particular with regard to \neducation, health, knowledge and human development. \nThe empowerment of women and the care and \nprotection of children are among the major success \nstories of our national development project. The United \nArab Emirates has also made efforts to combat all \nforms of violence, extremism, crime, violation of \nhuman rights and human trafficking through \npartnerships that are based on equality and mutual \nrespect and contribute to achieving peace, stability and \nsustainable development. \n In conclusion, we hope that our deliberations on \nthe items on the Assembly\u2019s agenda this session will \nlead to positive results that will enhance our joint \nefforts to establish a more just, peaceful, tolerant and \ndeveloped world.

I \nwould like to assure him of the unconditional support \nof the Republic of Angola in fulfilling his important \nmission. The delegation of Angola is absolutely \npositive that under his auspicious leadership, the sixty-\nfourth session will reaffirm the importance of the \nGeneral Assembly in the search for consensual \nsolutions to the burning issues affecting humanity, \nthereby greatly contributing to creating an increasingly \nsafe, free and fair world. \n I would also like to express my delegation\u2019s deep \nappreciation to Mr. Treki\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for the high degree of efficiency \nand vast expertise with which he conducted the work \nof the presidency. \n Guided by the most elementary sense of justice, \non behalf of the Republic of Angola, I express my \ndeepest appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, for the excellence with which he has \nmanaged to consolidate reforms and ensure the \nfulfilment of the decisions of the Millennium Summit \nand other major United Nations conferences, as well as \nfor the commitment that he has consistently shown in \nplacing the needs and development of Africa at the \ncentre of the international agenda. I would also like to \npraise the Secretary-General for his timely initiative to \nconvene the high-level meeting on climate change. \n The Assembly\u2019s sixty-fourth session is taking \nplace in a political, social and economic context of \nenormous complexity. Ensuring international peace and \nsecurity, fighting poverty, protecting the environment, \nensuring a better future for generations to come, \nensuring the rule of law in relations among the \nmembers of the international community and \npromoting and safeguarding human rights \u2014 all of \nthese issues are clearly among the major challenges \nconfronting us. Combating organized crime and the \nimplementation of the Anti-Terrorism Strategy are also \nfactors of extreme importance that require the steady \n  \n \n09-52604 32 \n \nattention of the United Nations as it calls for more \neffective measures and a greater commitment from the \ninternational community. \n These challenges must be added to the list of \nothers to which our Organization must also devote \ngreat attention, especially the lack of decisions on \ndisarmament, the persistence of armed conflicts and \nthe consequences of these conflicts for the lives of \npeople, and finally, the issue on the agenda for all \nMember States \u2014 the reform of the Security Council \nof the United Nations. \n We live in a more globalized world, one that is \nincreasingly characterized by substantial economic and \nsocial inequality. Hunger and poverty, aggravated by \nthe fact that they are linked to endemic diseases such \nas malaria and tuberculosis, cause millions of deaths \nevery year and in Africa are devastating an entire \ngeneration, dramatically jeopardizing the development \nand progress of our continent. It is therefore urgent that \nwe reverse this situation, which is consuming our \npeople, putting men and women at the mercy of \ninducements that inevitably lead to violence and crime \nand, to some extent, are the cause of some of the \nserious problems that humanity currently faces. \n Food security thus seems to be one of the main \nconcerns of the African continent, due to its importance \nto health, productivity, social and political stability and \neconomic growth. Angola believes that it is possible to \nsubstantially reduce the food security deficit in Africa \nif the international community comes together around \nthe following fundamental issues. \n First, reserves of food and medicines for \nemergency aid and for people in need should be \nmaintained. Secondly, national and regional integrated \nstrategies and programmes in agriculture, trade, \ntransport, water and vocational training \u2014 which can \nbe implemented with the support and experience of the \nFood and Agriculture Organization, the International \nFund for Agricultural Development and other United \nNations specialized agencies \u2014 should be adopted. \n Action plans within the framework of regional \ninitiatives are also extremely important and can \ncontribute to reducing food shortages and combating \ndisease. Among other initiatives, I would like to \nhighlight the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment, the 2004 Ouagadougou Declaration and \nPlan of Action on employment and the eradication of \nextreme poverty, the Maputo Declaration proposing the \nallocation of 10 per cent of public expenditure to \nagriculture and rural development, the Sirte \nDeclaration on agriculture and water, the Abuja \nResolution on food safety, and the Abuja and Maputo \nDeclarations on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and \nother related diseases. \n The economic and financial crisis, though of \nexogenous origin, has also been seriously affecting the \ngrowth of African economies, due, among other \nreasons, to the reduction in asset values and financial \nassets held abroad, and mainly due to a marked \ndecrease in the price of raw materials that are exported \nby countries on the continent. Rather than finding \ninterim solutions in order to overcome immediate \nproblems, the entire current economic and financial \nsystem should be reviewed. We need to identify ways \nof restructuring the world so that it serves the interests \nof all peoples and countries from a global perspective. \n My Government welcomes the initiatives that, \nthough insufficient, have been taken in the context of \ntrade liberalization, and we support the idea of \nreforming the regulatory institutions of the financial \nand economic world. We also call for greater fluidity \nand transparency in the transfer of capital to less \ndeveloped countries. \n Similarly, Angola welcomes the various multilateral \ninitiatives, emphasizing the Forum on China-Africa \nCooperation, the Africa-South America Conference, the \nTokyo International Conference on African Development, \nthe Africa-Europe summit, the India-Africa Forum, the \nSouth Korea-Africa summit, and, more recently, the \nTurkey-Africa summit. The Angolan Government \nconsiders that all of these initiatives are of fundamental \nimportance for the development of the least developed \ncountries, which include most countries in Africa, and \nAngola in particular. \n The Secretary-General presented an important \nreport to the high-level meeting on Africa\u2019s \ndevelopment needs (A/63/130), particularly on the \nimplementation of commitments made by partners of \nthe African continent, which took place on the margins \nof the Assembly\u2019s sixty-third session. Angola shares \nthe relevant concerns raised by the Secretary-General \nin that report, especially the references to the \nimportance and urgency of moving from mere \nexpressions of political will to concrete actions, with a \ncomprehensive and vigorous pursuit of the goals \nenvisaged. \n \n \n33 09-52604 \n \n The Secretary-General gave conclusive examples: \na reduction of aid levels and commitments; \ncancellation of the foreign debt of African countries, \nwhich is taking a long time to materialize; and the \nnegative effects arising from the failure to complete the \nWorld Trade Organization round of negotiations, which \nwill result in fewer opportunities for the African \ncontinent. Angola shares all those concerns. As we \nconclude from all the eloquent statements by the \nspeakers before me, there are no magic solutions or \none-size-fits-all models to enable the least developed \ncountries to find easy and immediate answers to \ndevelopment overnight. \n As the President is certainly aware, economic \ngrowth in Angola has been quite encouraging. The \ninvitation to my country to participate in the summit of \nthe Group of Eight, held in L\u2019Aquila, Italy, on 10 July \u2014 \nwhich greatly honoured the Angolan Government and \npeople \u2014 was unquestionable proof of the international \ncommunity\u2019s recognition that Angola is on the right path \ntowards promoting sustainable development. Between \n2004 and 2007, the national economy accumulated \ngrowth of 92.4 per cent in real terms. In barely four \nyears, the value of the gross domestic product almost \ndoubled, with an average annual real growth of \napproximately 17.8 per cent. In that same period, the \ncountry saw a sharp rise in the level of public and \nprivate investments, which generated a large number of \njobs, in particular in the agricultural sector. \n Angola is firmly committed to achieving \nuniversal education, as demonstrated by the fact that \nwe have tripled the number of students in our \neducation system. In 2005, as a result of the \ninvestments that the Government directed towards the \nsocial sector, Angola moved up five positions in the \nUnited Nations human development index ranking. \nAnd the country is committed to efforts towards \nachieving the eight Millennium Development Goals. In \nthe area of sports, Angola recently won its tenth \nAfrican basketball championship, and next January it \nwill host the African Cup of Nations, having built the \nnecessary infrastructure for that significant event for \nour continent. \n Those major accomplishments, achieved in such a \nshort time, fill all Angolans with pride and strengthen \ntheir confidence in the future. However, such \nachievements are possible only in peace and social \nharmony and when States themselves take on the \nprimary responsibility for the development, progress \nand well-being of their populations. \n Despite the progress already made in Africa in \nthe areas of good governance and the \ninstitutionalization of the organs of the African Union, \nas well as in growth and economic and social \ndevelopment, we must be aware of the difficulties and \nthe long way still to go. I am referring, for example, to \nthe burning issue of promoting peace and security, \nessential conditions for the development and promotion \nof human rights. \n In that regard, it is important to add that it is \nessential that the Security Council continue to fund \noperations for peace and security in Africa and to \nsupport the efforts of African States to combat drug \ntrafficking, the illicit arms trade, piracy and terrorism. \nIn addition, I believe it important to emphasize that the \nstrategy of conflict prevention and resolution, in \nparticular the mandates of peacekeeping missions, \ncannot be separate from measures to combat organized \nand transnational crime and the relationship between \nthe illegal exploitation of natural resources and the \nillegal trade in small arms. Moreover, the conflict \nprevention and resolution strategy should be \ncomplemented by measures to combat the financing of \nterrorists, another major challenge facing the entire \ninternational community. \n Speaking for a country that has chaired the \nUnited Nations Peacebuilding Commission, I am \nparticularly pleased to note the progress in the peace \nprocesses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nBurundi, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The \ninclusion of Guinea-Bissau on the agenda of the \nPeacebuilding Commission is also very important. In \nthat regard, without false modesty I stress here the role \nplayed by Angola, not only in the negotiations that led \nto the holding of free and fair elections in that country, \nbut also in consolidating peace and political, economic \nand social stability of that brother country. \n The active participation of Angola in resolving \nthe conflicts that have plagued several countries in \nvarious regions of Africa has clearly raised the \nexpectations of the entire international community, in \nparticular the Secretary-General of the United Nations \nand the Chairman of the African Union Commission. \nAllow me to reaffirm my Government\u2019s commitment to \ncontinuing to work within the African Union and the \n  \n \n09-52604 34 \n \nUnited Nations in the search for lasting solutions for \npeacebuilding and national reconciliation. \n It is fitting to refer here to another issue of utmost \nimportance that is a consequence of armed conflict. \nThat is the humanitarian situation \u2014 the maintenance \nand protection of refugee camps and identifying \ndurable solutions for the millions of refugees whose \nrights must be protected and respected. \n The United Nations is unquestionably the \nprincipal forum of multilateralism, and its credibility \nshould constantly and increasingly be enhanced by the \nadoption of effective, creative and practical measures. \nThus, the Government of Angola welcomes the new \nformat and functions of the Economic and Social \nCouncil, especially the Annual Ministerial Review and \nthe Development Cooperation Forum. Among the \nreforms that have already taken place, the \nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and of \nthe Human Rights Council should also be highlighted.  \n My country\u2019s Government, despite welcoming the \nprogress in the evolution and functioning of the United \nNations system, cannot help note that the United \nNations was created a long time ago \u2014 over half a \ncentury ago \u2014 at a particular time in the international \ncommunity\u2019s history that we all hope will never \nreoccur. \n The world today is substantially different. The \nindustrial, economic and social development of a large \nnumber of countries has narrowed the gap between the \nmost developed countries and the least developed \ncountries. Communications have advanced; technology \nhas progressed; transport is much more sophisticated; \nand Internet surfing occurs throughout the world. \nGiven this new reality, the Government of Angola \nbelieves that the structure of the Organization, which \nbrings together people from around the world, cannot \nremain indifferent to those developments and should, \ntherefore, adapt to the modern world. \n Specifically, the Government of Angola considers \nthat the fact that the reform of the Security Council, \nparticularly aspects related to its composition and the \ndemocratization of its decision-making mechanism, has \nnot evolved since 2005 suggests that this is a situation \nthat must be corrected with urgency. \n In that context, my Government hopes that the \nprocess of ongoing negotiations within the General \nAssembly will be conclusive. \n Furthermore, the Government of Angola attaches \ngreat importance to the effort led by the United Nations \nto implement the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons, and disarmament in general, and \nrecognizes that it deserves the utmost attention of all \nits Members. \n Angola also believes that the United Nations \nshould strengthen its monitoring of the implementation \nof its Programme of Action on Small Arms and develop \ninitiatives to promote the universalization of the \nOttawa Convention on Landmines. \n At the end of my statement, I would like to avail \nmyself of this golden opportunity to launch an appeal \nfor the lifting of the economic, trade and financial \nembargo on Cuba. It is fair and imperative to abolish \nthat embargo, because it violates the principles of \ninternational law, in particular Articles 1 and 2 of the \nUnited Nations Charter. \n Angola is fully convinced that the United Nations \nwill not refrain from once again taking a clear and fair \nposition on that embargo, a position that is also \nconsistent with the principles of the Charter. \n Finally, I would like to reiterate my conviction \nthat with effort and determination, our Organization \nwill be in a position to correct asymmetries and \nprovide solutions to problems that still exist in the \ninternational community in order to build a world that \nis more fair, stable, and secure and able to provide \ncurrent and future generations with a standard of living \nconsistent with human dignity."

        "file_text": "This morning, like all \nother members of the Assembly, I listened with great \ninterest to President Obama\u2019s statement. The President \nspoke from the heart with great idealism and called \nupon all of us to shoulder our common responsibility to \nsecure the future of the world by bringing about real \nchange. He expressed feelings, hopes and goals that I \nshare and that I also intended to express here. \nHowever, since he said those things so well, I shall \nforgo that part of my statement and confine myself to \nreporting on the outcomes of the L\u2019Aquila summit of \nthe Group of Eight (G-8), over which I had the honour \nto preside.   \n The L\u2019Aquila summit brought together in that \ngrief-stricken city the representatives of 28 countries \nrepresenting more than 80 per cent of the global \neconomy. Our first order of business was to continue \nthe work being done on banking and financial market \nregulations, which will again occupy us in two days\u2019 \n  \n \n09-52179 50 \n \ntime at the Pittsburgh summit. We believed it crucial to \nensure solid and lasting growth. Economic activity \nmust once again be based on the principles of equity \nand transparency. The new development model should \nalso be based on open markets and a rejection of \nprotectionism so that the poorest countries can benefit \nfully from the growth opportunities provided by \ninternational trade. \n After L\u2019Aquila, we decided to revive the Doha \nnegotiations with a view to concluding them by 2010. \nOur trade ministers have already met in India to \nprovide practical follow-up to that decision. Pittsburgh \nwill be an important opportunity to reaffirm the \npolitical commitments undertaken at L\u2019Aquila. \n Progress was also made in the area of climate \nchange. The major economies reached an agreement to \nlimit global warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-\nindustrial levels. The common front to combat climate \nchange was reaffirmed by the broad participation in the \nmeeting held here yesterday at the initiative of the \nSecretary-General. I thank him for the leadership that \nhe demonstrated on that occasion \u2014 a quality so \nessential to the success of the Copenhagen summit.  \n L\u2019Aquila reaffirmed a clear and fundamental \nconcept that I wish to reiterate today. Overcoming the \nchallenge of climate change will require commitment \non the part of all actors in the global economy, without \nexception. \n In the area of food security, we decided to \nestablish a $20-billion fund for agricultural \ndevelopment and the fight against world hunger. The \neffort to restore agriculture\u2019s place at the heart of the \ninternational agenda is a common thread running \nthrough the G-8 summit, the Pittsburgh summit of the \nGroup of 20 (G-20) and the food security summit that \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations will host in Rome in November.  \n Too often in the past, the financial assistance \nallocated to developing countries has failed to reach \nthose for whom it was intended. That is why we have \ndecided that such financing should be invested in the \nimplementation of concrete projects primarily targeting \nagricultural infrastructure. The beneficiary countries \nmust also do their part. If it is to be effective, \nassistance should be directed only to those countries \nthat promote democracy, are committed to good \ngovernance, respect human rights and protect women \nand children. \n Finally, we discussed the need to firmly counter \nstock-market speculation and the manipulation of the \nenergy, commodities and food resource markets. This \nis of the utmost importance. Speculation in food \nproducts \u2014 wheat, rice and soy \u2014 has led to serious \ncrises, in particular on the African continent, where the \nelderly and children have been dying of starvation. In \nturn, dramatic fluctuations in oil prices have \ncontributed to financial and economic instability. Why? \nBecause the price of crude oil has risen from $70 to \n$150 a barrel, only to drop to $32 dollars and then \nbounce back to $70, despite a nearly 2 per cent \ndecrease in world consumption over the past year. We \nknow only too well that such fluctuations are caused by \nspeculation, whereby a barrel of oil is bought and sold \nfour to six times before it reaches the end user. And it \nis precisely the interest of speculators that drives up the \nprice of a barrel.  \n Thus, it is an absolute priority that the futures \nmarket be more strictly regulated. In our view, we \nshould also consider a global system of strategic \ncommodity reserves in order to nip in the bud any \nspeculative tendencies. Impartial specialized agencies, \nsuch as those of the United Nations, should also be \nempowered. Finally, the fight against speculation must \nalso ultimately include the abolition of tax havens. \nMuch has been done to eliminate existing havens, but \nwe must also strengthen the monitoring role of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in \norder to fight attempts to create new ones. \n In a nutshell, those are the main outcomes of the \nL\u2019Aquila summit. The crisis from which we are \nemerging makes it incumbent upon all of us to address \nthe issue of effective governance. The G-8 still has a \nmajor role to play in geopolitical, non-proliferation and \ndevelopment issues, as confirmed at L\u2019Aquila. \nTogether with the G-20, which is now developing \nalongside it, we need to coordinate our actions to \ntackle global economic governance and open it up to \nall major countries wishing to contribute. In doing so, \nwe must, of course, respect the central role of the \nUnited Nations, beginning with its most representative \norgan, the General Assembly. \n As for the United Nations, we must also reform \nthe Security Council to make it more effective and \nrepresentative. Let me strike a note of caution, \nhowever. Adding new national permanent members \nwould simply increase the sense of exclusion of all \ncountries that contribute actively to international peace \n \n \n51 09-52179 \n \nand security and of those that could assume growing \nresponsibilities in the future. \n Finally, during the past century, the international \ncommunity faced even more tragic crises than it does \ntoday. History shows that no crisis is insurmountable, \nbut we must be positive, resolute and, above all, \nunited. As President Obama recalled this morning, we \nare all going to have to roll up our sleeves. That is the \nkey message sent from L\u2019Aquila. Only through \ncommon commitment will we be able to restore the \nconsumer confidence that is so indispensable to a \nrenewal of spending and investment. Only through \ncommon action will we be able to overcome a crisis \nwhose roots lie also in the psychological soil of fear as \nthe determining factor. \n If we are willing and able to do this together, our \nefforts will be successful and we will manage to limit \nthe depth and the duration of the crisis. I have no doubt \nthat we will succeed. I am absolutely sure of that. \n I thank representatives for their attention, and \noffer my best wishes for their work. \n"

        "file_text": "I am indeed honoured to address \nthis body on behalf of the people of Kiribati, but let me \nstart by congratulating Mr. Ali Treki on his assumption \nof the presidency of the General Assembly at this \nsession. The tasks ahead of him and indeed ahead of us \nall are challenging. I am confident, however, that with \ncooperative efforts and commitment from all of us and \nwith the President\u2019s able leadership of this session, we \nshould be able to rise to the challenge before us. I also \ntake the opportunity to thank the President\u2019s \npredecessor, Mr. D\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for his \ncommendable leadership during the previous session. \n Every year, we gather in this Hall to deliberate on \nthe daunting challenges that continue to confront us as \ncitizens of the international community. We gather as \nleaders to find solutions to these challenges that will \nensure the survival of humanity not just today but \ntomorrow and beyond. \n Climate change is indeed the greatest moral \nchallenge to humanity in our time, and I fear that our \nchildren and grandchildren will look back and ask us \nthe question: \u201cHow is it that they knew what they knew \nyet they did so little?\u201d We simply cannot afford the \nconsequences of inaction. The people of my country \nare already feeling the impacts of climate change, \nwhich will only worsen over time. We, together with \nthose of other low-lying States, will become victims of \nclimate change. \n I have been advocating a combination of \npragmatic adaptation strategies for my people. It is our \noverwhelming desire to maintain our homeland and our \nsovereignty. However, with the inevitable decline in \nthe ability of our islands to support life \u2014 let alone \nincreasing populations \u2014 due to rising sea levels, we \nmust also provide opportunities for those of our people \nwho wish to migrate to be able to do so on merit and \nwith dignity. Our approaches will be time-relevant, \nresponding to the different levels of threat and impacts \nof climate change on our islands and our people as \ntime goes by.  \n We expect greenhouse gas emitters to take \nappropriate action to mitigate these negative effects. \nWe ask for assistance with our adaptation efforts and \nwe ask those who might need our labour to be able to \nopen their doors. It is important to stress that these \noptions are not mutually exclusive. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n Our relocation strategy requires the support of the \ninternational community. On previous occasions, I \nhave referred to existing initiatives with our regional \ndevelopment partners, and I wish to say again that I am \ngrateful to the Governments of New Zealand and \nAustralia for their support through the Pacific Access \nCategory scheme, the Kiribati Australia Nursing \nInitiative and the Australia-Pacific Technical College \nprogramme. These are models that we believe can be \nimplemented more broadly as a win-win option for all \nconcerned. Pacific leaders have agreed to work \ntogether to address climate change through the 2008 \nNiue Declaration on Climate Change.  \n Internationally, the declaration adopted by \nAlliance of Small Island States leaders a few days ago \noutlines the issues of importance to small island \ndeveloping States and calls for action on climate \nchange, particularly leading up to Copenhagen. \nResolution 63/281 on climate change and its possible \nsecurity implications is a landmark decision of the \nGeneral Assembly that acknowledges the link between \nclimate change and security. I commend our Pacific \nambassadors in New York for initiating and driving \nthat resolution, and I thank the sponsors for their \nsupport. \n I appreciate that reaching consensus in \nCopenhagen will not be an easy task, but I do believe \nthat it is possible and that it is imperative that we do \nso. If we can mobilize trillions of dollars to address the \nchallenges of the global economic crisis, then we must \nbe equally capable of taking the action necessary to \n \n \n27 09-52463 \n \ndeal with the challenges of the global environment. \nOver the past few days, I have been deeply heartened \nto see leaders\u2019 strong commitment to tackling this \ncommon challenge together, to hear leaders resolve to \nlook beyond national interests and focus on the global \ninterest, and by their understanding of the predicament \nof those on the front line of climate change.  \n To be able to see leaders\u2019 strong determination to \nseal the deal in Copenhagen \u2014 a deal that, among \nother things, will address the plight of the most \nvulnerable \u2014 has given me hope and restored my faith \nin humanity and in the relevance of our global \ncommunity and our global leadership. I take this \nopportunity to strongly commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for his initiative in organizing the high-level \nSummit on Climate Change. That Summit provided us \nwith the opportunity as leaders to talk face to face and \nto agree on a way forward for the climate change \nnegotiations. I also thank my fellow leaders for their \nunderstanding, compassion and political will \ncollectively to address this crisis and its impacts. \n It is now absolutely necessary that we capitalize \non this collective political will. We must direct our \nnegotiators to act accordingly to ensure that our \ncommon resolve as leaders is in fact given effect. I \nknow that we will not be able to agree on all issues, but \nat the same time I am sure there are some fundamental \nissues that we cannot afford not to agree on. Let us not \nwaste any more time on diplomatic talk, language, \ndrafting of amendments, posturing and empty \nplatitudes. We know what needs to be done. It has been \ncalled many things \u2014 a new world order, the grand \nbargain, a new green deal \u2014 but Copenhagen gives us \nthe opportunity to enter into a global compact for \naction on climate change between developed and \ndeveloping countries, North and South, East and West. \nThis might be our last chance. If we do not act now, \nwho the hell is going to do it? \n We have declared the Phoenix Islands Protected \nArea (PIPA), the largest marine protected area in the \nworld, covering more than 400,000 square kilometres \nof ocean area. It constitutes something like 11 per cent \nof our exclusive economic zone. PIPA is a collective \npartnership between my Government, Conservation \nInternational and New England Aquarium. The \npreservation of the Phoenix Islands and the \nsurrounding ocean is our gift, our statement to \nhumanity, in the face of climate change. It is our \ncontribution to international efforts to significantly \nreduce biodiversity loss by the year 2010. Even now as \nwe confront the possibility that our islands will become \nuninhabitable within this century due to rising sea \nlevels, we recognize the value of protecting something \nthat we firmly believe to be the common heritage of all \nmankind. \n We are indeed encouraged to see the emergence \nof ocean conservation and management initiatives in \nthe Pacific. Such initiatives include the Micronesia \nChallenge, the Coral Triangle Initiative and the Nauru \nAgreement. Kiribati and the Pacific are committed to \nthe sustainable conservation and management of its \noceans. At the Pacific Islands Forum in Australia last \nmonth, the leaders of the Pacific adopted the Pacific \nOceanscape initiative, aimed at promoting \ncollaboration and exchanges between marine protected \nareas in the region and with other partners. We call for \nsupport for this initiative from the international \ncommunity. \n The impacts of the climate crisis, the \ninternational financial crisis and the food and energy \ncrisis have ended our efforts to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment and our way forward towards achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals. The particular \neconomic and environment vulnerability of Kiribati as \na small island developing State should be taken into \naccount when considering us for graduation from least \ndeveloped country status. Assistance provided to the \nleast developed countries helps us at this point in time \nin our efforts to address challenges we face as a nation. \nTo lose that assistance would be detrimental to our \nefforts and to the livelihood of our people. We reiterate \nour call to the United Nations to reconsider the listing \nfor the graduation of Kiribati and other countries in the \nPacific. \n On the issue of global governance, the United \nNations is undergoing change to adapt to the realities \nof our time. It must maintain its relevance if it is to \naddress the security challenges that the world continues \nto face. We believe that the United Nations should be \nan inclusive Organization, particularly for States such \nas Taiwan that make a contribution to world harmony \nand have demonstrated time and again their willingness \nand ability to contribute positively to international \ncooperative efforts. Taiwan has demonstrated its \ncommitment to international peace and security \nthrough its contributions to national, regional and \ninternational development programmes. It is only fair \nand fitting, therefore, that Taiwan should be allowed to \n  \n \n09-52463 28 \n \nparticipate meaningfully in meetings and activities of \nthe United Nations organs. Given the impact of climate \nchange and the demands of aviation safety and security \non its development and the well-being of its people, we \nnow appeal for the meaningful participation of Taiwan \nin the work and activities of the International Civil \nAviation Organization and the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \n In concluding, in the face of the common \nchallenges facing the global community, it is \nencouraging to hear leaders call for a new global order \nin which our interests as fellow citizens of the planet \noverride our national interests, particularly where \nglobal human security and lives are under serious \nthreat. This goal reaffirms the principle of collective \nresponsibility for the common challenges that we face.  \n The United Nations will and must continue to \nplay a significant role in the new world order, \nparticularly in mobilizing the political will and the \nnecessary action and resources required to implement \nit. Copenhagen will be the test of the political will and \ncommitment that we have declared over the past few \ndays as leaders. It will determine the fate of the most \nvulnerable and eventually the whole of humanity."

I would like to \ncontribute to this debate with some additional remarks. \n Slovakia is a keen believer in effective \nmultilateralism and the central role of the United \nNations in that regard. We therefore greatly welcome \nthe main theme of our deliberations during this general \ndebate, with a focus on achieving tangible results on \nthe three pillars of the work of the United Nations: \npeace and security, human rights and development. \n We welcome the attention that the Organization \nhas paid to the issue of climate change, as well as to \nincreasing food security and eliminating the negative \neffects of the financial and economic crisis, especially \nin the most vulnerable States and populations. Slovakia \ncalls for reaching an ambitious, balanced and \ncomprehensive agreement on climate change in \nCopenhagen at the end of 2009 that will replace the \nKyoto Protocol. Also, we need to elaborate an action \nplan and strengthen global strategies for food security \nin the world. It is essential not to lose sight of the \nMillennium Development Goals and to maintain our \nefforts to achieve them by the year 2015. \n We have in recent years invested considerable \neffort in elaborating and implementing our own \nconcept of official development assistance, through a \nnumber of bilateral and multilateral projects. The \nwestern Balkans, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Africa \nhave been among our priority geographic areas in this \nregard. \n Slovakia\u2019s commitment to the issues of economic \nand social development prompted us to present our \ncandidature for membership of the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Council at the elections to be \nheld in the General Assembly later this year. We \nappreciate the endorsement of our candidature by the \nGroup of Eastern European and other States and will \ndo our best to gain the trust and support of all of the \nOrganization\u2019s Member States. Slovakia is committed \nto serving as an active and engaged member of the \nEconomic and Social Council, and would like to \ncontribute tangibly to making that important United \nNations organ as relevant and as effective as possible. \n The United Nations has achieved remarkable \nresults in peacekeeping over past decades. We \nrecognize its continued efforts to adapt peacekeeping \nso that it can respond better to current and future \nchallenges. More emphasis should be put on ensuring \nthat peacekeepers and other United Nations actors on \nthe ground are properly equipped and trained, \nincluding in the area of the so-called critical \ncapabilities. It is our belief that preventive diplomacy \nshould be used whenever possible in order to avoid \nconflicts in the first place. \n Slovakia continues to be actively engaged in \nnumerous peace and security endeavours of the \ninternational community. We are currently participating \nin international crisis-management operations under \nUnited Nations command or Security Council mandate \nin Afghanistan, Cyprus, Kosovo, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and the Middle East. We are doing our \nbest to contribute to peacekeeping, peacebuilding, \nstabilization and reconstruction efforts in those parts of \nthe world and will continue to do so in the future. \n In addition, Slovakia remains actively engaged in \nthe area of security sector reform, an issue that we \nbegan promoting within the United Nations during our \nnon-permanent membership in the Security Council. \nSlovakia, as the initiator and chair of the United \nNations Group of Friends of Security Sector Reform, \nwill continue working to ensure that the United \n  \n \n09-52586 48 \n \nNations system is able to react in an adequate, timely \nand systematic manner to the needs of Member States \nrelating to security sector reform. After a useful \nAfrican regional workshop, held in Cape Town as a \njoint South African and Slovak project, we have now \nteamed up with key partners, namely, Argentina and \nIndonesia, in two other important regions, Latin \nAmerica and South-East Asia. The Buenos Aires \nworkshop will be held just a few days from now. \n As I have already mentioned, we are glad to see \nthat significant progress has been achieved in \npreventive diplomacy, conflict prevention and \nmediation support. This has recently been \ndemonstrated, for example, in the role played by \nUnited Nations mediation teams in helping to find \npeaceful and negotiated solutions to crises in Kenya, \nZimbabwe, Madagascar and elsewhere. Slovakia will \ncontribute further to that work. We are, in this regard, \nvery pleased that the first United Nations Regional \nCentre for Preventive Diplomacy, located in Central \nAsia and led by a Slovak representative, has achieved \ngood results so far and has fully proved itself as a \nmeaningful and necessary project. We are convinced \nthat issues such as conflict prevention cannot be seen \nin isolation. They are connected with respect for \nhuman rights, protection of civilians, gender equality, \nprotection of children in armed conflict and so forth. \nAs a serving member of the United Nations Human \nRights Council, Slovakia works to promote universal \nrespect for the protection of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms for all, at national and \ninternational levels. \n Among the key tools that the United Nations has \nat its disposal for protecting those who are most \nendangered and vulnerable is the concept of \nresponsibility to protect, one of the most important \nachievements of the 2005 World Summit. We believe \nthe international community should focus more on the \nprotection of civilian populations from genocide, war \ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. \nNor can we forget our obligation, under international \nlaw, to prevent the incitement of those most serious \ncrimes, which should be referred to the International \nCriminal Court, established for the purpose of ending \nimpunity for perpetrators of such crimes. \n Much of the Organization\u2019s ability to deal with \ncurrent threats and challenges depends on the existing \ninstitutional framework. The United Nations Security \nCouncil is at the centre of that framework. Slovakia is \na long-term advocate of enlarging the Security Council \nin both of its membership categories. The composition \nof an enlarged Security Council should better reflect \nnew global realities. Appropriate attention must also be \npaid to the Council\u2019s working methods. We are pleased \nthat the intergovernmental negotiations have begun and \nbelieve that things will move forward in the interest of \nmaking the Security Council a truly relevant and \nefficient body. \n The old saying \u201cIf you seek peace, prepare for \nwar\u201d has resulted in an unprecedented arms race, \nwhich in itself has become a source of fear and \ninsecurity. Slovakia is particularly concerned about the \nrisk of weapons of mass destruction and their means of \ndelivery falling into the hands of non-State actors, \nespecially terrorist groups. In this connection, Slovakia \nis ready to work with all partners towards the \nsuccessful outcome of the 2010 Review Conference of \nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons, which should result in an enhanced \ninternational nuclear non-proliferation regime. Our \npriority is to outlaw nuclear testing and see the \nComprehensive Test-Ban Treaty come into force. \nSlovakia also calls for an early start to substantive \nnegotiations on an arms trade treaty, which is essential \nfor reducing the unacceptable human cost resulting \nfrom the proliferation of conventional arms. \n Slovakia, together with the other members of the \nEuropean Union, is deeply concerned about Iran\u2019s \ncontinued defiance despite its international obligations, \nincluding the Security Council\u2019s demands that it \nsuspend its nuclear activities. We note that Iran has \nagreed to continue talks with the P5+1 group of the \nfive permanent members of the Security Council plus \nGermany, and we call on Iran to commit to diplomatic \nnegotiations in order to restore the trust of the \ninternational community and make real and urgently \nneeded progress. The deteriorating human rights \nsituation and the violent suppression of the popular \nprotests that erupted in Iran after the elections in June \nis a cause of much concern to Slovakia. We have also \nrepeatedly and strongly condemned the nuclear test and \nmissile launches carried out by the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea. We call on North Korea to \nreverse its position on the Non-Proliferation Treaty and \njoin the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \n Let me now turn to some regional issues that \nSlovakia pays particular attention to. As a matter of \npriority, Slovakia has been closely following \n \n \n49 09-52586 \n \ndevelopments in the western Balkans. We continue to \npromote full respect for international law, including the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States within \ntheir internationally recognized borders. At the same \ntime, we welcome and support a peaceful and \nconstructive approach to seeking solutions to disputes. \nWe believe that the future of the entire region and its \npeople lies in the European perspective and that there \nis no meaningful alternative to that. \n Promotion of full respect for international law \nand the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States \nwithin their internationally recognized borders is also \nthe principle that guides us in the case of Georgia. \nSlovakia was very disappointed when, earlier this year, \nthe Security Council was unable to agree on extending \nthe mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in \nGeorgia. The termination of the Mission complicates \nthe already unstable situation in the region, as well as \nthe security conditions for civilians in the conflict \nzone. We firmly support a peaceful and lasting solution \nto the conflict in Georgia and hope that the Geneva \ntalks will yield positive results. \n In addition to participating in the United Nations \nPeacekeeping Force in Cyprus operation on a long-\nterm basis, Slovakia has been actively engaged for \nmore than 20 years in the confidence-building process \nbetween the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot \npolitical leaders, and we are committed to continuing \nour active engagement. A combination of military and \ndevelopment aid activities characterizes our long-term \nactive engagement in Afghanistan. Slovakia, as a \nmember of the International Security Assistance Force \noperation, is helping to establish a secure and stable \nenvironment in Afghanistan. \n In conclusion, Slovakia hopes that the last year of \nthe first decade of this millennium will bring all the \nStates of the international community closer together in \norder to overcome the negative consequences of the \nfinancial and economic crisis, among others. \n This represents a basic step towards the possible \nsettlement of many other conflicts and problems that \nthe international community is facing. In our view, we \nhave to intensify our efforts, in this regard, and adopt \nappropriate measures on the local, regional and global \nlevels in the spirit of solidarity and common \nresponsibility. We strongly believe that the United \nNations and its specialized agencies must be directly \nengaged in this process and guide the world for the \nwelfare of this generation and of those of the future. \n I should like once again to reaffirm Slovakia\u2019s \nsupport for your work, which, through pursuing the \npriorities of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession, will address the main ills that pain the \ninternational community today.

        "file_text": "Thirty years after the triumph of the people\u2019s \nSandinista Revolution and the start of a process of \npopular and participatory democracy, on behalf of the \nPresident of Nicaragua and Commander of the \nRevolution, Mr. Daniel Ortega Saavedra, I salute and \ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election as \n \n \n09-53165 8 \n \nPresident of this Assembly, which it is my honour to \naddress. \n Nicaragua is a country impoverished by historical \ncircumstances no different from, if not identical to, the \nhistories and circumstances of countries of our Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean region and others around the \nworld. This history has been repeated over time and \nspace, as we will outline later. Nevertheless, Nicaragua \nremains a land rich in beauty and natural resources. It \nis a nation symbolic of reconciliation and of national \nand international unity. \n Although few may know this, our country is one \nof the safest countries of this continent. Nicaragua is \nengaged in an exemplary, tireless and decisive \ncampaign against organized and petty crime in an \nexemplary fashion, as acknowledged by international \nbodies and authorities. It does so not only with \ncoercive and punitive measures, but, more \nsignificantly, by building an alternative model of \ndevelopment that transforms the structures of poverty \nand marginalization that are the breeding ground of \npublic security problems. Our model is based on \ndemocratic reform expressed by the people\u2019s will, \nwhich we call \u201ccitizen power\u201d. \n By means of the \u201cFrom Mart\u00ed to Fidel\u201d campaign, \nilliteracy has been reduced to 3.16 per cent. We have \nmade progress in preventive medicine and have \nsuccessfully controlled pandemics, such as that of the \nA (H1N1) virus. In our country, the mortality rate from \nthis disease is one of the two lowest in America. These \nachievements have been made possible by the generous \nsolidarity of the fraternal people and Government of \nCuba, which has been consistent and has perpetuated \nthe internationalist calling of Commander Fidel Castro \nRuz. \n The Government of Nicaragua has opened the \ndoor to production credits. The Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) selected our \nschool nutrition programme as one of the top four in \nthe world. In that spirit, President Daniel Ortega has \nproposed the adoption of a Central American \nagriculture policy to transform the region into a food \nproduction zone, and in that same spirit, we welcome \nand support the World Summit on Food Security \nscheduled for November of this year. \n Today, we have an electrical power reserve of \n42.6 per cent, although barely two years ago there was \na shortfall of 3.29 per cent. This is thanks to the \nsolidarity of the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela \nunder the leadership of its President, Commander Hugo \nCh\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas. Meanwhile, we continue to make \ntargeted efforts to promote the use of alternative \nrenewable energy sources, such as water, wind, \ngeothermal, solar power and, more recently, biomass. \nWe also support initiatives aimed at developing civilian \nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \n Clean drinking water has been made available to \n217,000 families. We have launched programmes such \nas Zero Hunger and Zero Usury, which were \nhighlighted in a report by the United Nations Special \nRapporteur on the right to food. In order to refute the \ndaily lies of certain media outlets in Nicaragua, FAO \nrecently issued a published notice of the positive \nresults of the programmes it coordinates with the \nNicaraguan Government to fight hunger and extreme \npoverty. \n Food security cannot continue to be subject to the \ngreediness of a few. There is enough food to nourish \ntwice the current world population, but thousands die \nevery minute around the world. While in some \ncountries automobiles are fed, millions of boys and \ngirls die with an empty stomach. That is simply \ncriminal. \n We also express our profound rejection of the \ndiscrimination and persecution of immigrants and \nunequivocally support full respect for their human \nrights. The Government of National Reconciliation and \nUnity also seeks to reverse the exclusion to which \nnative peoples and communities of African descent \nhave been subject throughout history. \n Nicaragua is the enemy of terrorism in any of its \nforms, including State-sponsored terrorism. It is for \nthat and many other reasons that we oppose the \ncriminal embargo against the heroic people of Cuba, \nsix generations of whom have been born since the \nembargo began. How many more generations must \noutlive it? How many more resolutions must the \nAssembly adopt on this topic? There are already \n17 resolutions on this issue. \n It is also rightfully of interest to this Assembly \nthat, while a criminal murderer of Cuban athletes \nenjoys total liberty, five anti-terrorist Cubans are \nimprisoned far from their families and incommunicado \nfor the sole crime of simply being anti-terrorists. \n \n \n9 09-53165 \n \n Today\u2019s Nicaragua is an active militant in favour \nof solidarity, as well as a militant supporter of \ngratitude. We therefore appreciate the disinterested \ncooperation of the sister nations that contribute to the \neconomic and social development of our people. We \nalso embrace the just cause of Puerto Rican \nindependence and support the return of the Malvinas \nIslands to their rightful owner, the Argentine people. In \nthe same manner, we endorse the struggles of the \nSaharan and Cypriot peoples.  \n We also call on Israel to withdraw from the \noccupied Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian territories. \nWe stand unconditionally with the Palestinian people \nin their daily fight for their own sovereign State. That \nis why we advocate a peaceful, just and lasting solution \nthat guarantees peace in that region. One year after \ngaining their independence, we congratulate the \npeoples of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and affirm that \nwe have already established diplomatic relations with \nAbkhazia. \n We support the new and positive focus that \nTaiwan has adopted in its relations with the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, as well as its participation in United \nNations specialized bodies and agencies. \n We condemn the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Honduras and \nhereby proclaim our definitive decision not to \nrecognize the results of any electoral farce in that \ncountry. By means of the coup, its perpetrators have \nsought to kill the democratic hopes and initiatives of \nthe Honduran people, just as they sought to thwart the \nfraternal process of Bolivarian Alternative for the \nAmericas (ALBA). Nonetheless, a change in Honduras \nthat supersedes a formal and hypocritical democracy is \ninevitable. \n From this rostrum, we denounce the massacre of \nthe Honduran people and point in no uncertain terms to \nthe assassination plot against President Zalaya. We \nmust heed this now, because later it will be said that he \ncommitted suicide. From this very moment, we \nunconditionally support and endorse the proposal made \nlast night in this same forum by the Foreign Minister of \nHonduras, Patricia Rodas, to the Secretary-General and \nthe General Assembly. \n The time has come to make the General Assembly \na forum in which substantive, irreversible decisions are \ntaken. We cannot continue to have a Security Council \nwith an abusive veto privilege. \n The time has also come for cooperation without \nhumiliating preconditions, the construction of the most \nbeautiful dream of Bol\u00edvar and Sandino, and the dawn \nof a realistic and coherent solidarity. I speak of the \nBolivarian Alternative for the Americas, composed of \nthe peoples of Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, the \nDominican Republic, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines, Venezuela, and Honduras \nin its resistance. ALBA is the basis for cross-cutting \nand inclusive cooperation between our peoples. Its \nmembership increases day by day. \n I cannot fail to note with profound concern that \nwe are meeting today under economic circumstances \nthat are similar to or worse than those of a year ago, \nwhen the worst world economic depression of modern \ntimes arose to exacerbate the existing food, energy and \nenvironmental crises. Unfortunately, these world crises \nhave met with a decrease in official development \nassistance, which remains conditional thanks to the \ninternational financial institutions, and with the \nreluctance of developed countries to replace the current \nmodel with one that is more just and respectful of \nMother Nature. \n The United Nations Conference on the World \nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \nDevelopment demonstrated that the Group of 192, as it \nhas been called by my brother, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, has a voice in world economic matters. It \nis within the most representative institution that \neconomic policies affecting millions should be \ndecided, and not within exclusive groups, such as the \nGroup of Eight or the Group of 20, defenders of the \nmodel of domination by the few over the majority. In \nthat regard, we welcome establishment of the ad hoc \nopen-ended working group that will follow up on the \noutcome of the Conference. \n For some years now, climate change has become \nnot a threat of the future, but rather a very present \nthreat. We believe that the United Nations Climate \nChange Conference, to take place in December in \nCopenhagen, should be a debate not on the need to act, \nbut rather on the need for the developed countries to \nfulfil their historic obligation under the Kyoto Protocol \nand to end their attempts to repudiate the principle of \ncommon but differentiated responsibility. \n It is time for attitudes and actions to reflect a true \ncommitment to counteracting the harmful effects of \nglobal warming. We firmly believe that it is the \n \n \n09-53165 10 \n \nexclusive responsibility of the General Assembly \u2014 \nand in no case of the Security Council \u2014 to seek the \nconsensus and commitments necessary for us to move \nforward in this struggle, which is a struggle for the \nsurvival of all humankind. \n It is not possible to democratize selfishness, \nexclusion or the manipulation of truth. It is not possible \nto put a kind face on perversion or arrogance. That is the \nessence of the prevailing economic system \u2014 the \nexploitation of one human being by another, the \nsubjugation of nations, and the hoarding of wealth by \nthe few. \n This is why we are in crisis; it is not because of a \nlack of resources, but because of the concentration of \nresources in the hands of a few, because of disregard \nfor our environment, because of the rejection of moral \nvalues, because of human arrogance towards other \nspecies and, worst of all, because of disdain for human \nlife itself. \n We are optimistic. It is necessary to replace and \nfind alternatives to the current socio-economic and \npolitical model, which has led to unjustified \ninterventions such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand to that now being committed against our region \nwith the establishment of military bases in Colombia \nunder the pretext of fighting drug trafficking. \n We cannot fail to be struck by the fact that, \ndespite the $7,558,000,000 invested, the flow of drugs \nout of Colombia continues to grow. In 1999, at the \nbeginning of Plan Colombia, the drug traffic to the \nUnited States and Europe was an annual 600 metric \ntons. Today, in 2009, that traffic has more than doubled \nto 1,450 metric tons. In other words, the strategy of \nmilitarizing Colombia has failed, absolute proof of \nwhich are the numbers I have cited. The true objective \nof installing these \u201cseven daggers in the heart of \nAmerica\u201d, as they are called by Commander Fidel \nCastro, is to salvage the moribund economic and \npolitical system with which capitalism flaunts its \npower by controlling the hemisphere\u2019s water, oil and \nbiodiversity. \n We believe in the strengthening of energetic and \nprogressive positions in the defence of peace and \nrespect for the sovereignty of the countries of our \nregion. We are sure that it will ultimately serve to \nfurther advance the Latin American unity dreamt by \nBol\u00edvar, Moraz\u00e1n, Mart\u00ed and Sandino.\n Today, the solidarity practices of Fidel Castro and \nrevolutionary Cuba have grown and spread like never \nbefore. The wide world of Latin America has ceased to \nbe foreign, and as Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann said \nduring his particularly outstanding presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly, the current scenario is not a tragedy \nbut a crisis. Crisis purifies. The pain we now feel is not \nthe death rattle of a dying man but the pain of a new \nbirth.  \n Finally, I wish to inform the General Assembly \nthat Nicaragua, respectful of international law, has \nabided by the ruling of the International Court of \nJustice in its decision of 13 July 2009, and has issued a \npresidential decree to regulate navigation in the San \nJuan River, over which Nicaragua has full, absolute \nand unquestionable sovereignty, as was recognized by \nthe ruling. \n I send greetings to all on behalf of our President, \nDaniel Ortega Saavedra, and of all Nicaraguans who \nsing in praise of Dar\u00edo and who proudly carry on \nSandino\u2019s legacy in order to defend ourselves today \nwith peace and dignity. Nicaragua is proud of its \ndevotion to peace, honour, solidarity and the relentless \nstruggle against injustice."

        "file_text": "It is indeed my \nhonour and privilege, Mr. President, to bring you, on \nbehalf of the people and Government of Papua New \nGuinea, our warmest greetings and to pledge our \nsupport as you preside over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session. We thank your predecessor, His \nExcellency Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for his \nstrong leadership during his tenure as President of the \nAssembly at its sixty-third session. \n We would like to reiterate our support for the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the United \nNations agencies such as the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and UNICEF for \ntheir efforts to enhance the benevolent work they do \nfor the world and Papua New Guinea. \n When God distributed the peoples of the world \neverywhere, he wedged in Papua New Guinea, a small \ncountry of 6.5 million people, between the South \nPacific and the South-East Asia. It has been a privilege \nthat has allowed us to appreciate the peaceful and \ncolourful people of the Pacific as well as the dynamic \nnations of South-East Asia. We may not be a large \ncountry or a country of economic or military power, \nbut in our own way and from our own standpoint, we \nhave a right to contribute to the world among other \nnations, to collectively approach issues and problems \nand to speak out whether in support or in disagreement. \n Very recently, on 16 September, we celebrated the \nthirty-fourth anniversary of our independence. But an \nimportant achievement for us was the fact that by the \ngrace of God, we have had an unbroken constitutional \ndemocracy for those 34 years. Our current Prime \nMinister, the Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, has \nbeen in Parliament for 41 years. He is the founding \nPrime Minister and has been ousted only through a \nparliamentary constitutional vote and has returned \nthree times as Prime Minister, the current term being \nhis fourth. I am mentioning this because Papua New \nGuinea is contributing to democracy in the world. \nThrough its democratic form of government, in a \nnation of over 800 languages and cultures, a people of \ndiversity can find a way towards harmony and political \nacceptance of one another. \n We are proud of that achievement, but we are also \nmindful of the many critical challenges that lie ahead \n \n \n5 09-53165 \n \nof us as we develop and progress. Many are challenges \nthat cannot be handled by one individual country \u2014 \nwhether large or small \u2014 on its own. The United \nNations must therefore continue to provide the global \nforum for all Member States, big and small, powerful \nand weak, to come together to address the many global \nissues and challenges we face collectively as a human \nfamily. And together we must confront, first, the \ncontinuing threats of climate change and global \nwarming, the global food crisis now compounded by \nthe global financial crisis, and the threats of diseases \nthat know no borders, such as H1N1, HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria, tuberculosis, cholera, et cetera. Secondly, we \nmust achieve together the social agenda of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n Papua New Guinea firmly believes that \nstrengthening international peace and security is \nfundamental and is a prerequisite to achieving human \ndevelopment, progress and prosperity. My country \ndenounces weapons of mass destruction and is fully \ncommitted to the principles of a world free from \nweapons of mass terror. That is attested to by the fact \nthat we are a State party to the South Pacific Nuclear \nFree Zone Treaty and also fully support the Treaty on \nthe South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. \n We are now working earnestly towards early \nratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty. We also look forward to contributing \nconstructively to United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. Papua New Guinea therefore welcomes \npositive initiatives of the new United States \nGovernment and other like-minded countries to \nenhance the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and \nencourage disarmament. \n A continuing major concern of Papua New \nGuinea is the increase in global conflicts heightened by \nthe illicit trade and use of small arms and light \nweapons, which continue to cause untold suffering to \nmillions of people around the world. The people of \nPapua New Guinea are no exception. The global debate \non small arms has focused on curbing their use. \nHowever, the supply side of weapons is never \ncomprehensively discussed. We therefore support a \nproposed arms trade treaty, which is still in \nnegotiations and which will deal with one of the key \nelements of the arms issue. \n In Papua New Guinea we have seen the presence \nof small arms and light weapons threaten the stability \nof communities. My Government prioritized the need \nto comprehensively address this issue through \ncommissioning the 2005 National Gun Summit Report, \nwhich will be implemented soon. \n The various global crises of today have had a \ndisproportionate negative impact on many developing \ncountries. From falling commodity prices to increases \nin food and energy costs, the damages caused and the \ncosts incurred to redress them have heavily impacted \ntheir development. The impact of the crisis has also \nreduced levels of official development assistance \nglobally and resulted in big shortfalls in the national \nbudgets of developing countries.  \n While we appreciate that many countries have \nhad to assist their economies by massive injections of \ncapital, we nevertheless support the strong call for \nreforms of the international financial architecture to \ninclude major developing countries like China and \nIndia. Such reforms would better reflect today\u2019s global \neconomic realities and provide effective management \nof the global process, which needs to be fair, equitable \nand transparent. \n At the 2005 World Summit, leaders agreed to a \nset of broad reforms to the United Nations. Since then, \nthe Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \nCommission have been established. Furthermore, the \nconcept of the responsibility to protect has received \nbroad support, with an inclusive process now under \nway to better elaborate it. \n We support the continuing call for the reform of \nthe Security Council in both the permanent and \nnon-permanent membership categories. In this regard, \nwe support the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations \nwithin the General Assembly, which have seen the \nemergence of strong agreement on certain issues. \n We note that great strides are being made in \nreforming the global gender architecture. We applaud \nthe strong but cautious consensus reached at the sixty-\nthird session of the General Assembly to support the \ncreation of an Under-Secretary-General post to assist in \nbetter management of the various United Nations \nentities dealing with the gender issues. We take note of \nand commend the work of former Prime Minister of \nNew Zealand, Her Excellency Helen Clark, as the \nUNDP Administrator. We therefore strongly support \nthe ongoing reform, as the gender issue in its entirety \n \n \n09-53165 6 \n \nremains one of the key policy issues of my \nGovernment. \n As a growing democracy in the Pacific, it is my \nGovernment\u2019s desire to see our friends and neighbours \nin the Pacific and beyond enjoy freedom and \nprosperity. We reaffirm our continuing support for our \nPacific neighbours in their development aspirations. \nWe feel that on the issue of Fiji we need to continue \ndialogue and not to isolate them. We also support the \nmain thrust of the Pacific Plan and encourage our \nForum dialogue partners to assist with its ongoing \nimplementation, as we believe it will catalyse the \nPacific region\u2019s development. \n The social sector of many of our developing \ncountries suffers greatly, and the United Nations has \nquite rightly set the Millennium Development Goals. \nThey provide us with one of the greatest opportunities \nto leverage our development process. We commend and \nstrongly support the Secretary-General for his proposal \nto convene a high-level session on the MDGs in \nSeptember 2010. \n Achieving the MDGs remains an integral \ndevelopment priority of our Government. We are \nworking to achieve the Goals in close cooperation with \nall stakeholders, including civil society and \ninternational development partners such as the United \nNations and its agencies, the Commonwealth, the \nPacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the South Pacific \nCommunity.  \n The MDGs have been incorporated into our \nMedium-Term Development Strategy, which focuses \non 15 national targets and 67 indicators under the \nNational Road Map. They are specifically designed for \nPapua New Guinea to reflect the nation\u2019s stage of \ndevelopment. MDG 8 is ongoing through international \ncooperation with bilateral and multilateral development \npartners. \n The Joint MDGs Project was launched in August \n2008 and comprises the National MDGs Steering \nCommittee, made up of representatives of the \nGovernment, the United Nations, academia and civil \nsociety. The Project is mandated to build national \nawareness and facilitate a strong data collection and \nanalysis regime in the country. The Project also serves \nas a constituency for the Medium-Term Development \nStrategy and the MDGs. \n The Government has localized the Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness by reaffirming its \nprinciples in the Kavieng Declaration to foster \ncollaborative commitments with our development \npartners in pursuing the achievement of the MDGs. \nOur long-term aim is to grow our economy to such a \nlevel as to allow us to exit from our dependency on aid. \nWe want to be economically independent; we choose \nnot to be aid-dependent forever. We want to give aid \nand not receive it. Our aim is also to assist others from \nthe richness of God\u2019s blessings on us. \n The Government recognizes that greater and \nsustained commitment to implement policies at all \nlevels is needed to achieve the MDGs. That \ncommitment will also be supported by ongoing public \nsector reforms, especially in relation to delivery of \nbasic services to our rural majority.  \n For the MDGs to be achieved, strong and viable \npartnerships must exist.  \n MDG 8 is critical to the achievement of the other \nseven Goals. However, all our partnerships must be \nunderpinned by mutual respect between the partners \nand the Government. Some of our key partners include \nAustralia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan, \nChina, the United States, Italy and Austria, along with \nmany non-governmental organizations, such as the \nClinton Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates \nFoundation, which continue to strongly contribute to \nPapua New Guinea\u2019s development. \n Climate change has emerged as one of the \ngreatest crises now facing humanity. The consequences \nappear dire, and they are truly global. Such a global \nchallenge can only be met by a concerted global \nresponse. \n In Papua New Guinea today, we see evidence of \nclimate change in the inundation of coastal areas, an \nincrease in malaria due to warming in the highlands \nregion of the country, and especially in the plight of the \npeople of the Carteret Islands, where sea level has risen \nand some 1,200 people have had to be resettled. \n We therefore strongly support the recent Alliance \nof Small Island States declaration on climate change. \nFor many small island States to survive, we must strive \nto roll back atmospheric carbon concentrations to less \nthan 350 parts per million and limit temperature rise to \nless than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Therefore, emissions of \ngreenhouse gases must peak by 2015 and be followed \n \n \n7 09-53165 \n \nby reductions of 45 per cent by 2020 and 90 per cent \nbefore 2050. Further, we will require healthy and \nexpanded forest cover and widely available low carbon \ntechnologies, including carbon capture and storage. \n In this context, the importance and urgency of \nextensive action on reducing emissions from \ndeforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) can \nhardly be overstated, and many delegations have \nspoken on it. Deforestation continues at an alarming \npace, with around 13 million hectares of the world\u2019s \nforests being lost annually \u2014 an area the size of \nDenmark, Norway and Belgium combined. \n The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) estimates that deforestation and degradation in \ndeveloping countries may contribute to approximately \n20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions caused \nby humans, while also representing around 30 per cent \nof the total cost-effective mitigation potential in the \nperiod up to 2020. Any solution to the problem should \nthus attract 20 per cent of any financial or institutional \nresponse. \n It is worth stressing that, without rapid and \nsignificant reductions in emissions from deforestation \nand forest degradation in developing countries, added \nto deep emissions reductions by rich countries, it may \nbe impossible to avoid global warming levels that will \nprove catastrophic for many vulnerable nations. \nWithout question, immediate action on REDD+ is a \ncrucial part of the climate change solution. Under the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, we will therefore require strong institutional \nframeworks for REDD+, including accommodating \ndifferent national circumstances and providing for \nresource mobilization. \n We also recognize the excellent work and \nanalysis under way via the Informal Working Group on \nInterim Finance for REDD. This work estimates that, if \na total of \u20ac15 to \u20ac25 billion were provided to catalyse \nearly action from 2010 to 2015, then a 25 per cent \nreduction in annual global deforestation rates may be \nachieved by around 2015. \n Deforestation and degradation in developing \ncountries are the results of the stark economic need for \nlocal communities to survive that propels the \ndestruction of forests. How do we keep the trees \nstanding to sequester carbon? \n There is hope. Significantly, early actions for \nREDD+ can be achieved at a reasonable cost, while \nprotecting the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and \nlocal communities, protecting biodiversity, rainfall \npatterns and soil quality, and helping countries to adapt \nto climate change. To succeed, a REDD+ mechanism \nshould accommodate countries at different levels of \ndevelopment through a phased approach. The \nagreement should be results-based and incentives-\ndriven. To achieve that, it must include both a reliable \nframework for monitoring, reporting and verification, \nand encourage a predictable and sustainable system for \nfinancing. \n We must succeed in Copenhagen. If we are to \nsucceed, rich countries must come forward and take the \nlead. Without their collective leadership on emissions \nreductions, finance and technology, the Governments \nof developing countries will not be able to make a \ncompelling case at home to get people to allow trees to \nbe left standing. As a result, 20 per cent of carbon \nemissions will continue to flow into the atmosphere. \nTherefore, let me be candid. Without a transformative \ngrand financial bargain in Copenhagen that involves all \nnations, there could be no deal. \n Let me conclude by repeating that the United \nNations is the forum for agreeing on solutions for \nproblems and challenges. In times of global crises such \nas climate change, financial meltdown and social \nsector vulnerabilities, there is also opportunity. Indeed, \nthere is opportunity here, if we remember that MDG 8 \nallows us to leverage the greatest asset we have: strong \npartnerships between nations, both rich and poor. \n More than ever before, we need the political will \nof the leading developed and developing countries, for \nthe sake of the children of the world and for \ngenerations after them. I ask the General Assembly to \nplease consider this and make a stroke for history."

        "file_text": "It is indeed an honour and a \npleasure for me to extend my very warm \ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \nwell-deserved election to the presidency at the sixty-\nfourth session of the General Assembly. I hope that \nduring his presidency he will help advance the \nrevitalization of the General Assembly, reinforce \nmultilateralism and promote dialogue among \ncivilizations. I promise Mr. Treki my personal \ncooperation as well as that of the Tanzanian delegation \nin the discharge of his responsibilities. \n Allow me also to use this opportunity to pay \ntribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Father \nMiguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for a job very well done. \nI thank him for the honour he recently bestowed upon \nthe late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the founder President \nand Father of the Tanzanian nation. \n Our deep appreciation also goes to our illustrious \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his diligent \nservice to the United Nations and to humankind. His \nexemplary leadership and commitment to action in \naddressing the global challenges we are facing are \nappreciated by many of us. We wish him and his entire \nteam great success in the future. \n For over five years now, a number of countries in \nEastern Africa, including Tanzania, have been \nexperiencing unprecedented drought. We have never \nseen anything like this before. Maybe the effects of \nclimate change are taking a toll. As a result of this, \nagricultural production has been affected severely \ncausing acute food shortages. There is an acute \nshortage of pasture and water for our livestock and \nwildlife in the game parks that is resulting in the deaths \nof many of our animals. Rivers have been drying up \nfrequently thus causing interruptions in hydropower \ngeneration.  \n The effects of the drought are threatening to \nreach catastrophic proportions if the shortage of rain \ncontinues for the next few years. It is important for the \nUnited Nations to be aware of this growing danger and \nto look into ways of assisting us. We should not wait to \nact until graphic pictures of emaciated and dying \nchildren dominate TV screens and newspapers. \n History has taught us that the greatest successes \nin the development of nations began with agriculture. \nNo doubt, therefore, the low levels of development in \nAfrica today are indicative of the underdevelopment of \nour agriculture. Indeed, African agriculture is \nbackward and productivity is low. It needs to be \ntransformed, it needs to be modernized. The African \ngreen revolution has taken too long to happen. \n Concerted efforts by African Governments and \nAfrica\u2019s development partners are required. \nUnfortunately, there is not as much interest on the part \nof our development partners to support agricultural \ntransformation in Africa as there is for other sectors. \nThis is an unfortunate omission which needs to be \ncorrected. We look to the United Nations to take the \nlead in this regard. \n Allow me to pay tribute to President Barack \nObama for demonstrating keen interest in assisting the \ntransformation and modernization of Africa\u2019s \nagriculture. African leaders were humbled by his \ncommitment at the meeting he held with leaders from \nsub-Saharan Africa on 22 September of this year. I \nappeal to other leaders to emulate his example. \n Another issue that I would like to raise for \ndiscussion and action is the problem of youth \nunemployment in Africa. Africa faces one of the \nbiggest unemployment challenges on the planet. \nAfrican youth make up 37 per cent of the working age \npopulation in Africa, but they are 60 per cent of the \n  \n \n09-52425 18 \n \nunemployed. In some nations youth unemployment is \nup to 80 per cent. Africa has the fastest-growing and \nmost youthful population in the world. Over 20 per \ncent of Africa\u2019s population is between the ages of 15 \nand 24. As a result, a constantly rising number of \nyoung Africans has been entering, and will continue to \nenter, a labour market that has not been fast-growing. \n Beyond economic costs, high rates of youth \nunemployment have had negative consequences in our \ncontinent. We have seen how some youths with no job \nprospects, and little hope of getting any, have become \nthe fuel being added to the raging fires of conflict in \nmany parts of our continent. They simply fall prey to \nthe machinations of war lords, criminal gangs and \npolitical manipulators, to the detriment of peace and \nstability in their countries. \n Creating job opportunities for Africa\u2019s youth is an \nenormous task that Governments of our poor \neconomies cannot carry out alone. Friends of Africa in \nthe international community, both from Government \nand the private sector, have an important role to play in \nthat regard. Allow me to commend the Danish \nGovernment for showing the way. In April 2008, it \nformed the Danish Commission for Africa to address \nyouth unemployment challenges on the continent. The \nCommission, on which I was fortunate to serve, came \nup with five bold initiatives that I believe, if strong \ninternational partnership can be forged to implement \nthem, can turn the large youth unemployment problem \nfrom a challenge into an opportunity. I humbly ask this \nbody for the opportunity for the Commission\u2019s report \nto be presented to the General Assembly. At the same \ntime, I propose that the Assembly consider declaring a \ndecade to focus on youth employment in Africa, \npossibly 2011 to 2020.  \n Two days ago, we held the fruitful high-level \nClimate Change Summit. I would like to thank \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and commend him for \nhis leadership on this important and challenging issue \nof our time. The event will go a long way towards \npaving the way for a comprehensive agreement in \nCopenhagen in December 2009. \n It was heart-warming indeed to hear President \nBarack Obama assure this world body that the United \nStates will join other nations in the joint endeavour to \nsave our common planet. We are also happy that, under \nthe leadership of Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the \nUnited Kingdom, consensus has been emerging on \nmaking additional resources available to assist \ndeveloping nations in their efforts at adaptation, \nmitigation and the pursuit of clean development. \n Allow me now to talk about three side events that \nhave taken place during this session of the General \nAssembly. \n The first one was the panel discussion on \naccelerating the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which was organized by \nMs. Helen Clark, the new Administrator of the United \nNations Development Programme, together with \nMr. Douglas Alexander, the United Kingdom\u2019s Secretary \nfor International Development. At that meeting, \nimportant impressions were made about successes and \nshortcomings with regard to the implementation of the \nMDGs to date. The meeting was a curtain-raiser for \nnext year\u2019s MDG summit. I hope all of us will take \nseriously the observations and conclusions that were \nmade, so that there will be no default come 2015. \n The second was the meeting on maternal and \nchild health convened by Prime Minister Gordon \nBrown with the support of Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon and World Bank President Robert Zoellick. \nThe meeting was a great success. I was impressed and \nencouraged by the commitment made by Prime \nMinister Brown and by the support of the World Bank \nto save the lives of millions of innocent mothers and \nchildren who die of causes that can be prevented. \nWhile I applaud and thank Prime Minister Brown for \nhis leadership, I appeal for unqualified support for the \noutcome of the meeting, for the sake of saving the lives \nof many women and children in Africa and elsewhere \nin the developing world. \n The third was yesterday\u2019s launch of the African \nLeaders Malaria Alliance. That was a landmark event \nat which African leaders made an unequivocal \ndeclaration of commitment to end malaria in their \nrespective countries. The Alliance provides the \nmechanism for advocacy, collective action and follow-\nup on measures to build capacities to eliminate the \nnumber one killer disease in Africa. Malaria can be \nprevented, cured, controlled and eliminated in Africa. \nMany countries in the world have done so; why not us \nin Africa? I would like the General Assembly to \nacknowledge that historic event and render support to \nthe work of the African Leaders Alliance against \nmalaria. Once again, I would like to thank Mr. Ray \nChambers, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy for \n \n \n19 09-52425 \n \nMalaria, for successfully organizing that event. I would \nalso like to thank all African leaders for their support \nand commitment. \n The gains made in the area of development can \neasily be eroded if the foundations of peace and \nstability are threatened. It is a matter of great comfort \nand pride that peace reigns in most parts of Africa, \nexcept for one or two hot spots \u2014 Somalia in \nparticular and, to some extent, Darfur. There is calm in \nthe eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo. Burundi is enjoying peace after many years of \ncivil war and instability, which has facilitated the \nreturn of many Burundi refugees from Tanzania. \nHowever, there are more than 160,000 Burundi \nrefugees who have chosen to remain in Tanzania and \nare applying to become Tanzanian citizens.  \n We have in principle accepted their request and \nare now finalizing the procedures to grant them \ncitizenship. However, I want this body to know that my \nGovernment has decided that, if accepted, they will be \nmoved from the refugee camps in which they reside at \nthe moment and will be resettled in various places in \nthe country. We do not want them to remain with the \nrefugee mentality. We also do not want Tanzanians to \ncontinue to consider them refugees. That is going to be \na very expensive exercise for which the support of the \nUnited Nations and other friends will be necessary. \n Tanzania remains committed to contribute to \npeace in Africa and the world. I promise that we will \ncontinue to play that historic role to the best of our \nability. In that regard, we are making good progress on \nour promise to scale up our participation in United \nNations peacekeeping operations. We have \npeacekeepers in the United Nations mission in \nLebanon, and we are ready to increase their number. \nWe are also in the final preparations of deploying a \nbattalion of peacekeepers in Darfur. We are going to \nhonour the request made by the United Nations to work \nwith the United Nations Organization Mission in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in the \ntraining of the armed forces of that country, under the \nMission\u2019s security sector reforms for the country. My \nmessage today is that we are ready to do more \nwhenever requested. \n Let me add my voice in support of the two-State \nsolution for an Israel and a Palestine living together \nside by side at peace with one another. Tanzania is of \nthe strong opinion that that is the best way to \nsustainable peace in the Middle East.  \n With regard to Western Sahara, we call upon the \nSecurity Council to expedite the process of giving the \npeople of Western Sahara the opportunity to decide on \ntheir future status. That matter has dragged on for too \nlong, namely, since 1975. The time has come to end the \nimpasse. \n I would like to reiterate that the reform of the \nUnited Nations will be incomplete without the \nstructural reform of the Security Council. That reform \nshould include Africa\u2019s attainment of two permanent \nseats in the Council. Giving seats to Africa is not a \nmatter of favour; it is a matter of correcting the \nhistorical injustice against the continent and its people. \n Let me conclude by echoing Africa\u2019s appeal to \nthe United Nations and the international community to \nsupport Africa\u2019s position with regard to unconstitutional \nchanges of Government in Africa. In recent years, the \nghosts of unconstitutional changes of Government have \nagain haunted Africa \u2014 through military coups and \nso-called mass action instigated by insatiable \ndemagogic politicians. There are people who want to \nget into leadership by using undemocratic shortcuts. \nThe African Union has taken a strong position, which \nis enshrined in its Constitutive Act, not to recognize \nsuch Governments and to suspend them from \nmembership of the organization until democracy is \nrestored.  \n Such decisions of the African Union would \nbenefit so much from, and actually would be \nstrengthened by, the support of the international \ncommunity and in particular the United Nations. Africa \nhas young polities, and its democracy is still fragile. \nWhat the African Union is trying to do is to entrench a \nculture of democratic values and governance. The \nsupport of the United Nations and the international \ncommunity is very critical in that regard. A decision to \nthe contrary would undermine the African Union\u2019s \ngood intentions. Africa needs the United Nations to \nsupport that historic position."

        "file_text": "I extend our warm \ngreetings to the President and to this Assembly. I \ncongratulate him on his election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at this sixty-fourth session. I pay \ntribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for presiding over the sixty-third \nsession with great sensitivity and for bringing a human \nface to our work. \n The sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly \nwill address important contemporary issues of interest \nto all Member nations. Such issues include seeking out \neffective responses to global crises and strengthening \nmultilateralism and dialogue on international peace, \nsecurity and development. Those issues are indeed of \ncritical importance to my own country, a small island \ndeveloping State that has been enriched by its \nmembership of and participation in the United Nations. \n Fiji and its people, like all small developing \nisland States, are among the first victims of \ncontemporary global crises, such as the financial and \neconomic crisis, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and, most \ndramatic of all, the phenomenon of climate change. In \nsmall economies like ours, those global events have a \nvery real effect on the daily livelihoods of our people. \nFor our part, we have attempted to respond to some of \nthose crises by making policy changes and \nadjustments, encouraging our people to grow their own \nfood and discouraging food imports wherever possible. \nOver the past two years, the size of our public service \nhas been rationalized. We have maintained a very \nstreamlined Cabinet structure and significantly \ncontrolled Government operational costs. \n There have been critics of the events in Fiji since \nDecember 2006, when the military, with great \nreluctance, was forced to remove the then Government \nof Fiji. I believe that these critics are largely unaware \nof the extent to which politicians, in league with those \nwho employ terror as a tactic to push racial supremacy \nand a corrupt agenda, had become a threat to the safety \nand security of our people. Terrorism has become a \nglobal issue and it impacts Fiji as well. We are fully \ncooperating in the international effort to control and \ncontain this scourge. \n Next year on 10 October, Fiji will celebrate the \nfortieth year of its independence and the fortieth \nanniversary of its membership in the United Nations. \nWe embraced our independence full of enthusiasm, \nexcited by the prospect of deciding our own future and \nbelieving that our community as a whole would work \n \n \n5 09-52592 \n \ntogether to achieve a better life for all of our people. \nOur path has not been smooth or easy. \n The President of Fiji abrogated the Constitution \non 10 April this year. He took this step when a Court of \nAppeal ruling created a legal vacuum \u2014 a \nconstitutional anomaly which would have also \nprevented implementation of the reforms which were \nmandated by him in order to achieve a truly democratic \nState. \n On 1 July of this year, I announced a road map to \nlead Fiji to a new constitution and elections based on \nequality, equal suffrage, human rights, justice, \ntransparency, modernity and true democratic ideals. \nMy Government and I were mandated to carry out and \nto continue the reforms, which will ensure that true, \ndemocratic, non-communal and equal suffrage-based \nelections for parliamentary representation will be held \nby September 2014. A road map to implement this \nmandate was announced on 1 July of this year. \n Together with stringent steps to protect our \neconomy from the effects of the world economic crisis, \nwork will commence on a new constitution by \nSeptember 2012. The basis for the new constitution \nwill be the ideals and principles formulated by the \nPeople\u2019s Charter for Change and Progress, a document \nprepared following widespread consultations with and \ninput from the people of Fiji. The People\u2019s Charter was \nadopted by the President after the endorsement of the \nmajority of the people of Fiji.  \n Work on the new constitution will involve \nconsultations with all the ordinary citizens of our \ncountry, as well as with civil society. Consultations \nwill focus on issues such as the size of the new \nparliament, the sustainability of a bicameral system, \nthe terms of office of Government, and systems of \naccountability of Government to the people. The new \nconstitution will implement reforms and the results of \nextensive consultations and will be in place by \nSeptember 2013. This will give the people of Fiji a \nyear to become familiar with its provisions before the \nelections take place in September 2014. \n There have been critics of this timeline. These \ncritics have asked why work on the new constitution \nwill not commence before September 2012. The \nanswer is very simple, at least to those who know and \nunderstand Fiji\u2019s history. Fiji has a colonial history that \nhas created many anomalies and inequalities and whose \nlegacy resonates today. Consequently and due also to \nthe politicians, our post-colonial period has been \npunctuated by political instability. On each occasion \nthat a new Government has been voted into power, the \nold elite which benefited financially from the previous \nestablished Government has been able to successfully \ndestabilize the Government and to replace it with its \nown supporters and representatives. This was possible \nonly because those institutions of the State that were \nsupposed to protect democracy and democratic values \ninstead colluded with the elite to destabilize and \nreplace the new Government.  \n And that is not all. Fiji has suffered more than \n20 years of mismanagement, corruption and nepotism. \nOur infrastructure, our judicial system and our systems \nof accountability have all remained underdeveloped \nand unproductive. Many of our finest brains have left \nthe country because they could see no future in a \ncountry governed by ethno-nationalism, corruption and \ngreed. In order to ensure that democracy has a real \nchance of survival in Fiji\u2019s future, serious and \nprincipled reforms must be implemented to build roads, \ninstitutions and values. \n Together with infrastructure, the hearts and minds \nof our people must adopt and cherish true democracy. \nThe way of the old elite must never triumph again. \nThere must be reforms before elections to ensure that \ndemocracy is sustainable for Fiji\u2019s long-term future. \nThe people of Fiji deserve better than the short-term \nband-aid solutions we have experienced over the past \ndecades. \n I ask for patience and understanding, particularly \nfrom our neighbours, who have shown a surprising lack \nof understanding and disregard of the peculiar situation \nwhich our country has experienced since independence. \nPut another way, there is an almost blind faith that \nonce independence has been granted to those who were \nunder colonial rule and the machinery of democracy \nbegins to work, the country concerned will enjoy \nsmooth sailing. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. I invite the international community to engage \nwith us, to visit our country to see the situation, and to \nprovide practical support and assistance to enable us to \nimplement the reforms. \n History is replete with the struggles of people the \nworld over for self-determination in order to be free \nfrom subjugation and foreign domination. Our own \nexperience should have provided some indication, if \n  \n \n09-52592 6 \n \none is needed, of how difficult it has been for us to \nachieve true, genuine and sustainable democracy. \n Many of the nations represented in this Hall \ntoday have experienced the traumas of nation-building. \nIt would not be out of place to reflect on what \nPresident Obama said during his address to the General \nAssembly on Wednesday, 23 September: \n  \u201cDemocracy cannot be imposed on any \nnation from the outside. Each society must search \nfor its own path, and no path is perfect. Each \ncountry will pursue a path rooted in the culture of \nits people and in its past traditions.\u201d ()  \nWe thoroughly endorse such sentiments. \n Our dream is for equality, for justice and for \nsecurity. Our dream is for dignity and for economic \nwell-being. Our dream is for true democracy. I thank \nthose of our friends who have had continued dialogue \nwith me and my Government and who have helped us \nto achieve what they themselves now take for granted. \nI thank Fiji\u2019s friends for their respect and \nunderstanding even when we agree to differ on some \nissues. If there is to be genuine dialogue at both the \nregional and the international levels, there must be a \nwillingness to listen and to respect a different point of \nview. \n To those nations that have refused to engage with \nFiji and have expressed an unwillingness to enter into \ndialogue, I can only repeat my plea that they change \ntheir stance. Fiji is a small nation. Our people pose no \nthreat to anyone, least of all to the big Powers of the \nSouth Pacific that have arrogated to themselves the \nright to dictate to us our future and the way we govern \nourselves. We respect the right of anyone who \ndisagrees with us to exercise their freedom. However, \nthat does not give them the right to interfere with our \nefforts to build a better country for our people. \n In addition to all of this, they have used their \nextensive diplomatic and financial resources to deny \nFiji the ability to participate in new peacekeeping \noperations. Fiji has participated in peacekeeping \noperations since 1978 and is proud of its association \nwith the United Nations, in particular with the \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations. Indeed, the \nFiji Military Forces, since the beginning of their \nparticipation in peacekeeping, have established a \nreputation for professionalism, skill and rapport with \nthe communities in their areas of operation. \n Fiji has been disappointed by what appears to be \na unilateral decision on the part of the United Nations \nto debar our country from any new peacekeeping \noperations. To this day, we have not been able to \nreceive a clear and satisfactory reply from the \nOrganization on this matter. I express the hope that the \nUnited Nations will deal equitably and fairly with \ntroop-contributing countries. \n Our experiences as a member of the United \nNations, particularly in the area of peacekeeping, will \nbe strengthened and enhanced by our People\u2019s Charter \nand the road map to the elections. Those documents \naptly demonstrate the positive values of genuine \ndialogue and engagement. We believe that, if we are to \nachieve genuine peace, security and development in \nour country, we must build on a foundation of patience \nand respect for all views. \n Like most small island nations, Fiji regards the \nthreat posed by climate change as one that will \nundermine international peace and security. The lives \nof real people from real places are at stake. The future \nsurvival of real generations, the continuation of real \ncultures and the security of belonging to a real \nhomeland are being threatened. \n The adverse impacts of climate change will be \npolitically blind; its devastating effects on humanity \nwill far outweigh any ideology or system of belief \ndevised by man. The potential casualties resulting from \nits impacts could be far greater than those caused by \nany of the battles we have ever fought. Yet the ability \nto reverse its onslaught is well within our collective \ncontrol. \n Fiji is thankful to the general membership of the \nAssembly for adopting, at its previous session, a \nresolution promoted by small island developing States \nlinking the threat of climate change to security. Some \nof Fiji\u2019s closest neighbours live on the lowest-lying \natolls in the world. The rise in sea level brought about \nby climate change threatens literally to drown them. \nWhy should they be forced to abandon their homeland \nfor no fault of their own? All human beings have the \nright to live in their ancestral homeland, if they so \nchoose. \n It is vital to understand that no measure of \nfinancial assistance can resurrect what has submerged, \ngenerate rain to end drought, reverse the effects of \nnatural disasters or replace what has been lost as a \nresult of climate change. No small island State can \n \n \n7 09-52592 \n \nsurvive the future by merely mitigating the impacts of \nclimate change. Adaptation and mitigation are not \nenough. We can halt the impact of climate change and \nensure the survival of island States only by \nsignificantly reducing carbon emissions. \n It is on the basis of that premise that Fiji, as one \nof the States that are more vulnerable to the impacts of \nclimate change, calls on all nations \u2014 in particular the \nmajor emitters \u2014 to be responsible and commit \nthemselves to the carbon emission reduction targets of \napproximately 45 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 \nand 85 per cent by 2050, with a global atmosphere \nconcentration of less than 350 parts per million; and, \nfurther, to limit temperature increases to less than \n1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level by \n2020. I wish to emphasize that, realistically, that is the \nminimum reduction level that will allow us to address \nthe devastating impacts of climate change that we \ncurrently face. \n To fail to meet those targets would be to make the \nprobability of risk astoundingly high for the most \nvulnerable. To negotiate on those targets would mean \nnegotiating on the lives of millions. The inequity that \nexists in terms of the extent of our vulnerabilities and \nabilities to meet mitigating costs vis-\u00e0-vis our \ncontributions to climate change has divided our views \nand weakened our collective strength to deal with this \nglobal issue. Those inequitable circumstances are \nfurther complicated by the conflicting political and \neconomic interests of States. Understandably, decisions \nand positions are based on national self-interests, \nwhich, in most cases, take priority over the principles \nof equity and responsibility. \n Those are the differences that have given rise to \nthe challenges that we currently face as an international \ncommunity in arriving at a binding international \nagreement that responds to the current most \nfundamental need of the world: its survival. \n Fiji hopes that political goodwill and compromise \nwill be found on the road to Copenhagen and that the \nnecessary platform will soon be found for a fair, \neffective and ambitious climate change regime that \nensures significant reductions in carbon emissions and \nthe creation of a financial regime that supports the \nadaptation and mitigation needs of every country, \nparticularly the most vulnerable ones. \n My Government is committed to upholding the \nprinciples and values enshrined in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and other United Nations conventions. We are \nresolutely committed to the elimination of all policies \nand laws that are inconsistent with our international \nobligations. We wish to create a new and brighter \nfuture for our people based on equality, dignity and \nrespect. \n We seek the understanding of the General \nAssembly and the community of nations, as well as \ntheir support in fulfilling our dreams."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President \nof the General Assembly. I assure you of our full \nsupport in your important functions. \n As many colleagues have already underlined, the \ninternational climate negotiations are at a crucial stage. \nThe Copenhagen Conference is a real possibility for \nchange. We need political determination and solidarity \nto reach a new climate agreement that is global, \neffective and fair. The responsibility lies with all of \nus \u2014 industrial countries, emerging economies and \ndeveloping countries alike \u2014 to take the decisions that \nwill so profoundly shape the future of humankind. \n I thank the Secretary-General for convening the \nSummit on Climate Change at the beginning of the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly. We had a \ngood discussion on issues that still need to be \naddressed before December. The meeting delivered a \nclear message that we are committed to working hard \nto seal the deal. \n A global climate agreement is a precondition for \ncomprehensive sustainable development. The poorest \nare the most vulnerable when struggling with the \nadverse effects of climate change. The new agreement \nmust include elements of solidarity and international \nsupport in coping with the needs of adaptation. Climate \nchange will affect especially seriously the lives and \nlivelihoods of women, but women are also powerful \nactors in combating it. We need to ensure their full \nparticipation in the negotiations and in the \nimplementation of the new agreement. \n Gender, food production and climate change are \nall interlinked. We know that 70 per cent of the world\u2019s \npoor are women and girls. We also know that the \n \n \n45 09-52425 \n \nmajority of agricultural labourers are women. If we \nreally want to combat climate change and avoid a \nglobal food crisis, we need to pay close attention to the \nrole of women, especially in least developed countries. \n While the negative consequences of climate \nchange are universal, their impact on small island \ndeveloping States and countries with low-lying coastal \nareas is particularly grave. Those countries are \nthreatened by the rise of sea levels and by extreme \nweather conditions. They need particular attention and \nassistance. \n In September 2000, we committed ourselves here \nto a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty \nand to reach the Millennium Development Goals. We \nreiterated that pledge at the 2005 World Summit. Now, \nin 2009, we have to demonstrate our resolve to live up \nto that commitment when faced with a contracting \nworld economy as well.  \n The solution of the current financial and \neconomic crisis should be based on the concept of fair \nglobalization. Our action, while striving to achieve \nsustainable economic growth, must address the goal of \ndecent work for all. It is really essential that we honour \nour commitments to development in spite of our budget \nconstraints. \n In the world economy, the tectonic plates are in \nmotion and new actors are emerging. We need to \ndevelop a new global consensus on business ethics, \nintegrity and sustainable economic growth. We must \nwork together so that trust in international financial \ninstitutions can be re-established. Let us make them \nmore transparent, accountable and sustainable. \n I sincerely hope that the Pittsburgh summit of the \nGroup of 20 will agree on further measures for global \nrecovery. But we should also make full use of the \nUnited Nations to promote inclusive and equitable \ncooperation on issues that are truly global. \n While climate change and the global economic \ndownturn cause problems in many parts of the world, \nAfrica is the continent that suffers the most. The \ninternational community must remain attentive to \nAfrica\u2019s needs. I am glad to note that positive \ndevelopments have also taken place in Africa. During \nthis decade, the number of conflicts in Africa has \ndecreased. The African Union is committed to \nstrengthening the organization\u2019s capacity in conflict \nprevention. Finland is contributing to that important \neffort by supporting the build-up of the peace \nmediation structures of the African Union. \n The latest developments in the Middle East peace \nprocess provide a reason for cautious optimism. It \nseems that the parties are willing to take some steps. \nCountries outside the region are committed to \nsupporting those efforts. It is my belief that, with that \nbroadening consensus, we can reactivate the peace \nprocess soon. \n Finland values highly the United Nations Charter \nand the central role given to the Security Council. We \nactively participate in efforts to make that body more \nrepresentative and efficient. Finland is a candidate to \nbecome a non-permanent member of the Security \nCouncil for the period 2013 to 2014. At the same time, \nwe hope that progress on the Council\u2019s reform can be \nmade during this session of the General Assembly. \n Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and \n1820 (2008) on women, peace and security were \nimportant achievements. Their implementation in all \ncountries and in all situations is urgently needed. The \ninternational colloquium on women\u2019s empowerment, \nleadership development and international peace and \nsecurity, which was held last March in Monrovia, \nadopted a call to action on resolution 1325 (2000) and \na call for action on gender and climate change. As a \nfollow-up to the colloquium, Finland and Liberia \nconvened a side event today here at the United \nNations. In a word, it was a success. I hope that the \nnext success will be in Copenhagen, and that women \nwill make a contribution to it.  \n Security Council resolution 1820 (2008) strongly \ncondemns sexual violence in conflicts. We must treat \nsystematic rape as a forbidden weapon of war. Victims \nof rape and sexual abuse must have access to legal \nprocesses, and rapists must be prosecuted and \ncondemned. In our view, the appointment of a special \nrepresentative of the Secretary-General on women and \narmed conflict would enhance the implementation of \nthose resolutions. We hope that all Member States will \nsupport that proposal. I want to thank Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for bringing up the question of \nviolence against women in his opening address to the \nGeneral Assembly yesterday. \n Civilian populations need protection in conflict \nsituations. At the United Nations World Summit in \n2005, the responsibility to protect was accepted as a \ngeneral principle applicable to genocide, crimes against \n  \n \n09-52425 46 \n \nhumanity, ethnic cleansing and war crimes. Further \nefforts are urgently needed to save civilians from \nviolence. \n This morning, the Security Council held a debate \non nuclear security issues. I am sure that we are all \npleased that disarmament is now strongly returning to \nthe international agenda. I sincerely hope that that will \nlead to real progress. \n Finally, I would like to underline that we have to \ntry to find things that unite us \u2014 and not things that \ndivide us \u2014 if we want to be midwives of the future \nand not guardians of the past. Lasting peace can be \nbuilt only through open dialogue between cultural and \nreligious communities, in our countries and worldwide. \nFinland supports all initiatives, such as the Alliance of \nCivilizations, to stimulate intercultural communication. \nI wish those efforts the best of success in promoting \nmutual understanding and peace. I promise that Finland \nwill support them."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate \nMr. Treki on his election to the high post of President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and \nwish him every success as he presides over the session.  \n Eight years ago, on 11 September, Ms. Zhannetta \nTsoy, a citizen of Kazakhstan, having kissed her \ndaughter and husband, left for her first day at a new job \nin New York\u2019s tallest building. Two hours later, she \nperished, along with 3,000 Americans and citizens of \nother 91 countries. She was buried under the debris of \nwhat had once been the World Trade Centre\u2019s Twin \nTowers. On that day, as Kazakhstan\u2019s ambassador in \nWashington D.C., along with all Americans and others, \nI felt acutely how fragile, vulnerable and \ninterdependent our world had become. This terrorist act \nand the world\u2019s unity in its strict condemnation showed \nthat only together can we make our present and our \nfuture safer and better. Indeed, the key to the \nsuccessful resolution of today\u2019s most acute problems \nlies precisely in the world\u2019s unity and understanding. \n President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan \nand our entire people have supported the global fight \nagainst terrorism from the start by assisting the efforts \nof the international coalition in Afghanistan. However, \nthere has never been and there will never be a purely \nmilitary solution to the Afghan problem. We note with \nsatisfaction that coalition members have begun to pay \nmore attention to non-military aspects of security. \n To the best of its ability, Kazakhstan is also \nassisting the international efforts to rehabilitate \nAfghanistan. We provide considerable humanitarian aid \nto that country. Moreover, we are developing a long-\nterm educational programme to train qualified Afghan \n \n \n53 09-52470 \n \nspecialists, and are also considering other forms of \nassistance to that country. \n Long-term stability in Afghanistan is impossible \nwithout effective measures to tackle illicit drug \ntrafficking. The Central Asia Regional Information and \nCoordination Centre has been established in Almaty, \nwith the support of the United Nations, to fight illicit \ndrug trafficking. As the Chairperson-in-Office of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE) in 2010, I intend to make the stabilization of \nthe situation in Afghanistan \u2014 a regional neighbour of \nthe OSCE \u2014 one of the organization\u2019s greatest \npriorities. \n The prospect of the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons, along with the risk of their acquisition and \nuse by terrorist organizations, remains one of the most \nserious threats to mankind. As a country that has \nexperienced the horrors of nuclear tests, shut down the \nworld\u2019s second-largest nuclear testing site, at \nSemipalatinsk, and voluntarily renounced the world\u2019s \nfourth-largest nuclear and missile arsenal, Kazakhstan \nhas an absolute moral right to call for more decisive \naction in the area of disarmament and for the radical \nstrengthening of the non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction regime. In particular, Kazakhstan \ndeems it important to ensure the soonest possible entry \ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \nTreaty. We welcome the efforts of United States \nPresident Barack Obama to give new impetus to the \nnon-proliferation process and to eliminate the nuclear \nthreat. \n Kazakhstan is in favour of strengthening and \nensuring the universality of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We must \nrecognize that the Treaty is asymmetric in that it \nprovides for sanctions only against non-nuclear-\nweapon States, whereas the nuclear Powers themselves \nshould set the example of reducing and renouncing \ntheir nuclear arsenals. In this regard, Kazakhstan \nwelcomed the unanimous adoption yesterday of \nSecurity Council resolution 1887 (2009) and believes \nthat this historic decision opens a new era in \nhumankind\u2019s efforts to create a world without nuclear \nweapons. It is gratifying that the measures being \nundertaken today by the international community \nreflects the principled position that President \nNazarbayev has expressed more than once from this \nrostrum and in bilateral meetings with heads of \nnuclear-weapon States and of States with nuclear \nambitions. \n It is necessary now more than ever to take even \nmore decisive actions. Our President has proposed the \ndevelopment of a new universal treaty on \ncomprehensive horizontal and vertical nuclear \nnon-proliferation. The configuration of the new treaty \nand its contents will largely depend on the proposals of \nall interested States. An effective measure to strengthen \nthe non-proliferation regime could be the establishment \nof an international nuclear fuel bank under the auspices \nof the International Atomic Energy Commission. \nKazakhstan is ready to consider the possibility of \nlocating it on our territory. \n One important contribution made by Kazakhstan \nand other States of Central Asia to the implementation \nof the NPT was the entry into force in March of the \nTreaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central \nAsia. The peculiarity of the Zone is that it is located \nbetween two of the world\u2019s largest nuclear Powers. The \nZone could play a large practical role in preventing the \nuncontrolled proliferation of nuclear materials and in \ncountering nuclear terrorism. We count on support for \nthe Central Asian Zone, above all from the nuclear \nPowers, including their possible extension of negative \nsecurity guarantees. We support the United States of \nAmerica\u2019s initiative to convene a global nuclear \nsecurity summit next year. \n I wish to draw the attention of the General \nAssembly to a proposal of the President of Kazakhstan \non declaring 29 August international day for a world \nfree of nuclear weapons. That date has deep symbolical \nmeaning. On that day in 1949, the Soviet Union \nconducted its first nuclear test at the Semipalatinsk test \nsite in Kazakhstan, and on the same day in 1991 the \ntest site was shut down forever by decree of our \nGovernment. We hope that the General Assembly will \nsupport this initiative. \n Today, humankind is experiencing the most \nserious global financial and economic crisis in decades. \nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, \napproximately 50 States have edged to the brink of an \neconomic catastrophe. At the same time, the present \ncrisis was largely inevitable. Unfortunately, the world\u2019s \neconomic development and the great leap forward in \ntechnology over the past 60 years could not solve such \neternal problems as poverty and hunger. The gap \nbetween the rich and the poor continues to grow. More \n  \n \n09-52470 54 \n \nthan a billion people live on less than $1 a day. Despite \nour exceptional achievements in modern science and \nmedicine, almost 10 million children under five die \nevery year of curable diseases. More than 30 million \npeople worldwide live with HIV, while only 3 million \nof those have access to antiretroviral therapy. \n The economic crisis has forced us to rethink and \nrevisit many conceptual approaches that earlier seemed \netched in stone. It has demonstrated once again the \nurgency of unifying all States\u2019 efforts in addressing \nmodern challenges. The leader of our country was \namong the first to share his vision for the world\u2019s post-\ncrisis development. He proposed drafting an \ninternational law on a single world currency, and the \neventual establishment of a world emissions centre, a \nworld anti-monopoly currency committee and a world \ncommittee on market freedom. The United Nations \nwith its structural bodies and specialized agencies is \nthe only global organization capable of addressing such \nlarge-scale issues. \n At a time of acute social and economic \nbreakdowns, the danger of inter-ethnic and \ninter-religious conflicts increases considerably. \nLocated at the confluence of Asia and Europe and \nhaving maintained peace and harmony in a multi-ethnic \nand multireligious country throughout its years of \nindependence, Kazakhstan is ready to act as a bridge of \nmutual understanding and tolerance between the East \nand the West. \n As Chair of the OSCE in 2010 and of the 2011 \nministerial conference of the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference, Kazakhstan is eager fully to use \nthis unique opportunity to strengthen constructive \ncooperation between diverse cultures and civilizations \nand to take concrete measures on this issue. \nFurthermore, since 2003 our country has hosted three \nCongresses of Leaders of World and Traditional \nReligions, supported by the United Nations. \n At Kazakhstan\u2019s initiative, the General Assembly \nadopted resolution 62/90 at its sixty-second session, \ndeclaring 2010 the International Year for the \nRapprochement of Cultures. We call on United Nations \nMember States to participate actively in celebrating the \nYear. Kazakhstan fully supports the goals of the \nAlliance of Civilizations and calls on all Member \nStates and agencies of the United Nations system to \ncontribute to strengthening tolerance and mutual \nunderstanding in the world. \n In the current circumstances, the regional aspect \nof solving global problems takes on added importance. \nOur country is firmly committed to the consistent \nstrengthening of regional cooperation for security and \ndevelopment in Central Asia. A unique security \narchitecture is being created in Eurasia, its most \nimportant elements being organizations such as the \nOSCE, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-\nbuilding Measures in Asia (CICA), the Shanghai \nCooperation Organization, the Collective Security \nTreaty Organization and NATO. In that regard, CICA, \nconvened as a result of an initiative introduced by \nPresident Nazarbayev from this rostrum in 1992, has \nbecome an effective mechanism for strengthening \nregional security and cooperation. In 2010, as our \ncountry takes up the chairmanship of the OSCE, we \nintend to work for the good of all its member States to \nstrengthen the organization\u2019s effectiveness in \naddressing new challenges and threats, as well as to \nfurther strengthen confidence-building and security \nmeasures in the Euro-Atlantic community. \n In today\u2019s rapidly changing world, the adaptation \nof the United Nations to modern realities is an \nimportant task for all Member States. Kazakhstan \nsupports the reform process for the United Nations and \nits main bodies based on the principled position of the \nneed to increase the effectiveness, authority and \nrelevance of our global Organization. We are \nconvinced that there is no alternative to the United \nNations in the modern world, and there never will be. \nWe support reforms on three principal tracks: \nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, \nreform of the Security Council and coherence of the \nUnited Nations system. \n Fifty years ago, Martin Luther King Junior said: \n \u201cMen often hate each other because they fear \neach other; they fear each other because they do \nnot know each other; they do not know each other \nbecause they cannot communicate; they cannot \ncommunicate because they are separated.\u201d \nRegrettably, those words are often true today, but they \nshould not be so tomorrow. In an age of globalization \nand unprecedented interdependence in the world, there \nshould no longer be mistrust, fear and hatred, but the \nprinciples of trust, understanding and cooperation \nshould triumph. Only together can we properly address \nthe difficult challenges facing humankind today and \nmake our world safer and better."

        "file_text": "I am greatly honoured to \nhave this opportunity to speak in this body on behalf of \nthe people and the Government of Tuvalu, who wish \nme first of all to convey their warmest greetings and \nfelicitations to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. \n At the outset, let me associate myself with \nprevious speakers in extending our special \ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \nelection as President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession, as well as to reassure him of our support \nduring his presidency. I also wish to highly commend \nhis predecessor for his exemplary leadership and \ndedication to the work of the Assembly during his \npresidency over the past year. \n As we begin the sixty-fourth session of the \nAssembly, the effects of the global financial and \neconomic crisis loom over our heads. For a small \nisland economy like Tuvalu\u2019s, which is highly \ndependent on the import of products from overseas, the \nimpact of the global financial and economic crisis has \nbeen severe. The price of basic food items has risen \ndramatically. My people are suffering from events that \nare not of our making. The financial and economic \ncrisis and its impact on development and the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals is \na global crisis that requires the cooperation of all \ncountries. Unfortunately, as is always the case, it will \nbe poor small countries such as Tuvalu that will have \nto bear the burden. \n Globalization has also left its mark in the context \nof swine flu. Tuvalu has not been immune to that \npandemic. We are grateful that the World Health \nOrganization has issued a call to action to help poorer \ncountries respond to the outbreak of swine flu. \nOutbreaks such as this highlight the need for trade \nreforms with respect to access to medicines. In that \ncontext, the right to health and access to affordable \nmedicines should not be a right for rich nations only. \nEvery human being has the right to a healthy life. \n This year is a special one for the people and the \nGovernment of Tuvalu, not because of something that \nwe have achieved and are proud to celebrate but, \nstrangely enough, because of something that has \nhappened for the very first time in the history of my \ncountry and that we strongly condemn. This has to do \nwith the actions of pirates off the coast of Somalia. For \nfour long months, 12 Tuvaluan seafarers were held \ncaptive by Somali pirates aboard a German-registered \nship. Those brave Tuvaluan seamen were subject to \nvarious privations and will suffer the effects of that \nunlawful imprisonment for a long time. \n The international shipping community cannot be \nheld hostage to the demands of such thieves and \ncriminals. This scourge must end. We strongly \ncondemn that inhumane form of organized crime and \nstrongly urge the United Nations and the international \ncommunity to bring the pirates to justice through the \napplication of the principle of universal jurisdiction, as \nwell as to take immediate action to tackle the problem \nhead-on. We also call on the United Nations to \nestablish a special task force to address the issue of \npiracy. \n The year 2009 will hopefully be a watershed in \nthe global fight against climate change. In a few \nmonths, we will meet at Copenhagen to seal the deal \non climate change. As the leader of one of the countries \nof the world most vulnerable to the impacts of climate \nchange, I hold out great faith for that Conference. But \nmy faith will be diminished if key milestones are not \nachieved. Allow me to refer to some of those \nmilestones.  \n First, the international community must commit \nto a rapid course of action to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions so that global temperatures do not increase \nby more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial \nlevels. Anything higher would be disastrous for Tuvalu. \nGlobal emissions must peak by 2015, and decline \ndramatically thereafter. \n Secondly, while we work to develop a new \nclimate change agreement in Copenhagen, we must not \nabandon the Kyoto Protocol, which is a cornerstone of \naction to address climate change. Let me repeat: we \nmust not abandon the Kyoto Protocol. I fear that some \ncountries are hoping that the Kyoto Protocol will \ndisappear so that they can make weaker emissions-\nreduction commitments. I hope that will not happen, as \nit would certainly be a significant step backwards. \n  \n \n09-52586 14 \n \n Thirdly, we need serious commitments from key \ngreenhouse-gas-producing countries. The United States \nmust take a leadership role and drastically reduce its \nemissions. I strongly appeal to President Obama to \ndeliver a significant commitment on emissions \nreductions. We also call on key developing countries to \ndramatically reduce their emissions. Since the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nwas developed, in 1992, the economies of a number of \ndeveloping countries have grown rapidly. They must \nnow contribute their fair share to emissions reductions. \n Fourthly, we need a strong commitment in terms \nof financing and resources to help vulnerable countries \nbuild their resilience to the impacts of climate change. \nThat means that we need a commitment to new money. \nIt would be foolhardy to simply reshuffle existing \noverseas development assistance to support actions to \naddress climate change. This is a new threat, and we \nmust find new money to address it. \n Fifthly, we need to reduce emissions resulting \nfrom deforestation and forest degradation, but in a \ncoherent way. In that regard, carbon markets will not \ndeliver climate change outcomes. We must develop \nnew funds to carefully build the capacity of forested \ndeveloping countries to reduce their deforestation \nrates. Whatever actions we take, we must ensure that \nthe rights of indigenous peoples are properly protected. \n The possible security implications of climate \nchange on the livelihoods and well-being of the most \nvulnerable countries, especially small island \ndeveloping States such as my own country of Tuvalu, \ncannot be ignored. Instead, they should be recognized \nand addressed vigorously by the United Nations as part \nof the collective efforts by all its appropriate subsidiary \nbodies.  \n Despite the concerns expressed by some Member \nStates on the engagement of the Security Council on \nthe issue of the security implications of climate \nchange, I am pleased to note that the Assembly\u2019s \nresolution on the possible security implications of \nclimate change (resolution 63/281), which was initiated \nby Pacific small island developing States more than a \nyear ago, was finally adopted by consensus at a plenary \nmeeting of the Assembly in June of this year. Tuvalu \nlooks forward to the Secretary-General\u2019s report on the \npossible security implications of climate change, as \nrequired under that resolution. \n Globalization has made Tuvalu a very vulnerable \ncountry. It is vulnerable to global economic shocks, \nhighly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and, \nnot least, vulnerable to disease outbreaks. However, \ndespite the wide recognition given and reiterated with \nregard to our vulnerability in many different United \nNations forums, such as the Rio, Barbados, Mauritius \nand Johannesburg conferences and in several major \nUnited Nations events, including the Millennium \nSummit, the General Assembly and the Economic and \nSocial Council have not taken it seriously into \nconsideration when addressing the question of Tuvalu\u2019s \ngraduation from least developed country (LDC) status. \n We strongly believe that Tuvalu\u2019s economic and \nenvironmental vulnerability, like that of any other LDC \nand small island developing State (SIDS), cannot be \ntotally ignored, especially in view of the impact of the \ncurrent economic global crisis. Although we are \npleased to welcome the latest decision of the United \nNations Committee for Development Policy not to \nrecommend Tuvalu for graduation from LDC status for \nthe next three years, we continue to appeal to this \nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and our \ndevelopment partners to carefully reconsider and \nreview the criteria and graduation rules for LDC \ngraduation. We strongly believe that no LDC that is \nrecognized as highly vulnerable should be forced to \nlose its LDC status. \n One of the priority areas highlighted in the \nPresident\u2019s statement at the opening of the sixty-fourth \nsession of the General Assembly is United Nations \nreform and democratization. We could not agree more, \nespecially on the necessity and importance of the \nreform and revitalization of the General Assembly and \nthe Security Council to enable them to fulfil their roles \ncomprehensively. \n We commend the progress of the \nintergovernmental negotiations on the question of \nequitable representation on and increase in the \nmembership of the Security Council and other related \nmatters. We fully recognize the need to restructure and \nexpand the Security Council to reflect a fair and \nbalanced representation of all regions. In this context, \nwe believe that small island developing States should \nbe allocated a seat on the Security Council. \n As a full Member of the Organization, Tuvalu is \nproud to be part of the United Nations family and \nenjoys a sense of ownership through the establishment \n \n \n15 09-52586 \n \nof a long-overdue United Nations joint presence office \nin Tuvalu in May this year. Although we appreciate its \nestablishment, we hope that it will not create another \nlayer of bureaucracy among United Nations \nimplementing agencies, but that it will be more \nresponsive to the aspirations and needs of Tuvalu in a \nmore coherent, efficient and effective manner. More \nimportantly, it is crucial that the office focus on the \nestablishment of more concrete development projects \non the ground for the benefit of the people of Tuvalu \nrather than mostly on enabling activities. \n I am compelled again to draw the attention of \nUnited Nations Member States to the plight of the \npeople and Government of Taiwan. As a proud nation \nof 23 million people, Taiwan must be given the right to \nself-determination \u2014 a principle that must be upheld \nby the United Nations. Taiwan also has all of the \nhallmarks of nationhood. It has a democratic system of \nGovernment and it is certainly a responsible \ninternational player in world trade, development and \ndiplomatic relations; not least, Taiwan has a clearly \ndefined territory. \n Although Tuvalu appreciates the long-overdue \ncourtesy finally accorded to the Government of Taiwan \nto participate as an observer to the World Health \nOrganization\u2019s (WHO) World Health Assembly this \nyear, Tuvalu strongly believes that Taiwan deserves to \nparticipate more fully as a member of WHO and other \nUnited Nations specialized agencies. Tuvalu therefore \nreiterates its strong appeal for Taiwan\u2019s aspirations and \ndesire to participate meaningfully as a full member of \nthe specialized agencies of the United Nations to be \ngiven the proper and urgent attention they deserve. \n In conclusion, my Government acknowledges \nwith full confidence that globalization and its impact in \nevery corner of the globe cannot be denied. This makes \nthe role of the United Nations even more important. \nHowever, we need to conclude the long-overdue \nreforms of the United Nations, especially the Security \nCouncil and the General Assembly, to enable the \nOrganization to deliver its services in a more \ntransparent, coherent, efficient and effective manner. \n We must work together to rebuild the global \neconomy. We must work together to combat climate \nchange, with special recognition given to the plight of \nthe most vulnerable countries, especially the LDCs and \nSIDS. Not least, we must work together to ensure that \neveryone enjoys a healthy life. We will continue to \nsupport the United Nations and sincerely hope that it \nwill not abandon the concerns of a small island country \nlike Tuvalu."

We \nwould also like to thank Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his leadership of the United Nations. \n A little more than three months ago, by changing \nits Government after two decades under the same \npolitical party, El Salvador began a process to expand \nand strengthen its democracy. The new Government \nhas set just a few, but overarching, goals aimed at \nbeginning a process of change that pulls the country \nout of its economic crisis and its social and cultural \nbackwardness while establishing the foundation for the \nfull development of its productive potential, including \nsocial integration and fair distribution of its income, as \nwell as making it possible to achieve peace and \nsecurity, which is our greatest challenge. We have set \nout the major outlines of my Administration in three \nwords: unite, grow and include. \n  \n \n09-52228 24 \n \n First of all, the Government over which I preside \nis not based on a single political party, let alone on a \nsingle faction. It is a Government of national unity \nfocused on two main goals. The first is to put an end to \nthe confrontations, hatred and divisions that have \ndrained a significant amount of vigour from our society \nand fuelled a bloody civil war that has left behind \npainful scars. The second is to put in place the \nfoundation for peaceful and secure coexistence. \n That means that major national decisions will no \nlonger be taken behind closed doors or out of sight of \nthe majority of our people. Every measure, every step \nin El Salvador will be discussed and decided at the \ntable through dialogue. Seated at that table will be \nrepresentatives of the production and labour sectors, as \nwell as of social movements, non-governmental \norganizations, political parties, churches and academia. \nIt is untrue that the demands of administration require \ncurtailing dialogue as the basic instrument of the \ndecision-making process. \n We were able to set up our economic and social \ncouncil in barely 100 days. That body is charged with \nproposing and considering social and economic \npolicies that will allow us to successfully address the \ncrisis we are experiencing. In the same period, we were \nalso able to launch an ambitious low-income housing \nprogramme that is unprecedented in El Salvador\u2019s \nhistory. That programme, which was the result of \nGovernment working with the private sector, will \nproduce 100,000 jobs. Work has already begun in the \nfirst projects.  \n That undertaking, like others in the area of social \nand productive infrastructure, also helps to promote \ntemporary work for young people at risk and to \nimprove the housing and community conditions in the \npoorest areas. It is also part of the comprehensive \nanti-crisis plan that I promised during my campaign, \nwhich we are carrying out through enormous effort. \n Also in less than 100 days, we succeeded in \nexpanding the social safety net and the provision of \nassistance for the poorest families in 100 rural \nmunicipalities. Upon my return to the country, we will \nlaunch the first safety net, involving social and \nemployment services in urban communities \nexperiencing extreme poverty. We are responding \npromptly to the urgent needs of the most excluded, \nimpoverished and neglected groups in our society. I \nshould like to reiterate that all this is being done \nthrough an honest and wide-scale dialogue that \nincludes the entire social spectrum of El Salvador. \n We have resolutely addressed the concerns \nresulting from changes in power. It was once believed \nthat changes in Government would lead to instability \nand uncertainty. The complete opposite happened. We \nhave given legal guarantees and clear examples that the \nnew Government is serious, responsible in managing \nfinances and trustworthy when it comes to both \ndomestic and foreign affairs, including as regards \nmultilateral organizations and friendly countries \nextending assistance to El Salvador. \n In that connection, allow me to thank the \ncountries and groups for that assistance. Their \ngenerosity makes us even more determined to follow \nthe path of responsibility, austerity and anti-corruption \nefforts throughout society and Government. \n My country has open wounds that have an impact \non our daily lives, including on our family, social and \ncultural lives. Those wounds include public safety and \nimmigration, which has taken about 3 million of our \nfellow citizens abroad in search of the work and \nopportunities they have not found in our homeland.  \n I should first like to speak briefly about \ninsecurity. \n As the Assembly is aware, this is not an \nexclusively Salvadoran phenomenon. While it is a \nglobal problem, it is certainly more pronounced in our \nregion. Organized crime, drug trafficking and the \nactivities of violent criminal youth gangs have \ndeveloped in the past decade to become the worst \nthreat to the stability of our countries. The policies that \nhave been implemented jointly and within individual \ncountries have not merely fallen short; they have been \nbut a succession of failures. That means that we must \nincrease our joint efforts while using all the means and \nintelligence at our disposal to confront those scourges. \nWe are faced with a structural phenomenon that \nhampers the full normal functioning of our societies. \n In that regard, I am completely convinced that we \nmust have strong, long-term, decisive and intelligent \npolicies within our countries. However, we will fully \ndefeat crime only if we unite as a single entity that is \ngenuinely determined to defeat organized crime, which \nis a destructive element that undermines institutions \nand saps the creative and productive energies of our \npeoples. \n \n \n25 09-52228 \n \n I have said to my fellow citizens, and I should \nlike to reiterate here, that my Government will do \neverything the law allows to combat crime with \ndetermination and courage. However, this is not a task \nfor a single president or Government; it is also one for \nsociety as a whole. I have therefore called for the \nwidest possible level of participation from all groups \nand people of good will in carrying out what is called \n\u201cthe good fight\u201d, referred to by the Apostle Paul in his \nfirst letter to Timothy \u2014 a good fight against \ninsecurity, fear and hopelessness. That is the great \nchallenge that brings us together, let us make no \nmistake. \n I should like to propose the holding of an \ninternational conference to address these problems in \norder to consider best practices with which to confront \nthat battle together. To that end, we would require the \nlogistical and financial support of both the \nOrganization of American States and the United \nNations. \n The other wound to which I referred is the \nongoing waves of immigration by Salvadoran men and \nwomen that have been taking place for many years. All \nthose who have left have been in their productive \nyears, the most skilled, seeking the work, security and \nwell-being denied them in their own country. With \n3 million Salvadorans abroad, remittances equal about \n18 per cent of our gross national product. That tearing \napart of families is difficult to overcome. It is also a \nconstant reminder of the fact that we have not been \nable to put in place the necessary conditions to keep \nour children home, as well as of the fact that we will \nnever be able to achieve our potential, individually or \nas a society, unless we heal this terrible wound. \n I have personally raised the flag of our country\u2019s \nfull democratization, which means that emigrants \nshould have access to the vote that has been denied \nthem to this day. That unjustifiable denial is added to \nthe pain of separation and the loss of human rights to \nwhich they are subjected as immigrants. \n I have called on political parties, intellectuals, \nacademics and judges to draft the outlines of a national \npolitical accord that advances the necessary reforms to \nexpand and strengthen democracy, increase \ntransparency in the workings of political parties, \nimprove the administration of national elections law \nand \u2014 as a key element of my appeal \u2014 ensure the \nright to vote for our brothers and sisters abroad. \n We are concerned, moreover, not only by the \nunstable situation of migrants living abroad with no \nlegal status, suffering constant uncertainty and fear of \nbeing deported, but also by the difficult situation they \nare currently experiencing as a result of the global \nfinancial and economic crisis. For this reason a policy \nfor the inclusion and protection of the rights of our \nmigrant population and their families is a priority for \nus. We will be undertaking measures within and with \ncountries of transit and destination countries to \nguarantee migrants\u2019 rights everywhere in the world, \nand in particular the rights of our Salvadorian brothers. \nWe will emphasize an integrated and long-term \napproach to addressing migration, considering all its \ncauses, manifestations and effects. We will bring this \nvision to the process initiated at the High-level \nDialogue on International Migration and Development, \nand we pledge our participation at the third Global \nForum on Migration and Development, to take place in \nAthens. \n My Government is carrying out a foreign policy \ngeared towards strengthening and broadening \nrelationships of friendship and cooperation with all \ncountries of the world, both at the bilateral and \nmultilateral levels, based on solidarity, mutual respect \nand compliance with the principles of peaceful \ncoexistence, such as respect for sovereignty, territorial \nintegrity, non-interference in internal affairs, the \nnon-use or threat of use of force, the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, respect for the right to \nself-determination and respect for international law and \ninternational commitments, in accordance with the \nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter. \n The foreign policy of El Salvador is free from \nideological or partisan political stances. In good faith it \nis guided not only by national interests and priorities \nbut also by the common goals and interests of the \ninternational community, in particular the quest for and \npromotion of peace, political dialogue, cooperation in \nsolidarity, security and sustainable development. One \nexample of this is the restoration of diplomatic \nrelations between El Salvador and Cuba, which \novercame a lingering breach in our country\u2019s \nhemispheric relations. I also wish to underscore that a \nfurther key objective of my Government is to \nstrengthen the ties that we have with our brother \ncountries in Central America. \n In this context, I am certain that there will be no \nsolution or future for any of our countries if we act in \n  \n \n09-52228 26 \n \nisolation from each other. We long ago emerged from \nthe era of nationalities, and we are now ready to \nembark on a new phase, one of greater integration. In \nthis regard the European Union is perhaps the most \nadvanced example. \n I appeal to my Central American colleagues to \nconsider this point. There are many pending issues that \nwe must address. There are common challenges that we \nmust face shoulder to shoulder. We have everything to \ngain and nothing to lose in the full integration of our \nregion. In these years of the bicentenary we must \nregain the free and independent spirit of our ancestors, \nwhich was exemplified in the concept of a Central \nAmerican union as a basis for development, well-being \nand peace for our peoples. A first step would be to \nconvene a summit that would focus on a balanced \nintegration process and an analysis of greater transfer \nof competencies to strengthen the mechanisms of \nsupra-nationality, in order to further the aims and \nprinciples established in the Tegucigalpa Protocol, to \nensure its credibility and viability. \n Among the aims, of course, would be to \nstrengthen regional democratic institutions, helping us \nto avoid occurrences such as the Honduran coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, \nof which members are all well aware. Working together \nwe must ensure that it will be impossible to return to \nthe times of authoritarianism or military or civilian-\nmilitary dictatorships. The coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Honduras \nmust not be allowed to set a precedent which will \njeopardize the achievements that we have reached in \nterms of regional stability and democratic institutions. \nThe de facto Government in our brother country has \nignored the clamour of voices raised by the \ninternational community, calling for Honduras to return \nas quickly as possible to constitutional order through \ndialogue and political negotiation in accordance with \nhuman rights and the fundamental freedoms of the \nHonduran people. \n Until the Constitution is restored in Honduras \nthrough the immediate reinstatement of President \nZelaya and the creation of a government of national \nunity in keeping with the San Jos\u00e9 Agreement, the \nelectoral process currently being prepared in our \nbrother country will lack the legitimacy or \ntransparency necessary to guarantee reliable results \nwhich might help resolve the crisis in our brother \ncountry. \n The United Nations has played and will play a \nleading role in the maintenance of international peace \nand security and in the promotion of democracy and \ndevelopment. El Salvador is a leading example: the \nOrganization helped in reaching the Peace Agreements \nthat succeeded in resolving our internal conflict \u2014 a \ncontribution for which I am deeply grateful, because it \nled us from war to peace and from peace to a phase of \ntransition to democratization and development. In this \nregard we will engage in a major review of the \ninternational agenda in order to set priorities and to \nensure compliance with the key guidelines issued by \nthis global Organization and which benefit the well-\nbeing and dignity of our peoples. We are implementing \npolicies that are geared towards meeting the \ncommitments we have entered into at major \ninternational conferences, in particular the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and the promotion and full \nprotection of human rights. We will also be joining \ninternational agreements aimed at strengthening human \nrights and freedoms. \n We believe in the role that the United Nations has \nplayed in the field of cooperation and development, \nand we reiterate our support for the reform of its \nprincipal organs, programmes and subsidiary bodies, \nwhich will allow the Organization to adapt to the \ndemands and complexities of new challenges, in \nparticular through the interrelationship and interaction \nthat exist among political, economic, social, \nenvironmental and security phenomena. \n Thus we commit ourselves to strengthening our \nnational system for the protection of human rights and \nto promoting and guaranteeing a policy of justice, truth \nand compensation for serious infringements of human \nrights, by implementing a policy of openness, honesty \nand transparency in public affairs. \n The effects of the international crisis that broke \nout last year have been felt by all, but especially by \npoor and developing countries whose economies are \ndependent on large markets and that suffer from the \nconsequences of the decline of economic activity, \nemployment and consumption. Given this situation, \ninternational solidarity and cooperation take on \nextreme importance for developing countries, which \nhave limited natural and financial resources and are \nvery vulnerable. In this regard we call upon the \nindustrialized countries and on the donor community to \njoin every international effort and initiative to \novercome the current challenges, which jeopardize \n \n \n27 09-52228 \n \nachievements made to date and future progress for \nhumankind. \n We recommend taking full advantage of the \nexperience and expertise within the United Nations \nsystem in fostering international cooperation and \ncoordinating efforts to achieve common goals. In this \ncontext we appeal particularly to developed countries \nto ensure follow-up, support for and implementation of \nthe recommendations and commitments set out in the \nMonterrey Consensus and the Follow-up International \nConference on Financing for Development to Review \nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus that \ntook place in Doha in 2008, as well as the \nrecommendations contained in the Outcome of the \nConference on the World Economic and Financial \nCrisis and Its Impact on Development (resolution \n63/303, annex), in particular the need for donors to \nmaintain and fulfil their commitments and objectives \nwith regard to official development assistance. To that \nend, there is a need for political resolve to reform the \ninternational financial structure and system in order to \naddress the current difficulties. \n The high-level meeting on climate change \nconvened by the Secretary-General provided us with an \nopportunity to consider that issue, especially with \nrespect to compliance by States, and in particular the \nindustrialized countries, with the provisions of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, which was adopted shortly before the Earth \nSummit, and with later commitments to eliminate the \ndanger posed by environmental degradation and \nongoing activities that have exacerbated climate \nchange. We therefore hope that we will act in earnest, \nresponsibly and decisively at the Copenhagen \nconference to achieve a new agreement in this area so \nas to ensure that States do not put their own interests \nbefore the common well-being of humankind. It is time \nto adopt measures and mechanisms to rectify the \nmistakes and shortcomings of the past, and to launch a \nprocess to bring development into harmony with \nenvironmental protections. \n As participants here are aware, in my country we \nhave done away with ideological prejudices and \nstereotypes in our international relations. We believe in \nmultilateralism and in particular in the systems of our \ncontinental organization, the Organization of American \nStates, and of the United Nations. We believe in the \nrich and valuable contribution that new and emerging \nnations can make to the work of those two systems. We \nbelieve that the future of humankind largely depends \non the intelligence, honour and generosity of the larger \nnations in ensuring the full and fair development of \nemerging countries so as to put an end to the \ndiscrimination and differences that offend human \nnature. \n I thank the General Assembly for its attention and \nits support for my country and the Salvadoran people."

        "file_text": "I would like first of all to \nthank almighty Allah for granting us yet another \nopportunity for a gathering of world leaders. My \ndelegation would like to thank President Obama, the \nGovernment and people of the United States of \nAmerica, and the leadership of the United Nations for \ntheir warm welcome and the facilities placed at our \ndisposal since our arrival. \n Permit me also to congratulate Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann on his inspiring leadership and on \nconducting the affairs of the sixty-third session so well. \nBy the same token, I extend warm felicitations to \nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at this important \nsixty-fourth session. He has the full support of my \ndelegation. Our special thanks go to Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his stewardship and the commitment \nhe has shown to the welfare of humanity, particularly \nof Africa. \n \u201cEffective responses to global crises: \nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \ncivilizations for international peace, security and \ndevelopment\u201d, the theme adopted for this year\u2019s \nsession, is indeed apt and relevant. It calls on every \nnation, big or small, to adopt multilateralism and \ndialogue in fostering international partnership on all \nmatters of common concern surrounding global peace \nand development. \n The complexities of today\u2019s world are such that \nno nation can successfully confront them alone. Some \nissues cannot even be resolved by regional groups \nacting independently. Much can be achieved only when \nwe all collaborate and work together within the \nframework of multilateralism based on mutual \nunderstanding, respect and, above all, sincerity, strong \ncommitment and universal justice under the same rule \nof law and equity. \n Our global body, the United Nations, has indeed \nadopted countless resolutions, which, if implemented \nto the letter, would have made this world a better place \nfor all humankind and indeed other creatures on our \nplanet. Unfortunately, there are some Member States \nthat block well-meaning resolutions necessary for the \nmaintenance of world peace and even question or \ndisregard with impunity resolutions adopted by this \nbody.  \n As long as this continues to be the order of the \nday, the United Nations will remain united in name \nonly, unable to achieve in full the fundamental \nobjectives for which it was established. The modus \noperandi of the Organization therefore needs urgent \nreforms to ensure that such impunity is eliminated and \nthat the principle of equality among nation States, \nirrespective of their geopolitical size, location, \neconomic circumstances, race or religion is \nsafeguarded. Double standards have no place in the \nUnited Nations. \n There cannot be peace and security in the absence \nof justice for all. There cannot be justice in the face of \nabject poverty characterized by hunger, starvation, \ndisease and a lack of basic social services as a result of \nexploitation. There cannot be justice if there is \nmerciless exploitation, suppression and criminal \ninvasion of sovereign States. There cannot be peace if \nthere is no development as a result of marginalization, \ninjustice and racism. Unfortunately, injustice, racism, \nmerciless exploitation and marginalization, especially \nas inflicted on developing nations by developed \nnations, are the order of the day. \n Africa and Africans are the poorest of the poor, \ndespite the fact that the African continent is the world\u2019s \nrichest in terms of mineral and other natural resources. \nThe sad truth is that, despite the fact that the African \ncontinent is the source of 90 per cent of the precious \nminerals, gemstones and strategic raw materials for the \nindustrialized North, we Africans are the poorest of the \npoor. \n It is no fault of ours if we Africans are poor \ntoday. This situation has been brought about by the \nperennial invasions of the locusts and their permanent \npresence in Africa. They devour 90 per cent of our \nuseful resources, from agricultural and mineral to flora \n  \n \n09-52425 28 \n \nand fauna. These locusts are present in all resource-rich \nAfrican countries today. This devastating permanent \ninvasion is exacerbated by another destructive \nphenomenon \u2014 the permanent drought that affects all \nAfrican countries without exception. We cannot do \nanything about these two deadly scourges of the \nAfrican continent. In the case of the locusts, they are \nprotected by a one-sided international treaty imposed \non all third-world countries, not only Africa. As for the \ndrought, it is even worse, since no irrigation system in \nAfrica can eradicate it. \n The locusts I am talking about are the \nmultinational Western companies that exploit our \nnatural resources and agricultural produce, taking \n95 per cent of their financial value and leaving us, the \nowners of the resources, with 5 per cent or less at most. \nIs it not interesting that, with respect to the mining of \nAfrican mineral resources, only four African countries \nreceive more than a 3 per cent royalty from these \nmultinational mining companies? The rest receive only \na 3 per cent royalty or even less. In the case of \npetroleum exploitation, few African countries receive \nabove a 15 per cent royalty. \n There is nothing African countries can do about \nthis because these locusts have an absolute monopoly \nof the technologies used in the extractive industries. \nThe treaty that makes it impossible for us to do \nanything about it is called globalization, which means \nthe exploitation of poor third-world countries\u2019 \nresources by the rich first-world countries. With \nregards to the drought \u2014 that is, the debt burden \u2014 \nvery few rich countries have cancelled the debt owed \nthem by third-world countries. This excruciating \nburden of debt consumes 80 per cent of the 3 to 5 per \ncent left by the multinational companies. \n Our agricultural produce, such as tea, coffee and \ncocoa, is bought at prices fixed by the buyers, in most \ncases at an average price of less than $1 per kilo. The \nsame produce is then sold at more than $15 per kilo \nwhen processed. Thus, for every kilogram of our \nagricultural produce worth $15 on the Western market, \nwe get only $1. How can Africa develop and emerge \nfrom this abject poverty? \n African resources have been looted continuously \nfrom the eleventh century to date. Everything in Africa \nthat the locusts set their eyes on is looted even today. \nEven dead bodies have not been spared by the locusts. \nGraves were and are being desecrated and human \nbodies called mummies have been stolen from Africa. \nIn such a situation, where even Africans in their graves \nare not spared by these rampaging locusts, who in his \nright mind could expect us in Africa to develop and \nbecome rich? In Africa, \u201cR.I.P.\u201d on a tombstone, which \nnormally means \u201cRest In Peace\u201d, has never been \nrespected. \u201cR.I.P.\u201d really means \u201cRespected If Poor\u201d \u2014 \nthat is, the body in the tomb will rest only if it was not \nburied with any precious jewellery. \n The United Nations must come to the rescue of \nAfrica. Otherwise, we Africans stand ready to liberate \nourselves from this eternal bondage at any cost. From \nnow on, the African Union will work towards ensuring \nthat African nations and our farmers receive their \nrightful share of our God-given natural and agricultural \nresources. We will no longer accept less than 65 per \ncent of the proceeds from our natural resources. \n We Africans have been suffering for too long at \nthe hands of Westerners and we will put an end to this. \nIt is African sweat, blood, tears and natural resources \nthat have built the North throughout almost five \ncenturies of merciless and racist exploitation that \ncontinues today. Enough is enough. Instead of being \nrespected, we are being called all sorts of names and \ngiven all sorts of unsolicited titles \u2014 dictators, corrupt \nleaders, failed States and even rogue States.  \n We, the new generation of African leaders, will \nseek to put an end to this humiliating, degrading and \nracist treatment by any means necessary. The world \nwill not live in peace and security as long as this \ndehumanizing and racist status quo continues to prevail \nwith regard to the continent of Africa and to Africans. \nWe have been forced to endure this for far too long and \nnow we are going to put an end to it, as we have ended \napartheid in South Africa, by force if necessary. We \nwill defend our humanity, our dignity, our resources, \nour interests and our culture from this moment \nforward. \n HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are killer \ndiseases. While I would like to reiterate my \ndelegation\u2019s support for the work of the Global Fund in \nfighting these diseases, I wish to call for concerted \nefforts to mobilize resources to support international \nresearch on traditional medicine and alternative disease \ntreatment programmes. These traditional systems are in \nmost instances more cost-effective, yet they have been \nabandoned due to the sort of criticism that come from \nmultinationals threatened that certain traditional \n \n \n29 09-52425 \n \nbreakthroughs would be detrimental to their corporate \nexistence and interests. These multinationals value \ntheir monetary gains more than human life. They \nshould not be allowed to hold humanity to ransom. \nTheir insatiable appetite for massive wealth at any cost \nhas pushed them to the point of blindness, insensitivity \nto human suffering and the loss of human life in the \ndeveloping world, especially in Africa. \n With regard to international peace and security, \nmy delegation calls once again for stronger and more \nhonest international cooperation and dialogue in \naddressing conflict prevention, the peaceful resolution \nof disputes and respect for the cultural values, norms \nand ways of life of others. We must respect the fact that \nhumanity was created to be diverse, just as planet Earth \nhas different regions, each with its own diverse \nclimatic and ecological system. Therefore, there is \nbound to be diversity in the colour of our skin, \ndiversity in the way we live and differences in our \nbeliefs. Diverse as we may be, we are part and parcel \nof the one human family created by the one and only \nGod, Allah. If we accept the principle that we are all \nhuman beings equal before the only God that created \nus, and that differences in religion and skin colour do \nnot make one person less human than another, then we \nwill all live in perfect peace and harmony in this global \nvillage called the world. \n The problem is that some play God and believe \nthat, by virtue of the colour of their skin, they are \nbetter than the rest of humanity and therefore should \ndictate to them how they should live and how they \nshould worship God. They impose their value systems \non the rest of humanity. This unacceptable dictatorship \nis the source of all the world\u2019s major conflicts and a \ncontributing factor to persistent threats to world peace. \n Racism is on the rise. Extremist hate-mongers are \nincreasing in number and rising in rank. Instead of \nbeing condemned as criminals and terrorists, they are \nlabelled the far right, neo-Nazis or supremacists, and \ntolerated and even encouraged by the same Powers that \nwould happily bomb them back to the Stone Age if \nthey were Muslim, black African or Asian. As long as \nthis status quo persists, peace and security will \ncontinue to be an elusive dream as people, rich or poor, \nMuslim or non-Muslim, black or Asian, are bound to \ndefend their human dignity at any price. \n My delegation therefore calls for a united front \nagainst this dictatorship of a few over the rest of \nhumanity. And in the interest of our collective security, \nthe United Nations should see to the total elimination \nof racism and hatred in all their forms, whatever it \ntakes, so that we can bequeath to the generations of \nhumanity yet unborn a very peaceful and prosperous \nworld devoid of destitution, exploitation and \nmarginalization. \n In this context, my delegation would like to see a \nspeedy resolution of the plight of the Palestinians. We \ncall on the State of Israel to accept and respect the \ntwo-State solution that the international community has \nso clearly articulated without preconditions. We also \nurge the Security Council to ensure that its resolutions \nare respected by all States and enforced to the letter \nand spirit by the United Nations, and not to allow \ncertain States to choose not only to ignore these \nresolutions, but to violate them with impunity, while \nother States face drastic and devastating military action \nif such resolutions are adopted against them and they \nso much as ask for clarification. \n The State of Israel has ignored and violated all \nUnited Nations resolutions and conventions with \nregard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, not only with \nimpunity, but also with the support and protection of \ncertain world Powers, while other countries have paid a \nvery high price merely for not having fully complied \nwith a Security Council resolution. The Council should \nstop employing these unfortunate double standards. \nThe United Nations must not be turned into an \u201canimal \nfarm\u201d. \n Secondly, there is also the lingering issue of the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan. My delegation holds the \nposition that Taiwan should be invited to participate in \nall meetings and activities of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization, among other \nbodies. Taiwan has a legitimate right to full \nmembership of all United Nations specialized agencies, \nsince even non-governmental organizations have either \nfull membership or observer status in those agencies. \nTaiwan, a democratic State with a population of \n23 million, is still being denied this fundamental \nhuman right, which the United Nations is supposed to \nuphold and protect in the first place.  \n My delegation also hereby calls on the United \nNations to urge the United States of America to \nimmediately and unconditionally lift its embargo on \nCuba, in accordance with the wishes of more than \n  \n \n09-52425 30 \n \n98 per cent of the membership of this body. That trade \nembargo continues to hurt Cuban women and children. \nThe Cuban children born into those extreme hardships \nhave committed no crime. The punishment of women \nand children because of political differences is a very \nserious violation of their rights. \n Thirdly, my delegation renews its full support for \nthe territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Kingdom \nof Morocco. On the question of the Moroccan Sahara, \nwe remain convinced that the proposal of the \nMoroccan Government to grant substantive autonomy \nto the Saharan region on the basis of the negotiations \ninitiated by the Security Council and conducted and \nagreed by the parties would lead to a lasting and \npeaceful resolution of the conflict. \n Finally, my delegation has been following keenly, \nbut with deep dismay, the protracted negotiations on \nreform of the Security Council and a seeming \nconnivance to prevent such reform. Africa would like \nto see Council reform undertaken, with balanced \nrepresentation of all continents in the Council. My \ndelegation therefore urges the President of the General \nAssembly to make more effort on the issue during the \nsixty-fourth session and to ensure that the continent of \nAfrica has at least two permanent seats on the Security \nCouncil with full veto powers; if it does not, any \nresolution adopted by the Council will not be binding \non Africa or any African Union member State by the \nend of 2010. Africa, a continent 10 times the size of \nEurope, does not have a single permanent seat on the \nSecurity Council, while Europe has more than one. \n Africa has been subjected to discrimination, \nmarginalization, exploitation and humiliation for a very \nlong time. We Africans are no longer going to accept \nthat status quo. We will put an end to it very soon. \nMembers should take my words seriously. "

        "file_text": "I am grateful for the \nopportunity to address the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session. \n Each year, we gather here to confront our \ncommon challenges and to express our vision for the \nworld we share, the world for which we are common \nstewards. And each year we promise to do more and to \ndo better to live up to and defend the principles \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. \n This year, we meet on the twentieth anniversary \nof the most successful triumph of those principles. \nTwenty years have passed since Europe and the rest of \nthe world were liberated from one of the cruellest \nepisodes in modern history. The fall of the Berlin Wall \nbrought an end to an artificial line that separated \nnations, divided families, strangled freedom and \nimprisoned millions. Remarkably, that formidable wall \ncrumbled without a single shot being fired. It yielded \nto the will of those millions who yearned for liberty \nand it yielded to the determination of a united West. \n Twenty years ago, a universally feared military \nforce was defeated by the force of a universal truth \u2014 \nthe call for freedom and the simple desire to live a \ndignified life. When the Berlin Wall was dismantled \n20 years ago, it did more than free the captive nations \nof the Warsaw Pact. It unleashed the hopes, dreams, \naspirations and talents of millions of citizens living \nunder the tyranny of the Soviet Union \u2014 including my \nown nation\u2019s people. \n Today, these citizens make up more than a dozen \ndiverse nations, linked together by the common desires \nand ambitions to live in a world free from spheres of \ninfluence \u2014 free from external control \u2014 and to be \nable to choose their own destiny. Today, as we look \nback at that historic chapter and the impact it has had \non our world, we can rightly be proud of what was \nachieved, the tremendous progress that has been made, \nand the prosperity that a lasting peace has brought. \n But if we are to evaluate the past honestly, we \nmust admit that the present remains bittersweet. For \nthere is a real danger that, rather than build on this \ngreat chapter of idealism and progress, States and \nleaders will allow a return of the dull complacency and \ncynical power politics that led to so many of the worst \nmoments of the past 100 years. \n And the moment is bittersweet because, \nregrettably, not everyone drew the same lessons of \nhope and inspiration when that wall came down. \nIndeed, 20 years ago, when freedom\u2019s spirit swept that \nwall away, few imagined the repression and threats it \nrepresented would so soon reappear and that the hopes \nunleashed in 1989 would so quickly founder. Yet today, \na Europe that is whole, free, and at peace remains a \ngoal still to be achieved \u2014 a project not yet \naccomplished and a challenge, unfortunately, unmet. \n Today, I stand before the Assembly as the \ndemocratically elected leader of a proud and sovereign \nnation. But, tragically, Georgia today, like Germany a \ngeneration ago, is a nation with a deep wound running \nthrough it. As V\u00e1clav Havel and other leading voices  \nof Europe\u2019s conscience declared earlier this week, \nEurope is today divided by a new wall built by an \noutside force \u2014 a wall that runs through the middle of \nGeorgia. \n This wall has been built by the same people who \nmiss the Berlin Wall, who regret its fall, who did \neverything so that the wall would not fall. This wall \ncuts off one fifth of our territory and, once again, \ndivides Europe from itself, creating new lines of \nrepression and fear, artificial dividing lines inside the \ninternationally recognized borders of a European \nnation. \n It may be unpopular, but I am obliged to speak \nthe truth. And the truth is that this wall\u2019s existence \nmocks the progress we seemed to have made since that \nbright, shining day in Berlin 20 years ago. This new \nwall tells us that, once again, the rule of force has \ntrumped the rule of law and the rule of reason. \n I see no irony \u2014 only tragedy \u2014 in the fact that \nthis wall is being built by the very people whose ideas \nwere collectively and decisively defeated and rejected \njust 20 years ago. I take no comfort in the fact that \n \n \n57 09-52425 \n \nthose who thought the wall\u2019s destruction was the single \ngreatest tragedy of the twentieth century now lead \nthese deplorable efforts. \n One year ago, my country was invaded. Tanks, \nwarplanes, warships, bombs and State-directed cyber-\nhackers descended upon our towns, villages, cities, \ninfrastructure and economy. Hundreds of our people \nwere killed within days and thousands were wounded. \nTens of thousands of innocent civilians were forced to \nflee in the face of ethnic cleansing, which independent \nhuman rights organizations have documented very \nwell. \n Today, these acts of brutality have gone \nunaddressed, in direct contravention of international \nlaw, the norms of this institution and internationally \nsigned agreements designed to reverse these wrongs. \nThese are the facts that confront us as we gather here \ntoday, and these facts have a name: armed aggression, \nethnic cleansing, mass violation of human rights and \ncontinuing illegal occupation. \n Those who unleashed war in our region and in my \ncountry and led ethnic cleansing campaigns in Georgia \nsaid yesterday \u2014 in this very Hall, from this very \nrostrum \u2014 that they had to do it to \u201cimplement the \nprinciple of the indivisibility of security\u201d in order to \n\u201cmove beyond the legacy of the past\u201d (). This \nis la langue de bois \u2014 very classical langue de bois \nfrom the old days. \n The only thing that they stepped over in reality \nwas our sovereign border. They said they had to do it, \njust as their predecessors had to invade Poland \u2014 \nbecause of Poland\u2019s reckless desire to be free \u2014 in \n1939, Finland in 1940, Hungary in 1956, \nCzechoslovakia in 1968, and Afghanistan in 1979. The \nsame people had to erase a capital of 400,000 \ninhabitants \u2014 Grozny \u2014 to destroy and exterminate \nthe proud Chechen nation and kill tens of thousands of \ninnocent women and children. And I am saying on the \nrecord that the clock is ticking, and they will have to \ndo it again, and they will do it again unless they are \nstopped by all of us. Recent history indeed is a \npowerful guide to understanding what kind of actions \nthese leaders undertake in order to bring what they call \nsecurity and stability to my nation. \n But I want to say clearly today that the people of \nGeorgia cannot and will not accept a new dividing line \nin our country. That is an unchangeable commitment. \nUnder these daily menaces, military provocations and \nall kinds of lies directed against us from many different \nsources, my nation will not crumble and we will never \nsurrender to this brutal force. \n The wall across Europe is not a matter of concern \nto Georgia alone. Indeed, in this matter the very values \nof this institution are under threat. The protection of \nhuman rights, respect for the dignity and equality of all \npersons, the inadmissibility of ethnic cleansing and the \nrecognition of the inviolability of sovereign borders \u2014 \nall these are values that form the bedrock of this \ninstitution.  \n We certainly did not choose this course of action, \nbut it is up to us to recognize and reverse its illegality. \nAs a community of responsible nations, it is our \ncollective responsibility to uphold international law \nand to insist that borders cannot and will not be \nchanged through the use of force. It is up to us to tear \ndown this new wall peacefully with the power of our \nideas and the strength of our convictions. I want the \nworld to understand clearly how we view this new wall \nand our strategy for tearing it down. \n To start with, let me state outright that we do not \nexpect it to disappear overnight. We understand that it \nis a very, very hard process, but the history of the \nBerlin Wall teaches us that patience must never be \npassive. We should never become resigned to the idea \nthat this situation should be accepted or tolerated. The \nBerlin Wall fell only because passionate, disciplined, \nenergetic partisans of freedom, both behind and outside \nthat wall, worked with focus, discipline, courage and \ndetermination to remind the world community of the \nillegitimacy and illegality of that wall, and to take \naction to hasten its demise. \n I would like to take this opportunity to thank \nthose States Members of the United Nations for their \nvotes recognizing the right of return for all who have \nbeen displaced and for all the victims of ethnic \ncleansing. I would like to thank all those nations across \nthe globe that resisted illegal pressure \u2014 and in many \ncases attempts at bribery \u2014 by standing firm in their \nnon-recognition of those territories of Georgia now \noccupied by a foreign force. I want to thank all those \nnations that have been so generous in pledging and \nproviding the vital economic support that has proved \ninvaluable in helping to build shelters for and rebuild \nthe dreams of those the invasion has made refugees and \ninternally displaced persons. On behalf of all my \nfellow citizens, I wish to thank them for their \n  \n \n09-52425 58 \n \ngenerosity, especially at a time of such extreme \nhardship around the world. \n Beyond the comfort provided by their material \nsupport, I want to thank all of Georgia\u2019s friends who \nhave defended not only our sovereignty, but our right \nto forge our own path in the world, to choose our own \nalliances and to reject the nineteenth-century notion of \nspheres of influence, which led to so much warfare, \nrepression and hardship in the world\u2019s history. I want \nto thank those nations and leaders of the European \nUnion who today have committed their monitors to \nGeorgia for the promotion of peace. The Georgian \npeople are also grateful to United States President \nObama for his unyielding words and very strong \ndeclarations of support for our sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity, as well as to Vice President Biden \nfor visiting Georgia this summer and for underscoring, \nin meeting with refugee children, America\u2019s \ncommitment to our democracy and our right to choose \nour own future. In particular, I want to thank the \nUnited Nations for more than 16 years of contributions \nto peace on the ground in Georgia through its presence \nin our country \u2014 a presence recently and abruptly \nhalted by the unilateral actions of one single Member \nState. \n Our future depends on us, and so today I also \nwant to report to the United Nations on the progress \nGeorgia has made, through our own efforts, in the year \nsince we suffered Europe\u2019s first invasion in the post-\ncold war era. One year after losing hundreds of our \nsons and daughters and after seeing hundreds of \nthousands of our people displaced, the Georgian people \nhave regrouped and made real progress down the path \nof peace, freedom and individual liberty. \n I would like to pay tribute to their courage. Just a \nfew days ago, in a refugee camp outside Tbilisi, I saw \nyoung children demonstrating their unstoppable will to \nhave a normal and free life. These were children of all \nethnic backgrounds. Indeed, most of the refugees from \nSouth Ossetia are ethnic Ossetians, and they fled from \nso-called liberators or were forced out. The children I \nsaw in that refugee camp were seizing the opportunity \nto learn how to compete in the modern age using new \ncomputers, mastering English and advancing their \npursuit of knowledge, despite the odds. These children \nare the future of my country. These children symbolize \nthe path Georgia took after the invasion. \n We are following through on the promises I made \nat this rostrum last year to strengthen our democracy, \nfoster pluralism and expand individual liberties. \nAlready, we have set reforms in motion that within the \nnext year will advance the progress of the Rose \nRevolution and irreversibly deepen our identity as the \nfreest State in our region. Already, we have permitted \nnearly three months of opposition protests to proceed \nunhindered, even though they closed down the main \nstreets of our capital and paralysed Government \nbuildings. Our actions reflect our deep commitment to \npluralism and our respect for dissent and freedom of \nspeech.  \n In a situation where enemy troops are just two \ndozen kilometres from the capital, with their artillery \npointed at the city centre, we have already given \nopposition-controlled broadcast stations license to \ntransmit across the nation. Already, we have brought \nopposition parties into the meetings of our national \nsecurity council, basically keeping no secrets from \nthem and giving full access to all State information, so \nas to ensure that our security policies reflect the unified \nwill of the nation, beyond faction and beyond party. \nAlready, we have committed to the direct election of \nall mayors in a few months\u2019 time, and we have begun \nthe development of new electoral rules, based on \nconsensus and the agreement of different political \nparties, in order to ensure the greatest possible \nlegitimacy of the next local, parliamentary and \npresidential elections. \n Along with all these efforts and our commitment \nto democratic reforms, our biggest imperative today is \nto continue to integrate all different political interests \nand groups in promoting a better everyday life for our \ncitizens. We are also doing everything we can to \nrebuild our economy. \n The Georgian people are skilled and hard-\nworking, but they are enduring the double punishment \nof the global economic downturn and the economic \nconsequences of last summer\u2019s invasion. Our biggest \nimperative at home is to create more employment, and \nwe are pursuing that goal every day. Indeed, we are \nheartened and proud that the World Bank recently \nranked Georgia as the eleventh most attractive country \nin the world for doing business, when only a few years \nago we ranked 122nd. We also rank first in Eastern and \nCentral Europe, just one year after the invasion. And \nwe will continue to take steps to strengthen our \neconomy and create more employment. \n \n \n59 09-52425 \n \n We are resolutely committed to our vision of a \nsovereign and unified Georgia. Together with all of \nGeorgia\u2019s diverse ethnic groups and religions, we will \nprevail over the illegal occupation and reverse the \nresults of ethnic cleansing. \n Abkhazia is the birthplace of Georgian \ncivilization. Since the days of the ancient kingdom of \nColchida \u2014 which was the birthplace of one of the \nmost interesting and ancient European cultures, \nbeginning with Jason and the Argonauts \u2014 it has been \na valuable and vibrant part of our journey through \nhistory. Just a few years ago, it remained a very vibrant \npart of Georgia. And that most vibrant and successful \npart of Georgia has now been emptied of more than \nthree quarters of its population. Gardens, hotels, \ntheatres and restaurants have been replaced by military \nbases, minefields and graveyards. It will take time, but \nI am sure that Abkhazia will once again be what it \nwas \u2014 the most wonderful part of Georgia \u2014 and that \nthe occupation will be merely a part of history.  \n I came here today to deliver a simple message. \nWe believe that Georgia is winning the peace, and here \nis how the Assembly can measure our commitment. \nDid we crumble in the face of the brutal invasion? No. \nDid we crack down on dissent? No. Did we reduce \nfreedom in the face of recession? No. Even in the face \nof adversity, we continue to contribute to the common \ngoals established by our friends and the international \ncommunity at large. \n I am proud to say that Georgia is in the vanguard \nof the battle against climate change, producing 85 per \ncent of its electricity from green and renewable \nsources. That percentage is growing, and within the \nnext three years we will cover 100 per cent of our \nneeds. Meanwhile, we are on the front lines in \nconfronting terrorism throughout the world with our \nallies, including in Afghanistan, where our troops will \nserve side by side with others from around the world. \n We are winning the peace because, every day, the \nnations of our region become more and more \nindependent from our common imperial legacy. Every \nday, regional States increasingly reject the tremendous \npressure generated by our common past. Every day, the \nidea that we can resist revanchist tendencies is \nspreading further, and every day the arc of independent \nnations \u2014 from Ukraine to Moldova and from \nUzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan to Mongolia \u2014 is telling \nthe world that spheres of influence are a thing of the \npast.  \n Georgia is not only a country; the new wall that \ncuts across our territory has transformed Georgia into \nan idea and a test. It is an idea of freedom and \nindependence and a test for the world \u2014 a test that the \nworld must not fail. If the world passes the test, then \neveryone will be amazed at how quickly the region will \ndevelop its tremendous potential. An active, patient \nvictory over this new wall would be a crucial step in \nthe effort to build energy security for free nations and a \nunited front against lawlessness and terrorism. Georgia \nis a place where all cultures, influences, religions and \ntraditions meet, providing an antidote to the threat of a \nclash of civilizations. \n Yesterday, President Obama said clearly that new \nwalls should not divide us, that the future belongs to \nthose who build and not to those who destroy, and that \ncooperation and values must prevail against division \nand cynicism. Today, I want to stress how much we \nshare that vision and how vital that vision is to my \ncountry, my region and beyond. \n Twenty years ago, the velvet revolutions opened a \nnew era of international relations and a new journey \nbegan towards a free and cooperative world. I am \nconfident that we will prevail on that journey, but only \nif we are not complacent or passive and only if we \nsupport and defend our deeply held values. After all, \nonly this week, the clarion voice of those velvet \nrevolutions two decades ago \u2014 the voice of V\u00e1clav \nHavel \u2014 offered us a solemn reminder about the \ndangers that we have yet to overcome. Speaking about \nthe new wall that now divides Georgia, he wrote, \ntogether with other prominent Europeans, that \n\u201cthe failure of western democracies to respond to \nthe dismemberment of a friendly nation, albeit a \nsmall one, can have very serious global \nconsequences \u2026 The European Union was built \nagainst the temptation of Munich and the iron \ncurtain. It would be utterly disastrous if we were \nto appear in any way to condone the kind of \npractices that plunged our continent into war and \ndivision for most of the last century. At stake is \nnothing less than the fate of the project to which \nwe continue to dedicate our lives: the peaceful \nand democratic reunification of the European \ncontinent\u201d. \n  \n \n09-52425 60 \n \n We must not fail to hear V\u00e1clav Havel\u2019s call, \nPresident Obama\u2019s call and the call of one of my \npersonal heroes from Russia, Anna Politkovskaya, who \nwas so brutally silenced. I remember my conversation \nwith Ms. Politkovskaya just a few days before she was \nmurdered. She was my friend and my hero, and I \nremember the hopes that she expressed. Their calls \necho across two decades of progress \u2014 progress that \nhas inspired the greatest hopes but that remains very \nfragile. Today and together, we must provide answers. \nToday and together, we must show leadership and \nvision. Today and together, we must demonstrate our  \n \ncommon resolve. And most of all, today and together, \nwe must provide an example, showing that the power \nof our values and ideals will finally unleash the \ntremendous human potential within all of us."

        "file_text": "Like previous speakers, I \noffer you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly for \nthis session. I also wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his excellent report on the work of the \nOrganization (A/64/1) and for his continuing \nleadership during these unprecedented and challenging \ntimes. A testament to the Secretary-General\u2019s \nleadership has been his persistent efforts to convene \nthe Summit on Climate Change held earlier this week. \nFor those of us who are also members of the Alliance \nof Small Island States, our own Summit, held \nimmediately beforehand, was a timely exercise in \nfocusing on the critical issues at stake in the run-up to \nthe Copenhagen Climate Change Conference to be held \nin December. \n Climate change has taken its rightful place at the \nforefront of many of the statements we have heard this \nweek. In the case of small island developing States like \nours, we all need to reach beyond our narrow national \ninterests and embrace our collective responsibility to \none another as nation States and to those most \nvulnerable and least able to address the adverse effects \nof climate change. At the Pacific Islands Forum, the \nissue of climate change and the type of collective effort \nit requires has been at the forefront of the meetings of \nPacific leaders, most recently in Cairns under the \nchairmanship of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of \nAustralia. Such efforts resulted, earlier this year, in the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s adoption by consensus of \nresolution 63/281, on climate change and its security \nimplications. \n It has been heartening to hear in this Hall words \nof action \u2014 a determination to move away from the \nrhetoric of climate change to the reality of action: \naction to mitigate the effects of climate change and \naction to stop the waste of our energy resources. But \nthe words of Presidents and Prime Ministers are not \nenough. They must be matched by action. Our \ndetermination and our understanding of the truth of \nclimate change must be propelled by honest efforts to \nmitigate and change the wasteful energy habits of a \nlifetime into the productive energy habits of the future. \n The lessons of the past year have reinforced our \nsupport for reform of the international financial \ninstitutions. In particular, we look forward to the \noutcome of the just-concluded meeting of the Group of \n20 in Pittsburgh as further crucial and concerted action \nfollowing the measures taken in Washington and \nLondon. \n Despite the uncertain global economic and \nfinancial climate, we remain committed to making \nfurther progress in achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which remain a core \ncomponent of our national development planning. \nMuch of that progress has been reliant on our own \n \n \n37 09-52586 \n \ndomestic efforts, but it has also been assisted by our \ndevelopment partners. In that regard, we support the \nSecretary-General\u2019s convening of a special summit on \nthe MDGs in 2010 as a final push towards 2015. \nFurther, the high-level review of the Mauritius Strategy \nfor the Further Implementation of the Programme of \nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small \nIsland Developing States, to be carried out the same \nyear, offers us, as small island developing States, a \nfresh opportunity to take stock of progress and areas \nfor improvement. We also welcome the renewed \ninterest and engagement of the United States of \nAmerica regarding the Pacific islands. \n Earlier this year, my country, the Kingdom of \nTonga, in compliance with its obligations under the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \nlodged a partial submission for the consideration of the \nCommission on the Outer Limits of the Continental \nShelf. This was a significant exercise made possible \nthrough our own efforts, with the technical assistance \nof organizations such as the Commonwealth \nSecretariat. As we are an island nation, the living \nmarine resources of our maritime zones and the \npotential of non-living ones remain critical to our \nfuture.  \n We continue to follow the meandering course of \nthe discussions on reform of the Security Council. We \nmaintain our support for such reform and hold the view \nthat there should be an expansion in both the \npermanent and the non-permanent membership \ncategories. \n Since 100 per cent of our power generation is \nfuelled by imported fossil fuels, our economic potential \nhas been adversely affected by rising fuel prices, which \nhas forced us to investigate feasible renewable sources \nof energy. We thus have set the target of achieving \n50  per cent of our electricity generation utilizing \nrenewable energy sources by the year 2012. \n We have reviewed donor funding provided by our \ndevelopment partners to see how best we could achieve \nthat ambitious goal and also fulfil our wish to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. At the conclusion of the \nregional Pacific Energy Ministers Meeting hosted in \nTonga earlier this year, we discussed those issues with \nour development partners. It very quickly became \napparent that a new model for doing business was \nneeded. And so it was that the concept for the Tonga \nRenewable Energy Road Map was born. \n The development partners all agreed to \ncollaborate, under the coordination of the World Bank, \nto assess the current infrastructure of on-grid and \noff-grid electrification throughout the Kingdom. The \nWorld Bank, the European Union, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, Australia, New Zealand and Japan \nreadily accepted this opportunity to actively participate \nin the development of our Energy Road Map. Those \nefforts were recently boosted by strong support from \nthe Government of the United Arab Emirates and the \nInternational Renewable Energy Agency, which was \nreaffirmed at bilateral meetings held in New York this \nweek. \n Tonga\u2019s cultural and constitutional roots are \ninnately enduring. We are proud of our 134-year-old \nwritten Constitution, which is one of the oldest in the \nworld and is still in force. Our Constitution enshrined \nbasic human rights and freedoms that today are the \nsubject of international treaties. The Tongan way of life \nis not based solely on the rights, responsibilities, \nfreedoms and obligations of the individual, but \nemphasizes rights, responsibilities, freedoms and \nobligations attaching to the extended family and the \nwhole community. While the values underlying human \nrights may be expressed differently from Tongan \ncustomary and traditional values, and while both \nreflect similar aspirations, Tonga\u2019s strength lies in the \nbinding links of collective group values and individual \nobligations and responsibilities. \n Our parliament recently considered ratification of \nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination against Women (CEDAW). Parliament \nvoted not to ratify CEDAW, because to do so would \nconflict with the cultural and social heritage that makes \nup the unique Tongan way of life. We take the \nratification of international treaties very seriously. We \ndid not want to ratify CEDAW as a matter of \ninternational convenience. We would rather be judged \nby our actions to empower women than by a \nratification of convenience. And we make no apologies \nfor our stance. We admit that there are issues to be \naddressed. But, rather than ratify CEDAW, we prefer to \naddress those specific areas of concern to women in \nour own way. We maintain that our women are among \nthe most highly cherished, elevated and respected in \nthe world. \n Finally, this month marks the tenth anniversary of \nTonga\u2019s admission as a Member of the United Nations. \nWe reaffirm the rights and responsibilities bestowed \n  \n \n09-52586 38 \n \nupon us by the United Nations Charter, and we pledge \nto continue to participate constructively in addressing \nour common challenges. Those challenges will be \novercome by our action. Given that the United Nations \nis the forum for united action and given the \ncommitments made by leaders to such action, we may \njust awake to the fact that it is the good in the world, \nnot the evil, that surpasses all explanation."

        "file_text": "For \nthe past four years, I have been proud to represent my \ncountry in this Assembly, the world\u2019s foremost \nassembly, the forum in which the peoples have placed \nso many hopes. Peace, human rights, international law, \ndevelopment: these are some of the causes promoted \nhere, sometimes successfully and at other times with \ndifficulty, but always with progress. This has been \nobserved by the poorest in various regions; it has been \nobserved by children and women; it has been observed \nby the persecuted, by those who suffer; it has been \nobserved by men and women all over the globe. \n It is true that the efforts have not sufficed to \neradicate all the injustice or the abuses or the sorrows \nof so many. But it is also true that we have made \nconsiderable progress in six decades of international \ncollaboration. The rule of law and the institutional \nframework have been strengthened, so that humanity \ntoday has the technical, legal and economic means to \nmake much more progress in the struggle for a better \nworld. \n We cannot let those hopes be dashed. But at times \nthis is what we seem to be doing. The world is \nexperiencing a serious economic crisis resulting from \nthe inability of countries and of the international \ncommunity to formulate clear and transparent rules on \nfinancial matters. \n We are on the brink of a serious environmental \ncrisis resulting from emissions of greenhouse gases and \nfrom the way the world has chosen to produce and \nobtain energy \u2014 as well as from the inability of \ncountries to agree on standards and policies to prevent \nglobal warming. \n Even more serious, in the twenty-first century we \nsee more than a billion people suffering from hunger: \none out of six people all over the world, 50 million of \nthem in Latin America. This is much more than a \nstatistic: it is a child, it is a mother dying in a poor \ncounty despite the opulence in which the developed \ncountries are living. \n Trillions of dollars have been spent in recent \nmonths to rescue the financial system and revitalize the \neconomy. Yet the World Food Programme will see its \nbudget reduced by more than half this year. What a sad \nparadox this is. Less than 0.1 per cent of the financial \nrescue plans would end the food crisis affecting dozens \nof countries. I should like today to raise my voice and \nurge that this item be put on the agenda of this \nAssembly, the forthcoming meetings of the Group of \n20 and, in general, all international forums. \n The economic collapse must not lead to a social \ncollapse. We must not let down our guard, for it is not \nacceptable that, on the pretext of the economic crisis, \ncountries should be reducing contributions for the fight \nagainst hunger, for the protection of the environment or \nfor the promotion of development. \n And it is ethically untenable that, while this is \nhappening, the executives of the investment banks that \nwere at the centre of the current crisis, gambling \nirresponsibly with financial assets, should today be \nback to business as usual and awarding themselves \nhuge bonuses which simply reward excessive risk-\ntaking in their bets. They are even considering \nestablishing companies to place their bonuses in tax \nhavens. \n The world simply cannot function in this way. \nResignation is not an option. It is possible to construct \nfairer, realistic, sustainable and pragmatic models to \n  \n \n09-52179 36 \n \nensure progressive advancement for all peoples. That \nrequires recognition that the economic crisis was not a \ncasual occurrence or, still less, a cyclical event in the \ncapitalist economy that will correct itself on its own, \nsolely through the workings of the invisible hand of the \nmarket. \n What happened here was much more than a \nchance occurrence or a cycle. What happened here was \nthe crisis of a paradigm, the crisis of a certain kind of \nglobalization, the crisis of a conception of the State and \nthe public sector in which the State is seen as the \nproblem and not the solution. In this conception, it is \nthought that the more the economy is deregulated, the \nbetter it is. In this conception there are misgivings \nabout democratic discussion as to which goods should \nbe public and should therefore enjoy efficient \nprotection and government guarantees. \n It is this extreme and dogmatic neo-liberalism \nthat has unfortunately erupted into crisis, unfortunately \nleaving in its wake a trail of hunger, unemployment \nand, above all, injustice. \n And it is at times like this that action by the \npublic sector has proved to be essential. Thanks to \ndecisive action by States, it has been possible to avoid \na widespread and fatal economic collapse with \nunexpected political consequences \u2014 which could \nhave been another Great Depression. \n The whole dogma of laissez-faire was forgotten \nwhen the time came for the State to save the \ninternational financial machinery and implement \nfinancial stimulus plans. \n In some countries \u2014 including my own \u2014 State \naction proved crucial in mitigating effects and \nprotecting the most vulnerable in crisis situations. In \nmy country, we were careful with commodity wealth \nsome years ago and saved resources for more difficult \ntimes, resisting political pressure to spend that money \nbut confident that this was the responsible thing to do. \nWe were proved to be right, and this has allowed us to \noffset the effects of the international crisis while \nincreasing social benefits for people, raising pensions, \nprotecting workers, building hospitals and investing \nmore than ever before in education and housing for \nthose most in need. \n Countries such as Chile learned the lessons of \npast crises and are facing this crisis with solid \nmacroeconomic foundations, with far better capitalized \nbanking systems and with stricter and more effective \nregulations. \n But this was not the case everywhere. It is worth \nrecalling that after the Asian crisis a decade ago, there \nwas much talk about financial system reforms, better \noversight mechanisms and early warning systems. But \nnone of this happened. Political laziness prevailed. \nPrivate interests prevailed over the public good. That is \nwhy today reform cannot wait, either domestically, \nwith better regulations in the capital market, or abroad. \n We hope that General Assembly resolutions and \nthe forthcoming meeting of the Group of 20 will make \nprogress in this direction because \u2014 I insist \u2014 \nresignation is not an option. We know that at this stage \nneither rhetoric nor populism can be of help. There \nmust be no flights of fancy, and we must remain open \nto the opportunities that well conducted globalization \ncan provide. \n We must find effective mechanisms to safeguard \nthe public interest in the world of national and \ninternational finance. We must find solutions to unlock \na world trade agreement that will thwart protectionist \ndesigns. And we must return multilateral dialogue to \nthe centre of international policy, abandoning \nunilateralism. \n While unbridled globalization in the financial \nsphere provoked the crisis we are experiencing, \nunilateral action and disdain for institutions resulted in \nconflicts that must not be repeated. Military or \neconomic might cannot be the norm in international \nrelations. Institutions and the rule of law must prevail, \nsince this is the only way to ensure peace and \ndevelopment. \n Thus, Chile strongly supports the reform and \nstrengthening of the United Nations. We support the \nOrganization\u2019s recent efforts in the areas of human \nrights, development and climate change. We favour \nreform and enlargement of the Security Council. We \nwelcome the important work being done by the \nPeacebuilding Commission to provide support from the \noutset to countries emerging from conflict \u2014 support \nthat is comprehensive, not only military. \n That is the logic that should prevail in all spheres. \nWe want the United Nations to spearhead a new global \nsocial covenant, we want the Millennium Development \nGoals to be attained by 2015 and we want to see \n \n \n37 09-52179 \n \nforceful and decisive involvement to mitigate climate \nchange. \n We have spoken about climate change at special \nmeetings during this session. Today I wish simply to \nsound the alarm. Unless we coordinate efforts at the \nhighest level, the forthcoming Copenhagen Conference \nwill not attain its goal. We risk failure on what is the \nmost urgent cause to be taken up by the world at this \ntime when the scientific forecasts made by the \nIntergovernmental Panel in 2007 already seem to fall \nshort of the mark. \n Climate change is not a theory; it is a tangible \nreality that we are witnessing in unusual storms, floods \nand droughts. My country, which is so close to \nAntarctica, is watching in amazement as melting of the \nglaciers and ice platforms on that continent accelerates \nat an inexorable pace. \n The industrialized countries must adopt \nquantifiable goals for more ambitious emission \nreductions than those that now exist. If they assume \ntheir historical responsibility with deeds, and not only \nwords, and if they undertake to provide the necessary \ntechnological and financial support, then the \ndeveloping world will be able to make an even greater \neffort to meet this challenge. \n We thus have the possibility to correct the course \nof our future. Let us not use the economic crisis as an \nexcuse for not reaching an agreement that all our \ncitizens are demanding. Let us today ensure the future \nof our descendants. We have a huge responsibility. For \nthis reason, let us lay the foundations this year, in \nCopenhagen, for a new economy that will allow the \ntwenty-first century to be an era of progress. \n If there is one lesson that we can learn from the \neconomic crisis and from the environmental crisis, it is \nthat the quality of policy matters. Neither the world nor \ncountries are governed on automatic pilot, trailing \nbehind the market, trailing behind globalization, \ntrailing behind social changes. The policy of quality \nhas a positive impact on the well-being of individuals. \n The rule of law, civil liberties and respect for \nhuman rights are all prerequisites for a democracy of \nquality. There is no longer any justification for \nviolating the principle of liberty and democracy in the \nname of justice or equality. Procedural democracy is \npart of the ethical and political common property of the \ninternational community in the twenty-first century. \nAnd little by little, we have started to reinforce this \nprinciple at the level of nations. \n My region, Latin America, has been able \ngradually to build a single vision, which has enabled it, \nfor example, to come rapidly to the aid of any \nthreatened democracy, as was the case in Bolivia one \nyear ago, or to strongly condemn democratic setbacks, \nsuch as occurred in Honduras a few months ago. For \nthis reason, today, with President Zelaya \u2014 who has \npeacefully returned to Honduras \u2014 I wish to reiterate \nour appeal for immediate acceptance of the San Jos\u00e9 \nagreement promoted by the Organization of American \nStates. Honduras deserves free and democratic \nelections, with the constitutional President leading this \nprocess. \n It is thus clear that policy is now more important \nthan ever. Let us make an effort to restore it to its \nrightful place, but, of course, with the quality that \ncitizens deserve. \n What has happened with the crisis, with the \nenvironment, with hunger, with conflicts, is the result \nof a lack of adequate leadership and political dialogue. \nIt is for us, leaders of our countries, to change this \nsituation. It is within our power, first, not to resign \nourselves to the market or to force and, secondly, to \navoid demagogy by trying to construct a fairer order \nfor our peoples through serious and responsible public \npolicies, in an environment of full democracy and \nrespect for human rights. \n This can be the basis for a global social covenant, \nwhich the world is insistently demanding at this \ndifficult time. We must not fail the world."

        "file_text": "In these tumultuous \ntimes marked by manifold crises, we are more than \never in need of a global Organization that all Members \nmake use of and support. We need the United Nations. \nThe comprehensive, universal system of the United \nNations forms the heart of the global system of crisis \nprevention and mitigation. Now more than ever, \nGermany pledges its active and extensive support to \nthis world Organization. \n This past year taught us bitter lessons, and today \nit seems clearer than ever: we must secure the \nsustainability of the economic recovery. That applies \nnot only to the financial sector, but also, and in \nparticular, to the most vulnerable in the world \u2014 the \npoorest of the poor in the developing countries \u2014 as \nwell as to our environment and the world\u2019s climate. \n The consultations on a charter for sustainable \neconomic activity point in the right direction. The \nUnited Nations should be actively involved in that \nprocess. We must turn the crisis into an opportunity for \ndevelopment and a truly green recovery. \n The aftermath of the financial crisis is \njeopardizing our progress on the path towards \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \nTherefore, we must do our utmost to avoid any \nsetbacks in that regard. Donor States must continue \ntheir efforts for development, all the more so in times \nof crisis. Germany has continually increased its official \ndevelopment assistance contributions in recent years. \nIn 2008, my country was the second-largest donor of \nofficial development assistance. We will also \nsignificantly increase our contributions to the \nmultilateral development banks. \n All of this underscores one thing: Germany, as \none of the world\u2019s largest economies, stands by its \nglobal responsibility. But developing countries must \nalso live up to their responsibilities. Responsible \ngovernance, respect for human rights, environmental \nprotection, the fight against epidemics, the \nstrengthening of the rights of women \u2014 those are the \nchallenges that each country has the responsibility to \nmeet. \n Climate change is the pre-eminent challenge of \nthe twenty-first century. It threatens our well-being, \nour security and our economic development. It will \nlead to uncontrollable risks and dramatic damage, if we \ndo not take resolute action \u2014 not in some distant \nfuture, but right now. \n I can assure the Assembly: Germany will \ncontinue to be a leader in climate protection. But we \nwill be successful only if we act together. We need an \ninclusive process in which those countries directly \naffected by climate change, such as the small island \nStates, can also play a part. The United Nations is the \nonly reliable framework for this. I would like to thank \nthe Secretary-General for his very timely initiative in \nconvening a United Nations summit last week \naddressing this key issue. \n Disarmament and arms control can help create \nbetter conditions for global cooperation and increase \nsecurity and stability. We warmly welcome the new \ndynamic in the area of nuclear disarmament. The call \nfor a nuclear-weapon-free world enjoys widespread \nsupport, including that of Germany. We must seize this \nopportunity for progress in all areas of disarmament. \nGermany has underlined that sub-strategic nuclear \nweapons must also be incorporated into the continuing \nprocess of disarmament. Our clear commitment to \nridding the world of all nuclear weapons is the best \nway to strengthen the international non-proliferation \nregime. \n We need a new international consensus at the \n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the \nlaunching of negotiations in Geneva on a fissile \nmaterial cut-off treaty and the entry into force of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In order to \navoid a conflict of objectives between \nnon-proliferation and peaceful uses, Germany supports \nmultilateral solutions to nuclear-fuel supply and has \nput forward its own proposal on that issue. \n The international community must not relent in \nits commitment to banning all weapons of mass \ndestruction. A model in that respect is the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, which outlaws a whole category \nof weapons of mass destruction. Its implementing \norganization needs strong and dynamic leadership. \nGermany has always had a particular commitment to \n \n \n55 09-52604 \n \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, and we stand ready \nto accept greater responsibility in that organization. \n We view the ongoing nuclear programme in Iran \nwith great concern. The belated admittance by Iran \nconcerning the construction of a second enrichment \nplant underlines the fact that our concerns are more \nthan justified. Even before this latest event, the report \nby International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \nDirector-General El Baradei emphasized the urgency of \nthe matter. Unfortunately, the Iranian Government still \nrefuses to cooperate fully with the IAEA and to remove \nserious doubts concerning the peaceful character of its \nnuclear programme. We urge Iran to grant an IAEA \nverification team access to the newly disclosed site \nwithout delay. \n We sincerely hope that Iran will use the \nopportunity of the upcoming talks between it and the \nE3+3 \u2014 the United Kingdom, France and Germany, \nplus the United States, the Russian Federation and \nChina \u2014 to demonstrate its willingness to engage in \nhonest and speedy negotiations. If Iran\u2019s leaders \ncontinue to stall, the international community will have \nno other choice but to take additional measures to \nemphasize the seriousness of our common concern. \n Iran has a long and great history. It witnessed the \norigins of civilization. It can become an anchor of \nstability in its region \u2014 a respected member of the \ninternational community. But that involves, in addition \nto a diplomatic resolution of questions regarding its \nnuclear programme, a responsible foreign policy \ntowards its neighbours. The key to this is the \nrecognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist. \n Since the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip \nat the beginning of the year, we have seen some \nencouraging signs of a return to the peace process. The \nresumption of negotiations aimed at the two-State \nsolution is still possible. Germany strongly supports \nPresident Obama\u2019s intensive commitment and regional \napproach. Together with the partners of the European \nUnion, we are prepared to support efforts towards \npeace through concrete contributions. What we now \nneed, however, are courageous gestures of goodwill on \nall sides to create the conditions for serious talks. \n The successful holding of elections in June was \nan important milestone towards the continuing \nstabilization of Lebanon. What is now important is that \na new Government soon be formed. The successful \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) \nmission remains a crucial contribution to securing the \nceasefire between Lebanon and Israel, and thus to the \nstabilization of the region. By again assuming \ncommand of the UNIFIL Maritime Task Force on \n1 September, we further strengthened our commitment \nto UNIFIL. \n For Afghanistan, 2009 is a pivotal year. The \npresidential elections \u2014 the first elections in decades \nthat were free and organized by the Afghans \nthemselves \u2014 determined who will control the fate of \nthe country over the next five years. They were an \nimpressive sign of the resolve of the people of \nAfghanistan to take part in the political process. \n Against the backdrop of the difficult security \nsituation, the further build-up of Afghan security forces \nassumes even greater importance. We will, therefore, \ncontinue to increase the number of German police \ninstructors in Afghanistan, we will support the further \nbuild-up of the European Union Police Mission, and \nwe will help to advance the training of the Afghan \narmy within the framework of the International \nSecurity Assistance Force. \n Despite all the criticism, there are also \nencouraging accomplishments, especially in the field \nof economic growth and in the reconstruction of the \ncountry\u2019s infrastructure. The basic prerequisites for \nAfghanistan\u2019s sustainable development are good \ngovernance, a resolute fight against corruption and an \nimprovement in State services. These are essential if \nthe population is to once again nurture hope for the \nfuture. As one of the largest troop-contributing nations \nand one of the main bilateral donors, Germany will \ncontinue to play an instrumental role in the \nreconstruction of the country. \n Following the presidential elections, we are now \nentering a new phase of cooperation between the \ninternational community and Afghanistan. For that \nreason, Germany, together with the United Kingdom \nand France, has taken the initiative to hold an \ninternational conference that will set out concrete, \nrealistic and measurable goals for the future political \nand economic development of Afghanistan. To that \nend, the Afghanistan Compact, which will expire in \n2010, should be further developed. \n In 2010, we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary \nof the independence of no fewer than 17 African \nStates \u2014 a fitting moment to also look to the future. \nDespite the global economic crisis, the overall outlook \n  \n \n09-52604 56 \n \nfor Africa and its people is positive. We must succeed \nin utilizing the continent\u2019s enormous potential in terms \nof people, creativity and resources. It remains our \nchallenge to support the development of that potential \nwhile, at the same time, respecting African ownership. \n African ownership should by no means be \nequated with a withdrawal from our neighbouring \ncontinent. On the contrary, it means that we should \ncultivate relations with the States of Africa in a spirit \nof partnership \u2014 a partnership in which each side \nintroduces its ideas, and in which we work together to \nmaster the challenges we face, whether locally or \nglobally. \n One major common challenge remains the \ncontainment of violence and the protection of people in \nconflict areas. Germany will continue its extensive \nengagement in Africa, be it in the area of development \ncooperation, peace and security, business and \ntechnology, the environmental and energy sector or \neducational and scientific cooperation. This also \napplies to cooperation with the African Union, which \nhas been expanding increasingly in recent years. \n United Nations peacekeeping missions are a \ncentral pillar of the international security architecture. \nReform of United Nations peacekeeping is an urgent \nissue, and Germany is ready to actively contribute to \nsuch reform. \n It is absolutely essential that the cooperation \nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \nbe further intensified. The European Union has just \nshown that, with its peacekeeping missions in \nAfrica \u2014 those in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo and Chad, to name just two examples \u2014 it is a \nreliable partner of the United Nations when it comes to \ncrisis management. \n We are facing a multitude of global challenges. \nToday, no country is strong enough to tackle those \nchallenges on its own. We need a universal forum for \njoint global action. That is why we need a strong \nUnited Nations that is capable of taking effective \naction. \n A long chain of high-level meetings \u2014 from the \n2005 High-level Event to the Secretary-General\u2019s \nSummit on Climate Change last week \u2014 has \nemphasized how urgent it is to adapt the United \nNations to the challenges of today\u2019s world, for threats \nhave become global. Our responses, however, are still \nnot always global, and that is true for the United \nNations as well. \n Reforms must start with simple questions. Does a \nparticular body effectively fulfil its tasks? Does its \ncomposition reflect the world of today? Where that is \nnot the case, reform must have a clear objective: to \nmake the United Nations more effective, more credible \nand more assertive. \n However, we must not limit reforms to the United \nNations. If we want to deal effectively with the current \ncrisis and effectively prevent future crises, we must \nalso reform the international financial institutions. \nIsolated reforms of individual institutions will not get \nus anywhere. Reform of the financial institutions and \nof the United Nations must intermesh as a broader \nreform of global governance \u2014 a reform that, more \nthan six decades after the founding of today\u2019s world \norder, is long overdue. Germany, incidentally, is \nadvocating at a high level the improved representation \nof newly industrialized and developing countries as \npart of the reform of the international financial \ninstitutions. This is our understanding of global \ngovernance: fair participation for everybody. \n In 2000 and 2005, heads of State and Government \ncalled for reform of the Security Council. They did so \nout of the realization that we can meet the threats of \ntoday only if the Council reflects the world of today. \nOne thing is clear: if the Security Council does not \nreform itself, there is a risk that other bodies will \nattempt to take its place. Such a rivalry would be \ndetrimental to us all. Let us therefore attempt, at this \nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, to bring \nabout concrete results. \n Germany has been and remains willing to take \nresponsibility. That includes assuming a permanent \nseat on a reformed Security Council. We also underline \nthis readiness to take responsibility with our candidacy \nfor a non-permanent seat on the Council for the period \n2011-2012. Through our work in the Security Council, \nwe want to contribute to the success of the United \nNations, just as we are already contributing to \nworldwide United Nations missions, to development \nfunds, humanitarian aid and the United Nations \nEnvironment Programme. Now and in the future, we \nwill work to find common interests, to overcome \ndivisions and to strengthen a global partnership of \nresponsibility."

        "file_text": "I \nwould like to congratulate the President of the General \nAssembly and reiterate to the United Nations our \ngratitude for its positive presence and cooperation with \nthe Colombian people. \n The Government over which I preside aims to \nenhance the confidence of the national and \ninternational community in Colombia. This quest for \nconfidence is based on three pillars: security with \ndemocratic values, the promotion of investment and \nentrepreneurship with social responsibility, and social \ncohesion with freedoms. \n We continue with our security advances, but also \nthere are some outstanding challenges. I would like to \nhighlight some intangible achievements that attest to \nthe democratic credentials of our security project.  \n We have recovered two monopolies that we \nshould never have lost: the monopoly of institutional \nforces to fight criminals and the monopoly of justice \nthat the terrorists tried to dislodge. We have dismantled \nparamilitarism, a term that emerged to describe private \ncriminal gangs whose objective was to fight drug-\ntrafficking guerrillas. Today, the State is the only entity \nthat fights all those criminals. Those criminals in all \ntheir forms \u2014 narco-guerrillas, criminal gangs \u2014 are \npart of a mafia-type relationship that unites them or \npits them against each other to distribute or fight over \nthe gains of the criminal drug business.  \n Justice, with the Supreme Court that was attacked \nin 1985 by drug traffickers and guerrillas; justice, \nwhich was tormented by the threats to and \nassassination of judges and was dislodged in many \nregions by the terrorists leaders of guerrillas and \nparamilitary groups that attempted to replace it; justice \nhas, throughout the entire country, regained its full \neffectiveness. \n Victims did not complain out of fear of retaliation \nor because they thought it was pointless. Now, thanks \nto the recovery of our security, we have registered \n239,758 victims, whose situations we are determined to \nremedy, a remedy that is never complete but which will \nlead little by little to reconciliation by overcoming of \nthe spirit of vengeance and hatred. \n We have regained the independence of \ndecentralization and of political exercise. Terrorism \nhad displaced 30 per cent of our mayors, stolen and \ncorrupted municipal and departmental budgets and \nexercised coercion within the public sector. Mayors \nhave regained their security so that they may freely \ncarry out their duties and transparently manage their \nresources. Politics is now expressed freely in all \nspectrums of thought. This terrorist threat has been \ntackled without martial law, with full civil and political \nguarantees and absolute respect for the freedom that we \npromote with security.  \n We are working to improve the effectiveness of \nour public forces as well as respect for human rights. \nWe do not hesitate to punish those who violate them, \nbut neither do we refrain from defending our soldiers \nand policemen who sometimes have been victims of a \ndirty legal war. Colombia has voluntarily presented \nitself to a United Nations human rights review.  \n Furthermore, despite the suffering caused by \nlandmines that had been planted by terrorist groups, the \nState destroyed those that were used by its public \nforces for training purposes. Our country is one of the \nleaders of the Ottawa Convention to destroy these \nlandmines and will host the next meeting of States \nparties in Cartagena. \n  \n \n09-52228 14 \n \n We tackle terrorism with the utmost \ndetermination, and we practise democracy fervently. \nThat is why the doors of Colombia have been open \nwithout restriction to international vigilance. We \ndeliberate and disagree, but both impartial observers \nand biased critics have had complete freedom to \nexpress themselves in Colombia. \n Our interest does not lie in the fanatical \nconfrontation between left and right, which is as \ndangerous as it is obsolete. Rather, we are betting on a \nmodern democracy, a democracy that is safe and free, \nthat builds social cohesion, a democracy with \nindependent institutions and with confidence that stems \nfrom the transparency that is based on a high level of \ncivic participation. \n We have not been able to completely overcome \nthe problem of displacement, but we have increased \nour budget twelvefold to help displaced persons. We \npromote trust between public forces and communities \nso that those who fight drug trafficking are not \nthwarted by the displacement that is caused by drug \ntraffickers. \n We have demobilized 51,783 members of terrorist \ngroups, whose numbers have dropped from around \n60,000 to fewer than 8,000. We have been extremely \ngenerous with those who have been demobilized and \nextremely severe with the 7 per cent who have returned \nto crime. The Justice and Peace Law, which covers \nthem, made it possible to report 29,555 criminal acts, \n12,104 confessions, the discovery of 2,043 graves with \n2,492 corpses, the identification of 708 bodies and the \nreturn of 581 to their families. The participation of \nvictims and new procedures for restitution and \nrestoration of their rights are a decisive component of \nthis demobilization process. \n Terrorism cannot be ignored in the name of good \ninternational relations. To the contrary, multilateralism \nand diplomacy must lead to collaborative action among \nStates to overcome this tragedy and its corollaries, \nincluding arms trafficking, illicit drugs, money and \nasset laundering and terrorist havens. \n We reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism in \nall its legitimate expressions, from organizations of \nneighbouring countries to the most global \nOrganization, but we believe that multilateralism must \ndemonstrate that it is effective in defeating \ninternational crime. \n Colombia has acknowledged its internal problem \nof narco-terrorism. We have carried out a heroic \nstruggle that will ultimately prevail. We cooperate with \nthe international community and we ask for more \neffective cooperation. We are cooperating with Mexico, \nGuatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, Haiti, the Dominican \nRepublic, Peru, Afghanistan and other countries. We \nacknowledge the efforts of the United States to work \ntogether with us to make progress in dismantling \nnarco-terrorism. We request greater cooperation from \nmore countries and from the international community. \nOur objective is to restore domestic security and never \nto participate in the arms race for the bloody game of \ninternational warfare. Our tradition is one of respect \nfor the global community. \n We are concerned that, instead of progress \ntowards greater cooperation to ensure the security, \npeace and tranquillity of the citizens of all countries, \nthere is an acceleration of the arms race. Some justify \nit by citing the need to modernize their military \nequipment, while others admit their desire for war. \n Multilateral agencies, led by the United Nations, \nmust strengthen their action so that Governments will \nfulfil their duty to protect their citizens and their \nobligation not to attack the international community. \n In Colombia, the only reason for terrorism is the \ndrug trade. Its violent criminals used to deny being \ninvolved in narco-terrorism and to try to appear \nideological; today, having lost all sense of decency, \nthey cannot hide their criminal enterprise or feign \nideological postures, which are negated by their cruelty \ntowards their victims and those whom they have \nkidnapped. The democratic transparency of our \ncountry, which they tried to destroy, ensures that they \nwill never be acceptable. \n We have a different view of co-responsibility and \nof the proposal that drugs be legalized. The former \ndivision between producer and consumer countries has \ndisappeared. Colombia began as a trafficking territory, \nburst into production and now suffers as a consumer. \nThose who began as consumers increase production. \nAll peoples are exposed to the risks of drug production, \ntrafficking and consumption. Co-responsibility must \nthus be exercised in accordance with its real meaning: \na task that belongs to all of us, without any \nreservations. \n We believe that, instead of advocating the \nlegalization of drugs, we should consider the need to \n \n \n15 09-52228 \n \ncriminalize consumption. There is no consistency \nbetween toughness when it comes to production and \ntrafficking and permissiveness when it comes to \nconsumption. That has led to deadly micro-trafficking \nin cities, the promotion of consumption by adolescents \nand young people and the involvement of children in \nthe criminal trade. We are making progress in the \nconstitutional process of criminalizing consumption, \ntaking care not to confuse the sick addict with the \ncriminal distributor.  \n Our Government is promoting investment and \nentrepreneurship as ways to overcome poverty and \nbuild equity. Colombia is moving forward in terms of \ncompetitiveness and confidence. Investment must \nperform a function of social responsibility to acquire \npopular legitimacy in democratic societies. Social \nresponsibility \u2014 not speculation \u2014 is inseparable from \ncapital as a significant factor in social-wealth creation. \nThe economic crisis is a crisis of speculation, rather \nthan of creative free enterprise. We are confident that \nthe necessary conventions will be adopted to avoid the \nrisks created by speculative money transfers and \nfinancial market speculation. We fear a new era of \nprotectionism and the selective closure of developed \neconomies, which would impede sustainable economic \nrecovery. \n Social responsibility is inseparable from the fight \nagainst climate change. Colombia is a net producer of \noxygen and emits insignificant amounts of carbon \ndioxide. However, we are highly vulnerable, as shown \nby the winter tragedies in recent years, which have \ncaused losses in terms of human life, production and \nhigh service costs. We support tougher international \nconventions to protect the environment. We hope that \nthe Copenhagen conference will produce effective \nbinding instruments so that it will not be another dead \nletter. \n Our main contribution to the fight against climate \nchange is the preservation of our 578,000-square-\nkilometre rainforest, which constitutes more than \n51 per cent of our national territory and the majority of \nwhich lies along the Amazon. We have as a concrete \npolicy the forest ranger family programme, which has \ninvolved more than 90,000 rural families in the \ncollective effort to protect the rainforest, keep it free \nfrom the shadow of illicit drugs and ensure its recovery \nwhere it has been destroyed. The State pays a bonus to \nthose families. The programme, supervised by the \nUnited Nations, has received the highest rating from \nthe Organization. \n In Colombia, forest ranger families protect the \nAmazon rainforest from predatory drugs; elsewhere in \nthe world, a similar model could preserve trees in order \nto mitigate climate change. \n Clean energy, mass transportation systems and \nthe protection of water sources are essential actions in \nour contribution to the fight against global warming. \nColombia, at more than 1 million litres per day, is the \nsecond-largest Latin American producer of ethanol \nfrom sugar cane and, at 1.8 million litres per day, the \nlargest producer of biodiesel from African palm. The \nconditions in our country make it possible to increase \nthose outputs without destroying the rainforest or \nlimiting food security. \n We have introduced incentives for other clean \nenergies such as solar and wind energy, the \ndevelopment of which remains small despite their great \npotential. \n We are working on building nine mass \ntransportation systems in major cities and are now in \nthe process of incorporating another 10 that are \nproportionally sized, with a view to replacing \nindividual transportation with collective transportation. \n Eleven per cent of our national territory has been \ndesignated a protected area. In natural sanctuaries such \nas the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, which is the \nhighest coastal sanctuary in the world, agreements with \nindigenous communities are being implemented. In \nexchange for security, the recovery of lands and the \nbuilding of seven out of nine promised villages, they \nhave once again taken over the noble task of preserving \nforests and water sources. \n We gain nothing from security, investment, \nhealth, education or any other social cohesion policy if \nwe do not attach equal importance to the environment. \nWe understand this in a \u201cmega-diverse\u201d nation that \ncontains 14 per cent of the planet\u2019s diversity and ranks \nsecond \u2014 behind Brazil \u2014 in terms of plant and \nanimal species and first in terms of amphibians and \nbirds. \n Our fervent desire is to increase the Human \nOpportunity Index in order to eliminate poverty, build \nequity and guarantee every possible alternative for new \ngenerations. We propose to include in the measuring of \nthe Index progress and setbacks in environmental \n  \n \n09-52228 16 \n \npolicies. Opportunities are pointless without \nenvironmental protection. Let us be effective in our \nfight against climate change so that we do not condemn \nthe future inhabitants of the Earth to a planetary \nholocaust."

        "file_text": "Let me start by expressing my \nsincere congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on \nhis assumption to the presidency of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. \n This year marks important milestones for Timor-\nLeste. Ten years ago, the United Nations sponsored the \npopular referendum held in my country, marking the \ntransition to full independence. Seven years ago, we \nattained full sovereignty with the restoration of our \nindependence and began, for the first time in the \nhistory of our nation, the challenging process of \nnation-building. \n \n \n35 09-52604 \n \n We have been assisted by successive United \nNations missions, which began by exercising, for the \nfirst time in the history of the United Nations, full \nadministrative powers in Timor-Leste. This process has \nbeen undertaken a very limited number of times in this \nnew millennium. \n Naturally, there are always failures and successes \nin decisions taken and policies adopted, and those form \npart of our collective challenge on the nation-building \nroad. This is true for both established and newly \nestablished States. Timor-Leste has been both \nshowcased as a success story of the United Nations and \nhastily characterized by some as a failed State. \n I stand here today, not to argue on behalf of one \nview or another, much less to duel over the past. I am \nhere to describe what Timor-Leste is today, what we \nhave been able to do, our modest achievements and \nremaining challenges, but most importantly, how we, \nas a new and small nation-State, situate ourselves in \nthe community of nations. \n We also want to be part of the solutions to the \nunprecedented challenges facing humanity in this new \nmillennium. Today we talk about global problems that \nare the responsibility of all of us, requiring concerted \nand collective action, and Timor-Leste is ready to \nassume its part of that responsibility. \n Let me also stress, however, that I am able to be \nhere today because it was through the United Nations \nthat a solution was found to what was then termed the \n\u201cQuestion of East Timor\u201d. It was the United Nations \nthat shouldered the responsibility of finding a just \nsolution to that question and that was, indeed, \nsuccessful in doing so. \n The decision to engage with the United Nations \nwas a wise one, taken by the then leaders of the \nresistance, who are today our elder statesmen, our \nesteemed President of the Republic, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ramos-\nHorta, and the Prime Minister, Mr. Kay Rala Xanana \nGusm\u00e3o. \n The underlining policy of seeking to resolve \nconflict through peaceful means and of deferring to the \nUnited Nations Charter so as to enable the exercise of \nthe universal right to self-determination is a \nfundamental principle embraced by the new generation \nof Timorese leaders. The engagement with the United \nNations continues to be the policy of Timor-Leste \ntoday. \n Timor-Leste has benefited greatly from this \nengagement, through the dedicated work of successive \nUnited Nations missions and through the presence and \nwork of various United Nations agencies, funds and \nprogrammes. The United Nations administrative role in \nTimor-Leste under the capable leadership of our dear \nfriend, the late Sergio Vieira de Mello, was without \nprecedence. Could the United Nations have done things \ndifferently in those earlier and subsequent years and \nhow can we best use this partnership to move forward? \n Without a doubt the most valuable contribution of \nTimor-Leste to lessons learned and how to apply those \nlessons for future situations involved United Nations \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. One of the most \nimportant lessons is that it takes time to build national \ncapacities and sustainable institutions. \n Young nations like ours have to evaluate and \nbalance many priorities among various pressing \nsocio-economic requirements, including the provision \nof basic social services, building State institutions and \ndeveloping capacities. We have to balance justice with \npeace and reconciliation. This involves prioritizing \nmany urgent demands and sequencing actions. There \nare no quick fixes or short-term solutions. \n Timor-Leste has been the subject of a staggering \nnumber of evaluations and studies, about three \nthousand in number, including some on United Nations \nwork in the country. As our contribution to the lessons \nlearned for the United Nations, I have proposed that \nTimor-Leste, as the beneficiary of what has been done \nand in order to provide a country-based perspective, \nshould itself conduct an evaluation of all that has been \ndone in the country by the international community, \nand of how the benefits of these actions, or otherwise, \nhave been experienced and felt in the country by the \nTimorese themselves. \n The experience of the United Nations Integrated \nMission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) has shown the need \nfor a longer term engagement by the United Nations. \nThe crisis in Timor-Leste in 2006 was an unfortunate \nreminder of the fragility of peace when State \ninstitutions are still weak, capacities still need to be \nstrengthened, and all competing social, economic and \npolitical needs cannot be met. The cost of dealing with \nthe regression to violence in 2006 has been high for the \ninternational community, including the United Nations \nand our development partners, as well as for the \nTimorese Government itself. UNMIT\u2019s mandate to help \n  \n \n09-52604 36 \n \nreconstruct our security forces and provide support for \nour justice system is central, and the Mission is still \nneeded to ensure long-term peace and stability in our \ncountry. \n The Government of Timor-Leste has continued to \nmake significant achievements, although we still face \nchallenges. Some of the main problems from the 2006 \ncrisis have been resolved. Internally displaced persons \nhave been peacefully reintegrated into their \ncommunities, the security forces are being \nreconstituted, although they still require capacity-\nbuilding and strengthening, and gang violence has been \nstopped. Our State institutions are fully functioning, \nand the Government can now concentrate more on \ndevelopment. \n I wish to emphasize the importance that we \ncontinue to place on relations with Indonesia, where \nwe have taken a pragmatic approach and base our \nrelations on reconciliation and the principle of looking \nforward. We cannot deny, or undo, what has happened \nin the past we share, but we are determined to be \nreconciled with that past, because we know we can \nprogress and do much for the future. I am part of a new \ngeneration of leaders in Timor-Leste, and neither we \ncollectively nor I personally have been spared the grief \nand loss experienced by most of Timor-Leste\u2019s \npopulation. But I know that my responsibility is to \nprevent what happened in Timor-Leste in the past from \never happening again. Timor-Leste and Indonesia are \nboth countries in transition, and we should be allowed \nto search for our own path, as President Obama has \nsaid, conscious that our path may not be perfect. \n This is a complex process that requires a \nTimorese solution. I am sure that other countries that \nhave been in conflict have appreciated the long-term \nsupport of the international community as they tackled \nthe same problems that we are facing. Timor-Leste has \nnot in any way turned its back on justice. Our \nConstitution enshrines the rule of law in our country, \nand the Government\u2019s policy is to fully strengthen the \njustice system. We are being aided in this by the \ninternational community, and we are fully cognizant \nthat we will continue to need its assistance in years to \ncome. Our Government has been severely criticized, \nboth internationally and nationally, on some positions \nthat we have adopted and some decisions that have \nbeen taken. However, they were taken in the conviction \nthat we need to be reconciled with our past and ensure \npeace for current and future generations, and we stand \nby those decisions. \n Timor-Leste today has its own set of challenges, \nwhich may appear distant from the emerging \nchallenges facing humankind in general and presented \nat this forum. Timor-Leste continues to be concerned \nwith alleviating and reducing poverty and high \nunemployment, addressing the needs of the rural \npopulation and establishing and consolidating State \ninstitutions so they can better respond to the needs of \nall of our people. But that does not mean that Timor-\nLeste has its head in the sand and is unaware of other \nchallenges. Our young nation will need time to address \nand overcome all of these challenges. \n As part of the community of nations and \nhumankind, Timor-Leste is also concerned with all that \nthreatens life on this planet, and has expressed its \nviews. In fact, as a Member of the United Nations, \nTimor-Leste has expressed its position in the General \nAssembly on a number of important issues. We wish to \nreiterate our opposition to the economic sanctions \nimposed on Cuba by the United States, and we reaffirm \nour support for the General Assembly resolutions of \nthe past 17 years that have called on the United States \nto lift those sanctions. \n It is not Timor-Leste\u2019s intention to develop \nnuclear capacity or become a nuclear power, and we \nhave therefore ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We \ncounsel caution in the development of and use of \nnuclear capacity. With regard to climate change, Timor-\nLeste, although an island State, is fortunate not to be \nimmediately threatened by rising sea levels, nor is it \nresponsible for large carbon emissions. But we are \naffected by changing weather patterns and we are \nfollowing the climate-change debate. At the national \nlevel, we are naturally concerned with the preservation \nof our environment and consider reforestation and \nprotection of the environment important issues. \n As far as the financial and economic crisis is \nconcerned, Timor-Leste has been fortunate to have \nexperienced only partial impact. However, we are also \nconcerned with the causes of the crisis, and we are \nlooking to learn the lessons about what to avoid in \nbuilding our financial systems and institutions. In light \nof this, we support the decisions taken at the recent \nmeeting of the G-20 in Pittsburgh on taking preventive \nmeasures for the future. \n \n \n37 09-52604 \n \n In conclusion, allow me, on behalf of our \nGovernment, to express our gratitude to the United \nNations and our international partners for their \ncontinued support of Timor-Leste. We stand resolutely \nwith you to contribute to solutions to our collective \nchallenges, and we are resolved to find solutions to our \nown national challenges. "

        "file_text": "I \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly. I wish you every \nsuccess in your noble mission and recognize your long \nexperience in international political affairs. I also \nextend our greetings and thanks to former President, \nHis Excellency Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, \nwhose positions and active efforts reflected the spirit \nand principles of this international organization, which \nis headed by His Excellency Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, whom I also salute. I express our \nappreciation for everything he has done personally and \nthrough the organs and agencies of the United Nations, \nnotably the United Nations Relief and Works Agency \nfor Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), to \nassist the Palestinian people and defend their rights.  \n During this session we have a full agenda before \nus. The peoples of the whole world are looking to this \nbody to determine what can be done to save our planet \nfrom the effects of climate change and global warming \nand to address the world financial crisis. Many \ncountries, including small and developing countries, \nsee the need to reform the United Nations, including \nthe Security Council, so as to reflect the reality of the \ncurrent international situation and to ensure more \ncomprehensive representation of the international \ncommunity.  \n These common concerns must not overshadow \nthe fact that serious problems face the Middle East \nregion in particular, first and foremost the lack of \ncommitment to the Charter of the United Nations and \nthe extent to which the resolutions of the General \nAssembly and the Security Council are actually being \nimplemented without the application of double \nstandards. Everyone agrees on the need to achieve \npeace in the Middle East, to counter extremism and \nviolence, and to establish the region as a zone free of \nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction. Yet the larger wound and deeper tragedy \nremains the suffering of our Palestinian people since \nthe Nakba \u2014 the catastrophe \u2014 more than 60 years \nago, to which the United Nations is a living witness. Its \narchives contain not dozens but hundreds of resolutions \nthat have not been implemented. \n The suffering of the Palestinian people as a result \nof Israel\u2019s settler occupation is crystal clear to the \nworld. Since the occupation of the West Bank and the \nGaza Strip, including East Jerusalem, in 1967, Israel \nhas continued with its settlement policy on all \nPalestinian land, especially in holy Jerusalem, where \nthat policy is being accelerated and escalated by many \nmeans, including the seizure of the homes of \nPalestinians in the city, the imposition of restrictions, \neven preventing Palestinians from building and \nsometimes from repairing their homes while new \nsettlement neighbourhoods are established. Jerusalem \nis becoming completely isolated from its surroundings \nbecause of the illegal settlements and the apartheid \nwall. \n We now face a unique situation. If international \nlaw stipulates the inadmissibility of the acquisition of \nthe territory of others by force, how can we then deal \nwith the current situation where Israeli settlement \npolicies are undermining the goal of establishing a \ngeographically contiguous Palestinian State in \nimplementation of the will of the international \nconsensus? That consensus is reflected in the many \nresolutions and principles, including the Road Map, \nwhich we all agreed upon and which is based on the \n \n \n31 09-52463 \n \nprinciple of land for peace and on an end to the \noccupation that began in 1967. \n Immense efforts have been exerted and many \nconferences have been held over the years, particularly \nsince the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Yet all \nof this has not led to an end to the conflict. President \nBarack Obama gave much hope to our people and the \npeoples of the region when he announced his vision for \na peace agreement on the basis of a two-State solution \nand the cessation of all settlement activities. We \nwelcomed the active American diplomacy to revive the \npeace process and all efforts of the international \nQuartet and its members: the United Nations, the \nEuropean Union, the Russian Federation and the \nUnited States.  \n All these active efforts and initiatives, which \nhave been welcomed and supported by us and by the \nArab States, are however confronted by the \nintransigence of Israel, which refuses to adhere to the \nrequirements for relaunching the peace process. How is \nit conceivable that negotiations can be held on the \nborders and on Jerusalem while Israeli bulldozers are \nworking to change the reality on the ground with the \naim of creating a new reality and imposing the borders \nthat Israel desires? How can one conceive of holding \nnegotiations without agreement on the terms of \nreference and the objective of those negotiations, \nwhich the whole world has unanimously agreed upon, \nnamely ending the Israeli occupation of the territories \noccupied in 1967, establishing the State of Palestine, \nwith Jerusalem as its capital, reaching a just and agreed \nupon solution to the question of Palestinian refugees on \nthe basis of resolution 194 (III) of 1948, and achieving \npeace on all the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese \ntracks, as affirmed in the Arab Peace Initiative, which \nprovides a precious opportunity that must be seized to \nachieve peace? \n In this regard, I should like to express our deep \nappreciation of the important speech delivered to the \nAssembly by President Obama two days ago (see \n), in which he affirmed the necessity of \nending the occupation that began in 1967 and the \nillegitimacy of the settlements. He also stressed the \nneed to establish an independent, sovereign and viable \nPalestinian State and to address all the final-status \nissues in the negotiations, foremost among these \nJerusalem, refugees, borders, water and settlements, \nalong with others. We reiterate that adherence to these \nprinciples, in addition to a complete freeze on all \nsettlement activities, can salvage the peace process and \nopen horizons for its success. \n I reaffirm the eagerness of the Palestine \nLiberation Organization to achieve a just, lasting and \ncomprehensive peace in accordance with the \nresolutions of international legitimacy. At the same \ntime, I caution that the settlement policy and the \nbuilding of the separation wall, which continue to be \npursued by the Israeli occupation, will abort \nopportunities to relaunch the peace process. Time is \nrunning out and the risks are becoming greater as a \nresult of the continued suffering of the Palestinian \npeople under the last remaining occupation in the \nworld.  \n We call upon the international community to \nuphold international law and international legitimacy \nand to exert pressure on Israel to cease its settlement \nactivities, to comply with the agreements it has signed, \nto cease its policies of occupation and colonial \nsettlement, to release the approximately 11,000 \nprisoners and detainees and to lift the unjust siege \nimposed on the Gaza Strip, which was subjected \nmonths ago to devastating aggression claiming \nthousands of civilian casualties among and causing \nunprecedented destruction of infrastructure and public \nfacilities, including hospitals, mosques, schools and \neven United Nations facilities. \n Our people, which continues to demand its rights \nand to be determined to remain in its homeland despite \nall of the suffering caused by the detentions, the \nblockade and the killings, is also keen to end internal \ndivision and to restore national unity. Our sister, Egypt, \nis making commendable efforts to achieve that goal.  \n In spite of all our suffering from the occupation \nand its practices, we continue to work to build and \ndevelop our national institutions. We have made \nsignificant progress in this regard both in upholding the \nrule of law and public order and in promoting \neconomic and social development, despite the harsh \nconditions of the occupation and the blockade. We \ncontinue to make every possible effort for the success \nof the efforts of our brothers in Egypt to end the \nongoing coup in the Gaza Strip and to restore our \nnational unity by resorting to the ballot box and \nholding presidential and legislative elections on their \nconstitutional date under the supervision and control of \nArab and Islamic countries, the United Nations and the \n  \n \n09-52463 32 \n \ninternational community. In that way, democracy will \nbe firmly institutionalized in our political life. \n Hope will remain alive in our souls and we will \nnot despair of regaining our rights on the basis of \nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations, the historic \nrole of which we reaffirm for attaining peace and \nupholding the principle of \u201cmight for right\u201d and not \n\u201cright for might\u201d.  \n From this rostrum, I conclude by reaffirming our \ncommitment to the Road Map, the Arab Peace \nInitiative and to all terms of reference of the political \nprocess. We call upon all parties to respect and abide \nby them to provide the opportunity to launch a \nsuccessful and effective peace process. We are \nconfident that all our brothers in sisterly Arab countries \nwill adhere to the Arab Peace Initiative as a basis for \nsafeguarding our rights and opening the way towards \ngenuine peaceful relations with Israel once the \noccupation is ended and the independent State of \nPalestine is established."

        "file_text": "\nI wish first of all to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. Knowing his \nbroad experience in the United Nations and his \ndedication to dialogue and consensus, I assure him that \nPeru will constructively support his initiatives. \n The global outlook is extremely complex and full \nof great contradictions. We face the deepest economic \nand financial international crisis that our generation \nhas experienced and which once again proves that the \nborders in a global world are purely cartographic and \nthat the symbol of our times remains interdependency. \nThe economic and financial crisis has stymied world \n  \n \n09-52598 6 \n \ngrowth and, above all, exposed the weaknesses that \ncaused the market to malfunction. As rarely in recent \nhistory, the international community has mobilized \nhuge resources and political capital to avoid \nunprecedented economic collapse. A significant share \nof those resources must support the developing \ncountries, which certainly did not cause the crisis but \nare the most affected by it. \n It is regrettable that the convergence of wills and \ninterests with regard to the crisis is, in turn, not \napparent with equal resolve in the endeavour to achieve \nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to \nfirmly address the threats that endanger freedom, \ndemocracy and, ultimately, regional and global \nstability. \n In that context, allow me to point out that one \ncrucial problem we face is the huge sums spent on \narms acquisitions. How can we explain to our peoples \nthat, in the midst of one of the worst global economic \nrecessions and with more than 1 billion people living in \nextreme poverty throughout the world, countries can \ncommit over $1,464 billion to military expenditure in \n2008, and that, while economies contract, arms \npurchases grow in real terms every year? \n Recently, the President of Peru, Mr. Alan Garc\u00eda, \nin a communication to South America\u2019s ministers for \nforeign affairs and of defence that is being circulated \nas a document of this General Assembly (A/64/367), \nseriously questioned that state of affairs in the region \nand asked why, in the five years since the \nestablishment of the Union of South American Nations, \nour countries have allocated for military spending a \ntotal of $156 billion, but in addition have acquired \napproximately $23 billion more in new weapons, \ncannons, aircraft and ships. That figure could reach \n$38 billion this year. The President appealed for that \nabsurdity to stop if conditions are created for a \nstrengthening of security and confidence in the region. \n To that end, on this occasion I affirm Peru\u2019s \nproposal that a friendship and non-aggression pact be \nconcluded to guarantee the commitments to \nstrengthening a zone of peace in South America, and to \nachieve the gradual reduction of arms purchases and \nthe future establishment of a peace and interposition \nforce to avert any conflict in the region. The final \nobjective would be to create a regional collective \nsecurity system that complements and is upheld by the \nCharter of the United Nations, enabling all our \ncountries to end the arms race in which South America, \na region that is otherwise demonstrating great maturity \nand respect for international law in the handling of its \ndisputes, seems to be engaged for no discernible \nreason. Our proposal will certainly require greater \nstudy and consideration in the light of experiences in \nother parts of the world. \n A second transnational threat that is not receiving \ndue attention is drug trafficking and its dangerous link \nto terrorism and violence in general, the consequences \nof which affect not only the security and rights of \nmillions of people, but also the environment. We are \npaying an enormous price through our inaction \nconcerning a problem that causes millions of deaths a \nyear and tremendous material losses. \n At the global level, the traffic in drugs brings in \naround $500 billion a year, equivalent to 8 per cent of \nglobal trade, while, according to data of the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, their use affects \nover 200 million people, in particular young people, \nthroughout the world. \n According to the 2008 report of the International \nNarcotics Control Board, it is clear that South \nAmerica\u2019s narcotics trafficking networks collaborate \nwith one another in their illicit activities, especially \nmoney-laundering, and recruit specialists at the highest \ntechnical level. It is therefore a matter of urgency that \ncombating narcotics trafficking once more be given top \npriority on the world agenda and in cooperation \nbetween developed countries, pursuant to the principle \nof shared responsibility. \n We must respond jointly to halt the advance of \nnarcotics trafficking and related criminal activities, \nsuch as trafficking in arms or people, the destruction of \nnature, corruption and terrorism. Legislation concerning \nillicit crops and their interdiction and eradication should \nbe complemented by prevention and rehabilitation \nprogrammes aimed at comprehensive, alternative and \nsustainable development. To that end, the concerted \nefforts of all international actors are essential under the \nprinciples of cooperation and, above all, shared \nresponsibility. \n In Peru, drug traffickers are working with the \nremnants of terrorist groups. This situation \nexponentially increases the level of violence among \nboth criminal groups, and if we do not solve the \nproblem now, we may find ourselves in a situation of \nunprecedented consequences in the future. Illicit coca \n \n \n7 09-52598 \n \nproduction is a process of utmost destructiveness to the \nenvironment. Three hectares of forest have to be \ndestroyed to obtain one hectare of coca. This is causing \nirreparable damage in the Peruvian Amazon forest; the \nlogging and burning of trees to clear land for illegal \ncrops erodes the soil and has resulted in the \ndeforestation of 2.5 million hectares of Amazon forest, \na leading contribution to global warming. \n For all these reasons, the Government of Peru has \ndevoted special attention to the problem in terms of \nfinancial and human resources. But the results have \noften left us feeling that this is a solitary struggle with \na problem for which the international community, and \nespecially the countries that consume the bulk of \nnarcotic drugs, do not have adequate or rapid solutions. \nPeru, which dedicates more than $600 million a year to \nfighting an illicit industry with a turnover of \n$22 billion, cannot fight the illicit production of drugs \nalone or hope for any long-term success without the \nfirm, supportive cooperation of the international \ncommunity and, particularly, of the consuming \ncountries, based on the established principle of shared \nresponsibility. \n Real cooperation has diminished alarmingly since \n2002. The largest contributor to Peru reduced its \ncontribution from $140 million to $128 million in 2003 \nand to $116 million in 2004. This year, the total will be \n$70 million and next year, $57 million. Peru therefore \nconsiders it essential for the United Nations Office on \nDrugs and Crime to draft a report providing updated \nfigures for the global resources that the international \ncommunity allocates to combating the illegal narcotics \ntrade, the donor sources and specific ongoing projects, \nas well as identifying key programmes to improve \ncooperation with the countries most affected by illegal \ndrug production. Such precise, reliable and \ninternationally comparable information would dispel \nmany myths concerning the efforts and joint action that \nwe should undertake without delay, and would be a \npractical starting point from which to better coordinate \nthe efforts of contributing States, international \norganizations and financial institutions with those \nStates most affected by illegal narcotics production and \ntrafficking, in order to strengthen them in this fight. We \nhope that this task can be accomplished without delay, \nsince, I repeat, international action in this area must not \nbe postponed. \n Another sensitive issue that has been the subject \nof special debate is that of climate change and the \npreservation of the environment in general. Peru is \nsuffering dramatically from the effects of global \nwarming, seen in the accelerated retreat of its tropical \nglaciers and its ensuing difficulties in adequately \nmeeting the water needs of its population. Peru \nconsiders it essential to establish concrete goals for \ntechnological cooperation and transfer, as well as the \ncreation of financial assistance funds for projects \naimed at directly combating the effects of climate \nchange in the countries most affected by it. Faced with \nthe urgent need to confront the adverse effects of \nclimate change, Peru supports the ongoing establishment \nof binding international commitments by the countries \nthat created this problem, and hopes that at the \nfifteenth International Conference on Climate Change, \nto be held in Copenhagen in December, all States will \nbe willing to adopt them. \n In this regard, Peru reiterates its proposal that a \nfinancial mechanism be established towards the \ncreation of a global fund to support measures aimed at \nmitigating and adapting to the effects of climate \nchange in developing countries. This would involve a \nduty of $0.50 on every barrel of oil, inasmuch as the \nfuel bears a responsibility at every stage in its chain of \nproduction, from extraction through refining to its \nuses, direct and indirect. Peru also proposes that \ncomprehensive programmes of adaptation to climate \nchange be established. Such programmes, which could \nbe financed by the Global Environment Facility or the \nWorld Bank, would identify a comprehensive approach \nto sectoral adaptation and emphasize strategies to \nreduce the occurrence of disasters and to protect the \nhealth and food security of affected populations, \neconomic infrastructure and biodiversity. \n Finally, we wish to raise an issue of particular \ninterest to Peru and developing countries in general \u2014 \nthe situation of migrants. Peru is an active promoter of \nthe defence of the human rights of migrants and their \nfamilies, and of the sharing of responsibility for \naddressing this phenomenon by their countries of \norigin and host countries. We endorse the principle that \nmigration is a factor for development and has \nundeniably been so throughout human history. It has \nenriched the culture and social life of nations, and \nallowed us to come into contact with the contributions, \ndiscoveries and developments that have gradually \nshaped our modern society.  \n It is therefore essential that we be aware that \nwhat migrants contribute to their host countries today, \n  \n \n09-52598 8 \n \nand what they can contribute in the future, will be in \nlarge measure the backbone of those societies. That is \nwhy xenophobic and discriminatory pressures must be \navoided, since they do nothing but delay the inevitable \nintegration of the world and the human race. \n In Latin America, we are living through a crucial \ntime in the consolidation of democracy and the \npromotion of the social and political rights of our \npeoples. Peru therefore expresses its deep concern over \nthe recent events in the sister country of Honduras, \nwhere the democratic system has been abruptly \ninterrupted. The actions taken against Brazil\u2019s embassy \nin Honduras should be repudiated and should cease \nimmediately, pursuant to Honduras\u2019s legal traditions as \na country that respects its international obligations, \nparticularly the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic \nRelations. \n We call for a dialogue aimed at re-establishing \ndemocracy in Honduras. All Honduran political groups \nshould take advantage of the return of President \nManuel Zelaya to Tegucigalpa to establish a \nGovernment of unity and national reconciliation as \noutlined in the San Jos\u00e9 agreement, which, through \nentirely peaceful means, will allow the country to \nmove forward with free, democratic and transparent \nelections that will guarantee the election of a \nGovernment that respects its Constitution and promotes \nnational integration and solidarity for each and every \nHonduran citizen. \n At a time when communications and technology \nbring us closer together than ever before, we must also \nunderstand that our problems and responsibilities \nshould also bring us closer together and that challenges \nto one State are challenges to all. This Assembly \ntherefore remains the most appropriate forum in which \nto discuss global and local challenges, which are now \nidentical and of concern to us all, and should also \u2014 \nwhy not? \u2014 inspire us all with hope. \n "

        "file_text": "On behalf of President \nJames Michel of Seychelles, leader of one of the \nsmallest nations of this Assembly, I congratulate you, \nSir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. \n \n \n33 09-53165 \n \n With a population of just over 85,000, we are \npainfully aware of our vulnerability as a nation at the \nmercy of the ebb and flow of global tides. Our \nvulnerability is all the more acute in this age marked \nby economic and other crises and the increasingly \ndestructive effects of climate change. However, \nprecisely because of that, our citizens are aware of our \nresponsibility as a nation within the community of \nnations. We are aware that the solutions to our \nproblems do not lie solely within our borders. As \nan assembly of nations, we must take into account \nmore than ever the responsibility that we have and that \nwe share. That is our responsibility to our peoples and \nto humanity as a whole.  \n The international community has not shirked that \nresponsibility in the face of the world financial crisis, \nfor example, as every nation has had to react in one \nway or another. In Seychelles, our inherent \nvulnerabilities and economic imbalances, which had \naccumulated over time, meant that we had to act earlier \nthan many other States to face up to the crisis. We \nentered into a Standby Arrangement with the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and are also \ndiscussing debt rescheduling through the Paris Club. \n The process has been difficult for every \nSeychellois, but we are seeing the results, and our \nnation is emerging stronger and more resilient. We still \nhave a long way to go, but we, and our multilateral and \nbilateral partners, have all been surprised at how \nquickly we have emerged and managed to improve our \neconomic situation. The process has also marked a \nmilestone in the relationship between multilateral \nfinancial institutions and a small island developing \nState. It has proved to us that, although the voices of \nthe smaller States are often drowned in the tumult of \nthe international arena, the instruments of the global \neconomy can be adapted to meet the needs of a smaller \npartner. \n Our specificities and vulnerabilities have been \nrecognized throughout the discussions with our \nmultilateral and bilateral partners. Seychelles would \nlike to salute the role played by the IMF, the World \nBank and the African Development Bank in that \nprocess. We would also like to express our appreciation \nto our bilateral partners and other organizations that \nhave supported us in one way or another in facing up to \nthe crisis. It is an example of a responsibility shared. \nThrough shared responsibility, a crisis can be \ncontained. Through shared responsibility, what \nappeared to be impossible has become achievable. \n It is our duty in this Assembly to use the principle \nof shared responsibility in solving our global problems, \nespecially in offering solidarity and assistance to those \nStates in need of outside support. We have all heard \nhow the unrest in Somalia has spilled beyond its \nborders to manifest itself as piracy on the high seas. \nSeychelles is one of the States directly affected and \nheavily impacted by that scourge, as pirates prey on \nshipping and lay siege to the yachting, tourism and \nfishing industries of the Western Indian Ocean. \n The long-term effects are much broader: as \ninsurance premiums for shipping increase, the cost of \ntransporting essential goods rises correspondingly. \nAlso, we have often seen that economic desperation, \ncoupled with long-term political instability, can lead to \na breeding ground for terrorism. \n Seychelles is pleased to note the increasing \nengagement of many States in the fight against piracy \nin the Indian Ocean. We share the responsibility to \nensure peace and stability in the region; as always, this \nis the prerequisite for progress. We must take action in \nthree areas to effectively tackle the piracy situation. \nThe root cause of the problem lies within Somalia. The \nlong-term solution lies in establishing peace, stability, \nprogress and the rule of law within Somalia. Through \nenhanced coordination and the sharing of information, \nwe must ensure that piracy is not economically viable. \nWe must share information to ensure that, by keeping \nvessels beyond their reach, we are always ahead of the \npirates. \n We must ensure that there is enough deterrence in \nterms of military assets in the region. Seychelles alone \nhas an exclusive economic zone of 1.4 million square \nkilometres to patrol and protect, which we would not \nbe able to do effectively without the help of friendly \ncountries. \n Nowhere is our shared responsibility more \nneeded than in protecting and nurturing our shared \nenvironment. For the small island developing States \n(SIDS), the preservation of our environment is about \nour safety, our security, our economy and, ultimately, \nour survival. Thus, the battle against climate change is \nfor a battle for our survival. Small island States and \nother particularly vulnerable nations, such as the least \ndeveloped countries, cannot look at that issue in any \nother way. \n \n \n09-53165 34 \n \n The fight against climate change is a fight based \non our undeniable human right to exist not only as \nnation States, but as peoples and communities. For \nexample, the Arctic peoples and other indigenous \npeoples are also suffering from climate change first \nhand. Their voices, just like those of us in the SIDS \nand other particularly vulnerable States, need to be \nheard by the world\u2019 s leaders. \n Nothing is more critical to our survival as States, \nas nations, as peoples and as communities than an \nurgent, coherent and effective response to the effects of \nclimate change. But the response thus far has been \nsorely lacking. Weeks before Copenhagen, we are still \nunsure as to what type of an agreement we will get \nthere. Furthermore, there are indications that if an \nagreement is made, it will not suffice to save many \nisland States. \n As the last small island developing State to speak \nin this general debate, Seychelles therefore feels it has \na duty to remind the international community that in \nthe coming weeks before Copenhagen, the Alliance of \nSmall Island States will continue to steadfastly call for \nthat which is necessary to our survival. That includes \nstabilizing long-term atmospheric greenhouse gas \nconcentrations at well below 350 parts per million; \nensuring that average global surface temperature \nincreases be limited to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius \nabove pre-industrial levels; and requiring global \ngreenhouse gas emissions to peak by 2015 and decline \nsignificantly thereafter. Furthermore, greenhouse gas \nemissions should be reduced by more than 85 per cent \nby 2050. Annex 1 greenhouse gas emissions should be \nreduced by at least 45 per cent by 2020 and by 2050, at \nleast 95 per cent of 1990 carbon dioxide levels should \nbe reduced. Non-Annex 1 emissions should also \ndemonstrate significant deviations from baseline over \ncomparable time periods. \n Before concluding, Seychelles must salute the \nUnited Nations for the body of work it has contributed \nto advancing our understanding of how climate change \nis damaging our planet. Seychelles also thanks \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership in \nensuring that climate change, and especially the plight \nof the particularly vulnerable such as the small island \ndeveloping States, get the attention they deserve. \n The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nhas shown us that climate change is a disaster very \nmuch in the making. It is a disaster which, unlike \nprevious global disasters, is not occurring in one \nsudden instant, but rather is gaining in pace and \ndestructive power over time. It is also a disaster which \nis man-made, which is to say that it is our fault. As \nsuch, it is a disaster that we have a duty and a \nresponsibility to prevent and that we can prevent. \n We cannot afford to leave any nation behind in \nCopenhagen, no matter how poor, how weak or how \nsmall. Once again, this is our shared responsibility that \nwe must assume."

        "file_text": "Today the international \ncommunity is striving to meet challenges that the \nfounders of the United Nations could not have \nenvisioned some 65 years ago. At the same time, the \nfounding principles of the United Nations have not \nchanged. The provision of joint security and prosperity \nand the safeguarding of human rights remain the \nimpetus for United Nations activities as they were \n60 years ago. Countries that gather here, big and small, \nhave a common responsibility as members of the \nUnited Nations to uphold and cherish the ideals \nexpressed in the United Nations Charter.  \n The global financial and economic crisis is not \nthe only problem today. Terrorism, the proliferation of \nweapons, energy challenges, climate change and many \nother issues must be addressed in order to make the \ngoals of the United Nations a reality. Complex \nchallenges require comprehensive responses. It is \nobvious we cannot benefit from isolationist or egoistic \npolicies. \n The United Nations must come of age. It must \nbecome the visible and credible expression of the \nglobalization of politics. The modern world dictates \nthat we are dependent on each other. Either we work \nwith each other or suffer in isolation.  \n Today more than ever before, the United Nations \nhas to play the leading role in strengthening our \nsocieties by promoting the shared values of humanity \nand tolerance. It is our responsibility to make sure that \nsuch phenomena as anti-Semitism, xenophobia and \nracism are eliminated from our lives. There can be no \nexcuse for not bearing this responsibility. Countries big \nand small alike have duties not only towards their own \ncitizens but also towards global society. But it is \nusually the poor and vulnerable who suffer the most, \nespecially as the current crisis and the lag in donor \ncommitments push back the hopes of implementing the \nMillennium Development Goals on schedule. \nTherefore, with all due regard for the domestic \nconcerns and needs of national taxpayers, we need to \nadapt to the reality of global complexity and to respect \nour common responsibility and international \ncommitments. We need to make sure that the \nMillennium Development Goals do not become the \nprime victims of the current global economic and \nfinancial situation.  \n \n \n09-52320 12 \n \n What particular steps should be taken? I will \nmention several. First, recent United Nations peace \noperations show that efforts to achieve and consolidate \npeace entail many dimensions, ranging from \npeacebuilding to nation-building. Despite its current \neconomic limitations my country is determined to meet \nits obligations. We will contribute to peace-keeping \nmissions and operations working to ensure global \nsecurity and stability, specifically by continued \nparticipation in the European Union missions in \nKosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Afghanistan. \n Second, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and \nbiological weapons will never be halted unless there is \nan international consensus to do so. The United \nNations must strengthen its policy against \nproliferation; in particular we need to find ways to \nallow nations to develop civil nuclear power but not \nnuclear weapons. Therefore the upcoming Review \nConference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons next year will provide a good \nopportunity to seek diplomatic solutions and work for \nfull compliance with international commitments and \nrequirements. \n Third, better and more responsible governance at \nthe global, regional and local levels is crucially \nimportant for a steady and sustainable economic \nrecovery. Protectionism and isolationism have never \nworked and will never work in the future.  \n Fourth, realizing the fact that global climate \nchange calls for global solutions, we will do our best to \nreach an international consensus at the Climate Change \nConference in Copenhagen. Fully aware of the global \nimpact of climate change, we support the ambitious \nEuropean Union commitment to cut carbon dioxide \nemissions by 20 per cent by 2020, within the \nframework of an international agreement. \n Fifth, I think that global responsibility has to be \naddressed regionally as well \u2014 this is the rule for \neffective implementation of the United Nations \nCharter. Regional organizations should assume a \ngreater responsibility for taking care of their regions. \nThey must share their best practices with their \nneighbours and other regional organizations. \n Aware of being a comparatively small State, \nLithuania is assuming its regional and global \nresponsibility to promote United Nations values \nthrough the core principles of dialogue, respect, \nunderstanding and tolerance, as it assumes the \npresidencies of regional and global organizations. \nLithuania began its one-year presidency of the Council \nof the Baltic Sea States as well as the presidency of the \nCommunity of Democracies on 1 July 2009, and it will \ntake on the chairmanship of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe in 2011. A \nLithuania representative will then assume the yearly \npresidency of the United Nations General Assembly in \nSeptember 2012 and will complete that term as \nLithuania takes on the European Union presidency in \nthe second half of 2013.  \n It is an immense responsibility to guide the \nCommunity of Democracies forward at this point in \ntime. In our view, real progress in development is \nlinked directly to the institution of democratic norms \nand principles. We believe democracy to be inseparable \nfrom peace, the rule of law, respect for individual and \nhuman rights, equal opportunity and overall prosperity.  \n Allow me to reiterate that small or less developed \nStates can no longer avoid global responsibility and \nthat all of us are responsible for our common present \nand future. Let us all recognize from now on, in each \nof our capitals, that the global interest is our national \ninterest and global responsibility is our national \nresponsibility."

        "file_text": "Yesterday and today we have \nheard many inspiring words. We heard powerful words, \nwords of hope. A few moments ago we heard words \nabout salvation. Although most of us would not agree \nthat salvation is around the corner, at the same time I \nbelieve all of us will agree that improvement is \npossible and that the reason we are here is to make that \nimprovement a reality. But in order to do that, we must \ndo what the peoples of the world legitimately expect \nfrom us as representatives of United Nations Member \nStates: to make this institution, the United Nations, \neffective and to work for it with a sense of common \npurpose, truly as united nations.  \n I express full confidence in your experience and \nwisdom, Mr. President, congratulate you on your \nelection and wish you every success in your work for \nthe improvement of humankind\u2019s situation. \n At the same time, I would not wish to miss the \nopportunity to thank the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session, Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann, who guided this Assembly with \ngreat determination and an ethical commitment to \nfairness and justice. \n I also wish to pay tribute to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his guidance in these \ntrying times. \n In the past few days, many of us were engaged in \nan effort, spearheaded by the Secretary-General, to \ngenerate the necessary political will to seal the deal in \nCopenhagen. We all appreciate this example of \ninternational leadership. Humankind must take resolute \nsteps towards a new and effective system to mitigate \nthe effects of global warming and to ensure our \nnecessary adaptation.  \n Our responsibilities are common and \ndifferentiated. Today, we understand that each of the \nMember States of the United Nations must do its share \nand that, together as united nations, we can save the \nplanet. Let the Copenhagen Conference be the turning \npoint. \n We also need to broaden the front and fully \ninclude civil society and the business sector in broad \naction for this needed technological and social \ntransformation. Action starting now to mitigate the \nconsequences of climate change will have to lead to \nprofound societal change \u2014 a change in the way we \nproduce, the way we consume and the way we live. Let \nus not be afraid of these changes. These changes may \nnot amount to a revolution, of which President Ch\u00e1vez \nFr\u00edas of Venezuela spoke, but they will have to be real \nand, if guided in a wise and timely manner, they can \nimprove our common future. \n Now the world needs a comprehensive strategy in \norder to fulfil this task. Such a strategy needs to \naddress all the main challenges of our time in a \nconsistent manner. The food crisis, climate change, the \nenergy crisis, the spreading of infectious diseases and \nother problems may have different roots, but they \nproduce a single, communicative effect. They hobble \nglobal development and make the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals only a distant \npossibility. Therefore, clear responses are called for.  \n And what is the role of the United Nations in this \ncontext? Some of the answers have already been \nprovided. They are enshrined, inter alia, in the \nOutcome of the United Nations Conference on the \nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on \nDevelopment, which was held in New York in June. \nResults of that Conference should be further \nelaborated. Specific priority tasks for global \ndevelopment must soon be defined. \n These days, many expectations are linked to the \nG-20 summit meeting in Pittsburgh. Much needs to be \ndone to bring greater discipline and responsibility to \nthe global financial system. This is an important and \nimmediate priority. Moreover, it is necessary to \nincrease resources and to adjust the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions with a view to the proper maintenance of \nglobal financial stability and of development financing. \nThe restarting of global trade negotiations has become \nan urgent priority. \n But even more is needed, including the \nimprovement of official development assistance, with a \n  \n \n09-52425 10 \n \nparticular priority on development in Africa. Issues of \nglobal development represent a large part of the agenda \nof the current session of the General Assembly. \n However, we must also think about the fate of \nhuman rights in current global circumstances. Human \nrights and development are closely connected. The \ncurrent recession has already increased global levels of \npoverty. Unemployment is growing. The faith of many \nyoung people is becoming ever more uncertain. All \nthese are serious challenges to global social stability \nand may turn into the serious security concerns of \ntomorrow if left unattended. \n I welcome the efforts of the International Labour \nOrganization and the Global Jobs Pact adopted in June. \nToday, there is no challenge to human rights more \npervasive, more strategic and more pressing than the \nchallenge of poverty and unemployment. Policymakers \nneed to ensure that economic policies and human rights \npolicies alike are coordinated and that mechanisms are \nput into place at the national and international levels. \n Slovenia was one of the first Member States to \nsign today the Optional Protocol to the International \nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. \nThe Protocol will give individuals an additional and \npotentially significant implementation mechanism. \nThis is a small step, but one which demonstrates our \nawareness of the problem and our commitment to \naction. \n We are also looking to the Human Rights Council \nas the main body of the United Nations to devise \nstrategies for human rights. Slovenia has been an active \nmember of the Council and we remain optimistic. The \nprogress achieved so far in developing new methods of \nwork in the Council is encouraging, albeit not yet \nsufficient. We welcome the election of the United \nStates to the Council and believe that only an inclusive \nforum for human rights can be an effective forum for \nhuman rights. Members of the Human Rights Council \nmust realize that they bear a special responsibility to \nlead. \n But there are problems which exceed the \npotential of the Human Rights Council itself. The \nfailures to protect human beings from mass atrocities \nand from gross and systematic violations of human \nrights should not be repeated. We still have not found \nthe right tools to respond in a timely and effective \nmanner to such situations. I therefore welcome the \ndebate on the responsibility to protect that took place \nin the General Assembly in July this year. Continued \nengagement of the General Assembly on this subject \nhas proved to be necessary, and I hope that this \ndiscussion will yield results. \n Issues of environment, development and human \nrights represent today the bulk of the current United \nNations agenda, but it is in the area of the maintenance \nof international peace and security that some of the \nmost urgent thinking and action are necessary. Four \nareas of work are of special importance. \n The reform of the Security Council is long \noverdue and progress made at the sixty-third session of \nthe General Assembly is insufficient. However, \nnegotiations so far have generated a positive \nmomentum. It is apparent that the expansion of the \nSecurity Council in the permanent and non-permanent \ncategories of membership has gained broad support \namong United Nations Member States. Exactly a year \nago from this rostrum, I suggested a specific model for \nSecurity Council expansion. It was one of many \nproposals that were made. Now the time is right for \nthat and other proposals to be put on the table and to be \naddressed head on. \n In addition to structural change, such as Security \nCouncil reform, we need to strengthen the United \nNations practical role in the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. I welcome the \nthinking expressed in the report of the Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations entitled \u201cA New Partnership \nAgenda: Charting a New Horizon for United Nations \nPeacekeeping\u201d, published in July this year. The report \nhighlights many of the most pressing and subtle needs \nfor improvement. Member States must give careful \nconsideration to the report and to such concepts as \nexpanding the peacekeeping partnership, the purpose \nof which is to strengthen the operational capacity and \npolitical sophistication of United Nations peacekeeping. \n Let us not overlook the fact that progress in \npeacekeeping would strengthen all other United \nNations activities linked to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, including preventive \ndiplomacy and post-conflict peacebuilding. \n The third area which needs to be addressed is \ndisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, \nwhere we have come up against far too many \nstumbling blocks in the past. United Nations action \nneeds to be energized now, and the forthcoming review \n \n \n11 09-52425 \n \nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons has to be a step forward.  \n Fourthly, the United Nations will continue to be \nan indispensable forum for political consultation and \npolicy advice. The experience of the United Nations is \nirreplaceable. The situation in Afghanistan can be cited \nas a case in point. For three decades now, the United \nNations has been seized with a variety of problems \naffecting Afghanistan, a Member State. No one should \ndoubt that Afghanistan belongs to the Afghans or that \nthe Afghanization of security is the only real path \ntowards security in the country. There can be no \nmilitary solution to the country\u2019s variety of problems. \nIt is becoming ever more apparent that the international \ncommunity will have to assist in an Afghan process of \ntransition that will decrease and eventually phase out \nthe international military presence in the country. \n Let me emphasize the role of the United Nations \nin that context. Sometimes, matters such as the \nsituation in and around Afghanistan are discussed at \nspecialized international conferences, but wisdom and \ncommon sense suggest that the experience of the \nUnited Nations be put to use. Let us not forget the \nunique success of the United Nations, of the United \nNations-led 2001 Bonn Conference and of the \nsubsequent Constitutional Loya Jirga. The time has \ncome for a broad look at the entire experience since \nthat period, an assessment of what exactly went wrong \nand why, a sober assessment of the current situation, \nand the careful definition of further steps that will \nmake international political, economic and \nadministrative assistance more effective and the \ninternational military presence no longer needed. The \nassistance of the Security Council and the General \nAssembly will be valuable in that regard.  \n Let me conclude by saying something very \nobvious. The agenda of the United Nations today is \nheavy, but that is not news. The United Nations has \nalways been the forum for addressing the world\u2019s most \nintractable problems. At the same time, however, the \nUnited Nations has always represented hope and \npromise to the world. Let us live up to that hope and \nthat promise. Let us make this the era of the United \nNations and the Organization\u2019s finest hour. "

        "file_text": "I should like to \ncongratulate the President on the singular honour of \nhaving been chosen for the presidency of the United \nNations General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I \nwould like to assure him of my delegation\u2019s fullest \nsupport as he undertakes his momentous responsibility \nto unite Member States in pursuing the common goal \nof a more humane, secure, united and prosperous \nworld. \n There was a time recently when that elusive goal \nfinally appeared within reach, but multiple new \nchallenges have coalesced to render the goal even more \ndistant. It is therefore most encouraging that the world \nis turning to the United Nations to find a common, \nglobal path to resolving the most intractable difficulties \nfacing humanity. There is a clear recognition emerging \nthat together we can all rise, but that separately, we can \nonly sink. \n There was a time when the powerful disdained \nthis institution\u2019s ability to be a unifying player. That is \nnow changing, and in this regard, I would like to \ncommend the President of the United States, who holds \n  \n \n09-52470 28 \n \na very special place in the hearts of Africans, Kenyans \nin particular, for having on Wednesday so eloquently \nindicated the centrality of the United Nations in \ncharting common solutions. \n In order to better equip the United Nations for \nmeeting these challenges, we must continue to press \nfor reform in the Organization. The Security Council, \nin particular, must be enlarged and made more \ndemocratic and representative of current day reality. \nPart of the enlargement must include permanent, veto-\nbearing seats for Africa. \n The world can no longer continue to marginalize \na continent that is home to nearly one billion people. \nThat is wrong in principle, but even more, it is wrong \nin practice. We cannot find sustainable solutions to our \nchallenges when such a large part of humanity is given \nso little voice and role in that quest for peace. \n The world is now acutely aware that the quest for \npeace begins with ensuring the survival of the planet. \nI would, therefore, like to thank Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for having convened the high-level \nmeeting on climate change, which has put that issue \nsquarely onto the world\u2019s centre stage. There is no \nissue that so clearly unites the population of the entire \nworld as climate change does. \n Regrettably, the far-sighted decision at the 2005 \nUnited Nations World Summit to explore the \npossibility of a more coherent institutional framework \nfor international environmental governance has not \nborne any fruit. This is particularly unacceptable now \nwhen climate change is indeed the most pressing \nchallenge of our times. We therefore call for the \nupgrading of the United Nations Environmental \nProgramme (UNEP) in Nairobi, so that it can become \nthe central environmental institution handling the \nnumerous conventions. \n We have noted with regret the emergence of \nmultiple centres dealing with environmental issues. \nThat dissipates their impact and sometimes even leads \nto contradictory actions. The United Nations Office in \nNairobi should now be elevated to the same level \nUnited Nations Offices in Geneva and Vienna to enable \nit to provide comprehensive support to all Member \nStates and organizations struggling to adjust to a new \nparadigm of a sustainable and dynamic green economy. \n Without that, the lives of billions will be \nimperilled. Already, as the Secretary-General pointed \nout on Wednesday, another 100 million people may fall \nbelow the poverty line this year owing to climate \nchange setbacks. Markets may be bouncing back, but \nincomes and jobs are not. These developments do not \naugur well for the future. \n I regret to say that my own country is emblematic \nof the woes unleashed by years of rampant excesses in \nthe global and local mismanagement of our \nenvironment. The melting of the famed ice caps of \nMt. Kenya and nearby Mt. Kilimanjaro, the destruction \nof vast swathes of our once beautiful forests, the drying \nof fast-flowing rivers, the intensifying cycles of \ndrought and floods, the spread of malaria to highland \nregions as temperatures rise \u2014 these are all \nconsequences of human action within and outside our \nborders. And so the solution also must also entail \naction on both fronts. \n The greater challenge for us, I am afraid, is the \nexternal one. We, like the rest of Africa, produce only a \ntiny proportion of the emissions that are rapidly \nwarming the planet and wreaking havoc with our \ncapacity to produce adequate amounts of food and \nenergy and husband sustainable water supplies. Our \neconomies are in disarray. We are victims of the richer \nworld\u2019s acts and omissions, and therefore we need \nlarge amounts of funds in assistance and private-sector \ninvestment to reverse the course of events. The world \ncommunity must agree on concrete actions in \nCopenhagen. \n But we in Kenya are not interested in playing the \nblame game or waiting for international action to \nmaterialize. We have already begun to make very tough \npolitical decisions to reverse the ravages. Our \nimmediate goal is to fully restore our largest water \ntower, the famed Mau Forest complex, as well as \nKenya\u2019s other four water towers, and are embarking on \na huge reforestation drive to plant seven billion trees, \nwhich will restore the carbon-taming sinks that once \nmade us self-sufficient in food and energy. We are also \nundertaking a crash programme designed to rapidly \nshift energy production to green technologies that use \nassets in which we are naturally rich \u2014 wind and sun, \nbut most important of all, geothermal energy, which \ncould more than double our current energy production \nwithin the next four years. \n For all of these programmes, we are mobilizing \nlocal resources, but we will need significant assistance \nand investment to succeed in our goal of achieving \n \n \n29 09-52470 \n \nself-sufficiency in a green way. The rich nations have \nrecognized that their own self-interest is served in \npromoting such green commitments in developing \ncountries, but the existing mechanisms through which \nthey can support such programmes need to be refined \nand made more effective in quickly releasing \nresources. \n We therefore support British Prime Minister \nGordon Brown\u2019s proposal for a $100 billion facility, \nand at the same time urge that the $20 billion pledged \nby the Group of Eight (G-8) for enhanced food \nproduction be speedily mobilized and disbursed. We \nneed immediate assistance in feeding the 10 million \nKenyans who are now living in hunger and will \notherwise face starvation shortly. Just last week we \ndeclared this situation a national disaster requiring \n$500 million to rectify, of which $250 million will be \nmobilized from our own resources, while we urgently \nappeal to our development partners to furnish the other \n$250 million. \n Tens of thousands of livestock animals have died. \nThis devastation is the result primarily of climate \nchange. We have had droughts before, but they now \nrecur much more frequently and with greater severity. \nOne drought year is difficult enough, but the rains have \nnow failed us for the past four consecutive seasons. \nI appeal to our well-wishers, who are many, to assist us \nin this dire emergency. To mitigate the suffering, we \nhave carried out a massive mobilization \u2014 including of \nthe military \u2014 in providing relief and in drilling \nboreholes and transporting water to areas in acute need. \n I am very proud to say that despite the terrible \npost-election violence and the subsequent multiple \nreverses that made reconciliation and reconstruction \neven more difficult, our people have shown an \nextraordinary maturity and resilience in rising to \nunprecedented challenges. We were able to overcome \nthe bitterness over the election with an accord that we \nsigned with the help of the African Union and the \nmediation of Kofi Annan, as well as with the support of \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who personally \nvisited Kenya at the height of the crisis \u2014 for which \nwe are deeply grateful. \n Let me now turn to an area where peace does not \nprevail and which is a source of immense concern to \nthe entire international community \u2014 and that is \nSomalia. As its immediate neighbour and with a large \npopulation of Kenyan Somalis, we have done more \nthan any other country to assist Somalia in overcoming \nits divisions and conflicts. No one is more eager than \nwe are to help defeat the forces of extremism in \nSomalia, which have so much sway because of the help \nof external elements. The continuing inflow of \nrefugees, small arms and light weapons from Somalia \nis the major source of insecurity in our country. \n The latest setback resulting from that insecurity is \ndisruption through piracy against international trade in \none of the busiest sea routes in the world. Despite the \nrisks incurred by doing so, Kenya has offered facilities \nfor the detention and prosecution of suspected pirates, \nas part of our international obligation to promote \npeace. We have also offered to host a United Nations-\norganized conference in Kenya on how to coordinate \nand more effectively deal with the scourge of piracy. In \nreturn, we ask the international community to \nrecognize our many sacrifices and assist us in dealing \nwith our major refugee and security burdens. \n The Intergovernmental Authority on Development \n(IGAD) and the African Union have recommended to \nthe United Nations Security Council that it impose a no-\nfly zone and a blockade of airports and seaports held by \ninsurgents so as to prevent the influx of arms. Kenya \nfully supports their position. It is now incumbent upon \nthe United Nations Security Council to take decisive \naction to forestall further anarchy in Somalia. \n To succeed in the quest for peace in Somalia, we \nmust recognize that the present focus primarily on the \nuse of force has not led to any curbing of extremism. \nIndeed, the security and humanitarian crises are worse \nthan ever. We must therefore take a more \ncomprehensive approach in tackling the extremists \u2014 \nan approach that includes encouraging the Transitional \nFederal Government to much more aggressively pursue \nits commitment to a more inclusive political process, \nby bringing into the Government all forces that eschew \nviolence. Such outreach to all moderates can succeed \nonly with much greater international support. It is \nregrettable that many pledges made at the Brussels \ndonors conference have yet to be honoured. I call upon \nall those who have not honoured their pledges to do so \nimmediately. \n Turning back to the global economic crisis, it is \nnow recognized that one of its principal causes is the \nweakness of the international financial system. We \nshould strengthen and promote effective multilateralism \nwith the United Nations at the centre. We need to reform \n  \n \n09-52470 30 \n \nthe international financial governance institutions, so \nthat they can prevent crises and develop more effective \nand equitable responses to them. \n The ideals and principles of the United Nations \nare, today more than ever, the surest hope for a more \nprosperous and equitable world. Multilateralism in this \nglobalized age is the only sure way to ensure that \npeace, development and unity prevail at a time when \nthe world is riven with so many divisions. We need a \ngenuine partnership among all nations and peoples, so \nthat everyone feels that he or she is a critical \nstakeholder in national and international decision-\nmaking.\n Finally, within democratic nations, each person\u2019s \nvote is equal to those of all others, regardless of their \npower or wealth. That is the principle that must finally \nbe applied to the workings of the entire international \nsystem."

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by \nextending to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki \nmy delegation\u2019s warmest congratulations on his \nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session. I assure him of the full support \nand cooperation of my delegation. I also take this \nopportunity to express our most profound appreciation \nto his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for the exemplary manner in \nwhich he guided our work at the sixty-third session. \n I should also like to record my delegation\u2019s \nheartfelt gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nfor his inspiring leadership and dedication in \npromoting the noble principles and ideals of this \nOrganization. \n This is the first time the General Assembly has \nbeen addressed by a democratically elected President \nof the Maldives. I am extremely pleased to be here. I \nhave spent many of the past General Assembly sessions \nlocked in a hot, humid, damp cell with my hands \nshackled and my feet bound, imprisoned for my \nconviction that the 300,000 people of the Maldives \nshould be free from fear, free from want and free to \nlive their lives in liberty and in dignity. \n I would like to thank the international community \nfor its invaluable support in securing our democratic \ntransition. Reformers in the Maldives and our friends \nin the United Nations should feel justifiably proud that \nour island home was able to mark last year\u2019s first \nInternational Day of Democracy in the best possible \nway: by throwing off a 30-year-old autocracy and \nsecuring a smooth, peaceful and democratic transfer of \npower. \n Just as the international community played a key \nrole in securing the Maldives\u2019 democratic transition, \nso, I hope, will it play a role in the even more difficult \ntask of making sure our democracy becomes a \npermanent feature rather than a passing illusion. All of \nus who care about the Maldives and believe in \ndemocracy bear an enormous responsibility to ensure \nthat the beliefs we fought for are set in stone rather \nthan written in sand. \n There are three areas in which the Maldives seeks \nthe help of the international community. The first is \ncontinued collaboration in democracy-building. We \nmust work together to strengthen the various pillars of \na democratic society, namely protection of human \nrights, good governance, independent oversight bodies, \na free press and civil society. The Maldives has made \nenormous progress on all of those pillars, but much \nremains to be done. My sense is that the necessary \nfoundations are now in place. The separation of powers \n  \n \n09-52425 34 \n \nhas been established by constitutional reform. A range \nof independent agencies and commissions have now \nbeen set up. We have a thriving independent media. \nNevertheless, several crucial challenges still remain, \nand we look forward to the support of the international \ncommunity as we move to meet these challenges. In \nparticular, I would like to stress the importance of \nensuring the equality of women and men, not just in \nname, but in practice. \n The second way in which the international \ncommunity can help consolidate democracy and the \nrule of law in the Maldives is by promoting a \nconducive economic environment. As a small, open \nmarket economy that is heavily dependent on tourism \nand fishery exports, the Maldives has suffered badly \nfrom the current global recession. Moreover, since \nassuming office, we have come to understand that, in \nthe run-up to last year\u2019s election, the former regime \nengaged in highly irresponsible economic policies in \nthe hope of buying their way to victory. Add to this \npicture our continued efforts to recovery from the 2004 \ntsunami, our impending graduation from the least \ndeveloped country category and the high oil and food \nprices of recent years, and the scale of the economic \nchallenge facing the new Government becomes very \napparent. \n The new Government is determined to confront \nthis challenge with honesty and with vigour. In \nconsultation with the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) and the World Bank, we have embarked on a \nprogramme of major economic reform designed to \nreduce the bloated public sector, privatize public \nutilities and promote private enterprise and trade. Yet \nthe scale of the problems we face means we cannot \nsucceed on our own. We therefore look to our friends \nin the international community to help us get back on \nour feet. We are very grateful for the support extended \nto us by the IMF and the Indian Government, to name \nbut two of our partners. However, more is needed if \ndemocracy and human rights are to coexist with \neconomic stability and prosperity. \n The third way in which the international \ncommunity can and must help the Maldives consolidate \ndemocracy and establish a secure, prosperous and \nequitable society is by taking urgent and effective \naction to tackle climate change. The threats posed to \nthe Maldives from climate change are well known. \nEvery beach lost to rising seas, every house lost to \nstorm surges, every reef lost to increasingly warm \nwaters, every job lost as fish stocks dwindle and every \nlife lost to more frequent extreme weather events will \nmake it harder and harder to govern the country, until a \npoint is reached when we must consider abandoning \nour homeland. \n I therefore call on you, the leaders of the world, \nto protect the future of frontline countries like the \nMaldives by reaching an ambitious and effective \nagreement at December\u2019s United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference \nin Copenhagen which seeks to limit average global \ntemperature increases to less than 1.5 centigrade \ndegrees above pre-industrial levels. To do otherwise \nwould be to sign a death warrant for the \n300,000 Maldivians.  \n But the Maldives is determined to do what we \ncan to survive. We are going to be the first country to \ngo carbon neutral, in 10 years\u2019 time. In order to do that, \nwe are determined to formulate a survival kit: a \ncarbon-neutral manual that would enable others to \nreplicate our actions, in order that all of us together \nmight just about save ourselves from climate \ncatastrophe. \n As part of our efforts to achieve a unified voice, I \nwill be inviting some of the most vulnerable States \naffected by climate change to the Maldives. We hope \nthat that November summit will reinforce our \ndetermination to leave no stone unturned to ensure our \nsurvival.  \n I should now like to touch on a number of other \nimportant issues which are of enormous concern to us. \nThe Maldives abhors terrorism in all its forms and is \ndetermined to stand shoulder to shoulder with all \ncountries in facing down this menace. Events over the \npast year in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, our \nneighbours and partners in South Asia, show us that \nvictory in this fight will not be easy to achieve. They \nalso show us that to effectively tackle terrorism we \nmust reaffirm and not dilute our commitments to \nhuman rights, democracy, the rule of law and good \ngovernance. \n While we applaud recent efforts to reform and \nrevitalize the United Nations, we believe that such \nreforms cannot be successful or complete without the \nmuch-anticipated and much-needed reform of the \nSecurity Council. We strongly believe that the third \nround of intergovernmental negotiations on Security \nCouncil reform must produce tangible results. I call \n \n \n35 09-52425 \n \nupon the Assembly to complete this task during the \nsixty-fourth session and come to agreement on \nincreases in both the permanent and non-permanent \nmembership of the Council. In terms of composition, \nwe believe that the geo-political realities of the \ncontemporary world must be duly reflected in the \nmembership of the Council. Therefore, we support the \ninclusion of India and Japan as permanent members. \n The new Government of Maldives is determined \nto pursue friendly and mutually respectful relations \nwith every country represented in this Hall. However, \nany friendship must include a willingness to be frank \nwith one another and to object to behaviour not \nbefitting a sovereign State. \n We believe dialogue and constructive engagement \nserve the cause of peace better than ostracism and \nisolation. The new Government in Maldives will look \nto renew relations with Israel and to use the \nrelationship to reiterate our support for an independent \nand sovereign Palestinian homeland, in conformity \nwith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. \n Maldives is seeking election to the Human Rights \nCouncil during the current session of the General \nAssembly because we firmly believe in the universality \nof human rights and their critical importance to \nachieving the noble goals of the United Nations \nCharter. \n Standing at this rostrum, I must admit how, as a \nprisoner, I was inspired by the courage and vision of \nAung San Suu Kyi of Burma. Today I would like to \necho the call of the Secretary-General for her \nimmediate and unconditional release along with all \nother political prisoners. I also reiterate my strident \nsupport for the work assigned to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, \nthe United Nations Special Envoy to Burma, and say a \nprayer for political prisoners everywhere. \n In conclusion, I must say that the most critical \ntest so far of the resoluteness of the international \ncommunity to save itself will come during Mr. Treki\u2019s \nwatch as President of this Assembly: the Copenhagen \nmeeting in December. We must prime ourselves to \nsucceed at that conference. Between now and then, we \nmust all use every opportunity, every debate, and every \nencounter to achieve that goal. It is imperative that we \nsucceed. If we want to save the world, I suggest that \nsaving Maldives is a very good starting point."

        "file_text": "First, I echo \nprevious speakers in warmly congratulating Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, of the Socialist People\u2019s Libyan \nArab Jamahiriya, on his election to preside over the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am \nconfident that under the able stewardship of Mr. Treki, \na veteran of the United Nations, the Assembly will \nmake significant progress on many critical issues of \ncommon concern. \n Our tribute also goes to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann, of Nicaragua, who successfully presided \nover the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. \n Everyone is concerned today about the \nconsiderable challenges that our world confronts, \nchallenges such as the current global economic and \nfinancial crisis, climate change, food and energy \ninsecurity, and the threats of terrorism and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I hope \nthat in its deliberations the Assembly will come up \nwith new ideas to cope with those global challenges. \n There is no doubt that the present global \neconomic and financial crisis will go down in history \nas a landmark case of world economic meltdown. This \nglobal crisis has clearly undermined the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). While the developed \ncountries have more possibilities and resources to cope \nwith the slowdown, the developing countries have \nsuffered the most, with huge losses of national income, \nas their economic growth is expected to fall sharply \ndue to a drastic reduction in exports, which they have \nlargely depended on, falling investments, rising \nunemployment and so forth. \n In order to help mitigate the impact of this \neconomic and financial disaster on developing \ncountries, we should do everything possible to get the \nDoha Round negotiations back on track for a \nsuccessful conclusion in order to break down barriers \nto trade, improve market access, particularly in \nagricultural goods, and reduce agricultural subsidies. \n In this regard, Cambodia greatly appreciates the \ncommitment that the Group of 20 (G-20) made in \nPittsburgh, just two days ago, to \u201cbringing the Doha \nRound to a successful conclusion in 2010\u201d. At the same \ntime, the Monterrey Consensus should be invigorated \nin order to help developing countries to alleviate \npoverty and meet the MDGs. \n Under these terrible circumstances, we warmly \nwelcome the G-20\u2019s commitment, made in London in \nApril 2009, to address the impact of the global \nfinancial crisis with the injection of $50 billion to \nsupport social protection, boost trade and sustain \ndevelopment in low-income countries, and with an \nadditional $6 billion concessional and flexible \nfinancing over the next two or three years for social \nprotection, including through investing in long-term \nfood security in the poorest countries. \n Today, everyone in the world is increasingly \nconcerned about climate change, which is another very \nserious threat to humanity. Global warming has \ntriggered more and more frequent cyclones, typhoons, \nextreme floods and droughts. Our planet is now \nconfronted, more than ever, with increasing natural \ndisasters. The worsening impact of climate change has \nnow reached an alarming level everywhere around the \nplanet. The shrinking of the Arctic summer sea ice \nshould be an alarm signal for everyone that global \nwarming is inexorably advancing, and with perilous \nspeed. \n South-East Asia, according to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), will be the most affected \nregion. Its vulnerability to climate change is largely a \nresult of its geography, with low-lying nations and long \ncoastlines. The negative impact of climate change on \nfarming in South-East Asia would seriously jeopardize \nthe production of rice and other agricultural products, \nand consequently would have ripple effects on food \nsecurity, as South-East Asia is one of the world\u2019s most \nimportant rice crop regions. \n Based on the estimate by the ADB, the total cost \nof loss in agricultural production and other negative \naspects of climate change would be equivalent to as \nmuch as 6.7 per cent of the region\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct compared with the 2.6 per cent loss estimated \nfor the world as a whole. \n Cambodia is essentially an agrarian country, with \nthe livelihood of more than 80 per cent of its \npopulation depending on farming. Therefore, it is very \n  \n \n09-52592 16 \n \nvulnerable to weather-related disasters. Fully aware of \nthat danger and the serious consequences of climate \nchange and global warming for the well-being, \nlivelihoods and development of peoples around the \nworld, Cambodia has been assuming its share of \nresponsibility in the matter of global warming since \n2003. \n We have made the utmost effort to implement the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange and the Kyoto Protocol by promoting Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism projects and implementing \nour National Adaptation Programme of Action on \nclimate change. \n We have also launched a major campaign of \nreforestation all over the country; more than 49,000 \nhectares of trees have been planted. We have also \nbanned timber exports.  \n In this context, Cambodia warmly welcomes the \nrecent United States initiative to engage with the lower \nMekong basin countries by sharing with the Mekong \ncountries its best practices and experience on climate \nchange and flood and water resource management. At \nthe same time, the Mekong countries and Japan are \nnow looking into an approach for the future to achieve \nsustainable development of the Mekong basin \npotential, with better respect for the environment of the \nmighty Mekong River. \n Furthermore, Cambodia commends the recent \npromise of the Group of Eight (G-8) at its summit in \nJuly to work towards an 80 per cent reduction in \nheat-trapping pollution by 2050. Nonetheless, since \nclimate change is evolving steadily with time, we may \nquestion whether the pledged reduction can match the \nspeed of global warming. I believe that the \nindustrialized countries, which produce 80 per cent of \nthe greenhouse gases, should share greater \nresponsibility and take more drastic and urgent \nmeasures to reduce emissions of those deadly gases. \n Governments around the world have just over \nthree months to craft a new treaty to deal with global \nwarming. It will be a historic treaty for generations to \ncome. The United Nations Climate Change Conference \nto be held in Denmark in December could secure a \nmilestone plan to really slow down climate change for \nthe safety of all humankind. Therefore, Cambodia \nbelieves that all countries and all actors should join \nhands to reach an agreement in Copenhagen in \nDecember. The international community has an \nobligation to roll back global temperatures before it is \ntoo late. The future generations of our children and \ngrandchildren are at stake. \n I turn to the subject of food and energy security. \nThe sharp increase in oil prices last year prompted a \nnumber of countries to turn to the production of \nbioenergy crops as an alternative source of energy, thus \nreducing the available cultivated land, while the \nworld\u2019s population continued to grow day by day, \nincreasing demand for food. The combination of those \nrealities underlines the importance of a comprehensive \napproach to tackle the planet\u2019s food crisis. \n The challenge we now confront is, on the one \nhand, how to produce enough food to feed the growing \nworld population, and, on the other hand, how to \nrespond to the increased need for clean energy to save \nthe global environment and stop the advancing climate \nchange. The solution to this twin problem is to find a \nbalanced approach between food crop and bioenergy \nculture, and to develop alternative energy sources to \nmeet the growing demand. We should avoid any short-\nterm solution to the energy problem that would have \nharmful consequences for food security worldwide in \nthe long term. \n Finally, Cambodia welcomes the outcome of the \nG-8 meeting in L\u2019Aquila, Italy, with the commitment to \nmobilize $20 billion over the next three years to \nsupport agricultural production in poor countries. We \nhope that the commitment will be translated into \nconcrete and timely action. \n In parallel to all the serious global challenges that \nI have mentioned, there remain political and security \nproblems causing great concern. Terrorism is a threat \neverywhere and has caused the death of innocent \npeople. To fight terrorism more effectively, we need \nstronger and closer cooperation between the many \nauthorities concerned in order to face up to such \ncriminal acts against humanity. Moreover, some \ncountries with the capacity to produce nuclear weapons \nhave not yet signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty (NPT).  \n The dissemination of weapons of mass \ndestruction constitutes another massive, deadly menace \nto humanity. In this context, Cambodia highly values \nthe call by United States President Obama on \n23 September to \u201cstop the spread of nuclear weapons \nand seek the goal of a world without them\u201d \n(). Cambodia also warmly welcomes the \n \n \n17 09-52592 \n \nSecurity Council\u2019s resolve, expressed at its summit \n(see S/PV.6191) on 24 September, \u201cto seek a safer \nworld for all\u201d (Security Council resolution 1887 \n(2009), first preambular paragraph). \n Within the framework of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we have the Treaty \non the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone, \nwhich is an important instrument to keep South-East \nAsia free of nuclear weapons in order to ensure peace \nand security in that part of the world. It is also a good \nconfidence-building mechanism, which needs to be \nadhered to by all, especially the nuclear-weapon States. \nIn recent years ASEAN has actively encouraged the \nnuclear-weapon States to accede to the Treaty, but \nthere has been no concrete result or effect yet. Here \nalso we appeal to all nuclear-weapon States to engage \nmore constructively with the Treaty. \n I come now to the Korean Peninsula issue. We are \nall concerned about the rising tension in that part of the \nworld, which can affect peace and security in the \nregion. Cambodia urges all parties concerned to \nexercise the utmost restraint and re-engage in peaceful \nnegotiations in the six-party talks aimed at the early \ndenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We should \ncall upon the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nto keep in mind that the six-party talks remain an \nappropriate forum to contribute to the settlement of the \noverall problem in the Korean Peninsula. \n While talking about threats to international peace \nand security, we should also keep an eye on the Middle \nEast situation. The never-ending cycle of violence of \nthe Israel-Palestine conflict must be broken. One of the \nmost pressing issues is to achieve a just, \ncomprehensive and sustainable solution to the problem \nof Palestine in accordance with the legitimate rights of \nthe Palestinian people and the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions. Cambodia strongly urges all \nparties involved to cease using military force and \nviolence, in order to foster a peaceful and lasting \nsettlement through the establishment of a State of \nPalestine living side by side with the State of Israel in a \nspirit of peaceful coexistence and close cooperation \nbetween the two peoples. \n Before concluding, I should like to say a few \nwords about United Nations reform. For many years \nnow, almost all delegations to the General Assembly \nhave voiced their demand for reform of the United \nNations. But when it was time to act a conflict of \ninterest arose. In my view, the reform of the United \nNations should be in the interest of peace, security and \ndevelopment for the whole international community, \nand not just the particular interests of a country. The \nreform should also go beyond the restructuring of the \nUnited Nations organs, in order to enable this world \nbody to engage itself more actively in revitalizing the \nprimary role of the United Nations in world affairs.

        "file_text": "I begin by joining others \nin congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on \nassuming the noble and high responsibility of the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. Let me wish him well in his leadership as the \nUnited Nations makes its way through the myriad \nevolving challenges on the global agenda. I also take \nthis opportunity to commend the Secretary-General for \nhis vision and for the initiatives that he has resolutely \npursued in the interests of all humanity. \n The theme of the sixty-fourth General Assembly \nsession will serve to focus the attention of the \ninternational community on the critical importance of \nbuilding partnerships for more equitable and \nsustainable development. My delegation shares the \nbelief that sustainable development is the responsibility \nof everyone, and that its realization requires strong \npartnerships at all levels. I firmly believe that equity \nand sustainable development are mutually reinforcing \ngoals, for it would be difficult to support peace, \nsecurity and growth in any process of development that \nleft much of humanity behind.  \n One of the major goals of my country\u2019s \ncomprehensive reform programme, introduced during \nthe mid-1990s, is to promote social equity, especially \nin terms of integrating the needs of our culturally \ndiverse people and geographically remote communities \ninto our national development priorities. I am glad to \nsay that we are still pursuing our nationwide policy \nconsultation processes, aimed at developing and \nmaintaining sound policies and frameworks for \ndelivering services to our people at the grass-roots \nlevel. \n We in the Pacific are grateful to all our \ndevelopment partners for their continuing support and \ntheir commitment to working closely with us in \ndeveloping mechanisms for strengthening development \ncoordination, improving development outcomes, using \navailable resources effectively and ensuring \ninclusiveness in our approach to development. \n We are very much aware of the fact that despite \ncontinued high levels of development assistance over \nmany years, the economic and development \nperformance of island States in the Pacific region \nremains weak. Many countries in our region, including \nVanuatu, are not on track to achieve all the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Vanuatu will \ntherefore remain firmly committed to the principles of \nthe Cairns Compact on Strengthening Development \nCoordination in the Pacific. We are committed to \nworking closely with the Pacific Islands Forum \nSecretariat and other multilateral agencies to ensure \nthat all resources made available to the region are \nfocused on the aim of achieving real progress towards \nthe MDGs. We are also committed to work with our \nindividual donor partners to ensure that they support \nour national development priorities that are linked to \nour overall efforts to achieve the MDGs. \n However, Vanuatu is aware that commitments to \nstrengthening development coordination in the Pacific \nregion are being made against the backdrop of the \nglobal economic crisis. My delegation therefore wishes \nto renew our call to international financial institutions \nto assist Pacific island countries in responding to the \ninternational economic crisis. Vanuatu is very \nconcerned that its recent high economic growth \nperformance, which rose above 6 per cent between \n2006 and 2007, will fall sharply as a result of the \nglobal economic recession. International Monetary \nFund and Asian Development Bank growth estimates \nforecast that Vanuatu\u2019s economy will grow at a slower \n \n \n41 09-52470 \n \npace in 2008 and 2009, averaging between 3 and 4 per \ncent. Growth prospects for the future continue to be \nuncertain. Maintaining strong economic growth over \nthe next few years will be critical if Vanuatu is to \nsucceed in sustained delivery of such basic services as \neducation, health and infrastructure development to its \n80 scattered islands. \n In the light of these concerns Vanuatu is pleased \nthat in February 2010 it will be hosting a Pacific-\nUnited Nations Conference on The Human Face of the \nGlobal Economic Crisis in the Pacific. Discussions of \nthe organizational arrangements for this important \nevent are under way between my Government, United \nNations specialized agencies actively engaged in the \nPacific region and Pacific regional organizations. We \nall look forward to the outcome of the conference, \nespecially in terms of guidance and support for \nbuilding Pacific regional partnerships that can assist us \nin addressing the impacts of this and future global \neconomic crises on the livelihoods of our people. \n The complex and challenging circumstances in \nFiji have led to international condemnation and \npressure for early elections to be held. Further \ninternational pressure has been brought to bear on the \nGovernment of Fiji in view of more recent \ndevelopments. While Vanuatu is part of the Pacific-\nwide regional calls for an early return of democracy in \nFiji, my Government believes that continued \nengagement of the Fiji Government by the \ninternational community will be critical. Under \nVanuatu\u2019s chairmanship, the Melanesian Spearhead \nGroup has continued to maintain high-level dialogue \nwith the Government of Fiji, primarily to ascertain that \nGovernment\u2019s views and to put forward the concerns of \nneighbouring States. \n Vanuatu welcomes the recent establishment of a \nfull-fledged department to oversee the implementation \nof the framework for change that the Fiji Government \nintroduced recently and to facilitate a nationwide \nprocess of reconciliation and dialogue. As the closest \nneighbouring island State, Vanuatu continues to plead \nthat the process of returning Fiji to democracy and \nparliamentary legitimacy should be driven by peaceful \ndialogue and genuine concern for the socio-economic \nwell-being of the people of Fiji. Any punitive measures \nwould not be in the economic and social interest of the \ngood people of Fiji or the region of the Pacific as a \nwhole. We are all too aware of the unprecedented \nchallenges that small island developing States like \nVanuatu have come to be faced with today. Man-made \nor linked with such phenomena as climate change, \nthese challenges pose unacceptable implications for the \nsocial, economic and political structures of our small \nisland States and often have grave security \nimplications. \n Vanuatu would like at this juncture cordially to \napplaud the tireless and collective efforts of all the \nisland nations, large and small, in cooperating and \nworking together towards the adoption by the General \nAssembly this past June of resolution 63/281 on \nclimate change and its possible security implications. \nThis is indeed a historical milestone for Pacific small \nisland developing States, such as my own country, \nbecause for the first time the security implications of \nclimate change were brought to the attention of the \ninternational community. Over the years differing and \nconflicting views have stalled the strenuous efforts of \nthe small island countries in convincing the world that \nthe impact of climate change was irreversible. Inherent \nin many of the arguments that needed to be overcome \nwas the idea that there was still time. \n At this point I wish to reiterate that the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nmust be the principal forum for addressing climate \nchange. Given our vulnerabilities and geographic \nrealities, we in the Pacific region have been among the \nfirst fully to accept the security implications of climate \nchange. I would like to stress here that no country, \nsmall or large, developed or developing, will be able to \navoid the security implications of climate change, \nwhich are already affecting the livelihoods of our \npeople, as the international community struggles to \ncome to terms with the idea that climate change poses \na real threat to the future survival of mankind. Unless \nall the relevant organs of the United Nations intensify \ntheir efforts to consider and address the issue of \nclimate change, no word will be more appropriate to \nthe global situation under this particular crisis than the \nword \u201cdoomed\u201d. The momentum seen today forces \nupon us the realization that these threats are real and \ntherefore require urgent attention. \n In preparations for the coming conference in \nCopenhagen, leaders of the Alliance of Small Island \nStates have agreed this week that more action is \nrequired from members of the international community \nin living up to their commitments. While globalization \nand interdependency have brought with them both \nopportunities and challenges for the small island \n  \n \n09-52470 42 \n \nStates, the challenges predominate and are ominous. \nThe gathering of world leaders at the Summit on \nClimate Change at this year\u2019s General Assembly was a \nreaffirmation that climate change presents a security \nthreat to all our nations and peoples. \n Consisting of volcanic and coral islands, Vanuatu \nis one of the smaller island nations in the South Pacific \nregion and in the world. Because of Vanuatu\u2019s rapidly \ngrowing young population and low economic growth \nrate, the United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP) assessment, until very recently, ranked it as \none of the poorest countries in the South Pacific \nregion. This degree of underdevelopment drastically \nlimits its capacity to effectively curb threats associated \nwith the adverse impacts of climate change. \n More than 80 per cent of the people of Vanuatu \nlive off the land through subsistence farming, which \nconstitutes their contribution to the national economy. \nVanuatuan traditional farming practices have been \nshaped by farmers\u2019 subsistence needs and climatic \nconditions. Land has always been precious to the \nNi-Vanuatu; rights to its ownership and use form a \ncentral part of their culture and traditional governance. \nThe rapidly growing population of Vanuatu places \nincreasing pressure on access to a finite amount of \nfarmland. This issue is likely to be compounded by \nprobable losses of arable land owing to the adverse \neffects of climate change. Such possible losses raise \nserious economic, political and security implications \nfor Vanuatu. \n Not only is Vanuatu among the least developed \ncountries, but it remains one of the most disaster-prone \nnations among the small island States. It is highly \nsusceptible to cyclones, coastal erosion, river flooding, \nearthquakes, landslides, tsunamis and volcanic \neruptions. \n Without doubt these are challenging times. We \nfollowed with great interest the recent Conference on \nthe World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its \nImpact on Development. Vanuatu is deeply concerned \nthat the world financial crisis, like climate change, is \ncaused by external forces beyond our control, and yet \nits rippling effects are quickly reaching our nation\u2019s \nmost vulnerable populations. Children, women, the \ndisabled and the working poor will be the hardest hit \nand the least able to cope with dramatic changes. \n Vanuatu is indeed being hurt by a variety of \neconomic realities, such as decreasing trade, erratic \ncommodity prices, increased borrowing costs and \nstrains on official development assistance. One of the \nreasons for this downturn is that we are quite \ndependent on external financing, in the form of both \naid and trade. Furthermore our foreign-exchange \nearnings and our Government revenue rely on a small \nnumber of commodities. However, we are confident \nthat we will be able to counteract those weaknesses in \nour economic situation by introducing progressive \nmicroeconomic policy mechanisms, improving \nGovernment structures and striving to maintain \npolitical stability. This plan is in line with working to \nimplement the Millennium Development Goals and to \nachieve country targets by the year 2015. \n Vanuatu emphatically concurs with the premise of \nthe upcoming Copenhagen conference that climate \nchange is one of the most fundamental challenges ever \nto confront humanity. No issue is more fundamental to \nlong-term global prosperity, and no issue is more \nessential to our survival as a species. I strongly feel \nthat a fair and comprehensive global deal in \nCopenhagen will represent a step forward for all us, for \nnations small or large, developing or developed. \nMutual cooperation, respect and trust will be the key \npolitical driving forces for a successful deal in \nCopenhagen. \n While we commend recent efforts to reform the \nUnited Nations, Vanuatu shares the view of many other \ncountries that to ensure a stronger and more effective \nOrganization we need to reconsider the membership of \nthe Security Council sooner rather than later. If the \nCouncil\u2019s membership better reflected the world\u2019s \ngeography and better represented currently \nunderrepresented groups, the United Nations would \nbuild a stronger sense of common responsibility and \ncollective responsiveness. A more representative \nCouncil would bring openness and transparency, create \nconfidence and ameliorate understanding and \ncooperation. \n Still, any reform must be implemented in a way \nthat does not affect the authority of the Council. Of \ncourse there are diverse vested interests among us. But \nour common interests and the United Nations role in \nfurthering them must continue to hold a central place to \nensure the continuity of the international legal \nframework. Negotiations must therefore be conducted \nin an atmosphere of inclusion and through constructive \ndialogue and positive engagement. Diatribes offer no \nsolutions. We must remain resolute in our defence of \n \n \n43 09-52470 \n \nthe United Nations; the necessity of this Organization \nis continuously made clear by the horrors that the \nscourges of armed conflict, disease and famine inflict \non people, especially women and children. \n On a more administrative level, the highly \nbureaucratic procedures and accession mechanisms \nestablished by the United Nations system for much \nneeded funds have placed unnecessary strain on local \ncapacities. As the burgeoning climate crisis looms on \nthe horizon we need to identify ways of simplifying \nprocedures, such as those for accessing climate change \nmitigation funds, and to consider revising delivery \nmodalities, including exploring direct access \npossibilities. The blueprint for international \ncooperation may be in place but it must be followed up \nby action. \n Finally, my delegation welcomes Security \nCouncil resolution 1887 (2009) on non-proliferation of \nnuclear weapons and disarmament. The presence of all \nthe leaders of the Permanent Five at the meeting (see \nS/PV.6191) demonstrates a commitment to control the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction. Maintaining \ninternational peace and security will always remain \nhumanity\u2019s greatest challenge, and there is hope. \n Despite all our differences and diversities, human \nsecurity for all is our main objective. We recognize the \nefforts of the Secretary-General and commend the \nmanner in which he has pursued the mobilization of \npolitical momentum for Copenhagen with the relevant \nbodies of the United Nations. Saving the Earth and \nhumanity remains our ultimate goal. \n In conclusion, we go to Copenhagen with \noptimism. The future is in our hands. Let us not \ndeprive future generations of their right to live in a \nworld of peace and stability."

        "file_text": "It is indeed \nan honour to address the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfourth session. Today, we converge in this Hall to \noutline how, from the perspective of our respective \nnations, this esteemed body might uphold the rights of \nall mankind, secure world peace and indeed, ensure the \nvery survival of planet Earth. \n We converge here in order to arrive at some \ncollective insight regarding the interests of the world\u2019s \nvarious peoples as well as the interests of humankind \nitself. We have come here not only to be heard, but \nmore importantly to listen and ultimately to commit \nourselves, both as a body and as independent, \nsovereign States, to constructive, ameliorative action. \n I congratulate the President on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession and assure him of my Government\u2019s full \nsupport; and if I may, through him thank his \npredecessor, His Excellency Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann of Nicaragua for his leadership during his \npresidency of the sixty-third session. \n Our world is defined by issues of politics, the \nenvironment, trade and finance at the global level. Last \nyear\u2019s financial crisis, which continues to reverberate \nthroughout the world, stands as a sobering reminder of \nthe interconnectedness of our economies and the \nknowledge that multilateralism is indispensable. \nWhether we are speaking about global trade, monetary \nand fiscal policies, human rights protection, health and \npublic security or protecting the environment, these \nissues have become interlinked. And their complexity \nmeans that no country can act alone. \n The circumstances that precipitated the virtual \ncollapse of several financial institutions were not \ncreated by small States such as St. Kitts and Nevis. Yet, \nas in the case of climate change, their consequences \nhave been forced upon us and we are left to fend for \nourselves. But, if we are to learn anything from the \ncrises we face today, it should be that collective action \nand partnership are necessary not only in the \nmanagement of conflicts but also in building effective, \ncomprehensive and sustainable infrastructure to protect \nour citizens\u2019 future. The ever-changing global \nlandscape will require that Governments and \ninstitutions work to establish common regimes and \ninternational regulatory frameworks for some time to \ncome. \n To that end, my Government will support an \nenhanced role for political forums such as the United \nNations to strengthen multilateralism. We owe this \nmuch to the citizens around the world, who still look to \nthe United Nations for hope \u2014 rooted in the belief that \nthrough our efforts their aspirations will be realized.  \n We live in complex times, and unexpected \ndevelopments challenge our resolve daily. But we \ncannot and must not relent. We must double our efforts \nand use the convening power and political authority of \nthis Organization and others like it to find common \nground, even in the face of strident and sometimes \ndivergent views. That is how we build that \nindispensable architecture so as to create a legacy \nworthy of future generations. And that is no small feat; \nit is, in fact, a monumental task. But the Government \nof St. Kitts and Nevis is confident that the President\u2019s \ncentral role in the coming year will help us to craft a \ntemplate for collective action. \n I would like this General Assembly to be able to \nsee the world from the perspective of a small middle-\nincome heavily indebted country. The country that I \n  \n \n09-52586 26 \n \nhave the honour of leading is a small one \u2014 the \nsmallest nation in the Western hemisphere. Despite the \nrecent downturn, small economies like ours continue to \ndisplay resilience and to make the sacrifices necessary \nto sustain ourselves.  \n As far as our access to capital is concerned, our \nhard work and sound management have had \nunexpected, harsh and destabilizing implications, with \nunwelcome restrictions vis-\u00e0-vis debt relief and other \nkey matters. The international economic crisis has \nmade clear the urgent need for the restructuring and \nrepair of the global economic system. As this moves \nforward, I urge that the very real vulnerabilities of \nsmall States that happen to have high per capita gross \ndomestic product be more clearly considered and \nreflected in multilateral policies, deliberations and \nprocedures.  \n We seek support for a new debt forgiveness \ninitiative within the framework of the reform of the \ninternational financial institutions and through the \nmaterialization of a concept of middle-income highly \nindebted countries, in which peculiarities and \nvulnerabilities no longer trigger punitive actions such \nas premature graduation from concessionary financing. \n In addition, the global economic crisis, which \nbegan far beyond our shores, has nonetheless made its \nway to us and made it necessary for my country to \ndevelop and introduce its own stimulus package, thus \nforcing us to sacrifice urgently needed tax revenues in \nthe interest of protecting employment and to find the \nmeans to shore up and advance the viability of our own \nprivate sector. \n Nevertheless, we are continuing to invest in our \npeople through education and retraining programmes \nand by working to attract international investments in \ncritical sectors to generate employment and other \nbusiness opportunities. By doing this, we hope to \nprepare for the future, when the global economy \neventually rebounds. \n It is no secret that our efforts can sometimes \namount to very little, because, through no fault of our \nown, it is a fact that when global crises occur, small \nvulnerable economies tend to pay a disproportionately \nhigh price. But under my leadership, Saint Kitts and \nNevis will not play victim or assign blame. We prefer \ninstead to work vigorously at the national level and to \ncollaborate actively internationally so as to introduce \nmeasures and systems that transform our economy and \nimprove the lives of our citizens. \n Going forward, we want our voices and ideas to \ninform whatever new architecture is developed, so as \nto avoid the mistakes of the past. Therefore, we will \nsupport the measures established to follow up on issues \npertaining to recovery from the global financial and \neconomic crises. And we intend to participate \nenthusiastically in the process to ensure that the \nrecovery is comprehensive. \n We have common challenges and a shared \nresponsibility to tackle them. We in the Caribbean have \nrepeatedly called on the international community to \nrecognize the special circumstances attending the \nrealities of small island developing States, not as a \nfavour to us, but as a practical way of addressing the \nmultifaceted and complex issues that we face. For \ninstance, on the issue of environmental protection, the \nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis has always urged \na multilateral approach. \n The interconnectedness of our planet, then, is \nindeed real, and nowhere is it more so than on the issue \nof climate change. Whereas small countries such as \nSaint Kitts and Nevis have tiny carbon footprints with \nnegative environmental impact, global warming and \nclimate change, with their effects, do not discriminate. \nWe can all agree that the incidence of catastrophic \nclimatic events, such as hurricanes, floods and \nmudslides, continue to cause more destruction and \nclaim more and more lives each year. \n The geography of our small islands is changing. \nSea levels are rising, and the marine life on which \nmany of our citizens depend for their livelihoods is fast \ndiminishing. Our coastlines are being affected. Our \nreefs are paying a high price. The long-term \nimplications for food production are dire indeed. \nAgain, though those changes began far beyond our \nshores, climate change has been inflicting a massive \nand disproportionate blow on nations such as mine, \ncausing us now to urge, in the strongest possible terms, \ntimely and effective action. Saint Kitts and Nevis is not \ninterested in stale debates about blame; we are \ninterested in action, and we want to play our own part. \n In the interest of advancing global stability, \ntherefore, we urge unrelenting commitment to emission \ntargets by industrialized nations. We urge that the \nmajor global emitters take the lead in ensuring that the \nresources are in place so that small island developing \n \n \n27 09-52586 \n \nStates can meet our adaptation, mitigation, technology \ntransfer and capacity-building goals. And we urge that \nthe emitters embrace the measures needed to \ncompensate for the risks and the losses resulting from \nclimate change. \n We continue to collaborate regionally and to work \ntowards efforts in the areas of disaster preparedness, \nreduction and mitigation. We recognize that high \ndependence on fossil fuels is untenable. Therefore, \nwith support from the Organization of American States \nand private enterprise, we are exploring renewable \nsources of energy, including geothermal energy, in the \nFederation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. \n As the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol \napproaches, my Government welcomes the recent \ncommitments by some industrialized countries to do \nmore to address harmful emissions. I hope that that \nwill be translated into concrete results on the \nenvironment and climate change at the Copenhagen \nsummit later this year. \n I also wish to urge the United Nations to \nstrengthen the Small Island Developing States Unit \nwith additional resources to make it more effective in \naddressing the concerns of Member States. I look \nforward to the Unit\u2019s assistance as we work towards \nthe five-year review of the Mauritius Strategy for the \nFurther Implementation of the Programme of Action \nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island \nDeveloping States at the current sixty-fourth session. I \nurge Member States to ensure that the agreed goals of \nthe Mauritius Strategy and the commitments made are \nimplemented and to support initiatives proposed during \nthe review exercise. \n In multilateralism, constructive partnership is an \neffective strategy. In such an approach, we are forced \nto appreciate the value of belonging: the need for all \npeoples of the world to be embraced within the \nfraternity of nations and to be allowed to contribute to \nthe common good. The Republic of China on Taiwan, a \nconstructive partner to a range of countries around the \nworld for so long, has a great deal to contribute to \nspecialized agencies and programmes of the United \nNations, such as the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and the International \nCivil Aviation Organization, given that climate change \nand aviation safety affect its own development, as well \nas the well-being of all mankind. \n The issue of security continues to be prominent \non the international agenda, and the global anti-crime \ncampaign intensifies, as concern heightens in the face \nof emerging threats to our citizens and to society. This \ndevelopment is the result of a new wave of crime and \nviolence, especially among the youth population. In the \nhemisphere, there is increased focus on human security \nin relation to the transnational nature of the categories \nof crime \u2014 especially illicit trafficking in drugs and \nfirearms \u2014 that are linked to anti-social behaviour, \nparticularly among our youth.  \n An emerging trend in the global analysis of crime \npoints to a new variable: young people as victims of \ncrime. Studies show that, in increasing numbers, the \nvictims and perpetrators of crime are young men. The \nreality of coexisting in a global village, the prevalence \nand sophistication of modern technology, the enhanced \ncommunication infrastructure and the free movement \nof capital and people have given rise to an \nunprecedented escalation in crime and violence. \n Youth alienation, youth rage and youth brutality \nare troubling global phenomena in urgent need of \nglobal analysis and action. And so, this moment \ndemands that this body, with its unique capacities and \ncapabilities and as part of its quest for international \nsocietal stability, marshal all available resources to \nbetter identify the underlying causative factors and \ncome to a clear agreement as to how, individually and \ncollectively, we can halt and reverse this destabilizing \ntrajectory. \n Violence is a multisectoral public-policy \nchallenge. It spans several areas, including public \nsecurity, governance, development and public health. \nThe human, social and financial costs of violence are \nunacceptably high. In addition to physical injury and \ndeath, violence has a serious and lifelong impact on \nmental and physical health, including \nnon-communicable diseases and HIV/AIDS, and \ndamages the social fabric, leading to unsafe \ncommunities. Ultimately, violence slows economic and \nsocial development in those countries that can least \nafford it. However, scientific evidence amassed in \nrecent years clearly demonstrates that violence and its \nconsequences can be successfully prevented. But, at \npresent, an integrated approach to violence prevention \nis lacking. \n An attempt to define a regional response to the \nproblem was made at a recent two-day regional \n  \n \n09-52586 28 \n \nsymposium, held on 22 and 23 June 2009 in Saint Kitts \nand Nevis, on the theme \u201cConfronting the challenges \nof youth crime and violence: Defining a multisectoral \nresponse\u201d. We would like to call upon Member States \nto join us today in submitting a draft resolution in \nsupport of an integrated approach and multisectoral \nresponse to violence prevention, which we would wish \nto place on the agenda of the sixty-fifth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n My Government strongly condemns all forms of \nviolence, including transnational organized crime and \nterrorism. And while we commend the United Nations \nfor its continued assistance to Member States in our \ncrime-fighting efforts, we urge that it extend its support \nby reopening, in the spirit of developing an effective \nmultilateral approach, the United Nations Office on \nDrugs and Crime regional office in the Caribbean. \n The challenges we must meet are vast. The \nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons today and a \nworld free of nuclear weapons tomorrow should be the \ngoals of us all. \n Within the Pan-Caribbean Partnership, we \ncontinue to develop and expand regional responses to \nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic. The problems posed by the \nHIV/AIDS pandemic are a real and growing threat, not \nonly in terms of loss of life and livelihood, but also to \nthe extent that the disease eliminates the most \nproductive groups in our society and demands outlays \nof capital that would otherwise be allocated to \neconomic and social development. The Caribbean \nCommunity, through the Pan-Caribbean Partnership, \nhas made gains in tackling the medical aspects of the \ndisease. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n But we need to do much more to fight stigma and \ndiscrimination and to increase access to inexpensive \nantiretroviral drugs and treatment for those infected \nwith the disease. With the help of the international \ncommunity, we can reconcile the objective need of \npharmaceutical companies to receive proper \ncompensation for their research, development and \ninvestment without prejudice to those who are in \nurgent need of care and without politicizing the issue. \n We, too, are very concerned about the challenges \nthat non-communicable chronic diseases pose to small \ncountries like ours and to mankind in general. In this \nregard, we join with the Prime Minister of Trinidad and \nTobago in calling on the United Nations to convene at \nthe earliest opportunity a special summit on \nnon-communicable chronic disease. \n In conclusion, Mr. President, my Government \napplauds your initiative to pursue effective responses \nto global crises and strengthen multilateralism. For \nSaint Kitts and Nevis, multilateralism is a sine qua non \nand the only effective approach to lasting peace, \neffective security and sustainable development. We \nhave seen the fallout from unilateral action. Many of us \nhave paid the price for the decisions and actions made \nin isolation by a few. \n I emphasize that it is the fundamental right of all \nhumankind to choose its own destiny. At the same \ntime, we have a collective duty to act responsibly and \nto work in the interest of the common good. That is the \npremise of multilateralism. That is the promise of my \nGovernment, and, Mr. President, my delegation stands \nprepared and willing to support you in this cause. \n I recall that it was Hubert H. Humphrey, former \nVice-President of the United States of America, who \nfelt it necessary to emphasize to individuals, like those \nof us in this Hall today, our responsibility to ensure \nthat the United Nations is a force for verifiable, \nconstructive change in the world. In reminding us and \nthose who will come after us of what is expected of us, \nhe said:  \n \u201cThe heroes of the world community are not \nthose who withdraw when difficulties ensue, not \nthose who can envision neither the prospect of \nsuccess nor the consequence of failure \u2014 but \nthose who stand the heat of battle, the fight for \nworld peace through the United Nations.\u201d \n This we must do today and forever.

        "file_text": "Nearly 62 years ago, the \nUnited Nations recognized the right of the Jews, an \nancient people 3,500 years old, to a State of their own \nin their ancestral homeland. I stand here today as the \nPrime Minister of Israel, the Jewish State, and I speak \nto the Assembly on behalf of my country and my \npeople. \n The United Nations was founded after the \ncarnage of the Second World War and the horrors of \nthe Holocaust. It was charged with preventing the \nreoccurrence of such horrendous events. Nothing has \nundermined that mission, nothing has impeded it more, \nthan the systematic assault on the truth. Yesterday, the \nPresident of Iran stood at this very rostrum spewing his \nlatest anti-Semitic rants. Just a few days earlier, he \nagain claimed that the Holocaust was a lie. \n Last month, I went to a villa in a suburb of Berlin \ncalled Wannsee. There, on 20 January 1942, after a \nhearty meal, senior Nazi officials met and decided to \nexterminate my people. They left detailed minutes of \nthat meeting that have been preserved for posterity by \nsuccessive German Governments. I have here a copy of \nthe minutes of the meeting of senior Nazi officials \ninstructing the Nazi Government exactly how to carry \nout the extermination of the Jewish people. Is that \nprotocol a lie? Are the German Government and all \nGerman Governments lying? \n The day before I was in Wannsee, in Berlin I was \ngiven the original construction plans for the \nAuschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. I now hold in \nmy hand the Auschwitz-Birkenau plans. They contain \nthe signature of Heinrich Himmler, Hitler\u2019s deputy, \nhimself. Are those plans for the Auschwitz-Birkenau \nconcentration camp, where 1 million Jews were \nmurdered, a lie too? In June, President Obama visited \nanother concentration camp, one of many \u2014 the \n \n \n09-52320 36 \n \nBuchenwald concentration camp. Did President Obama \npay tribute to a lie? \n And what of the Auschwitz survivors, whose \narms still bear the tattooed numbers branded on them \nby the Nazis? Are those tattoos a lie, too? One third of \nall Jews perished in the great conflagration of the \nHolocaust. Nearly every Jewish family, including my \nown, was affected. My wife\u2019s grandparents, her \nfather\u2019s two sisters and three brothers, and all the \naunts, uncles and cousins were murdered by the Nazis. \nIs that a lie?   \n Yesterday, the man who calls the Holocaust a lie \nspoke from this rostrum. I commend those who refused \nto come and those who left in protest. They stood up \nfor moral clarity and brought honour to their countries. \nBut to those who gave that denier of the Holocaust a \nhearing, I say on behalf of my people, the Jewish \npeople, and of decent people everywhere: Have they no \nshame? Have they no decency? A mere six decades \nafter the Holocaust, they give legitimacy to a man who \ndenies the murder of 6 million Jews, while promising \nto wipe out the State of Israel, the State of the Jews. \n That is a disgrace. It is a mockery of the Charter \nof the United Nations. Perhaps some representatives \nthink that that man and his odious regime threaten only \nthe Jews. If they believe that, they are wrong \u2014 dead \nwrong. History has shown us time and again that what \nstarts with attacks on the Jews eventually ends up \nengulfing many, many others.  \n For this Iranian regime is fuelled by an extreme \nfundamentalism that burst onto the world scene three \ndecades ago after lying dormant for centuries. In the \npast 30 years, that fanaticism has swept across the \nglobe with a murderous violence that knows no bounds \nand with a cold-blooded impartiality in the choice of \nits victims. It has callously slaughtered Muslims, \nChristians, Jews, Hindus and many others. The \nadherents of that unforgiving creed, although it is \ncomprised of different offshoots, seek to return \nhumanity to medieval times. Wherever they can, they \nimpose a backward, regimented society where women, \nminorities, gays or anyone else deemed not to be a true \nbeliever is brutally subjugated.  \n The struggle against that fanaticism does not pit \nfaith against faith, or civilization against civilization. It \npits civilization against barbarism, the twenty-first \ncentury against the ninth, and those who sanctify life \nagainst those who glorify death. The primitivism of the \nninth century ought to be no match for the progress of \nthe twenty-first. The allure of freedom, the power of \ntechnology and the reach of communications should \nsurely win the day. Ultimately, the past cannot triumph \nover the future, and our future offers all nations \nmagnificent bounties of hope because the pace of \nprogress is growing, and growing exponentially.  \n It took us centuries to get from the printing press \nto the telephone, decades to get from the telephone to \nthe personal computer, and only a few years to get \nfrom the personal computer to the Internet. What \nseemed impossible a few years ago is already outdated, \nand we can scarcely fathom the changes that are yet to \ncome. We will crack the genetic code. We will cure the \nincurable. We will lengthen our lives. We will find a \ncheap alternative to fossil fuel, and we will clean up \nthe planet.    \n I am proud that my country, Israel, is at the \nforefront of many of those advances in science and \ntechnology, medicine and biology, agriculture and \nwater, and energy and the environment. Those \ninnovations in my country and in many others offer \nhumanity a sunlit future of unimagined promise. \n However, if the most primitive fanaticism can \nacquire the most deadly weapons, the march of history \ncould be reversed for a time and, like the belated \nvictory over the Nazis, the forces of progress and \nfreedom prevail only after a horrific toll of blood and \nfortune has been exacted from mankind. That is why \nthe greatest threat facing the world today is the \nmarriage between religious fundamentalism and the \nweapons of mass destruction.  \n The most urgent challenge facing this body today \nis to prevent the tyrants of Tehran from acquiring \nnuclear weapons. Are the Members of the United \nNations up to that challenge? Will the international \ncommunity confront a despotism that terrorizes its own \npeople as they bravely stand up for freedom? Will it \ntake action against the dictators who stole an election \nin broad daylight and then gunned down Iranian \nprotesters, who died on the sidewalks and in the streets \nchoking in their own blood? Will the international \ncommunity thwart the world\u2019s most pernicious sponsor \nand practitioner of terrorism? Above all, will the \ninternational community stop the terrorist regime of \nIran from developing atomic weapons and thereby \nendangering the peace of the entire world? \n \n \n37 09-52320 \n \n The people of Iran are courageously standing up \nto this regime. People of goodwill around the world \nstand with them, as do the thousands who have been \nprotesting outside this Hall throughout the week. Will \nthe United Nations stand with them? \n The jury is still out on the United Nations. Recent \nsigns are not encouraging. Rather than condemning the \nterrorists and their Iranian patrons, some here in the \nUnited Nations have condemned their victims. This is \nexactly what a recent United Nations report on Gaza \ndid, falsely equating the terrorists with those they \ntargeted. \n For eight long years, Hamas fired rockets from \nGaza on nearby Israeli cities and citizens \u2014 thousands \nof missiles and mortars hailing down from the sky on \nschools, homes, shopping centres and bus stops. Year \nafter year, as these missiles were deliberately fired on \nour civilians, not one single United Nations resolution \nwas passed condemning those criminal attacks. We \nheard nothing \u2014 absolutely nothing \u2014 from the \nHuman Rights Council of the United Nations, a \nmisnamed institution if ever there was one. \n In 2005, hoping to advance peace, Israel \nunilaterally withdrew from every inch of Gaza. It was \nvery painful. We dismantled 21 settlements, really \nbedroom communities and farms. We uprooted over \n8,000 Israelis; we just yanked them out of their homes. \nWe did this because many in Israel believed that it \nwould win peace. Well, we did not get peace. Instead \nwe got an Iranian-backed terror base 50 miles from \nTel Aviv. But life in the Israeli towns and cities \nimmediately adjacent to Gaza became nothing less than \na nightmare. The Hamas rocket attacks not only \ncontinued after we left, they actually increased \ndramatically. They increased tenfold. And again, the \nUnited Nations was silent \u2014 absolutely silent. \n Well, after eight years of this unremitting assault, \nIsrael was finally forced to respond. But how should \nwe have responded? There is only one example in \nhistory of thousands of rockets being fired on a \ncountry\u2019s civilian population. This happened when the \nNazis rocketed British cities during the Second World \nWar. During that war, the Allies levelled German cities, \ncausing hundreds of thousands of casualties. I am not \npassing judgement; I am stating a fact, a fact that is the \nproduct of the decisions of great and honourable \nmen \u2014 the leaders of Britain and the United States \u2014 \nfighting an evil force in the Second World War. \n It is also a fact that Israel chose to respond \ndifferently. Faced with an enemy committing a double \nwar crime \u2014 firing on civilians while hiding behind \ncivilians \u2014 Israel sought to conduct surgical strikes \nagainst the rocket-launchers themselves. That was no \neasy task because the terrorists were firing their \nmissiles from homes and schools, using mosques as \nweapons depots and missile caches, and ferreting \nexplosives in ambulances. \n Israel, by contrast, tried to minimize casualties by \nurging Palestinian civilians to vacate the targeted \nareas. We dropped countless flyers over their homes. \nWe sent thousands and thousands of text messages to \nthe Palestinian residents. We made thousands and \nthousands of cellular phone calls urging them to \nvacate, to leave. Never has a country gone to such \nextraordinary lengths to remove the enemy\u2019s civilian \npopulation from harm\u2019s way.  \n Yet faced with an absolutely clear-cut case of \naggressor and victim, who do you think the United \nNations Human Rights Council decided to condemn? \nIsrael. A democracy legitimately defending itself \nagainst terror is morally hanged, drawn and quartered, \nand given an unfair trial to boot. By these twisted \nstandards, the Human Rights Council would have \ndragged Roosevelt and Churchill to the dock as war \ncriminals. What a perversion of truth! What a \nperversion of justice! \n The delegates to the United Nations and the \nGovernments that they represent have a decision to \nmake. Will they accept this farce? Because if they do, \nthe United Nations would revert to its darkest days, \nwhen the worst violators of human rights sat in \njudgement against the law-abiding democracies, when \nZionism was equated with racism and when an \nautomatic majority could be mustered to declare that \nthe Earth is flat. If you had to choose a date when the \nUnited Nations began its descent, almost a freefall, and \nlost the respect of many thoughtful people in the \ninternational community, it was the day in 1975 it \ndecided to equate Zionism with racism. \n Now this body has a choice to make. If it does \nnot reject this biased report, it would vitiate itself, it \nwould recommence the process of vitiating its own \nrelevance and importance. But it would also do \nsomething else. It would send the message to terrorists \neverywhere that terrorism pays: all you have to do is \n \n \n09-52320 38 \n \nlaunch your attacks from densely populated areas, and \nyou will win immunity. \n A third point: in condemning Israel, this body \nwould also deal a mortal blow to peace. Let me explain \nwhy. When Israel left Gaza, many hoped that the \nmissile attacks would stop. Others believed that, even \nif they did not stop, at the very least Israel, in having \nmade this extraordinary gesture for peace, would have \ninternational legitimacy to exercise its right of self-\ndefence if peace failed. What legitimacy? What self-\ndefence? \n The same United Nations that cheered Israel as it \nleft Gaza and promised to back our right of self-\ndefence now accuses us \u2014 my people, my country \u2014 \nof being war criminals? And for what? For acting \nresponsibly in self-defence? For acting in a way that \nany country would act, with a restraint unmatched by \nmany? What a travesty! \n Israel justly defended itself against terror. This \nbiased and unjust report provides a clear-cut test for all \nGovernments. Will the Assembly stand with Israel or \nwill it stand with the terrorists? We must know the \nanswer to that question now. Now, not later. Because if \nIsrael is again asked to take more risks for peace, we \nmust know today that the Assembly will stand with us \ntomorrow. Only if we have the confidence that we can \ndefend ourselves can we take further risks for peace. \n Make no mistake: all of Israel wants peace. Any \ntime an Arab leader genuinely wanted peace with us, \nwe made peace. We made peace with Egypt led by \nAnwar Sadat. We made peace with Jordan led by King \nHussein. And if the Palestinians truly want peace, my \nGovernment and I, and my people, will make peace. \nBut we want a genuine peace, a defensible peace, a \npermanent peace.  \n In 1947, this body voted to establish two States \nfor two peoples \u2014 a Jewish State and an Arab State. \nThe Jews accepted that resolution. The Arabs rejected \nit and invaded the embryonic Jewish State with the \nhopes of annihilating it. \n We ask the Palestinians to finally do what they \nhave refused to do for 62 years: say yes to a Jewish \nState. It is as simple, as clear and as elementary as that. \nJust as we are asked to recognize a nation-State of the \nPalestinian people, the Palestinians must be asked to \nrecognize the nation-State of the Jewish people. The \nJewish people are not foreign conquerors in the Land \nof Israel. It is the land of our forefathers. \n Inscribed on the walls outside this building is the \ngreat Biblical vision of peace: \u201cNation shall not lift up \nsword against nation. They shall learn war no more.\u201d \nThese words were spoken by the great Jewish prophet \nIsaiah 2,800 years ago as he walked in my country, in \nmy city, in the hills of Judea and in the streets of \nJerusalem.  \n We are not strangers to this land. This is our \nhomeland. But as deeply connected as we are to our \nhomeland, we also recognize that the Palestinians also \nlive there and they want a home of their own. We want \nto live side by side with them \u2014 two free peoples \nliving in peace, living in prosperity, living in dignity.  \n Peace, prosperity and dignity require one other \nelement: we must have security. The Palestinians \nshould have all the powers to govern themselves except \na handful of powers that could endanger Israel. That is \nwhy the Palestinian State must be effectively \ndemilitarized. I say \u201ceffectively\u201d because we do not \nwant another Gaza, another south Lebanon, another \nIranian-backed terror base abutting Jerusalem and \nperched on the hills a few kilometres from Tel Aviv. \n We want peace. I believe that with goodwill and \nwith hard work such a peace can be achieved. But it \nrequires that all of us roll back the forces of terror led \nby Iran that seek to destroy peace, that seek to \neliminate Israel and to overthrow the world order.  The \nquestion facing the international community is whether \nit is prepared to confront those forces, or will it \naccommodate them. \n Over 70 years ago, Winston Churchill lamented \nwhat he called the \u201cconfirmed unteachability of \nmankind\u201d. By that he meant the unfortunate habit of \ncivilized societies to sleep and to slumber until danger \nnearly overtakes them. Churchill bemoaned what he \ncalled the  \n \u201cwant of foresight, unwillingness to act when \naction would be simple and effective, lack of \nclear thinking, confusion of counsel until the \nemergency comes, until self-preservation strikes \nits jarring gong \u2026\u201d. \n I speak here today in the hope that Churchill\u2019s \nassessment of the \u201cunteachability of mankind\u201d is for \nonce proven wrong. I speak here today in the hope that \n \n \n39 09-52320 \n \nwe can learn from history, that we can prevent danger \nin time. \n In the spirit of the timeless words spoken to \nJoshua over 3,000 years ago, let us be strong and of \ngood courage.  Let us confront this peril, secure our \nfuture and, God willing, forge an enduring peace for \ngenerations to come. \n(spoke in Hebrew) \n May God bless his people with peace; may God  \ngive strength to his people; may God bless his people \nwith peace."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \ncongratulating our sisterly country the Libyan Arab \nJamahiriya and you personally, Mr. President, on your \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-fourth session. I express our confidence that \nyour long-standing diplomatic skills and leadership \nwill lead us to a successful conclusion of the session. I \nwish to assure you of the full support of the delegation \nof the State of Eritrea in the realization of this mission. \n Permit me also to seize this opportunity to pay a \nwell-deserved tribute to the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-third session, Mr. Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua, for the very able \nand effective manner in which he led the affairs of the \nAssembly. \n Likewise, we commend Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his continuous efforts to administer \nthe affairs of the United Nations, and especially for \nconvening the Summit on Climate Change last week. \n The General Assembly is holding its annual \ngeneral debate for 2009 at a very critical juncture. One \nyear after the world financial and economic crisis \nbegan, this gathering provides us with another \nopportunity for reflection. \n The Hall in which we meet today and the lofty \npurposes for which it was built have both outlived their \ntime. This body was conceived in another era to \naddress the challenges of the world order prevailing \nafter the First and Second World Wars. Therefore, it \ncannot realistically cope with the demands of the \ntwenty-first century. From an objective point of view, \nthe United Nations should have embarked on a process \nof transformation 20 years ago, in concurrence with the \nend of the cold war. By now, it should have been \nreplaced by a reformed Organization fit to address the \nchallenges of the century we live in and beyond. \n The calls to re-engineer this renewed \nOrganization have not been few. Two decades have \npassed without any meaningful results in the direction \n \n \n23 09-52598 \n \nof substantive reform. The financial and economic \ncrisis and the global awareness that it has spawned are \nmere symptoms of the consequences of inaction at the \ncost of reform. \n The prevailing world order has not succeeded in \nguaranteeing the peace and security of our planet, in \nspite of all the intentions that brought forth its creation \nand of the harsh lessons learned from the two World \nWars. On the contrary, this ageing world order has been \nhijacked to serve the interests of the few, opening the \ndoor to a myriad of ramifications.  \n Financial institutions have been left to operate \nunrestrained by restrictions or regulations. Economic \nstructures that pillage the resources and wealth of \npeoples and nations have been consolidated. \nIllegitimate military and coercive blunders have been \nallowed to fester unchecked. The exploitation of war \nand those who help spread it have been honed in a \npurposeful manner. The number of people suffering \nfrom poverty and hunger has not been reduced; it has \nrather multiplied many times over. Violent extremism \nhas not received the attention it deserves; rather, it has \nbeen further fuelled and manipulated as a pretext and \nexcuse for ulterior motives. A culture of the politics of \nfear and management by crisis has been nurtured, \nexploited and established as a norm. Indeed, world \npeace and security have been imperilled beyond \nmeasure. The United Nations itself has been one of the \nvictims of this world order. Evidence to this effect is \nknown to us all and is well documented. \n Reform and change are long overdue. Despite \nfervent calls for reform by the international \ncommunity, the few who control our outdated world \norder are unfortunately not attuned to the notion of \nchange. They have instead regarded crises and \nsuffering as ordinary historical imperatives. To this \nend, they have resisted all attempts to introduce change \nand, through their clout, influence and advantages, \nhave been able to block it. Thus, no real reform has \noccurred so far. \n In this global maelstrom, where even the peoples \nof the developed countries have been adversely \naffected, none have been more exposed to harm than \nthe marginalized in Africa. We, the peoples of Africa, \nhave been victims of poverty and hunger, models of \nbackwardness, and metaphors for diseases and \nepidemics. And the continent has become a breeding \nground for crises and conflicts.  \n In this regard, the most urgent concern is the fact \nthat special-interest groups have rendered Africans \nparalysed. Hence, instead of resolving our own \nproblems, we find ourselves mired in poverty, hunger \nand disease rather than actively striving to achieve \ndevelopment and growth. Similarly, when it comes to \nthe resolution of crises and conflicts, Africans find \nthemselves dependent on the goodwill of others.  \n However, criticism cannot be reserved only for \nthe special-interest groups that steer the prevailing \nworld order; it must also be apportioned to those \ngroups that serve as their instruments and partners. \nIndeed, the role of Africa in this body, as well as in \nother international organizations, can best be described \nas inconsequential. The evidence for this unfortunate \nsituation is also well documented. \n If world peace and security are to be preserved, \njustice and human rights respected, hunger eradicated, \nand economic development and growth made to benefit \nthe majority in a sustainable fashion, the implementation \nof fundamental change in this Organization and other \ninternational bodies should not be left to the goodwill \nof the few. The change needed to transform this \noutdated world order into a new one must not be \nlimited to reform; it should be solid, genuine and \ncapable of bringing peace, security and prosperity to \ncoming generations. Reform should not be limited to \nincreasing the number of seats in the Security Council. \nIt should, rather, steer our world away from its \ndangerous downhill path, controlled by a powerful few, \nand redirect it towards one that ensures the safety of \nall. \n Though this is the ideal to which the world\u2019s \npeoples aspire and strive for, the African continent, for \nobvious and particular reasons, needs to expend more \neffort to achieve it. But beyond all the good wishes, the \nfundamental reform we are waiting for requires \ncollective commitment. On this auspicious occasion, it \nwould not do simply to dwell on various current events \nor those consequences spawned by the fundamental \nflaws of the world order. Doing so would only confuse \nand distort the bigger picture. I have therefore chosen \nnot to address important issues concerning the Horn of \nAfrica and Eritrea\u2019s specific problem of the illegal \noccupation of sovereign Eritrean territory, which is \nalready in the records of the United Nations awaiting \nresponsible and urgent action."

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency and \nreiterate our confidence in his ability to conduct our \nwork and our deliberations successfully. I would also \nlike to recognize the excellent leadership of Father \nMiguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, President of the \nAssembly at its previous session. The ethical \ndimension and political scope of his presidency have \nenabled us to move forward towards the goal of \nrestoring to this Assembly all its powers, and will stand \nas a benchmark for the future. Thanks to his example, \nit has become even clearer to us now that reforming the \nUnited Nations is about democratizing it and bringing \nit closer to the people. \n Since the general debate of one year ago \nimportant events have occurred in the international \narena. Climate change is now more visible and \ndangerous. The economic crisis has become intense \nand global. Social exclusion has increased. \n However, the international community reacted \nwith profound optimism to the change of Government \nin the United States. It seemed that a period of extreme \naggressiveness, unilateralism and arrogance in the \nforeign policy of that country had come to an end and \nthe infamous legacy of the George W. Bush regime had \ncrumbled in repudiation. As those in this very Hall can \nattest, novel and conciliatory words from the White \nHouse raised great hopes, and the world welcomed his \nrepeated messages of change, dialogue and \ncooperation. Unfortunately, time goes by, and those \nwords do not seem to be supported by concrete facts. \nThe words do not coincide with reality. \n The most serious and dangerous aspect of this \nnew situation is the uncertainty about the real capacity \nof the present authorities in Washington to overpower \nthe sweeping political and ideological currents that \nthreatened the world under the previous Administration. \nThe neoconservative groups that placed George Bush \nin the presidency \u2014 the powers that promoted the use \nof force and domination under the protection of the \ncolossal military and economic strength of the United \nStates and that are to blame for crimes including \ntorture, assassination and the manipulation of the \nAmerican people \u2014 have quickly regrouped and retain \nimmense resources of power and influence, contrary to \nthe change proclaimed. \n The detention and torture centre at the \nGuant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base \u2014 which usurps Cuban \nterritory \u2014 has not been shut down. The occupation \ntroops in Iraq have not been withdrawn. The war in \nAfghanistan is expanding and is threatening other \nStates.  \n As for Cuba, which has suffered American \naggression for half a century, last April the new United \nStates Government announced measures to abolish \nsome of the Bush Administration\u2019s most brutal actions \nthat prohibited contact between Cubans living in the \nUnited States and their relatives in Cuba, particularly \nthe possibility to visit them and to send assistance \nwithout limitations. These measures are a positive step, \nbut they are extremely limited and insufficient. \n The announced measures included authorizing \nAmerican companies to carry out certain \ntelecommunications operations with Cuba, but other \nrestrictions that prevent the implementation of those \noperations have not been modified. Nor has there been \nany sign that the United States Government is ready to \nput an end to the immoral practice \u2014 which has \nrecently increased \u2014 of misappropriating Cuban funds \nfrozen in American banks, as well as other goods, \nunder the protection of venal judges who violate their \nown laws. \n The essential fact is that the economic, \ncommercial and financial blockade of Cuba remains in \nplace. The United States President, despite the \nexistence of laws such as the Helms-Burton Act, still \nhas broad executive powers, such as the granting of \nlicenses, by means of which he could modify the \nimplementation of the blockade.  \n If there were a true desire for change, the United \nStates Government could authorize the export of Cuban \ngoods and services to the United States and vice versa. \nThe United States could allow Cuba to buy anywhere \nin the world products comprised of more than 10 per \ncent American components or technology, regardless of \ntrademark or country of origin. The United States \nDepartment of the Treasury could refrain from \npursuing, freezing and confiscating third-country \ntransfers in United States dollars and other currencies \nto Cuban nationals or entities. Washington could lift \nthe ban preventing third-country vessels from docking \nat any American port until 180 days after calling at any \nCuban port. The Treasury Department\u2019s persecution of \nfinancial institutions and companies that trade with or \n \n \n17 09-52598 \n \ncarry out operations in Cuba could also be suspended. \nPresident Obama could allow American citizens, by \nmeans of a license, to travel to Cuba \u2014 the only \ncountry in the world they are not allowed to visit. \n The Secretary-General\u2019s report to the Assembly \n(A/64/97) abounds with examples. In the course of \n2009 numerous fines, confiscations and other \nhindrances have been levelled at trade carried out by \nCuba or by third countries with Cuba. As the United \nStates Treasury Department itself has reported, since \nJanuary this year almost half of the funds collected by \nits Office of Foreign Assets Control came from \nsanctions imposed on American and foreign companies \nfor alleged violations of the economic blockade against \nCuba.  \n The true and indisputable fact is that the new \nAmerican Government continues to ignore the \ninternational community\u2019s overwhelming appeal, \nexpressed in this Assembly year after year, to put an \nend to the blockade of Cuba. Two weeks ago President \nObama instructed the Secretaries of State and the \nTreasury that, contrary to what is reflected in all \nAmerican opinion polls, \u201cit is in the national interest\u201d \nto maintain economic sanctions against Cuba under the \nTrading with the Enemy Act \u2014 a law enacted in 1917 \nto address wartime situations and which is today \napplied only to Cuba. The United States blockade of \nCuba is an act of unilateral aggression that should be \nunilaterally terminated.  \n For many years Cuba has expressed its \nwillingness to normalize relations with the United \nStates. On 1 August 2009, President Ra\u00fal Castro Ruz \npublicly reiterated Cuba\u2019s readiness to participate in a \nrespectful dialogue, between equals, with the United \nStates \u2014 a dialogue that assumes our independence, \nsovereignty and self-determination. He emphasized \nthat we should mutually respect our differences and \nthat Cuba does not recognize that the Government of \nthat or any other country, or any other group of States, \nhas any jurisdiction over our internal affairs.  \n The Government of Cuba has suggested to the \nUnited States Government a set of essential topics it \nconsiders must necessarily be discussed during a future \ndialogue aimed at improving relations. Those topics \ninclude the lifting of the economic, commercial and \nfinancial blockade; the removal of Cuba from the \nspurious list of terrorist countries; the revocation of the \nCuban Adjustment Act and of the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d \npolicy; compensation for economic and human \ndamages; the return of the territory occupied by the \nGuant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base; the end of all radio and \ntelevision aggression from United States territory \nagainst Cuba; and the cessation of American funding of \ndomestic subversion.  \n An essential item on that agenda is the release of \nthe five Cuban anti-terrorism fighters who have been \nunjustly imprisoned in the United States for 11 years. \nPresident Obama has the constitutional prerogatives to \nfree them as an act of justice and of his Government\u2019s \ncommitment against terrorism. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n Furthermore, we have proposed to the United \nStates to begin talks on setting up cooperation to tackle \ndrug trafficking, terrorism and human smuggling, \nprotect the environment and address natural disasters. \nIn that spirit, the Cuban Government has held talks \nwith that of the United States on migration and on the \nestablishment of direct postal services. Those talks \nhave been courteous and useful. \n Cuba enjoys extensive and fruitful relations in all \nparts of the world. With the single exception of the \nUnited States, Cuba has friendly relations with all \ncountries of this hemisphere and counts on the \nsolidarity of the region. We cooperate with dozens of \ncountries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the \nCaribbean. \n Ours is a stable country with a united, cultured \nand healthy people who have amply proven that, even \nunder an embargo, they are capable of facing the \nconsequences of the global economic crisis and the \neffects of climate change, which last year cost the \nnational economy 20 per cent of its gross domestic \nproduct. \n Conditions in Cuba are such that it can face its \nown problems and find solutions to them. We do so in a \njust and fair society that relies on its own efforts and \nhas been able to advance and guide its development in \nthe most adverse conditions. We are ready to continue \nfacing those challenges calmly and patiently, confident \nthat no citizen has been or will be abandoned and \ncertain that we are defending a cause of national \nindependence and a socialist plan that have the huge \nsupport of the Cubans. Anyone who tries to stop the \nrevolution and bend the will of the Cuban people is \nsuffering from delusions. Patriotism, social justice and \n  \n \n09-52598 18 \n \nthe resolve to defend independence are all part of our \nnational identity. \n Latin America and the Caribbean are in a \ndramatic situation, characterized by the sharp \ncontradiction between the large majorities \u2014 which, \ntogether with progressive Governments and broad \nsocial movements, are demanding justice and \nfairness \u2014 and the traditional oligarchies committed to \npreserving their privileges. The coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in \nHonduras demonstrates that. Those who participated in \nthe coup and the usurpers who kidnapped the \nlegitimate President of that country are violating the \nconstitution and brutally repressing the people, as \nhappened in the dark years of the military dictatorships \nin Latin America propped up by the United States. \nHundreds of thousands of assassinated, missing and \ntortured persons are stirring the conscience of our \nAmerica in the face of impunity.  \n It has still not been explained why the plane that \nkidnapped the constitutional President of Honduras \nmade a stopover at the American Palmerola air base. \nThe American fascist right, which Cheney symbolizes, \nopenly supports and defends the coup. President \nJos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya must be fully, immediately and \nunconditionally reinstated to the execution of his \nconstitutional duties. The inviolability of the Brazilian \nEmbassy in Tegucigalpa must be respected and the \nsiege of and the attacks on its property must stop. The \nHonduran people are valiantly resisting and will have \nthe last word. \n Those events coincide with the renewed and \naggressive interest of the United States in setting up \nmilitary bases in Latin America and in re-establishing \nthe Fourth Fleet, clearly with the aim of putting the \nregion within only a few hours\u2019 reach of American \ntroops, threatening the revolutionary and progressive \nmovements, in particular the Bolivarian revolution in \nthe sister nation of Venezuela, and gaining control of \nthe region\u2019s oil and other natural resources. \n The slander and lies against the Bolivarian \nRepublic of Venezuela are brutal. It should be recalled \nthat it was thus when atrocious aggression emerged and \nwas instigated against our fatherland. The broader and \nclearer the policy towards that sister nation, the more it \nwill contribute to the peace, independence and \ndevelopment of the peoples of Latin America and the \nCaribbean. \n Latin America and the Caribbean can advance \nand, to a certain extent, are moving forward to new and \nhigher forms of integration. They have more water, \nland, forests and mineral and energy resources than any \nother region of the planet. Their population exceeds \n570 million. The Rio Group, the Latin American and \nCaribbean Summit on Integration and Development \nand the Union of South American Nations are bodies \nset up by virtue of the ties that unite us. The Bolivarian \nAlliance for the Peoples of Our Americas and the \nPetrocaribe cooperation scheme are prime examples. \n The optimistic forecasts from Pittsburgh on the \nprogression of the global economic crisis, which \npredict a possible economic recovery early next year, \nare not based on solid data and, at best, only indicate \nrelief from collapse for a very limited group of the \nworld\u2019s most powerful economies. It is worth noting \nthat objectives have been set but not a word has been \nsaid about how to achieve them. \n No one should forget that what is involved is an \nunprecedented crisis of the capitalist system that \nencompasses the respective food, energy, ecological, \nsocial and financial crises. Nor should we overlook the \ndanger of debt combined with inflation, of the bursting \nof other financial bubbles, or of a second collapse. The \ndeveloping countries are not to blame, but are the \nvictims of the consequences of the unreasonable and \nunsustainable model of consumption, exploitation and \nspeculation, the attack on the environment and the \ncorruption in the industrialized economies. \n While the debates go on, the number of hungry \npeople will reach a record figure of 1,020 million in \n2009 \u2014 a sixth of the world\u2019s population. This year, \nanother 90 million will be cast into poverty and  \n50 million others into unemployment. During these \nmonths, another 400,000 children are expected to die \nas a result of the crisis. \n The measures that have been adopted are only \npalliative ones that perpetuate the serious deficiencies \nof an unjust, exclusive and ecologically unsustainable \ninternational economic system. We need a fully \ncomprehensive and inclusive international dialogue \nwith the active participation of all developing \ncountries. We need to establish a new international \neconomic order based on solidarity, justice, equality \nand sustainable development. The international \nfinancial architecture should be founded anew. The \n \n \n19 09-52598 \n \nUnited Nations, particularly this General Assembly, is \ncalled upon to play a key role in this endeavour. \n In conclusion, I reiterate Cuba\u2019s gratitude for the \ntraditional and invaluable solidarity it has received \nfrom this General Assembly in its struggle against \naggression and the blockade. Today, that solidarity \nremains as indispensable as ever. \n As Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz said \nfrom this very rostrum nine years ago:  \n  \u201cNothing in the existing economic and \npolitical order serves the interests of humankind. \nThus this order is unsustainable and must be \nchanged. Suffice it to say that the world has \nalready more than 6 billion inhabitants, 80 per \ncent of whom live in poverty. Ages-old diseases \nof the third world \u2014 diseases such as malaria, \ntuberculosis and others equally lethal \u2014 have not \nbeen eradicated, while new epidemics like AIDS \nthreaten to exterminate the population of entire \nnations \u2026 Meanwhile, wealthy countries keep \ndevoting enormous amounts of money to military \nexpenses and to buy luxury items, and a \nvoracious plague of speculators exchange \ncurrencies, stocks and other real or fictitious \nvalues for trillions of dollars every day. \n  \u201cNature is being devastated. The climate is \nchanging under our own eyes, and drinking water \nis increasingly contaminated or scarce. The seas, \na source of human sustenance, are being depleted, \nand crucial non-renewable resources are being \nwasted on luxury and vanities \u2026 \n  \u201cThe dream of having truly fair and sensible \nnorms to guide human destiny seems impossible \nto many. However, we are convinced that the \nstruggle for the impossible should be the motto of \nthis institution that brings us together today.\u201d \n(A/55/PV.4, p. 20) \n Despite everything, the fiftieth anniversary of the \nCuban Revolution is being celebrated victoriously and \nwith pride."

        "file_text": "We look back \non a year that has been exceptional in so many \nrespects. Twelve months ago, a bank only a few \nhundred metres away from here collapsed and brought \nthe global financial system to the verge of breakdown. \nThe ensuing turbulence in the finance sector led to a \nsevere global economic downturn. \n This illustrates the interconnectedness of our \nworld. It reminds us that other issues, such as climate \nchange, the food crisis, migration, pandemics, \nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction are not confined by national borders. \nRising to these global challenges requires determined \nand coordinated action at the national, regional and \ninternational levels. International cooperation has \nbecome vital. The United Nations is the place where \nthis cooperation happens. Today, the world needs the \nUnited Nations more than ever. \n The United Nations should continue along its \npath of reform in order to reinforce its legitimacy. At \nthe same time, exchanges between the United Nations \nand other forums such as the Group of 20 (G-20) \u2014 \nwhich is meeting today \u2014 must be strengthened. The \nG-20 has taken over a role in discussing important \nglobal issues. This development must not take place at \nthe expense of other nations or global institutions such \nas the United Nations. The G-20 lacks legitimacy; \nbasic considerations of due process are absent in the \nsanctions procedures. The members of the G-20 \nthemselves are not subject to the same scrutiny. \nSwitzerland advocates a level playing field. \n The financial and economic crisis continues to be \nof concern to all of us. Governments and central banks \nhave put together vast stabilization packages. However, \nquantity is not everything. What counts is quality. \nEconomic activity must revert to fundamental values \nand virtues. It must focus on economic, social and \nenvironmental sustainability. Through institutions such \nas the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank \nand the United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP), the United Nations has the knowledge and the \ninstruments needed to combat the financial and \neconomic crisis. It is important to ensure that the \nvoices of these institutions too be heard within the \nG-20. \n The present crisis has occasionally been used in \nsome quarters as an opportunity to question the market \neconomy and, indeed, globalization. I do not dispute \nthat reform is necessary. The failures and abuses have \nbeen too big to ignore. Nevertheless, we must remind \nourselves that it is also thanks to a liberal economic \norder and open markets that much of the world\u2019s \npopulation has been lifted out of poverty. Here, we \nshare the concerns of those who believe that the current \ngrowing trend towards protectionism will lead us \nstraight towards disaster. My country therefore \nwelcomes the call made at the United Nations World \nConference on the Financial and Economic Crisis for \nthe swift conclusion of the Doha Round. \n People in the developing countries have been hit \nparticularly hard by the financial and economic crisis. \nThere is a significant risk that the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals will be delayed. As for \n \n \n09-52320 24 \n \nSwitzerland, we have pledged to maintain our level of \ndevelopment aid despite stringent budget constraints. \nDeveloping and developed countries are jointly \nresponsible for achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. Next year, the United Nations conference \nmarking the tenth anniversary of the Millennium \nDeclaration will provide us with the opportunity to \nreinvigorate this partnership and to improve the \neffectiveness of development aid. \n Sustainable development must also be our \nguiding principle in the fight against climate change. \nThis is why the climate conference in Copenhagen \nmust be a success. Switzerland wants and is able to set \na good example. We will achieve our CO2 reduction \ntargets for 2012. For the period until 2020, we are \nprepared to cut our CO2 emissions by 20 per cent. At \nthe global level, the costs of adaptation to climate \nchange will amount to several tens of billions of \ndollars per year of which more than half will be at the \nexpense of developing countries. Switzerland has \ntherefore proposed the creation of a global carbon tax \nwhich is based on the polluter-pays principle, in order \nto deal with these emerging needs. \n Violent conflicts continue to plague the planet, \nrendering a life in dignity, peace and security elusive \nfor too many people. The unique legitimacy of the \nUnited Nations allows it to play an active role in \nconflict prevention, mediation, the protection of \ncivilians, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. My country \nwelcomes the greater involvement of the United \nNations in these areas and especially advocates the \nstrengthening of United Nations prevention and \nmediation capacities. Switzerland is also active in the \narea of peacebuilding. It has taken over the \nchairmanship of the Peacebuilding Commission\u2019s \ncountry-specific configuration on Burundi and will \ncontinue its initiative on armed violence and \ndevelopment. \n This year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \nthe Geneva Conventions. Since their creation, the \nGeneva Conventions have set indispensable rules for \nsituations of armed conflict. New forms of armed \nconflict and new means and methods of warfare make \nit increasingly difficult to ensure respect for these \nrules. It is unacceptable that civilian populations \nshould be so often the target of deliberate attacks and \nthat humanitarian aid personnel should be so often \ndenied rapid and unimpeded access to populations in \nneed.  \n In an effort to identify ways of improving \ncompliance with the Geneva Conventions, Switzerland \nis organizing a ministerial side event on Saturday here \nin New York. In November we will hold an \ninternational conference of experts in Geneva, open to \nall State parties to the Geneva Conventions. The \nconference will focus on the current and future \nchallenges faced by international humanitarian law. \n Human dignity is an inalienable right of all \nhuman beings, regardless of their gender, origin or \nreligion. The Human Rights Council is the principal \nforum for discussing human rights within the United \nNations. Both its special procedures and its universal \nperiodic review process have demonstrated their \neffectiveness. This said, a great many challenges \nremain. Switzerland will continue to work vigorously \nfor an effective Human Rights Council and will present \nits candidacy for a second term starting in 2010.  \n The protection of human rights, along with the \npromotion of democracy and the strengthening of the \nrule of law will also be priorities of the Swiss \npresidency of the Council of Europe from November \n2009 to May 2010. Under the Swiss presidency, efforts \nwill be made to increase cooperation between the \nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe. \n 2010 will thus be a symbolic year for the United \nNations. Five years will have passed since the adoption \nof the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document and ten \nyears since the signing of the Millennium Declaration. \nNext year\u2019s summit will be an opportunity to assess the \nstatus of implementation of these declarations and to \ninitiate new, more comprehensive reforms. These are \nnecessary steps because only a reformed United \nNations will be in a position to find appropriate \nresponses to the global challenges.  \n In this context, it is my great pleasure to \nannounce to Member States that Switzerland has put \nforward the candidature of Joseph Deiss, former \nPresident of the Swiss Confederation, for the \npresidency of the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly. \n I will conclude with the following: the challenges \nto be met are huge, however we must not yield to \npessimism. Throughout history, human beings have \ndemonstrated time and again that with courage, \nimagination and persistence they are capable of great \nachievements. The Swiss writer Max Frisch once said: \n\u201cA crisis can be a productive state. You just have to get \n \n \n25 09-52320 \n \nrid of the aftertaste of disaster.\u201d I absolutely agree. So \nlet us be productive and seize the opportunity to create \na prosperous, just, peaceful and sustainable world."

        "file_text": "For \nthe past three years the President of Honduras has \ncome to this global forum to propose simple, honest, \nstraightforward ways of responding to the great \nchallenges that face our societies, because of the need \nto do more to contribute to the survival of the human \nspecies and to decrease the injustice of the immense \nasymmetries among nations and between rich and poor. \nFrom this very rostrum, President Zelaya urged respect \nfor the human rights of our migrants and the forgotten \nones of the Earth \u2014 those who draw on the strength of \nhurricanes from their poverty to produce wealth to \nwhich they hardly ever have access and that does not \nrelieve the anguish caused by their unsatisfied needs.  \n Our constitutional President, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya \nRosales, with simple and effective proposals, has \nalways called for a more just and more equitable world \nthat would lighten the burden of the shame created by \nthe existence of the astonishing wealth of a few \nalongside the outrageous misery of the majority. He \nhas also called for a world of tolerance in which we \ncould exchange opinions, ideas and diverse ways of \nseeing the world, respecting and cooperating with one \nanother to build a better world. \n But today, another fate has forced us to represent \nour President and our people here. In our country, \ncriminal hordes have made us revisit old issues \u2014 ones \nthat we had believed to be mere vestiges from the \ndistant past. Today, from this rostrum, I should like to \ntell the members of the Assembly that, as I address \nthem, our President is being besieged by military \nforces at the diplomatic mission of the sisterly \nRepublic of Brazil in Tegucigalpa. He is being \nthreatened, and every moment that passes could bring a \ntragic outcome that would have a paralysing effect on \nhistory and on all Hondurans, all Central Americans \nand the entire world. As I speak, our President\u2019s life is \nin peril, and the lives of our people are also in peril.  \n I should like to prove this to the members of the \nAssembly. In my hand, I have a telephone with \nPresident Manuel Zelaya Rosales on the line. He \nwishes to address the Assembly and to reclaim his \nrightful place in the presence of the members of the \ninternational community. Here, with them, is our \nleader, our President, the hero of democracy, which he \nis defending today with his life alongside our people. \n President Zelaya (spoke in Spanish via \ntelephone): Greetings to the United Nations. For those \nwho had any doubt that a dictatorship was being \ninstalled here, I believe that all that has occurred \nduring the past 93 days of repression have dispelled \n \n \n45 09-52604 \n \nthose doubts. In Honduras, in addition to a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat \nhaving taken place, a fascist dictatorship has been \ninstalled that has suppressed the freedoms of \nHondurans and is violently repressing the Honduran \npeople.  \n Today, the broadcast frequencies used by the only \ntwo media outlets opposed to the dictatorship \u2014 a \nnational radio station, Radio Globo, and a national \ntelevision network, Channel 36 \u2014 have been shut \ndown, their offices invaded and their transmission \nequipment confiscated. Surely, a serious crime is being \ncommitted when the voice of the people is silenced \u2014 \na people that is being suppressed.  \n I ask the United Nations for cooperation to \nrestore the rule of law and the freedom that Hondurans \ndeserve. I ask the United Nations for support, so that \nthe civilized nations of the world can continue to stand \nfirm against force and barbarity. I also ask the United \nNations to give us guarantees for our own personal \nintegrity and the lives of those being besieged with \nchemical gases and electronic interference at this \ndiplomatic facility of the sisterly Republic of Brazil. \nWith great courage, President Lula is demonstrating his \ninterest by supporting democracy and fighting against \ncoups d\u2019\u00e9tat. I ask the United Nations for its support to \nreverse this coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, so that democracy will really \nbe an asset of all civilized societies throughout the \nworld. \n Ms. Rodas (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): Our \nPresident is surrounded and isolated by military forces. \nThe Embassy of the Republic of Brazil is under threat \nof invasion. We have heard the forceful call of \nPresident Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya Rosales, and we are here \nto tell the Assembly about the scale and the terrible \nimpact of the repression being visited on our people \ntoday.  \n Free transit through airports and land borders has \nbeen halted. A state of emergency has been decreed, \nwith the indefinite suspension of absolutely every \nconstitutional guarantee. In addition, independent news \nmedia have been shut down, destroyed and dismantled \nand their operators persecuted, and two journalists \nwere tortured today in our country. Women have been \nraped during demonstrations, and sport centres have \nbeen turned into concentration camps in Tegucigalpa \nand other cities.  \n Honduras is becoming an enormous prison camp. \nThey have imprisoned national journalists and expelled \ninternational media. Furthermore, the entire country is \nmilitarized. There are constant reports that highly \ndangerous hired assassins are being freed from prison, \nas military contingents move forward and mass around \nthe place where our President is now located, together \nwith his family, officials of the Embassy of the sisterly \nRepublic of Brazil, journalists, priests and a large \ngroup of people who are accompanying him. We have \nmade major efforts together, inside and outside of \nHonduras, aimed at enabling our country to regain its \nconstitutional rights, which were forcibly taken from it \njust three months ago to the day. We have done this, \nconvinced that it will benefit not only Honduras, but \nthe entire world, where there are still people fighting \nfor freedom and self-determination, so as not to be \npunished for their ideological differences or for their \nefforts to improve society and transform the economy, \nso that our peoples may finally look forward to a \nbrighter future with greater possibility.  \n Our countries, our peoples deserve this, because \nthey have fought their entire lives \u2014 first against \nconquest, then against colonization, then against the \nmajor differences created by economic dependency; \nand today, we continue to fight peacefully and without \nweapons for our democratic freedoms. Our only \nweapon is the truth we carry in our hearts, which we \nhave openly expressed to the world.  \n In the meantime, while we are faced with all of \nthis, our President is being punished for trying to give \nmore freedom and more well-being to our people and \nfor joining in the concert of nations to ensure that our \ndiversity and ways of thinking are viewed as equal to \nthose of the greater countries of the world. Because no \nmatter how small our economies or populations may \nbe, we deserve no less than any other society. \nDreaming the impossible dream makes it possible for \nus to attain what is indeed possible. But our President, \nour people, all of Honduran society, the international \ncommunity and the solidarity that gives life to our \nstruggle are shamefully punished day after day by the \nweapons and brute force of the regime of putschists, \nwhich is quickly transforming itself into a dictatorship \nin the best tradition of what occurred three and four \ndecades ago on our continent.  \n There is no civil war in Honduras. There are no \narmed forces facing each other. There are no \nsubversive groups. Hondurans are people who walk \ntirelessly. They continued walking forward for 90 days, \npeacefully, silently and determined, with bravery and \n  \n \n09-52604 46 \n \nheroism. And with their silence, children, young \npeople, men, women and the elderly told the world: as \nlong as the Honduran people have the unwavering \nsupport of the international community, it will be \npossible to take back our democratic path \u2014 the path \nwe shed blood for throughout our history, until the \nvictory at the ballot boxes, until the guns and cannons \nwere lowered \u2014 and now those weapons are raised \nagain with bayonets aimed at our defenceless people. It \nis a dreadful state of siege: every single conceivable \nconstitutional guarantee has been suspended, which \nthreatens the life of every Honduran man and woman \nevery night and every day.  \n But every day, tirelessly, our people come out to \nthe street and march in small groups, large groups or in \nmasses. They mobilize in whatever way they can \naround their houses, their blocks, their neighbourhoods \nor on big plazas. It does not matter how they do it; \nwherever they are, they mobilize actively. They put \ntheir feet on the ground, on the soil that gave birth to \nthem, and assured of regaining our territory \u2014 with \nfreedom and democracy \u2014 they do not feel tired, they \nsimply walk, as Gandhi did a long time ago and as our \nmigrants and poor have done thousands of times to \nharvest their simple everyday sustenance.  \n In this way our people do not use their energy for \nviolence. They are determined to conquer the world by \nforce of will alone, without raising a gun or shooting a \nsingle round, even if they risk joining the ranks of the \ndead, or being tortured or jailed. The brutal coup d\u2019\u00e9tat \nexpelled our President, persecuted his Cabinet and \nkidnapped his Minister, but finds itself humiliated \nunder the feet of a people who walk their way around \nthe world every day. Their steps cross imaginary \nbridges to all of the countries of the world, and the \nworld responds with its solidarity. \n But, we have been able to present many shared \nefforts inside and outside our country, including \nmediation initiatives that have arisen with the aim of \nimplementing resolutions of this General Assembly, \nsuch as resolution 63/301 of 30 June 2009, in which \nthe Government of putschists was repudiated and the \nonly constitutional president of Honduras was \nrecognized to be Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya Rosales. Forums \nfor dialogue have been created, along with efforts at \nmediation such as the San Jose Agreement, all of which \nhave been systematically rejected by the intransigent \nputschist regime, which causes those efforts to fail, \neven when the world attempts to revive those efforts \nevery day.  \n Those who wished to join the constitutional \nPresident have been replaced and prevented from \nreturning to the country, even though they wanted to \nfind the path to reconciliation. Ambassadors who were \nsummoned for consultations following the military \ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat cannot return to the country without first \nbowing to the boots of the military who are trampling \non our country today. \n All of these initiatives, as important and essential \nas they are in attempting to give strength to the \nstruggle of my people, all of the efforts of the \ninternational community in searching for rational, \npeaceful solutions have made it clear that we are facing \nforces that are able to unleash the most perverse  \nform of violence and irrationality. Civilization is  \nbeing brought to a halt by barbarism there in Central \nAmerica \u2014 in the centre of Central America \u2014 that \nnarrow strip that joins the two halves of our \nhemisphere. \n Given this new situation in which the President\u2019s \nreturn unleashed the fury of the dictators, the initiatives \nneeded in order to find a solution today call for \nspecific actions to be taken: the tyrant and the military \nmust be forced to step back. The military forces who \ndisobeyed their President and oppressed their own \npeople have become an occupying army \u2014 irregular \nforces serving only to repress and oppress. They \nuphold the executory arm of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that found \nits support in a sector of the powerful, old economic \nclass, which is responsible for crushing, exploiting and \nstripping bare our people and has done so throughout \nour history.  \n That is why, in those new conditions, when we \nneed strength to consolidate the proposals and \nassemble global intelligence and the feeling of a \ncontinental home in the midst of the conspiracy of the \nimminent danger that today confronts not only our \nPresident, an embassy and a diplomatic mission the \ninviolability of which is threatened, but also, in fact, \nour humble people who walk, who at any moment can \nbe assassinated, imprisoned or tortured; at this time \nwhen we hear that military units are moving towards \nthe Embassy of Brazil to continue attacking our \nPresident, I appeal to this Assembly. With the authority \nderived from our peaceful and heroic people and with \nthe moral authority of those who resist the bullets with \n \n \n47 09-52604 \n \ntheir bodies and flesh, we fervently but resolutely call \non the United Nations and its highest bodies to use the \nstrength of their authority to avert and ward off the \ndanger that hovers over Honduras. It is increasingly \nimminent, ever closer and more and more terrifying. \nWe can avert that danger together with the will and \nsolidarity garnered so far, but with resolute joint \nactions that will succeed in pushing back that shame. \n I must say that, first of all, we must demand \nrespect for the life of our President, his physical and \nmoral integrity and the dignity of his high office. That \ngives our people strength and determination because \nwe are and wish to be a sovereign, free and \nindependent republic with a solid lasting democracy \nthat will also help make the injustices and inequalities \nsubside. We must also request unconditional support \nfor the dialogue that our President began once he had \nentered the country unarmed and peacefully so as to be \nable to sit with the different sectors of Honduran \nsociety and thereby open the way to restoring trust, \nreconciliation and the fabric of the Constitution, \nbecause all that depends on reinstating the \nconstitutional President of the Republic of Honduras, \nJos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya Rosales.  \n It is also important to bolster efforts to set \nspecific dates, precise mechanisms, ultimatums and \nframeworks for action to be signed by the body for \ndialogue and mediation that has been set up, and those \nthat may emerge in its support, to restore peace to our \npeople and to continue building the path of \ntransformation. Furthermore, we must say that as long \nas there are no constitutional guarantees, a permanent \nstate of siege is imposed on our people and citizen \nrights are absent, the conditions to prepare free, \ntransparent and universal elections do not exist. \n The international community has spoken out by \nnot recognizing that regime of the coup or those \nGovernments or regimes that arose from spurious \nelections launched into history by cannon or at the \npoint of a bayonet. We therefore urge this General \nAssembly to call an urgent extraordinary session of the \nAssembly to keep under review the situation \ndeveloping in Honduras, that country so close to this \nland and all countries of the world, neighbour of the \nPanama Canal and at the centre of all America, so as to \nbe able to keep monitoring the pace of events and, of \ncourse, the necessary resources to urgently respond to \nrelieving whatever needs arise there. \n It is important that the vital issues that we have \npresented here be addressed at that Assembly, but it is \neven more important and more urgent that we urge the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations to appoint an \nurgent special diplomatic mission, comprised of the \nvarious countries that make up this world forum, to go \nas soon as possible and pay a working visit to \nHonduras. It can assess in situ the situation prevailing \nthere and help seek solutions for the region, together \nwith our President, in conjunction with the efforts of \nthe Organization of American States (OAS). The OAS \nspecial missions sent to Honduras to prepare a meeting \nof its Secretary-General with other foreign ministers \nwas recently expelled from the territory. \n Thirdly, we should impress on this Assembly and \nits appropriate authority the need for it to continue \nanalysing and constantly review the situation of \nviolence and the danger of violation of the Vienna \nConventions, which prevail over everything pertaining \nto the inviolability of diplomatic missions and the \nupholding of international law. For the lives of our \nPresident and of our entire people, the consideration, \nreview, analysis and ongoing attention of the Security \nCouncil is essential in order to find formulas to avert a \ngreater tragedy that later, once out of control, we could \nnot address. \n To conclude, I must state here that, with the \nawareness of and support for the presence of our \nPresident, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya Rosales, in our land \u2014 \nin the country where he was elected President by a \nlarge majority in free and democratic elections, which \ntoday makes him the leader and hero in defending the \ndemocratic rights of our peoples \u2014 the need to restore \nto Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya Rosales to his functions as \nPresident of the Republic is more urgent than ever, so \nthat he can take on the duties bestowed on him by our \nRepublic\u2019s constitution and the sovereign mandate of \nour people. Right now, tonight and in the days \nfollowing, the leaders of the coup should be urged to \nrespect the life of our President and the inviolability of \nBrazilian territory in Honduras in its diplomatic \nmission. \n We must not neglect this grave political and \ninstitutional crisis, a crisis that affects the entire world \nand democracy around the globe. I therefore request \nthat the Secretary-General present to the special \nsession of the General Assembly a report analysing \ncompliance with resolution 63/301, and resolutions that \nmight stem from it, for a return to constitutional rule, \n  \n \n09-52604 48 \n \nthe restoration of our President, ending violence and \nrepression and violations of the international law, for a \nreturn to international peace and concord, to our \npeople\u2019s freedom to hold elections without the constant \nthreat of violence and coups d\u2019\u00e9tat, and, finally, for \nrespect for human life. The most humble may not be \nknown to the international community, but every night \ntheir lives are in danger under the skies of our country. \n We declare our solidarity with all those suffering \nfrom lack of freedom and of democracy, from lack of \ndevelopment, from poverty and inequality, those \nsuffering from a lack of respect for the freedom that \nevery society must have to organize itself as best it \ncan, without being attacked, blockaded or, much less, \nexpelled from any international entity. I express the \nsolidarity of Honduras with those people suffering \nfrom discrimination and despoliation and those whose \nhope is crushed beneath the terror of military force, \nand our bottomless gratitude for the solidarity \nexpressed by the entire international community. In an \nextraordinary, unprecedented way, they joined hands \nand forgot their profound differences to unite with our \npeople and jointly confront this crime, which, in the \ntwenty-first century, has once again stained our \ndemocracies. \n We give our thanks for the prayers and the \nsolidarity of all the peoples of the world, to those who \naccompany us daily on the long road back to \ndemocracy, and to those who will never forget the \nwords of our President calling out for respect for life, \nintegrity and freedom of speech, and that never again \nwill this sad story of persecution and death be \nperpetrated against an innocent, unarmed and peaceful \npeople. \n These, then, are the initiatives I have set out. \nAlong with that I express our gratitude to all peoples of \nthe world, representatives of whom fit into this small \nspace, just as all the freedom and the hope of \ndemocracy of the entire world fits into that tiny \ncountry of Honduras."

I would also like to extend to him \nour full readiness for cooperation in the course of his \nmandate. At the same time, I wish to congratulate the \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-third session, \nMr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, for his successful \npresidency. Availing myself of this opportunity, I \nwould like to acknowledge the engagements and the \nefforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nwhich indisputably have contributed to the \nenhancement of the role and reputation of the \nOrganization. \n Before I refer to the key theme of this session, I \nwould like to remind the Assembly of the fear and \nuncertainty we all felt exactly one year ago, right here. \nIt was fear and uncertainty over the scope and the \nconsequences of the global financial and economic \ncrisis. I recall this in order to emphasize the urgent \nneed for the United Nations to use this opportunity to \ncontribute to processes that will facilitate the \novercoming of the effects of the crisis. It is even more \nimportant that we assist in preventing new such crises. \nIn this context the serious economic problems most of \nus have been facing should not shift our focus from the \nabsolute priority, which is the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n The issue of climate change, which today \nrepresents one of the biggest challenges facing \nhumanity, is extremely high on our national agenda, \nbut also on that of the United Nations. We owe it to our \nchildren and to the generations to come to preserve our \nplanet. If we do not establish, urgently and \nimmediately, the highest and most sustainable \nstandards for how we treat the environment, we will \npay the price in the future. Time is running out, and \nthere is no possibility for us to further postpone \n \n \n21 09-52463 \n \ncoordinated and serious measures to combat the \nnegative consequences of climate change. Climate \nchange and global warming have an increasingly \nserious impact on economic growth and on the quality, \nquantity and price of food. That exacerbates poverty. It \nis therefore imperative that we tackle this issue \nimmediately.  \n The Republic of Macedonia, as a party to the \nFramework Convention on Climate Change for more \nthan a decade now, has been actively working on \nimplementing the goals set out in the Convention. We \nhave \u2014 including me personally \u2014 assigned special \nsignificance to the forthcoming United Nations Climate \nChange Conference in Copenhagen, and we all have \ngreat expectations for it. The Macedonian authorities \nare truly committed to undertaking numerous concrete \nactivities with a view to raising awareness in society \nregarding this issue. The Republic of Macedonia is \nfully prepared to make its contribution to the global \neffort. \n When we address issues related to peacekeeping \nand stability, a large majority of us, unfortunately, \nregularly expresses dissatisfaction regarding the \ncurrent state of affairs. Peace and security are \ncompromised on a daily basis in certain regions of the \nworld. We are faced with the continuation of old and \nfrozen conflicts, but also with a series of new tensions \nin many regions throughout the world. \n When it comes to the reasons for the constant \ncrises besetting our world, or certain parts of it, allow \nme to seize this opportunity to quote Martin Luther \nKing, who in 1967 uttered a recipe for overcoming \nbilateral, regional and global crises. He said:  \n \u201cLet us be dissatisfied until from every city hall, \njustice will roll down like waters, and \nrighteousness like a mighty stream. Let us be \ndissatisfied until that day when the lion and the \nlamb shall lie down together, and every man will \nsit under his own vine and fig tree, and none shall \nbe afraid.\u201d \n With reference to these words, I welcome the \ntopic of this session, which is meant to assist us in \nfinding effective responses to global crises. The \nresponses to most questions must take into \nconsideration not only the present and the reality of \ntoday\u2019s world, but on top of that, we must anticipate \nthe future and take on board the objectives we have set \nourselves. \n Instead of paying lip service to multilateralism, \nwhich I do not believe will help, a real approach based \non meaningful multilateralism and action is required. \nThe Republic of Macedonia and I personally strongly \nbelieve in and strive towards effective multilateralism. \nWe believe that strengthening multilateralism is the \nonly way to advance towards and achieve our primary \ngoals of peace, democracy, human freedoms and rights \nand respect of international law and principles. \n The Republic of Macedonia strongly supports \njoint efforts to improve the overall coherence of the \nUnited Nations system. We need a United Nations that \nwill, in the best possible and most efficient manner, \nrealize the expectations and the objectives of its \nMember States. \n The Republic of Macedonia is a country that has \nimmense experience in nurturing and affirming \ndialogue and in advancing dialogue among \ncivilizations. It is a unique example of a successful \nmulti-ethnic and multi-faith country. \n The summit on Dialogue Among Civilizations \nthat was held in the Republic of Macedonia, in Ohrid \nin 2003, with assistance and support from the United \nNations, is an example of the kind of regular annual \nmeetings at the highest level that are being held in \nSouth-East Europe under the auspices of UNESCO. \nThis not only represents recognition for my country but \nalso demonstrates the value of dialogue in the \nadvancement of security and in development. \n Since its independence, the Republic of \nMacedonia has been unswervingly committed to the \npromotion of democracy and the improvement of the \nliving standards of its people, and to reform in all \nspheres of our economy. The Republic of Macedonia \npromotes a society founded upon the rule of law, \nrespect for human rights, multi-ethnic cohabitation, \ndialogue and mutual understanding.  \n Over the past number of years, the Republic of \nMacedonia has achieved impressive progress that has \nbeen recognized and acknowledged by all. My country \ntoday is looking forward to the initiation of the \naccession negotiations with the European Union. My \ncountry has fulfilled all of the conditions set for NATO \nmembership. It is an active and strong supporter of \nregional cooperation. It remains fully committed to \ngood-neighbourly relations and to dialogue as a key \ntool for overcoming all of the issues that continue to \nbeset the region. \n  \n \n09-52463 22 \n \n All of my country\u2019s Governments have consistently \nfocused on the realization of the country\u2019s two top \nstrategic priorities: accession to the European Union \nand accession to NATO. The Republic of Macedonia is \ndedicated to sharing and contributing to the \nEuro-Atlantic values in a common vision for the \nenlargement of the stability and security zone in South-\nEast Europe.  \n The actions of our southern neighbour that \nprevented the Republic of Macedonia from acceding to \nthe NATO alliance were contrary to the obligations \nundertaken in the 1995 interim agreement. That was \ndone in an attempt to influence the outcome of the \nnegotiations held under the auspices of the United \nNations and was completely opposite to the common \nvision. Nevertheless, I would like to stress before this \nforum that the Republic of Macedonia is sincerely \ndedicated to the process of resolving our differences \nwith our southern neighbour within the framework of \nthe mechanism set out in United Nations resolutions.  \n The Republic of Macedonia believes in law and \nin justice. The Republic of Macedonia believes in the \nInternational Court of Justice as a body of the United \nNations and as a protector and upholder of the law. \nBeyond the absurdity of the dispute with our southern \nneighbour, the Republic of Macedonia sincerely hopes \nthat soon the only obstacle that prevents us from taking \nour rightful place in the Euro-Atlantic family will be \nremoved.  \n In spite of the flagrant violation of international \nobligations by our southern neighbour \u2014 in respect \nwhereof the Republic of Macedonia has filed an appeal \nat the International Court of Justice \u2014 we are actively \nparticipating in the negotiation process with the \nRepublic of Greece. I would like to state clearly that \nwe are prepared to discuss only the issues foreseen in \nthe United Nations resolutions. The Republic of \nMacedonia is prepared to seek a solution that is a \nreasonable and fair compromise and that will not touch \nupon or deny our national, cultural or linguistic \nidentity in any way, a solution that would obtain the \nlegitimacy and the seal of approval of our citizens. \nThere is no more sovereign right than the right of self-\ndetermination and self-identification. That right has \nbeen cherished by many generations before us. \n I hope that the Republic of Greece will abandon \nits policy of taking action from a position of power in \norder to unfavourably influence the outcome of the \ndisputed issue. I expect that the political leadership \nwill look towards the wider interest in terms of \npermanent stabilization of the entire region. We believe \nthat with truthful and sincere willingness and \npreparedness we can reach a solution whereby there \nwill be neither winners nor losers. \n Allow me to take this opportunity to recall \nArticle 1, paragraph 2 of the Charter of the United \nNations:  \n \u201c[t]o develop friendly relations among nations \nbased on respect for the principle of equal rights \nand self-determination of peoples, and to take \nother appropriate measures to strengthen \nuniversal peace\u201d. \n Let not this Organization betray the expectations \nof the vast majority of people who set their hope on it, \nand let it not betray the ideals of its founders. The \nOrganization must prepare itself to come up with \nresponses to existing and emerging challenges posed \nby our times. When I say \u201cthe Organization\u201d, I refer to \nall of us who support those processes. The Republic of \nMacedonia sees in the Organization the potential to \nmaintain stability in international affairs and a unique \nopportunity to tackle the numerous challenges posed to \nhumanity. The Republic of Macedonia, as has been the \ncase hitherto, shall continue to respect and support the \nvalues and principles enshrined in the Charter. \n Allow me to finish my address with the words of \nthe former Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan, who \nsaid that if the goal of humanity is progress in peace \nand freedom, the state of peace is not only a state free \nof conflict, it is a state of respecting human freedom \nand rights. We are still far from that goal. However, \nindisputably, huge and serious progress has been \nachieved."

        "file_text": "As I take \nthe floor for the first time at the present session, allow \nme to join all of those who preceded me at this rostrum \nin congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki and telling \nhim how proud we are to see him presiding over the \nGeneral Assembly at the sixty-fourth session. His \nelection testifies to his personal qualities and is a \ntribute to the African Union.  \n I applaud our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon. He has kept the United Nations on track and \nstrengthened the United Nations in the context of the \nmultiple crises affecting the world. \n Two years ago, from this very rostrum, I updated \nthe Assembly on the crisis in my country, C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire. At that time, I welcomed the important role \nplayed by regional organizations, such as the African \nUnion and the Economic Community of West African \nStates. I particularly dwelt on the internal processes \nthat brought us, the Government and former rebels, to \ncommit to a process of peace that ended the conflict \nand led to the current preparations for general \nelections. All through that process, we enjoyed from \nthe support of the United Nations, notably through the \nUnited Nations Operation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. We \nbenefited even more from the assistance of the \nPresident of Burkina Faso, Mr. Blaise Compaore. \n Thanks to the efforts of all, and particularly to the \nIvorians\u2019 hard work and desire for peace, the process \nhas now entered into a irreversible phase. Today, there \nare no remaining political obstacles to the holding of \nthe elections. I take this opportunity to express once \nagain the gratitude of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to the United \nNations and to all our friends for their commitment to \nthe restoration of peace. \n I would also like to share our desire to do our \nutmost to end the crisis via the ballot box. We are all \nthe more resolute given that the challenges facing \ntoday\u2019s world require of all States, and in particular \nsmall States such as ours, a political strategy based on \ndemocracy. Thus armed, we will be able not only to \neffectively address our current difficulties, but also to \ncontribute to the understanding of and resolution of \ninternational crises. \n This is what President Treki has called on us to \ndo through the theme of this sixty-fourth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, \u201cEffective responses to global \ncrises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue \namong civilizations for international peace, security \nand development\u201d. \n We note that, in addition to recurrent political \ncrises, the acute crises facing the world today affect the \nstability of nations and jeopardize our shared future. In \n2008, the energy crisis reached unprecedented \nproportions. The price of a barrel of oil, it will be \nrecalled, rose to nearly $150. That major crisis took \nplace alongside a food crisis and an unprecedented \nfinancial crisis that soon turned into a deep economic \ncrisis. The entire world woke up to the threat posed to \nsocial and political equilibrium by the three crises that \nstruck at the same time. These crises shook all our \ncertainties and caused a wave of panic. They showed \nus in no uncertain terms that nothing can ever be taken \nfor granted, even in big countries. \n The entire world mobilized to meet the challenge, \nboth within individual countries and within \ninternational institutions and organizations. We saw the \nInternational Monetary Fund provide assistance to \ncountries that are not usually the recipients of such aid, \nsuch as those of northern Europe. This exceptional \nmobilization points to the concern of the international \ncommunity at seeing the situation end in uncontrollable \nsocial and political crises. \n However, although the mobilization and \ncooperation were multilateral, the crisis resolution \n  \n \n09-52463 12 \n \nplans were not. Countries in North America, Europe \nand Asia adopted national plans. This shows that there \nare limits to multilateralism and that nation States \nprotect their prerogatives and shoulder their full \nresponsibilities at the economic level, when necessary. \n I note, moreover, that the mobilization in Africa \nand for Africa was quite diffident. It was as though the \nfinancial crisis was not also an African crisis, or as if \nthe financial sector in Africa was not sufficiently \nintegrated into the international financial system. \nPerhaps our continent did not grasp the full extent of \nthe crisis. And yet, the financial crisis has had \nconsequences on the African continent. In Africa, \nperhaps more than anywhere else, the financial crisis \nbecame an economic crisis that underscored the \neconomic and social fragility of our countries. \n The lesson we draw from that experience is that \nno country is immune to crisis. This requires the \ninternational community to enhance its vigilance by \nincreasing oversight of the financial system and its \ninstitutions at the international level. It would also be \ntimely for us to embark on a reform of the international \nmonetary and financial system. In this context, United \nNations reform, and above all reform of its organs, is \nessential if the United Nations is to play a solid leading \nrole in strengthening multilateralism.  \n Among the cross-cutting issues in which the \nUnited Nations must play a key role are the resurgence \nof extremism. The entrenchment and hardening of \npositions are prevailing over dialogue and deepening \nthe chasm between cultures that need to live together in \nharmony. Hence, the importance of the historic high-\nlevel meeting convened in this very Hall on 12 and \n13 November 2008 on the urgent need for genuine \ndialogue among religions with a view to creating a \nculture of peace. That initiative bolstered activities to \nraise the awareness of the international community to \nthe need for preventive diplomacy on this key topic, in \nparticular the World Conference on Dialogue, held in \nMadrid in July 2008, and the launching in July 2005 of \nthe Alliance of Civilizations, under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations. \n We therefore believe that all of these initiatives in \nfavour of dialogue among cultures, as well as those to \ncome, point to the need to establish a permanent forum \nfor dialogue among civilizations so as to draw peoples \ntogether. \n I now turn to world peace and security. The only \nsure way to attain lasting peace is the equitable \nsettlement of conflicts within a reformed, more \ndemocratic and more credible Security Council. \nTogether, we need to build a United Nations with a \nstronger mandate and greater representativity. \n In that regard, it would be preferable to entrust \nthe prevention, management and settlement of local \nconflicts to regional and even subregional \norganizations. That approach, which was enshrined in \nApril 2008 by the Security Council, should be \nstrengthened by an earnest updating of the mechanism \nfor cooperation with regional organizations, as \nprovided for in the United Nations Charter of 1945. \n In that regard, I would like to simply reiterate \nhere the position of my delegation, which is based on \nour experience of handling and settling the Ivorian \ncrisis. Direct dialogue, like that in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, offers \navenues for thought that the United Nations could \nmake good use of. I think that the Burkina Faso \ndelegation can address that issue as well as, if not \nbetter than, we can.  \n Another topic of concern is world poverty. World \npeace and security are dependent on the eradication of \nextreme poverty and poverty reduction. That is why my \ndelegation welcomes the convening at the sixty-third \nsession of two high-level meetings on Africa\u2019s \ndevelopment needs and the Millennium Development \nGoals. We welcome the outcomes and \nrecommendations of those meetings. \n C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is resolved to free itself of the \nburden of debt that is threatening its development \ngoals. There have been meetings on debt, but there \nneed to be more, and decisions must be taken on debt \nbecause the debts that were incurred in the 1960s, the \n1970s and the 1980s today hamper the development of \nAfrican countries. That must be considered. It is a law \nof nature that when a small, weak country is \noverburdened by debt, the original purpose of which is \noften not known even to its leaders, that country sinks, \nand drags the world down with it. Africa is part of the \nworld. If a decision is not taken on the issue of the debt \nof African countries, the entire global financial system \nwill be on course for disaster.  \n That is why I stress, alongside the problem of \ndebt, the issue of climate change. We talk of climate \nchange, and we are right to do so, but we need to take \ndecisions that are critical for most of our countries. I \n \n \n13 09-52463 \n \ndo not know the situation in West Africa very well, but \nit has been shown that, in Central and Southern Africa, \nthe deserts are advancing by two kilometres a year. \nWhat does that mean? It means that in 50 years the \ndeserts will have advanced by 100 kilometres and \nreached the coasts. We must decide. \n While the deserts advance, on the coasts villages \nand houses are disappearing into the sea. That is \nhappening in Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana, C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire and elsewhere. There are people living today \nwith the water at their feet. There are those who live \nnot knowing if tomorrow it will reach their houses or if \ntheir houses will, in fact, be in the sea. Urgent \nmeasures are needed. We need not only meetings, but \nalso decisions, and those decisions \u2014 on deserts, the \nsea and floods \u2014 must be implemented. Everywhere \ntoday \u2014 in Burkina Faso, Mali and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 \nthe rains bring disaster, and those very rains that we \ncall for to water our farms have become a cause for \nalarm. We no longer know if the rains to come bring \ndeath or life.  \n Africa is fighting, and is doing so alone. It would \nprefer to fight with the rest of the world behind it. That \nis also why we have come to speak here. Africa no \nlonger wishes to feel abandoned or to fight alone. \nSoon, in 50 years according to the experts, it will be \neasier to find oil than clean drinking water, because we \nwill have to go a long way \u2014 too far for our \neconomies.  \n What are we going to do? The issue of clean \nwater has become a problem. Certainly, in some rich \noil-producing countries in the Arab world, we have \nseen our brothers working to make seawater drinkable, \nbut how many countries in the world have the means to \nturn seawater into drinking water? It is terribly \nexpensive. We need to convene a meeting here at the \nUnited Nations on that issue \u2014 and not only meetings, \nbut decisions followed by action.  \n Those are the problems that I came here to talk \nabout on behalf of the Ivorian delegation. Everyone \nknows that Africa is such that when one delegation \ntalks, it speaks for all delegations because we face the \nsame problems. I would hope that, as of today, we can \nlook beyond internal crises. We all know that Africa \nhas made great progress. It is up to us to strengthen \nourselves by daring to fight poverty, extreme poverty \nand catastrophic climate change. Climate change is \ndangerous throughout the world, but it is catastrophic \nfor us. We need the help of representatives to tackle \nthis difficult century before us. I pray that God may \nbless the United Nations."

        "file_text": "When we met here last \nyear, financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers \nand American International Group (AIG) were falling \nlike tenpins. For weeks, credit froze as perceptions of \nrisk shot up. The global financial system went into \nseizure. National Governments took emergency \nmeasures to rescue banks and keep credit lines open. \nThe United States Treasury and the United States \nFederal Reserve, in particular, reacted with \nextraordinary boldness. For a period of time, it seemed \nas if everyone was flying blind. \n After a year, the situation no longer looks as \nbleak today. In fact, after a sharp contraction of the \nadvanced economies in the first half of this year, there \nare signs of a recovery. Some of the leading indicators \nare flashing positive again and the next two quarters \nwill probably register good growth globally. Whether \nthis growth can be sustained is, however, a different \nquestion. \n \n \n41 09-52598 \n \n It would be a mistake to think that the global \neconomic crisis will soon be over. The crisis came \nabout because of excesses and imbalances which have \nto be put right. Looking back, we know that the \nexcesses were the result of inadequate regulation of \nbanks and quasi-banking institutions. Over the years, \nclever minds turned non-banks into de facto ones \nwhich were not regulated as conventional banks. This \nunregulated financial sector grew to dwarf the \nregulated sector. \n To forestall collapse when the bubble burst, \nGovernments and regulators stepped in taking over \nfinancial institutions, guaranteeing liabilities, \nincreasing public spending and pumping liquidity into \nthe economy. These are emergency measures which are \nneeded to get the global economy through a critical \nphase. They have stabilized the financial sector and \nprevented the real economy from being too badly \naffected. \n However, as when steroids are administered to \nreduce inflammation, there is a price to be paid for this \ntemporary relief. First, the expectation that \nGovernments will step in when things go badly wrong \ncreates a huge moral hazard. Once Governments set a \nbottom limit to the consequences of risk-taking, more \nrisks will be taken in the future. \n Secondly, the huge increase in global liquidity \nhas slowed down or reversed the fall in inflated asset \nprices. Worldwide stock markets have benefited from \neasy money. In Asia, property markets are booming \nagain even though the real economy is still struggling. \nWithdrawing liquidity without destabilizing economies \nand asset markets in the coming months and years will \nbe a tricky business. \n And thirdly, the emergency measures which have \nbeen taken reduce the need for painful restructuring. \nYet without major restructuring of regulatory systems \nand businesses, the imbalances which created the \nconditions for the crisis in the first place can only get \nworse. \n While excesses in the financial sector were the \ntrigger of the crisis, the deeper underlying cause was \nthe global imbalance between producers and consumers \nand between saving and consumption. For too long, the \nworld depended on the United States consumers \nkeeping global demand high and on lending those \nconsumers the money to keep the game going. To \ncorrect this imbalance, Asians have to consume more \nand save less as a proportion of income, while \nAmericans have to consume less and save more. \nOtherwise, a global Keynesian paradox of thrift will \ncause the global economy to operate below capacity. \n Rebalancing the global economy is, however, not \na simple matter at all, and is not only about economics: \nit is also deeply political. The rise of Asia is altering \nthe global power structure. Nothing expresses this \nmore than the complex relationship that now ties the \nUnited States and China together. China, with its \nreserves of over $2 trillion, is heavily invested in the \nUnited States dollar, making it a major stakeholder in \nthe United States economy. Without continuing market \nconfidence in the United States dollar, not just the \nUnited States economy, but the entire global economy \nwill be put at risk. \n Looking ahead, however, it is not going to be a \nbipolar world but a multi-polar world. Europe and \nJapan will remain heavyweights. India, Russia, Brazil \nand others will become more significant players. A \nmulti-polar world means a messier world with a \ndiversity of political systems, values and worldviews. \nNon-State actors like civil society organizations must \nincreasingly be engaged. At the same time, we are all \nmembers of the same human family sharing the same \nplanet. Looking ahead, we will need more effective \nglobal governance across a wide range of issues from \nprotection of human rights and international financial \nregulation to efforts to combat pandemics, climate \nchange and terrorism. \n The greatest challenge confronting us today is \nthat of ensuring effective global governance. We do not \nwant a global Government but we do need better \ncoordination, cooperation and enforcement in many \nareas. The reform of the United Nations, including the \nUnited Nations Security Council, is going to take time. \nIncremental rather than dramatic change is a more \npractical approach. \n In terms of world trade, the World Trade \nOrganization, while far from perfect, can still function \nwell with effective political leadership. Once that \nleadership is supplied, the Doha Round of negotiations \ncan be concluded within the next few years. We are \nfortunate to have in Pascal Lamy a strong Director-\nGeneral at the helm. But this is a dangerous period \nbecause domestic politics in many countries favour \ngreater protectionism. At all regional and international \n  \n \n09-52598 42 \n \nforums, we must take a clear collective stand against \nprotectionism. \n Climate change is a long-term challenge for \nhumanity which needs to be addressed with some \nurgency. While we cannot be sure how much increased \ncarbon dioxide emissions will affect the global climate \nin the coming decades and centuries, it would be \nirresponsible for us in this generation not to start acting \nnow. The increased weather volatility we have been \nexperiencing in recent years could be a warning of \nlonger-term trends already under way. An international \nagreement on climate change which aligns our interests \nand efforts is absolutely necessary to preserve this \nplanet for future generations. \n For that reason, we must redouble efforts to \nconclude negotiations for an international agreement at \nthe Copenhagen Climate Change Conference at the end \nof this year. It is good that caring for the environment \nis increasingly becoming a moral norm in the world, \nespecially among the young. We must not fail them. \nThe strong political commitment expressed by many \nleaders at the Summit on Climate Change, chaired by \nthe Secretary-General himself here last week, gives us \nreason for hope. \n The present economic crisis is a major challenge \nto global governance. In November last year, then \nUnited States President George W. Bush convened the \nfirst summit of the Group of 20 (G-20). The second \nmeeting of leaders was held in London in April and the \nthird has just concluded in Pittsburgh under President \nBarack Obama\u2019s chairmanship. The G-20 has now been \ndesignated the premier forum for international \neconomic cooperation, replacing the Group of Eight \n(G-8). \n This G-20 process and the swift, decisive actions \nthat it brought about have helped avert an economic \ndepression in the last year. The emergency measures \ntaken by various Governments in response to the \nfinancial tsunami have bought us precious time to \nrestructure and rebalance the global economy. In \nPittsburgh, the G-20 leaders acknowledged that a sense \nof normalcy should not lead to complacency. We \nwelcome their pledge to adopt policies needed for \nstrong, sustained and balanced growth. If the biggest \neconomies do not persist in that effort \u2014 and persisting \nmeans pain for domestic constituencies in many \ncountries \u2014 the respite we are now enjoying will lead \nto an even bigger crisis, this time possibly involving \nforeign exchange markets as well. \n In the coming months and years, it is important \nfor the G-20 process to develop greater legitimacy, \nespecially as it begins to deal with a broader set of \nissues. That the establishment of the G-20 leaders \nmeeting was not blessed by the United Nations or other \nexisting international organizations should not hold us \nback from giving it full support. Although the G-20 \nprocess is not ideal, it is the most important driver of \nchange that we have right now.  \n The United Nations itself is too intricate and not \nstructured to deal with issues such as a major financial \ncrisis. The old G-8 lacked representation, and the G-8 \nPlus was not acceptable because it put the additional \nparticipants at a disadvantage. As for the International \nMonetary Fund, it was never designed to tackle a crisis \nof such scale. In any case, the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions themselves need reform, which indeed is a \nmajor subject on the G-20 agenda. \n For the G-20 process to be effective and \nlegitimate, however, it is not enough for leaders to \nconfer and make general exhortations. Ministers and \nexperts must also meet and go into details. They should \nnot be confined to the same G-20 countries every time. \nWe need variable geometry in membership. For \ndifferent subjects, there could be different groups of \nparticipants, including both G-20 and non-G-20 \ncountries. The views of small States, which comprise \nthe majority of Members of the United Nations, must \nnot be ignored. The meetings should be transparent. \nThere must be wide consultations so that those not \nincluded in specific meetings can still table their views. \nDepending on the subject, those consultations can take \nplace at the United Nations or at one of the other \ninternational organizations. \n Mindful of the need to widen participation, \nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown invited regional \nrepresentatives, such as the Chair of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Chair of the \nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development and the \nChairperson of the African Union Commission, to the \nG-20 leaders meeting in London in April 2009. \nPresident Obama followed this precedent in Pittsburgh. \nWe in ASEAN certainly hope that the inclusion of the \nASEAN Chair will become the norm at future G-20 \nleaders meetings. It is right that the United Nations \n \n \n43 09-52598 \n \nSecretary-General was included from the very \nbeginning. \n A balance has to be struck between effectiveness \nand inclusiveness. If a meeting is too big, it becomes \nunwieldy and unworkable. If too small, it lacks \nrepresentation and legitimacy. As most Members of the \nUnited Nations are not in the G-20, it is important for \nus to have a say on the role the G-20 should play as an \nagent of change in global governance. While we should \nsupport the G-20 process, we should do so in a way \nthat ensures that our own interests as smaller States are \ntaken into account. \n A great power shift is taking place in the world. \nThe formal establishment of the G-20 as a new \ninternational institution last week marks a momentous \nnew beginning. History shows that power shifts never \noccur smoothly. Without a good system of global \ngovernance, we can be sure that the power shift in this \ncentury will also be a troubled one. Putting that system \nin place requires the collective effort of all of us. We \nshould not be lulled by the temporary easing of the \nglobal economic crisis into thinking that the worst is \nbehind us and that we can return to our old ways."

I am \nconfident that under his able leadership, meaningful \nprogress will be made during this session. I also wish \nto express my appreciation and support to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in \nreforming the United Nations. \n I would first like to recall the special historic ties \nbetween the Republic of Korea and the United Nations. \nThe contemporary history of the Republic of Korea \nbegan with the United Nations. Under the auspices of \nthe United Nations, we held our first democratic \nelections in 1948, and with the approval of the United \nNations we became the only legitimate Government on \nthe Korean Peninsula.  \n Indeed, the Republic of Korea is a country that \nhas been championed by the United Nations. Men from \n16 United Nations Member States came to our support \nwhen the Korean War broke out in 1950, only two \nyears after the founding of the Republic. Fallen heroes \nof the Korean War from 11 countries are buried in the \nonly United Nations cemetery in the world, located in \nBusan, the second largest city in Korea. To this day, the \ncemetery serves as a place for the Korean people to \ncommemorate their noble sacrifices. \n At the time of the Korean War, Korea was among \nthe least developed countries in the world, with a per \ncapita income of less than $50. But to everyone\u2019s \nsurprise, Korea was able to achieve both \nindustrialization and democratization in a single \ngeneration. Korea has transformed itself from an aid-\nrecipient country to a donor country. \n While this achievement is the fruit of the Korean \npeople\u2019s toils and tears, the invaluable support of the \nUnited Nations has been a great source of strength. For \nthis reason, Korea observed United Nations Day even \nbefore becoming a Member State in 1991. Building on \nsuch achievements, Korea is now embarking on a path \nof actively contributing to the international community. \nThat is the goal that a global Korea aims to achieve. \n We wish to share our past development \nexperiences in order to help developing countries lift \nthemselves out of famine and poverty. While financial \nsupport to developing countries is important, it is even \nmore important to find the right development model to \nfit each country.  \n Today, the unprecedented financial crisis is \ncompounding the difficulties of developing countries. \nAs a member of the G-20 Troika , Korea is making the \nutmost effort to strengthen the free trade system which \npowers global economic growth, while also ensuring \nthat the voices of developing countries are heard. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set \nforth by the United Nations must be realized. \nDevelopment cooperation and humanitarian assistance \nneed to increase, especially for the developing \ncountries most severely affected by the economic \ncrisis. Korea will fulfil its pledge to triple the volume \nof its 2008 official development assistance (ODA) by \n2015. And in 2011, we will be hosting the Fourth High-\nlevel Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Seoul. By \nensuring its success, we will enhance aid effectiveness \nfor the achievement of the MDGs by 2015 and \ncontribute to strengthening the global partnership for a \nmore comprehensive and effective development \ncooperation. \n Today, young Korean volunteers, under the name \nof World Friends Korea, are doing volunteer work \nthroughout the world to put into practice the spirit of \nlove and giving. Currently, more than 3,000 volunteers \nhave been dispatched to some 40 countries, and we will \ncontinue to send more volunteers, focusing on sharing \nour areas of strength in information technology, \nmedicine and agricultural technologies as well as our \nexperience in governance development. \n Among other efforts, Korea is also actively \nengaging in promoting international peace and security \n \n \n43 09-52179 \n \nand preventing terrorism through its participation in \npeacekeeping operations. Currently, Koreans are \nserving in 13 missions around the world. Since last \nMarch, we have also been taking part in multinational \nefforts to protect commercial vessels of all flags from \nacts of piracy in the waters off the coast of Somalia. \n Korea will faithfully fulfil its responsibilities as \nexpected by the international community, including in \nthe areas of preventing conflicts, countering terrorism \nand responding to natural disasters. \n Responding to climate change has become an \nindispensable and urgent item on the agenda for all of \nhumanity. Climate change poses a common challenge \nto all humankind and thus requires the concerted \nefforts of developed and developing countries as well \nas newly industrialized countries. For this reason, all \ncountries need to take part and be prepared in \naddressing this challenge. \n Korea greatly appreciates the role of the United \nNations in placing climate change high on the agenda \nas an urgent priority and in galvanizing global efforts \nto address this critical issue. At the Copenhagen \nConference, to be held in December 2009, the \ninternational community is expected to deliver a very \nimportant decision with great implications for the \nfuture. At this very place yesterday, we reaffirmed our \ncommitment to making the Copenhagen Conference a \nsuccess. \n Korea, while not included in annex I of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC), plans to make a voluntary \nannouncement before the end of this year stating its \nmidterm emissions-reduction target for 2020. Korea \nhas proposed the establishment of a registry of \nnationally appropriate mitigation actions at the \nsecretariat of the UNFCCC, with a view to inviting \ndeveloping countries to voluntarily participate in \nmitigation actions and to providing the international \nsupport that they need. We hope that our proposals and \nefforts will contribute positively to the attainment of \nsuccessful outcomes at Copenhagen. \n To respond proactively to climate change, Korea \nhas adopted low carbon green growth as a guiding \nvision for our nation and a strategy for further \ndevelopment. We are currently working to enact a \nframework law on green growth and establish a five-\nyear plan for green growth. Thereby, we will not only \ntransform our economic and industrial structures, but \nalso change our very lifestyles to become more future-\noriented. Under this plan, Korea will invest about 2 per \ncent of its gross domestic product in the field of green \ngrowth every year over the next five years. This is \ntwice the level recommended by the United Nations. \n The underlying objective of the low carbon green \ngrowth strategy is to promote sustainable development \nby putting in place a positive cycle in which the \nenvironment revives the economy and the economy \npreserves the environment. This strategy is the most \neffective way to address global climate change and to \novercome the economic crisis at the same time. By \npursuing a green growth policy that makes assertive \nfiscal investments in areas of green growth, Korea is \npreparing for the future, while also responding to the \nimmediate economic crisis. \n The development of green technologies and \ninternational cooperation are key factors in ensuring \nsuccess in responding to climate change. At the \nexpanded Group of Eight Summit last August, Korea \nwas designated as a leader in transformational \ntechnology, including the area of smart grid \ntechnology. Korea will strengthen global partnership \nfor cooperation on green technology and share the \nensuing benefits of this partnership with the rest of the \nworld. \n While fossil energy is replaceable, water is not. \nWater is the most important resource in our lives. \nAccordingly, I wish to urge the President of the \nGeneral Assembly, world leaders and the Secretary-\nGeneral to take a special interest in the issues \nconcerning water, since it is also a crucial factor in \nachieving the MDGs. \n Today, close to half of the world\u2019s population \nface water-related problems, and most of the climate \nchange-related natural disasters, including floods, \ndrought and rising sea levels, are water-related \ndisasters. In the course of launching the East Asia \nClimate Partnership, the Korean Government reviewed \nwater-related issues in Asia. We have come to the \nconclusion that the provision of clean water and the \ndevelopment of policies and infrastructure for \ninundation and disaster prevention are the most \npressing issues at hand. \n Korea possesses cutting-edge desalination \ntechnology and has been improving its integrated water \nresource management system. The restoration of \nCheong Gae Cheon in Seoul, which had been a \n  \n \n09-52179 44 \n \nconcrete-covered dry stream for several decades, has \nprovided more than 10 million residents with a \npleasant recreation site and a clean stream. This was an \nenvironmentally friendly greening project that helped \nthe city to overcome the heat island phenomenon, not \nto mention rendering it more attractive at the same \ntime. \n Such experiences and achievements have led us \nto launch a four major rivers restoration project, \ninvolving the four rivers that traverse our country from \nnorth to south and from east to west. This project not \nonly provides a fundamental solution for securing \nwater and controlling flooding, but also enables us to \nrevive the ecosystem of these rivers. \n The time has come for the international \ncommunity to establish a system of governance that \naddresses water-related issues effectively. I am aware \nthat some 20 United Nations agencies have been \nworking in earnest on water issues. Issues concerning \nwater are complex, as they have a bearing on a wide \nrange of areas. To establish a more effective system of \ninternational cooperation on water, I would like to \npropose a specialized integrated water management \ncooperation initiative. \n Global peace and security form the cornerstone \nfor maintaining the stability and prosperity of all \nmankind. Today, global peace is threatened by the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their \nmeans of delivery. To respond to these challenges, \nstrong determination and cooperation among all \ncountries are essential in strengthening the \ninternational non-proliferation regime, including the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \nLast October, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon put \nforward a five-point proposal for nuclear disarmament. \nAnd, in his speech in Prague in April, United States \nPresident Barack Obama set out his vision for a world \nfree of nuclear weapons. Through sufficient \ndiscussions, we anticipate that these initiatives, which \nembody the hopes and desires of humanity, will \nenhance a common understanding on nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. \n In particular, a nuclear weapons-free Korean \nPeninsula must be realized in order to attain peace in \nNorth-East Asia and beyond. Denuclearization is a \nprerequisite to laying a path towards genuine \nreconciliation and unification in the Korean peninsula, \nwhich is the only remaining divided region in the \nworld. \n The Republic of Korea will play an active part in \nthe concerted international efforts to dismantle the \nnuclear programmes of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea. We urge the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea to join in these efforts and to return \nto the Six-Party Talks forthwith and without \nprecondition. \n The 1992 Joint Declaration on the \nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, to which \nboth Koreas committed themselves, must be observed. \nOn that basis, the Republic of Korea will increase \ndialogue and exchanges with the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea, and strengthen cooperation with the \ninternational community towards that country\u2019s \ndevelopment. I have proposed a grand bargain that \nwould involve dismantling the core components of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme and the concomitant provision of security \nassurances and intensified economic support within the \nframework of the Six-Party Talks. We are currently \nengaged in consultations with the concerned parties. I \nwant to make it clear that now is the time for the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to make the \ndecision to achieve genuine peace on the Korean \npeninsula, and for its own sake as well. \n We are confronted with diverse and complex \nchallenges that can be met only through international \ncooperation. In meeting the expectations of the \ninternational community, we hope that a renewed and \nstrengthened United Nations will assume a greater role. \nTo that end, it is important now more than ever for the \nUnited Nations to demonstrate efficient and effective \nmanagement. We hope that the United Nations reform \ninitiatives in the various areas will yield concrete \nresults. \n As a responsible State Member of the United \nNations, Korea will continue to render its close \ncooperation so that the Organization can play a lead \nrole in bringing progress to all humankind and the \ninternational community at large. Korea seeks to be a \nfriend to the world that is considerate of others and \ncontributes to global society."

        "file_text": "The convening in the splendid\nmetropolis of New York of this last General Assembly\nsession of the millennium affords me the happy\nopportunity, on behalf of the people, the Government of\nPublic Salvation and the head of State, His Excellency\nPresident Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, to convey our warmest greetings to\nall people the world over who love peace and justice.\nIt is my pleasant duty also to congratulate the\nPresident of the General Assembly and the other Assembly\nofficers on their unanimous election to the leadership of the\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. My country views the\nelection to the presidency of Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab as\nrecognition of his many sterling qualities, both human and\nprofessional, and as an acknowledgement by the\ninternational community of the important role played by his\ncountry, Namibia, in building an Africa and a world that\nwill be marked by peace, political stability and economic\nprosperity. The President may be sure that the delegation of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo will unreservedly\nsupport him in fulfilling his mandate and in guiding the\nwork of the Assembly to a successful conclusion.\nI also extend to his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti,\nour full appreciation of the extremely important work he\ndid during his presidency, as well as the commitment he\nshowed throughout to the triumph of the ideals embodied\nin the United Nations Charter.\nFinally, my delegation would like to welcome here in\nour world Organization three new Members: the Republic\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga.\nI invite Members to read my prepared text at their\nleisure, so that I may say a few other things. I begin with\na good quotation, from Article 2 of the United Nations\nCharter:\n\u201cThe Organization and its Members, in pursuit of\nthe Purposes stated in Article 1, shall act in\naccordance with the following Principles.\n\u201c1. The Organization is based on the principle\nof the sovereign equality of all its Members.\n\u201c2. All Members, in order to ensure to all of\nthem the rights and benefits resulting from\nmembership, shall fulfil in good faith the obligations\nassumed by them in accordance with the present\nCharter.\n\u201c3. All Members shall settle their international\ndisputes by peaceful means in such a manner that\ninternational peach and security, and justice, are not\nendangered.\n\u201c4. All Members shall refrain in their\ninternational relations from the threat or use of force\nagainst the territorial integrity or political\nindependence of any state, or in any other manner\ninconsistent with the Purposes of the United\nNations\u201d.\nI say to representatives: This is the United Nations\nCharter, your Charter. Are there represented in this Hall\n\u2014 yes or no \u2014 Members that violate these principles\ngoverning relations between nations? Are there\nrepresented in this Hall \u2014 yes or no \u2014 Members that do\nworse than those that do not pay their dues, or pay them\nlate, regarding which immediate reminders are sent, and\nrightly so, since the rules of procedure of the\nOrganization of which they are Members prescribe that\nfor its proper functioning each Member must pay its\ndues? Failing to do so even means being stripped of the\nright to speak here at the United Nations. So, if you have\nyour right to speak taken away, if you are punished as a\nMember of the United Nations because you do not pay\nyour dues, what about those who violate Article 2 of the\nCharter, who cross the boundaries of another State with\ntheir armies, sow hardship in that country, occupy vast\nportions of its territory, plunder its natural resources, steal\nthe fauna and rare species of animals which international\norganizations recognize as being received by other\ncountries, carry out a blitzkrieg such as the one in the\nearly 1940s, without warning, without provocation,\nentering the country of another people with their arms and\neverything else they need, under pretexts which I shall\nexpose in a little while.\nOn 2 August 1998, some two years ago, our brothers\nfrom the hills of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda invaded\nour country in an unprovoked blitzkrieg, without having\ndeclared war, and it continues to this very day. For two\nyears now those Members of the United Nations have\nbeen violating Article 2, and they continue to violate it,\nwith arrogance and total impunity, which is not the case\nfor those who fail to pay their dues.\n28\n\n\nIt is perhaps better to violate Article 2, occupy other\ncountries, pillage them, deport their inhabitants and torture\nchildren, women and old persons, than it is to commit the\nmortal sin of failing to pay up. There are two yardsticks,\ndouble standards, which we regard as an immense injustice.\nAs I speak I feel the presence of illustrious persons\nwho have spoken from this rostrum in the past, such as\nCabral, Nkrumah and \u2014 I say this with a great deal of\nemotion \u2014 Lumumba, who came here to denounce what\nwas being set in train more than 30 years ago, under United\nNations banners which is now being repeated. We know the\nUnited Nations. The French rightly say \u201cA cat that has been\nscalded is even afraid of cold water.\u201d They have already\ncome, those United Nations forces; they came to restore\npeace, and the result was that for one of the most illustrious\nsons of our people, the most admired African nationalist\nPresident Patrice Lumumba, the flag of the United Nations\nserved as a shroud. We do not wish, we will not allow, that\nsame flag to be a shroud for those who have taken up the\ntorch that fell from Lumumba's hands and who carried it,\nwith some help of course, as far as lying down \u2014 with\ntheir boots on \u2014 in Mobutu's bed. This is something with\nwhich the Assembly is familiar.\nIt is on behalf of my President, my friend, my long-\ntime comrade, that I speak. As representatives will see, and\nas I often say, we will have no more charming \u201cRastas\u201d,\nbecause we lost our hair waiting for President Kabila to\nreturn to relight the torch that fell from Lumumba's hands.\nIf people do not watch out, if they let things slide\nalong, if they tolerate arrogance and do not stand up to\nimpunity, there are those who will begin to dream of\nwrapping Kabila up in the United Nations flag, as was done\nin the case of Patrice Lumumba not long ago.\nWhen events are repeated, they do not always happen\nin exactly the same way, but sometimes the repetition\nstrikes a familiar chord. Now we see the United Nations\ndelaying putting an end to what it calls euphemistically the\n\u201cconflict\u201d in the Great Lakes region. This terminology is\nbeing used for some reason \u2014 but what? A foreign army\ncrosses the border, occupies the country, a part of the\ncountry; it pillages the country's wealth \u2014 and the United\nNations calls this a \u201cconflict\u201d? We should check our\ndictionaries. This is a war. Instead of shouting themselves\nhoarse about sending peacekeepers, Member States must\nsend people who can put an end to the war. This is what I\nam waiting for. Our Rwandan, Ugandan and Burundi\nbrothers must be solemnly requested here and now to go\nback home. They have no business being in our country.\nThey are undermining all national reconstruction efforts.\nThis should be clear to those who understand the\ncondition in which we found this country, which used to\nbe called Zaire and which we now call, as Lumumba\ncalled it, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe presence of these outsiders, their occupation,\nimpedes our efforts to reconstruct our country. They came\nupon us like thieves who attack without warning. They\nattacked while we were busy sowing corn, peanuts and\nbeans, and we were doing so because that was what we\nwas needed in this country that is overflowing with\ndiamonds, gold, cobalt, copper and so forth. In order to\nhelp our people we had begun by planting peanuts, corn\nand beans, but our efforts were stopped cold by these\npeople who are now in our territory, who came from the\nhills, who came to defend their borders \u2014 their borders\nthat, according to them, were threatened by genocidal\nbands in our country.\nI ask the Assembly to look at a map of Africa, a\nmap of the Congo in particular. I come from the Atlantic\nCoast province of Bas-Congo. Do you know where these\npeople who began the war came from, in order to secure\ntheir borders? They came from 2,000 kilometres away\nfrom my province. They began in my province in order\nto secure borders 2,000 kilometres away. They brought\nsoldiers 2,000 kilometres from their borders in order to\nbegin the occupation of our country. Luckily, they took a\nlicking, and they would all have been wiped out if the\nAmericans had not asked us to allow them to return home\nalong a designated route. They retreated after their\nthrashing and tried their luck in the east of our country.\nAfter the ceasefire requested by Secretary-General\nKofi Annan, United Nations staff went to the area to\ncarry out an order of the World Health Organization to\nvaccinate all children up to five years of age. We have\nvaccinated them in the part of the country that we\ncontinue to control. But these others \u2014 who only have\ntwo hands, both of which are busy pillaging \u2014 have yet\nto vaccinate the children in this age group. Thus, these\nchildren are in danger not only of polio, but also of other\ndiseases that the agencies of our Organization have been\nstriving to eliminate from our continent.\nThese soldiers do not have time to vaccinate our\nchildren. They do not even have time to pillage\neffectively because these Horatii and Curiatii have taken\nto fighting each other on our soil. They came to take\ncontrol of our country, but now, how strange, they are\nfighting each other, these people who came to teach us\n29\n\n\ndemocracy, these people who came to restore peace. In\norder to have a break from their looting, they are enjoying\na little war on our land, and in the process destroying the\n3 million doses of vaccine that the United Nations, through\nthe World Health Organization, sent to Kisangani. They\nshoot at each other, each band allied with this or that local.\nThis is what is happening.\nAnd then these people take their place here as United\nNations Members \u2014 after having treated us like that, and\nas they continue to do so. They are building up their\narsenals, bringing in troops, taking towns. What reassures\nus is the teaching of the Marquis de Sade that taking is not\nthe same as possessing. Thus, these people are taking towns\nbut they do not possess them. And they will not posses\nthem because, just as in erotic relations, there is no\npossession without consent \u2014 that consent that has been\ngiven to us. Otherwise, our people would not have fled to\nthe forests to escape from these people who come from the\nhills. Our citizens' lengthy stay in the forests has led to the\nreappearance of some diseases that were eradicated as long\nago as the Belgian colonial era.\nHaving to flee the invaders like the plague makes our\ncitizens' lives more difficult. And these people from the\nhills continue to advance even though they signed with us,\nlast 10 July, a Ceasefire Agreement that lacks both fire and\na cease, as they continue to advance and lay siege to our\ncities.\nTheir latest exploit, which they are now engaged in, is\nto lay siege to the city of Mbuji-Mayi, the world diamond\ncapital, but also the world capital of children afflicted with\npolio. I do not think that their haste and willingness to\nreturn to Mbuji-Mayi are out of desire to vaccinate the poor\nCongolese children who are infected with or at risk of\ngetting polio. These people from the hills do not have a\nthird hand, as I said earlier, yet I am sure that, driven by\ntheir greed, they are going to take as many diamonds and\nas much copper and cobalt as they can \u2014 and at the risk of\nfighting each other for these minerals, since Uganda also\nwants to take them. The statistics on sales of diamonds\nindicate that last month our Rwandan brothers sold more\nthan a million carats of diamonds \u2014 a mineral not mined\nin their country \u2014 and with the money from the sales they\nare buying weapons so as to be able to fight us. Then they\ntake more diamonds, buy more weapons and continue to\nfight us.\nIn this Hall speeches have been made against dirty\nmoney. Therefore, we are outraged to see bloodstained\ncobalt, bloodstained copper, bloodstained gold and\nbloodstained diamonds for sale on the international\nmarket, and to see that it does not occur to the buyers of\nthis booty to put a stop to this practice by refusing to buy\nit \u2014 even though they oppose dirty money. Double\nstandards continue to prevail.\nDirty money poses a threat to the world. And yet,\nwhile the blood of the Congolese people is spattered on\nour cobalt, our copper and our gold, that doesn't seem to\nbother those from all over the world who buy them and\ngive money to the pillagers and occupiers our country. If\nwe revisit this issue, I reserve the right to address it\nagain.\nI wish, however, to speak out loud and clear against\nthe infamous pretext that has aroused the world's\nprurience and sensitivity about genocide. Those who are\nguilty of genocide are in our country right now. Let them\nleave and go on sowing misery in their own countries:\nRwanda, Uganda or Burundi.\nAs I said at the outset, President Kabila has raised\nLumumba's torch and welcomed those who sought refuge\nin our country, because over there you do not seek\nrefuge \u2014 you get your throat slit. I was just a schoolboy\nwhen I saw Hutus fleeing cutthroat Tutsi and Tutsi\nfleeing cutthroat Hutus. They all sought refuge with us.\nThat is how those who helped us, who walked with us on\nour march on Kinshasa, came to be refugees in our\ncountry \u2014 they fled Hutus who would have cut their\nthroats. That is at the heart of the current instability and\nreflects the values of our brothers in Rwanda. We must\nhelp our Rwandese to change their political culture.\nWhen the \u201cone man one vote\u201d law was enacted in\n1960, the obsession of each of these groups was to seize\npower and abuse it in order to hasten the carnage. This\ncarnage has been alternating and reciprocal and did not\nbegin in 1994. I cited a date when I was in short pants,\nand I can assure the Assembly that it was not yesterday.\nIt is the open faucet that produced the interahamwe that\nwe must close. Rwanda must become democratic;\nRwanda must adopt a culture of politics and abandon its\nculture of carnage. Rwanda must leave our country;\nUganda must leave our country; Burundi must leave our\ncountry and turn over the task of providing security to\nUnited Nations observers, who will take their place and\nserve as a buffer force between us. Those people are our\nneighbours and we can never replace our neighbours, but\nthey are on our territory, which means they are no longer\nour neighbours. I ask the Assembly to help us to resume\nour status as neighbours. Let them go back home and if\n30\n\n\nthere are problems that we must settle among ourselves, we\nshall settle them by peaceful means.\nI am speaking without acrimony. We hold out our\nhands to our brothers from Rwanda, who have been here\nfor several days. I offer them signals of friendship when we\npass, and they respond. We are here so that in three\nmonths, when the new millennium dawns, we will not still\nbe fighting. One must deal with urgent matters quickly.\nThe Lusaka process, in which I participated, raised\nhopes that have been dashed by dilatory tactics. One\nmoment the Congolese and Rwandese affiliates who refuse\nto come; the next, it is the Ugandans or their Congolese\npuppets. Here we are on 29 September and nothing has yet\nbeen done seriously to implement an Agreement that was\nreached on 10 July.\nThat is why we ask the Assembly, if only out of\nrespect for the Articles of the Charter, to do something\nabout it. It is intolerable and incomprehensible that these\npeople remain, and may even take the floor here, while\nthey continue to violate the United Nations Charter and the\nprinciples that bring us together here. If you violate the\nprinciples of an organization to which you belong, you are\nno longer worthy of belonging.\nWe must remind our brothers that, as Members of the\nUnited Nations, they are bound to respect the Charter. This\ncannot be done by occupying other people's countries. If\ndifferences must be settled by invasion and plunder, there\nwill no longer be a United Nations, because there will no\nlonger be any rules to unite us. That prompts my request to\nthe Assembly, because the suffering being endured by the\nCongolese people and the atrocities being visited upon us\nare unimaginable.\nUnder the very nose of the Vatican, in the Italian\nmission of Kasika, these new-style Huns entered, tore open\nthe chest of a traditional chief, pulled out his heart,\nshredded it and distributed the pieces like hosts. The killers\nwho did this sucked on the bloody heart as if it were an\nice-cream cone. We have seen this and continue to witness\nsuch acts. Our United Nations mission is at Members'\ndisposal to provide irrefutable testimony, which we have\npublished in a three-volume white paper that could easily\ngrow into further volumes describing similar incidents. We\nhave requested that this white paper be issued as a working\ndocument of the Security Council. All are invited to study\nit in order to understand precisely what is happening and to\nput an end to this situation \u2014 to save the United Nations\nitself, to help us Africans, and the Congolese in particular,\nwho had to wait 32 years to defeat and eliminate a regime\nof notorious satraps, only to see new satraps step in two\nmonths later to occupy our country and put it to the\nsword.\nHelp us to make our Rwandese, Ugandan and\nBurundian brothers understand that they must go home.\nThey have no business in our country; let them relinquish\ntheir place to United Nations forces, which will secure\ntheir borders. That is in itself a fiction that we have not\nhad an opportunity to dwell on. They helped us to raise\nLumumba's torch. They were in our army. Most officers\nin our army were from Rwanda, as was the Chief of\nStaff, who dispatched his troops on the basis of his\nparticular military skills. Moreover, these people have\noccupied that region of our country for two years and are\nstill hunting the Interahamwe, as the Incas were once\nhunted here. They will not stop until Joe the Ugandan and\nBill the Rwandese have extended their hunting grounds to\nthe entire territory of our country while they prance after\nthe Interahamwe.\nThis is just a pretext. If they were not able to catch\na single Interahamwe while their officers were in our\narmy; if they have been unable to stop the interahamwe\nin their two-year occupation of that region, then the task\nis beyond them. It must be left to the United Nations to\nunseat these Interahamwe, if they exist, and let us pursue\nour national reconstruction.\nI have a great deal more to say and believe that we\nwill have further opportunities in due course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf\nof the Government of the Republic of San Marino, I wish\nto congratulate you on your election to the presidency of\n21\n\n\nthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. You\nrepresent a geographical region, the African continent,\nwhich can significantly contribute to identifying the major\ncauses of world problems and help to evaluate their effects.\nYou can lead this Organization towards desirable and\nconcrete results.\nA particular acknowledgment goes to President Didier\nOpertti. San Marino had the opportunity and privilege to\nwork in close cooperation with him and to ascertain his\nundeniable and extraordinary skills and the remarkable\naccomplishments reached during his mandate.\nFinally, I would like to congratulate the three new\nStates which have recently joined the big family of the\nUnited Nations. I am deeply convinced that countries never\ninvolved in wars possess an inestimable richness and can\ntransmit to the whole world their history of peace and\ntolerance, helping us reach the goals set forth in the\npreambular paragraphs of the Charter.\nThe Republic of San Marino believes that the United\nNations is, and must remain, the forum for international\nnegotiations best suited to the nations\u2019 expectations. We\nreiterate its central role in the prevention and management\nof international crises, particularly in the field of peace and\nsecurity, through the necessary updating process of its main\noperative organs, and primarily the Security Council, which\nshould never be delegitimized.\nThe Council\u2019s reform, in the context of a larger reform\nof the United Nations system, is a fundamental step in the\nconstruction of the new international structure. The reform\noriginated from the need to update the composition and the\nmodus operandi of the most important United Nations\norgan to operate in a deeply changed international\nenvironment.\nWe are particularly thankful to the Secretary-General\nfor courageously proposing, and partly already\naccomplishing, a complete, wide-ranging programme of\nreforms to strengthen the United Nations. This programme\nwill progress because only an Organization in constant\nevolution will be able to prevent, in some cases, and to\ntackle, in others, the challenges of the next millennium.\nSan Marino feels internationally responsible and it\nfeels the need to mobilize all its strength to find solutions\nof solidarity to the serious problem of the external debt of\ndeveloping countries.\nFaced with 3 billion people who still live with less\nthan $2 a day, faced with 130 million children without\naccess to education and 1.5 billion people without\ndrinking water, we must support action aimed at creating\nsustainable development and healthy economic policies.\nThe imbalance between rich and poor countries must not\nbecome irreversible, with tragic consequences for all\nhumankind.\nSan Marino shares and supports the series of\nprogrammes and plans announced and applied by creditor\ncountries and by the major world financial institutions to\ntackle this serious emergency. Programmes and plans\nhave so far shown themselves to be insufficient to tackle\nthe problem of debt in a decisive way.\nWe hope that the United Nations will intensify the\ndebate aimed at an equitable and durable solution to the\nproblem. In particular, we hope that the General\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council will\nrepresent the best laboratory of ideas for its definition.\nSan Marino shares the ethical approach to the situation\nthrough solidarity and development. We believe this will\ngive more hope to the people affected by this heavy\nburden.\nIn the past year the Republic of San Marino was one\nof the first countries to ratify the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, convinced that such an\ninstitution is indispensable for the future world order. In\ninternational society, it represents not only a political\nadvance, but moral progress, too.\nThe Republic of San Marino has recently established\na permanent court of arbitration, trusting it will become\na trustworthy and impartial international instrument for\nthe resolution of national and international disputes. We\nare convinced that such an instrument will be duly\nevaluated by all Member States of the United Nations and\nthat they will shortly be able to subscribe to a proper\nconvention. We further believe that this initiative could\nrepresent a significant contribution by our country to the\ninternational community.\nAt the outset of the third millennium, we still find\ndisconcerting the coexistence of a large, consolidated\ncorpus of humanitarian laws and human rights and the\nspread of atrocities beyond all limits, affecting almost\nexclusively civil populations, mainly women and children.\nThe international community can rightly state that it\nhas reached goals in the field of humanitarian law and\n22\n\n\nhuman rights that were unimaginable 50 years ago.\nHowever, these considerable goals have been reached only\nwith the simultaneous application of established rules. In\nthis regard, we appreciate the tireless work of the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children and\nArmed Conflict, aimed at filling the deep gap between\nlegality and accepted practice, and at underlining the\nabsolute need in the community of States for the full\napplication of and respect for, international law. San\nMarino has great expectations of the future World Summit\nfor Children.\nIn every country and in every culture there are\nmessages of peace which are often forgotten, neglected or\nignored. It is the responsibility of the United Nations, its\nspecialized agencies, and all of us to rehabilitate those\nmessages through the awakening of our conscience and the\napplication of a universal culture of peace. This will happen\nif we are able to courageously identify and defeat the seeds\nof violence.\nTherefore, we have to decide now what culture we\nwant to defend: a culture where violence is considered an\ninevitable evil from which we can only protect ourselves,\nor a culture where violence can and must be eradicated.\nThe preamble to the Constitution of the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO), which includes the words,\n\u201csince wars begin in the minds of men, it is in\nthe minds of men that the defences of peace\nmust be constructed\u201d,\nremains today, in our opinion, the right perspective, because\npeace-building through dialogue, education and acceptance\nof differences is the best guarantee for the survival of\nhumanity.\nWe all know that there are 45 armed conflicts going\non at this very moment all over the world. Sadly, the\nspilling of stains of hate and violence constantly destroys\nthe hope that humanity will soon prepare to use the so-\ncalled \u201cpeace dividend\u201d, resulting from the end of the\nbalance of terror between the super-Powers, for positive\ngoals.\nThe Republic of San Marino deeply appreciates the\nrecent Security Council resolution expeditiously\nestablishing a multinational peace force to change the\nsituation in the East Timor crisis. What the United\nNations is starting is a risky mission, but it will contribute\nto increasing the role and dignity of the United Nations,\nunderlining its force as an impartial and neutral institution\ndeploying itself as a bulwark against prevarication to\ndefend the life and the dignity of humankind.\nIt is with great satisfaction that the Government of\nSan Marino acknowledges the renewed impetus and\nmomentum of the Arab-Israeli peace process negotiations.\nSan Marino regards with equal satisfaction the present\nsearch for political solutions at the end of the Balkans\nconflict, activating a channel of concrete solidarity for the\npopulation of Kosovo.\nThe people of San Marino sadly regret to see that\nthe important and topical question of the death penalty\nhas not been included in the General Assembly\u2019s agenda.\nSan Marino intends to continue to voice its protest against\ncapital punishment, firmly convinced that the abhorrent\ninstrument of death consciously and legally inflicted by\none human being on another can be considered neither a\nvalid and effective answer to defend society nor a\ndeterrent against the spreading of criminality.\nOn behalf of the Government of San Marino, I wish\nto acknowledge once more the focal role of the United\nNations with respect to the major challenges at the end of\nthis millennium and the momentum that the greatest\ninternational Organization can provide for a new century,\nin which the supremacy of a culture of peace over a\nculture of war, of a culture of life over a culture of death,\nof the full realization of human dignity over its systematic\nviolation, will prevail.\nIt is in this spirit that I wish good work to you, Sir,\nand to all the members of the Assembly."

        "file_text": "I should like to express\nmy most sincere congratulations to Mr. Gurirab on his\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at this\nsession. It is significant that his country, which gained\nindependence as a result of the struggle of its people and\nthe successful efforts of this Organization, will be\npresiding today over this Assembly and will, I am certain,\nbring its work to a successful conclusion. I extend my\ncongratulations to his predecessor for the commitment\nwith which he conducted his duties. I express our\nwarmest support to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his tireless efforts. He has used his competent\npolitical skill, his moral authority and his deep knowledge\nof the opportunities and limitations of his office to pursue\ndaunting tasks, often working against all odds.\nMy Government fully subscribes to the statement\ndelivered by Ms. Halonen, the Foreign Minister of\nFinland, on behalf of the European Union, and to the\nmemorandum circulated by the Union.\nGlobalization in the field of information, ideas, the\neconomy, democracy and human rights has been the\ndominant feature of the last years of our century. Some\npeople fear it; some try to ignore it; a few try to fight it;\nothers try to avoid it. Many welcome it as a creative\nchallenge. We Greeks are among the last category: we\nthrive on openness, freedom of exchange, freedom of\nthought, expression and inquiry. We speak the language\nof dialogue, the language of ideas. That is our tradition.\nWe are proud of that tradition which sparked off the\nRenaissance and supported the Enlightenment, whose\nessence was captured by Immanuel Kant's motto sapere\naude: dare to think. Globalization challenges us to dare to\nthink the unthinkable in terms of sovereignty,\ninternational relations and human rights. But that is not\nenough: we know we must go beyond it; we must dare to\nstate a vision for our world; we must dare to hope.\nWe take heart that at the end of our century\ndemocracy is being celebrated as the universal system of\npolitical rule, the only secure basis for legitimacy in the\nmodern world. Experience teaches us that democracy not\nonly institutionalizes freedom but also brings prosperity.\nCelebrated economist Amartya Sen has conclusively\nproved that a democratic system of Government is no\nobstacle to the creation of wealth: development does not\n32\n\n\nrequire an authoritarian ruler. Sen has observed that no\nsubstantial famine has ever occurred in any country with a\ndemocratic form of government and a relatively free press.\nWe take heart from the fact that more States claim to\nbe democratic now than ever before in human history, and\nwe are firmly committed to seeing this trend expand.\nSlowly but surely, we are observing the globalization of\ndemocracy, and we dare to hope.\nNevertheless, our challenges and political dilemmas\nare formidable. We need to globalize peace. We watch in\nawe as Israelis and Palestinians shake hands once again.\nThe peace might be local, but our pride is international.\nEqually, when watching India and Pakistan, we dare to\nhope for non-proliferation. We cringe as pictures of war\ncome out of Africa. We cannot hope for peace yet shut our\neyes to war.\nWe need to globalize human rights. Do we apply the\nsame standards everywhere, from Kosovo and East Timor\nto Cyprus and Rwanda? We need to globalize our concept\nof rights pertaining to human beings. We understand\nmultinationals that support human rights to protect their\ninvestments, but who will protect individuals who seek\nprotection from the indignities of the world market?\nWe need to globalize ethics. From Kosovo to East\nTimor we have bowed our heads, for we are still ill-\nequipped to deal with global ethical dilemmas such as those\nmentioned by the Secretary-General. Can human suffering\nbe subordinated to sovereignty? Can we afford to be\ninconsistent in the application of military intervention? Is it\nright to impose trade sanctions on Governments that violate\ninternational rules, at the expense of their innocent\npopulations?\nWe seek to globalize values. Technological innovation\nis calling into question some of our most deeply felt beliefs.\nFrom cloning to brain transplants, scientists now face\ndilemmas that have global implications. We must make sure\nthat fear does not inhibit scientific development, but also\nthat curiosity does not inhibit civility.\nWe need to globalize wealth. The growing gap\nbetween rich and poor countries has marginalized a large\nsegment of the world's population and led to dangerous\nsocial problems, from illegal immigration to drug\ntrafficking, terrorism, child labour and sexual exploitation.\nIn an effort to contribute what little we can, Greece decided\nto increase its official development assistance by an annual\naverage of 27 per cent over a five-year plan, targeting in\nparticular sub-Saharan Africa.\nHow can we hope to face these challenges if the\npeople of this world do not share a basic education and\ndo not enjoy basic health? While the electronic media\nhave minimized the restrictions of borders in the transfer\nof resources, wealth and information, democratic\ninstitutions and social policies remain confined within the\nborders of nations. We cannot wait for democracy to\nspread at this pace: we need a faster cure. We need to\nconfront this global democratic deficit by supporting\nglobal democratic institutions.\nBeyond the globalization of democracy, I call for the\ndemocratization of globalism. This is a vision worthy of\nthe United Nations. We seek a United Nations that is an\nactive centre for peace and justice, a centre for the\nimprovement of the life of each individual on this Earth.\nWe expect a United Nations to respond to our needs for\nglobal ethics and global values. We believe in a strong\nUnited Nations that will act swiftly and effectively against\nthose who wage war, harbour terrorism and destroy our\nplanet. We aspire to a United Nations which will become\nthe centre for democratic thinking and democratic practice\nthroughout our world.\nMay these United Nations, on our behalf, develop a\nculture of dialogue and a dialogue of cultures. For this is\nthe essence of democratic politics: not a clash of different\ncivilizations, but an educative dialogue that allows all to\ntake part. We must educate each other to find peaceful\nand democratic ways to confront our challenges.\nThis is a task for the United Nations. We yield to its\nauthority as the only forum able to democratize the\nglobalization process. We call for all Member States to\nprovide the United Nations with the authority and the\nmeans to perform its duties. Greece will do so. As our\nGhanaian colleague said yesterday, we continue to ask\nmore of the United Nations, and yet we continue to\nendow it with fewer resources. We feel that following the\nimportant reforms of the Secretariat, the time has come to\nexpand this Organization's authority, responsibility and\nbudget. Do we dare allow this Organization to hope? In\nGreece we do.\nMy country believes in strengthening the United\nNations, but it also believes in doing its own work, on the\nground, in the region. Uri Savir, the Israeli negotiator in\nOslo, has said that peacemaking is a gradual revolution\nthat moves from hostility to a desired conciliation, a\n33\n\n\ncollection of moments in which a new trend is set in\nmotion.\nTogether with the International Olympic Committee,\nGreece has proposed the creation of such a moment \u2014 a\nglobal moment: we would like to see the revival of the\nancient Greek tradition of the Olympic truce. We hope that\nthis Assembly, which has unanimously endorsed that\nproject, will give its full support to the observance of the\nOlympic truce during the games of the year 2000 in\nSydney, Australia, in Athens in 2004 and at all future\nOlympics, so that the event may become a momentous\nfestival of excellence, cross-cultural dialogue and peace in\nour global village.\nFrom Cyprus to Bosnia, a \u201ccollection of moments\u201d is\nproviding a ray of hope that, one day, a united Balkans and\nSouth-Eastern Europe will belong to a united Europe: a\nfamily of nations, a bouquet of cultures, a kaleidoscope of\nethnicities, where diversity is our strength and where\nborders are so profoundly respected that they cease to exist.\nCan we dare see that far? Do we dare not to? We dare to\nhope.\nTurning first to Cyprus: following the declaration on\nCyprus by the leaders of the Group of Eight and Security\nCouncil resolutions 1250 (1999) and 1251 (1999) of last\nJune, there is hope that a new initiative may break the\ndeadlock. Just as we envision a multicultural Balkans, we\nare striving to see Cyprus as a federal State with a single\nsovereignty and a single citizenship, a united, demilitarized,\nindependent country with its territorial integrity safe from\nencroachments and with no foreign troops on its soil. The\naccession of Cyprus to the European Union would certainly\nbenefit both communities living on the island. We invite the\nTurkish Cypriots, in the spirit of a newfound friendship\nbetween Greeks and Turks, to grab this historical\nopportunity. Let us break down the last \u201cBerlin wall\u201d,\nwhich artificially divides those two peoples. Let us show\nthe world and our children that, yes, we can live together\nin peace and harmony with respect for human rights and\ndemocratic principles, within a wider European family.\nThe tragic events in Kosovo will be remembered for\nacts of brutal ethnic cleansing and a military intervention\nthat ensued without the authorization of the Security\nCouncil. Today, I encounter individuals who, under\npressure to \u201cclose the case of the Balkans\u201d, opt to redraw\nthe maps, believing that ethnic isolation, constructing new\nwalls and barriers between our peoples of the region, will\nsolve our problems. But it can only compound our\nproblems.\nI assure the Assembly that there is no short path, no\nlazy road if you will, to lasting peace in the Balkans.\nConsistent with our policy in our region is our belief that\nborders are sacrosanct. But within them we must do our\nutmost to protect minorities, democratic procedures and\nhuman rights. We must strive to develop the three pillars\nof the Stability Pact for South-eastern Europe: democracy,\nsecurity and reconstruction. We need to build democratic\ninstitutions, judicial and financial systems, competitive\nbusiness and free media, things we often take for granted.\nWe need to be aggressive in ensuring that all forms of\nlikely threat to security within and among our countries\nare dealt with directly, openly and with vigour. The\nprotection of minorities is of fundamental importance. We\nneed, as the Secretary-General has said, a new\ncommitment to the prevention of conflict. We need to\nprovide basic economic help that will fight against the\npoverty and degradation that lead to ethnic and religious\nfanaticism.\nBut more important, we need a total Balkan\napproach. When I say \u201ctotal\u201d, I mean a coherent and\nconsistent approach by the international community. The\nBalkans are badly served by mixed signals.\nGreece has drawn for itself a creative and effective\nrole in the region. Greece supports all efforts to deepen\ndemocracy in the region. A total Balkan approach to\ndemocracy, security and reconstruction will pave the way\nfor our neighbours to enter the European Union.\nYugoslavia, of course, is also an integral part of this total\nBalkan approach. So too are Greece's bilateral and\ntrilateral contacts of very close cooperation with Albania,\nthe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria\nand Romania. We worked closely together during the\nrecent Kosovo crisis for stability in the region and in\nproviding humanitarian aid to Kosovo refugees.\nWe believe that in our region there are no good or\nbad people, just good and bad practices. We have\ndelivered and continue to deliver humanitarian assistance,\nas major humanitarian problems remain in many parts of\nYugoslavia, and peacekeeping forces. We have conducted\nmultilateral diplomacy, and we have promoted every\neffort that adheres to principles I have just stated without\ndiscrimination. Yes, in the total Balkan approach there is\nroom for both the Albanian and the Serbian people. We\nask them to dare to have a vision, the same vision: that,\none by one, each Balkan country will become part of a\nunited democratic Europe.\n34\n\n\nIf the road to peace is indeed made up of a collection\nof moments, then I also dare hope for our relations with\nTurkey. My Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, and I have\nbeen engaged in careful diplomacy for many months. We\nrecently inaugurated discussion committees to address a\nnumber of bilateral concerns, including trade, tourism, the\nenvironment and security, where we feel our two countries\nhave much to gain from mutual cooperation.\nPeoples' aspirations for the principles of democracy,\nsecurity and prosperity can overcome historical strife. In\nthis democratic spirit, we believe that our security is bound\nby the stability in the region; that our neighbours' strength\nis our own strength. From the outset, therefore, Greece\nshared with Turkey the vision that one day Turkey would\nbecome a worthy member of a united Europe. But we\nrecognize today that our role needs to be to lead the\nprocess.\nThe terrible earthquakes that shook both our countries\nhave accelerated that process. Spontaneous and dramatic\nacts of fraternity and solidarity between our citizens short-\ncircuited elaborate diplomatic strategies and exerted\npowerful pressure on our Governments to move ahead\nboldly. I for one shall never forget the sweat, the tears and\nthe genuine expressions of solidarity and friendship shared\nby so many non-governmental organizations, and\nparticularly by Greek and Turkish rescue workers from the\nDisaster Management Special Unit (EMAK) and the\nTurkish Search and Rescue Team (AKUT), sifting through\nthe rubble of buildings destroyed by the earthquakes,\nlooking for survivors. These people did not wait for us to\nact. Their actions globalize democracy, human solidarity\nand peace.\nThat is one more lesson for democracy. International\nrelations, humanitarianism, peace and cooperation have\nmuch to gain if we allow for citizens' diplomacy and give\nour full support to constructive roles for non-governmental\norganizations.\nBuilding on this unique experience, in our first joint\nact as members of this Organization, I join hands today\nwith my Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem. I join hands with\nhim to announce to the Assembly the establishment of a\njoint stand-by disaster response unit composed of\ncontingents drawn from governmental and non-\ngovernmental agencies of both countries, Greece and\nTurkey, to reinforce the United Nations capacity in this\nfield.\nLet me take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt\ncondolences to the victims of the recent disastrous\nearthquake in Taiwan, and to their families.\nA comprehensive and methodical approach to\ndealing with natural disasters is in line with the recent\nstatement by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, that\nsome major risk reduction and disaster prevention\nprogrammes require levels of funding that many poor\ncountries simply cannot afford.\nIn this Assembly, great visions founded on a strong\nsense of realism have helped to make the world more\ndemocratic, safer, and a little less painful for those in\nneed. In Greece and south-east Europe, similar visions are\nhelping to build democratic institutions, cement peace and\npave the way to prosperity. There simply is no truth in\nthe saying that we in the Balkans are trapped, that we\nhave produced more history than we can consume and\nthat we are prisoners of past conflicts and hatreds. History\nis not duress unless one makes it so. The challenge to\nevery new generation of Greeks, and the challenge to our\nneighbours, is to learn from our history, and not to\nbecome slaves to it. We are building a new collective\nvision for the region, slowly but surely. We look forward\nto the day when Belgrade and Pristina will be an easy bus\nride away, when Jerusalem and Damascus, Athens and\nAnkara and, of course, the two parts of divided Nicosia,\nwill no longer be separated by fear and suspicion, but will\nbe joined in peace. Perhaps that day is still far away but,\nas a Chinese proverb has it, a journey of a thousand miles\nbegins with one small step.\nHistory is not compulsion unless one makes it so.\nThe challenge to every new generation of Greeks, the\nchallenge to our neighbours, is to learn from our history\nrather than become slaves to it. We are building a new\ncollective vision for the region, slowly but surely.\nWe look forward to the day when Belgrade and\nPristina will be an easy bus ride away from each other,\nwhen Jerusalem and Damascus, Athens and Ankara and,\nof course, the two parts of divided Nicosia, will no longer\nbe separated by fear and suspicion, but be joined in\npeace. Perhaps that day is still far away, but as a Chinese\nproverb has it, a journey of a thousand miles begins with\none small step.\nThis step we dared take this year. We dared to\nimagine the world at the end of a thousand miles. Rigas\nFereos, a prominent Greek revolutionary, wrote in a\nconstitution for the Balkans more than two centuries ago,\n35\n\n\n\u201cAll should be equal with equal rights without\nprejudice in the Balkans: Christian, Muslim and Jew,\nAlbanian, Slav, Romanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Turk,\nArmenian, from Bosnia to Arabia.\u201d\nToday, 100 days before the next millennium, we\ncommit ourselves to keep walking in this direction of a new\nhope and vision for our world. As they say in Latin\nAmerica, se hace camino al andar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to\nsincerely congratulate Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his\nunanimous election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session and to express\nconfidence that under his skilful leadership the Assembly\nwill cope successfully with the complex issues before it.\nI would like also to commend the President of the\nprevious session of the General Assembly, Mr. Didier\nOpertti, on his remarkable commitment to the success of\nthe session.\nI wish also to congratulate and to welcome the new\nMembers of our Organization \u2014 the Republic of Kiribati,\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\nSpeaking from this lofty rostrum, representatives of\nthe States Members of the United Nations are trying to\ncommunicate to their colleagues and the international\ncommunity the most pressing problems that their\ncountries face. The truth, which is not always pleasant, is\nexpressed here with hope for justice, understanding and\nsupport.\nStates, including the Republic of Azerbaijan, that\nhave regained their freedom and now face threats to their\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, count\non the support of the international community. They are\nalso deeply concerned about the current difficulties of the\nOrganization. Member States look to the United Nations\nwith trust and hope. This places on the Organization an\nimportant responsibility for finding a way out of the\ncurrent complex situation.\nIn this connection, the Republic of Azerbaijan\nactively supports the United Nations reform process,\nwhich our times demand. We believe that a transformed\nOrganization, adapted to modern realities, will be in a\nposition to cope with an increasing number of challenges\nand risks to international peace and security.\nThreats to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nsecurity of the Member States of the United Nations have\nbecome appallingly routine. States often face aggression,\nmilitary occupation, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, separatism and\nterrorism. A conflict that is not dealt with in a timely and\nresolute manner is later transformed into a humanitarian\ndisaster that brings about a very sensitive reaction on the\npart of the international community.\nGiven the resolute action by the international\ncommunity in the Balkans, the situation with regard to the\nunresolved or frozen conflicts in other regions seems\nespecially tragic. We consider it unacceptable to set\npriorities in this respect, and wish to draw the attention of\nthe international community to the intolerable fact that\n15\n\n\none fifth of the territory of a sovereign Member State of the\nUnited Nations \u2014 the Republic of Azerbaijan \u2014 has\ncontinued to be under foreign occupation for more than six\nyears and that, as a result of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, one out of\nseven of its citizens is a refugee or displaced person in his\nown country.\nThe clear trend towards putting up with the behaviour\nof the aggressor and sometimes even conniving at his\nattempts to legalize the situation in the conflict zone, as\nwell as the eagerness of some mediators to reach an easy\nsettlement on the basis that the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of the\nAzerbaijani population and the occupation of its territories\nis a fait accompli, will only lead to continued tension and\nfurther delay the prospects for a settlement of the conflict\nand the restoration of durable peace and stability in the\nregion, based on the norms and principles of international\nlaw.\nThe only valid premise for a lasting settlement of\nconflicts is a timely display of determination and solidarity\nby the international community, first and foremost by the\nUnited Nations, which has primary responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, for the\nprotection and observation of the norms and principles of\ninternational law and for making every effort to secure the\nimplementation of decisions taken.\nLike other countries facing aggression and militant\nseparatism, Azerbaijan rejects settlement models that\ninfringe on its sovereignty, territorial integrity and the unity\nof its State and run counter to its national interests. An\nexample is the concept of the common State, which was\nproposed as a model for settlement in the context of certain\nconflicts, but failed to find the support of the countries\nconcerned. That concept is pernicious, because it attempts\nto distort the notion of statehood and State sovereignty; in\nfact, it is an attempt to provide a legal framework for the\nideology of militant separatism.\nIt goes without saying that an important factor in any\nsettlement is the readiness of the parties involved to find a\ncompromise. At the same time, by definition, compromise\nimplies reciprocity and clear limits. Seeking a realistic\nformula for a compromise based on adherence to the norms\nand principles of international law, taking into account\nnational and State interests, the President of Azerbaijan,\nHeydar Aliyev, has maintained direct contact and held talks\nwith the President of Armenia, Robert Kocharian. It is\nAzerbaijan\u2019s hope that this approach can open new\npossibilities to steer the settlement process out of the\ndeadlock that we have witnessed during the past year.\nIt is now possible to speak about the achievement of\na positive climate, which should be complemented with\nmore active work by the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group, which is\nresponsible for the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan\nconflict, so that the negotiation process can be resumed in\nthe near future. We regard it as absolutely unjustified that\nsome members of the Minsk Group use the fact that there\nare direct contacts between Azerbaijan and Armenia as an\nexcuse for their stepping aside from the process and for\ntheir inactivity. In this connection, we call upon the\nCo-Chairmen of the Minsk Group to make every effort\nnecessary to bring about in the near future a revised\nproposal for the settlement of the conflict that would\nrepresent an acceptable combination of elements.\nIt will be necessary effectively to use the time\nremaining before the OSCE summit in Istanbul in order\nto come closer to achieving concrete results. It is\nextremely important that the consistency and\ndetermination of the international community be\nmaintained in advocating its declared positions on the\nsettlement of the conflict between Armenia and\nAzerbaijan. We believe, in particular, that the sequence of\nsteps provided for in the Security Council resolutions on\nthe conflict continues to be optimal.\nAzerbaijan reaffirms its commitment to a peaceful\nsettlement and unconditional implementation of the\nceasefire until a political agreement on the cessation of\nthe conflict is concluded. Guided by a spirit of goodwill\nand a sincere desire to reach progress in the settlement\nprocess, on 18 September 1999, during the visit of Knut\nVollebaek, the Chairman-in-office of the OSCE, the\nPresident of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, announced the\nunilateral release of all Armenian prisoners of war held in\nAzerbaijan. We expect an adequate reaction from the\nArmenian side in the near future.\nAzerbaijan supports the reform process in the\nOrganization, based on the proposals of the\nSecretary-General and the decisions of the General\nAssembly. Reform of the Security Council continues to\nbe the priority problem. Azerbaijan fully agrees with the\napproach reflected in resolution 53/30, in accordance with\nwhich any decisions on this issue would require the\npositive vote of a minimum of two thirds of the Member\nStates.\nWe still believe that the representation of the States\nof Asia, Africa and Latin America in all membership\ncategories of the Security Council should reflect modern\n16\n\n\npolitical realities. Azerbaijan reconfirms its support for the\nelection of Germany and Japan as permanent members of\nthe Security Council. We continue to believe that, together\nwith that, objective reality calls for the allocation of one\nadditional non-permanent seat to the Eastern European\nGroup.\nWith regard to the reform and strengthening of the\neffectiveness of the work of the Security Council, I cannot\nfail to draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact that\nthe four resolutions adopted by the Security Council on the\nArmenia-Azerbaijan conflict, resolutions 822 (1993), 853\n(1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993), have still not been\nimplemented. We believe that the lack of an adequate\nreaction to the violation of the principles of the United\nNations Charter and the non-compliance with decisions\nadopted within the United Nations is seriously undermining\nthe image of the world Organization.\nAzerbaijan welcomes the increased attention of the\nSecurity Council to acute humanitarian problems in conflict\nsituations, and supports the inclusion in the mandate of\npeacekeeping forces of concrete and adequate provisions for\nthe demilitarization of conflict zones and the disarmament\nof combatants, as well as of special provisions on the\nprotection of and support for the civilian population,\nincluding women and children.\nIllegal arms transfers to conflict zones make the\nprospects for settlement more remote and aggravate\nhumanitarian disasters. Recently this has become a pressing\nproblem which requires special attention and specific joint\naction by the international community. In this context,\nbreaches of the relevant provisions of Security Council\nresolutions, especially by some of the Council\u2019s own\nmembers, are unacceptable. Azerbaijan supports convening\nan international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its\naspects not later than 2001.\nWe attach great importance to the timely convening of\na fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted\nto disarmament, which could determine the future course of\naction in the field of disarmament, arms control and related\ninternational security matters.\nAzerbaijan stands by the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer\nof Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, and\nwelcomes its entry into force; we welcome also the\noutcome of the First Meeting of States Parties, held in\nMaputo. A national agency in this sphere has been created\nin Azerbaijan; it has begun its activities and has started to\nestablish cooperation with its international counterparts.\nAzerbaijan\u2019s formal accession to the Convention is\ndirectly dependent on the issue of the continuing\noccupation of its territory by Armenia.\nAzerbaijan has a highly positive view of the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, and\nsupports the work of the Preparatory Commission for the\nInternational Criminal Court on a number of provisions of\nits Statute. We regard as very important the work being\ndone by the Commission to define the crime of\naggression, and believe that the definition should be clear\nand viable, and that it should make provision for a norm\nestablishing personal criminal responsibility. As a victim\nof aggression, Azerbaijan maintains that the Court should\nbecome an effective organ for the prosecution of those\nwho commit crimes against humanity.\nMy country is interested in taking an active part in\ncombatting international terrorism, organized crime and\nillegal drug trafficking. The fight against these evils can\nbe effective only if it is based on joint efforts by all\ncountries, at both the regional and the global levels. We\nsupport the idea of convening in 2000 an anti-terrorist\nconference or a special session of the General Assembly\non this issue, and the elaboration of a declaration of\nprinciples on the interaction of States in combatting\nterrorism. We hope that the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) will be able to mobilize additional\nresources to continue the joint project on drug-abuse\ncontrol of the UNDP, the United Nations International\nDrug Control Programme and the Government of\nAzerbaijan.\nAnother emerging topical area of activities is the\nprovision of humanitarian relief assistance in emergency\nsituations and periods of natural disasters, such as those\nthat we have witnessed in recent months. In this\nconnection, Azerbaijan calls for increased assistance to\nthe victims of the tragic earthquake in brotherly Turkey,\nwhich claimed thousands of human lives.\nDespite the objective difficulties caused by the\narmed conflict and the transitional period, Azerbaijan\nbelieves that there is no alternative to its chosen course of\nreform aimed at building a democratic society with a\nmarket economy. As a State located at a key point\nbetween Europe and Asia, Azerbaijan is keenly interested\nin securing access to trans-European and trans-Asian\ncommunication networks; this would facilitate the\ndevelopment of industrial and trade links among\nparticipating countries, improved access to markets,\n17\n\n\nincreased integration links, and closer cooperation among\nthe economies of European and Asian countries.\nUnfortunately, the process of the profound\ntransformation of the national economy is facing the serious\nconsequences of the presence in the country of 1 million\nrefugees and internally displaced persons. Coping with this\nemergency situation has been a primary concern of the\nAzerbaijan State for many years. Given the limited financial\nresources of our State, humanitarian assistance from the\nUnited Nations and other international organizations is a\nnecessary element not only of the physical, but also of the\nmoral survival of people who have lost their homes. We\nwould like to express our most sincere gratitude to the\nUnited Nations, to the relevant United Nations agencies and\nto donor countries providing humanitarian assistance to\nAzerbaijan, and we call upon them not to reduce the\nvolume of that assistance.\nAllow me to touch briefly upon the role that the\nUnited Nations and its agencies are playing in Azerbaijan.\nAt the last session, I spoke about the constructive work\nbeing done with respect to the social and economic\ndevelopment of our country by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme. The UNDP is actively assisting\nthe Government of Azerbaijan and bilateral and multilateral\nhumanitarian organizations in addressing development\nissues. At the same time, my Government is deeply\nconcerned at the fact that UNDP is entering the new\nmillennium with an extremely decreased financial base. We\nall need a UNDP able to cope with the development\nproblems that we are not in a position to solve alone. All\nparticipants in this process \u2014 donors and recipients of\nassistance \u2014 should provide sincere and solid support to\nthe development activities of the United Nations.\nIn this context, I would like to call upon all concerned\nto improve significantly the very difficult current financial\nsituation of the Organization.\nWith reference to relations between my country and\nthe United Nations in general, I would like again to draw\nattention to the fact that Azerbaijan is still not represented\nin the United Nations Secretariat.\nThe world is tired of crises and wars. Mankind\ndeserves a peaceful, prosperous and happy new millennium.\nOur Organization is designed to play a leading role in\novercoming obstacles to global peace and progress. It must\nbe in a position to implement that noble mission. This is\nnot an abstract desire, but a realistic task based on an\nassessment of the situation and an awareness of both\nneeds and possibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow\nme first to congratulate the President most sincerely on\nhis election to the presidency of the fifty\u2014fourth session\nof the General Assembly. I take this opportunity to assure\nhim of the full support of the Hungarian delegation in the\nexercise of his responsibilities as the head of our\nAssembly.\nHumanity has reached the threshold of the\ntwenty\u2014first century. Therefore, no Member State can\nremain indifferent to the way in which we discharge our\ntasks at this session, held as the twentieth century ends.\nOne of the most urgent tasks of States and\ninternational organizations at the turn of the century is to\nend the ever\u2014growing disparities between the various\nregions of the world. In this regard, special attention\n27\n\n\nshould be paid to the African continent, which is fraught\nwith various crises and conflicts.\nThe persistence of poverty, still one of our major\nchallenges, is exacerbated by the process of globalization.\nInequality is a major source of the emergence and\nproliferation of all kinds of extremism and of intolerance,\nwith its concomitant violence, which threaten the very\nfoundations of contemporary civilization.\nAt the dawn of this new century, we are called upon\nto exploit further the advantages of globalization, a salient\nfeature of our era, while being aware of the attendant risks.\nAll of us in the international community must become\naware of the paramount importance of dealing adequately\nwith global problems, such as the growing gap between the\nlevels of economic development; environmental\ndegradation; the dangers posed by organized crime;\nuncontrolled migration; disease and so on.\nIn this context, we must take note of the relationship\nbetween globalization and regional integration. Integration\ncan adjust itself to the process of globalization, draw the\nlessons of the process's inevitable consequences, absorb its\nrelated risks and assist the struggle against transboundary\nscourges, thereby becoming the engine of the universal\nsystem of economic cooperation.\nMost conflicts today are not between States, but within\nStates, essentially as major ethnic or religious\nconfrontations that too often lead to humanitarian crises of\nunprecedented dimensions. Entire ethnic groups and\ncommunities and national and linguistic minorities are\nfalling victim to \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d. Dictatorial regimes do\nnot hesitate to resort to nationalist extremism and\nxenophobia, and to unspeakable violence, exterminating\nhundreds of thousands of people, terrorizing others in their\nancestral lands and expelling millions of people from their\nhomes. We cannot remain indifferent to such acts.\nA great debate is therefore going on in the\ninternational arena, as demonstrated in this very Hall, about\nhow the world should react to tragic situations involving\nmassive and flagrant violations of human rights at a time\nwhen, for all kinds of reasons, our world Organization finds\nitself paralysed. We are convinced that, given the terrible\nupheavals we are witnessing throughout the world, the\ninternational community cannot fail to respond effectively\nto this major present-day challenge.\nThe traditional concept of the principle of national\nsovereignty is undergoing a progressive evolution in inter-\nState relations and within multilateral organizations.\nBecause of developments in the area of international law,\nnational sovereignty is becoming less acceptable as a\njustification for Governments in cases of serious\nviolations within their countries of universally recognized\ninternational legal standards. As the Secretary-General\nrightly said, in our era of globalization the collective\ninterest represents national interests. Fortunately, today\nthe principles of good governance are prevailing and\nflourishing in an ever-growing number of countries.\nIn the immediate vicinity of my country, a regime\nbased on extreme nationalism has sparked four wars in\nthe last decade. The international community, albeit after\nhesitation and delay, took the necessary measures. In the\ncase of Kosovo, it did so with great resolve and\nconsistency. In the wake of the action undertaken to\ndefend universally recognized values, and thanks to the\npresence of international military forces and the United\nNations mission, a fragile peace reigns today in that\nmartyred region, and considerable, increasingly effective\nefforts are being deployed there with a view to establish\npeace and stability.\nIn the light of the events of the past decade in this\npart of Europe, let us state clearly and unambiguously\nthat it would be pointless to expect democratization in the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia if things remain\nunchanged in Belgrade. However, a new Serbia, emerging\nfrom tragedy and destruction, free of the burdens of the\npast, would no doubt be able to rely on the understanding\nand effective assistance of the international community.\nIn this context, we would underscore the importance of\nthe implementation of the judgments of the International\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The Stability Pact,\ndevised with a view to responding to the needs of the\ncountries of South-Eastern Europe, will play a primary\nrole in the rehabilitation and development of the region.\nIt will also contribute to promoting respect for democratic\nstandards and human rights by proposing, inter alia,\ninstitutional arrangements aimed at improving relations\nbetween majority and minority communities within the\nregion.\nThe international community is again being put to\nthe test in the case of East Timor. Hungary shares the\nprofound concerns of all nations in the wake of recent\nevents, which represent a brutal violation of the right of\nthe people of that country to self-determination. The\natrocities committed against the civilian population of\nEast Timor represent a serious blow to human rights.\nThose responsible for these acts will be brought to justice.\n28\n\n\nWe welcome the decision of the Security Council\nauthorizing the deployment to East Timor of a multinational\nforce to restore peace and security on the island as well as\nthe enactment of all necessary measures for the\nimplementation of that force's mandate.\nThe tragic events in Kosovo and East Timor only\nconfirm the universality of human rights and the importance\nof a timely resolution of conflict by appropriate means.\nThey also demonstrate the value of harmonious cooperation\nbetween the United Nations, regional organizations and\nparticular groups of States, a cooperation that is becoming\nincreasingly important in dealing with the diverse and\nvaried conflicts that are erupting \u2014 and, unfortunately, will\ncontinue to erupt \u2014 throughout the world. Hungary is\nprepared, with its own means, to take part in this great\nenterprise of safeguarding and restoring international peace\nand security.\nAmong the phenomena that threaten peace and\nsecurity throughout the world, the question of the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction will require\nsustained attention in future. Regional conflicts having\nnuclear ramifications only aggravate the destabilizing effect\nof certain crisis areas.\nAgainst this backdrop, the pillars of the global non-\nproliferation system \u2014 such as the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, whose Review\nConference will be one of the major events on next year's\ndiplomatic calendar, or the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty (CTBT) \u2014 take on additional significance. We\nregret that the CTBT has not yet been able to exert its\nfavourable influence on the process of nuclear disarmament\nand non-proliferation. We would like here to underscore the\nresponsibility of the 44 States whose ratification is needed\nfor this key instrument to enter into force. My country, as\none of the States in question, has already ratified the Treaty\nand thereby discharged its obligations. The international\nconference to be convened next October in Vienna is likely\nto play an important role in speeding up the process leading\nto the entry into force of this instrument. We would be\ngratified if those States that have not yet acceded to the\nTreaty participated in that conference and decided, in the\nnear future, to sign and ratify the Treaty.\nWe would underscore also the need to commence, as\nsoon as possible, negotiations on a fissile material cut-off\ntreaty. The entry into force of the Ottawa Convention on\nanti-personnel mines could contribute tangibly to resolving\nthe humanitarian, economic and social problems stemming\nfrom the massive and irresponsible use of these mines. In\nthat connection, we note with satisfaction the outcome of\nthe Maputo meeting. Hungary was one of the first\ncountries to join the Ottawa process and recently\ncompleted the destruction of its stocks of anti-personnel\nmines. We hope that other countries in the region will\nfollow our example, as this could contribute to the\nelimination of all of these lethal devices in the crisis area\nalong our southern border.\nWe would also note the importance of speeding up\nnegotiations to conclude a verification protocol annexed\nto the Biological Weapons Convention. We believe that\nthese negotiations could be completed sometime between\nnow and next summer. As Chairman of the ad hoc Group\nmandated to draft a verification protocol, Hungary is\nprepared to contribute to any political initiative that could\npromote its implementation.\nI cannot fail to mention the establishment of an\nInternational Criminal Court \u2014 a deeply significant\nundertaking. In our view, the Court is an indispensable\ninstitution if we are to take action against crimes against\nhumanity and war crimes. The Court will not only bring\nto justice people who have been accused of serious\ncrimes, but will also act as a deterrent, thereby\ncontributing to the maintenance of regional and\ninternational peace and security. We hope that the number\nof signatures and ratifications of the Rome Statute will\ncontinue to grow and that disputed questions relating to\nthe universal acceptance of the Court will be resolved as\nsoon as possible.\nActs of terrorism in recent weeks sadly remind us of\nthe great challenge involved in combating this\nphenomenon. They underscore the importance of making\nnew efforts and the imperative need for concerted\ninternational action in this area. We hope that at this\nsession of the General Assembly we will be able to go\nbeyond the universal introduction and complete\nimplementation of international agreements relating to\nterrorism that are already in force, and move forward the\nwork of finalizing international agreements relating to\nnuclear terrorism and the prevention of financing for\nterrorism.\nThe authority and prestige of the United Nations\ndepend to a large extent on the capacity of its Member\nStates to reform the Organization. In the light of the\nexperience of recent years, it is very clear that reform is\na long-term process and will be probably consist of\nvarious interconnected stages. The achievements thus far,\nthough insufficient in themselves, are valuable elements\n29\n\n\nthat must be built upon if we are to go further along this\nlong road leading to the transformation and revitalization of\nthe world Organization, including the reform of the Security\nCouncil. What is certain is that if we are to succeed, all\nMember States, without exception, will have to get to work\nwith a greater sense of commitment. We expect the\nmillennium summit, to be held next year, to give the\nnecessary impetus to the dynamic continuation of United\nNations reform.\nAs has been repeated on many occasions, our\nparamount task today is to make this unique Organization,\nthe United Nations, capable of preserving the values of our\ncivilization in a twenty-first century that promises to be\nturbulent. At the dawn of the year 2000, which also marks\nthe thousandth anniversary of the foundation of our State,\nit is up to all of us \u2014 Governments, the business world and\ncivil society \u2014 to make our planet a decent and habitable\nplace for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to\ncongratulate the President heartily on his election. His post\nis a challenging one, and I am particularly pleased that this\nsession is being chaired by a colleague from Namibia,\nwhich is an important partner for my country.\nThe crucial role of the United Nations in the global\ncommunity can never be overstated. As this millennium\ndraws to a close, it is natural to take stock of the past and\ntry to foresee what the future holds in store. The\nOrganization's reform measures have included an inward\nlook at the organizational structure and personnel matters\nand, last but not least, its financial make-up. In this respect,\nmany feel that more needs to be done. We must have the\ncourage to scrutinize not only the Organization itself, but\nalso the manner in which the Member States conduct their\nbusiness inside these walls. While we are going through\nthis process, the utmost care should be taken to prevent the\ndiscussion from negatively affecting the public image of the\nOrganization. Moreover, we should make sure that it does\nnot have detrimental effects on the morale of the United\nNations international staff, whom we depend upon for the\nsmooth operation of the difficult and often dangerous tasks\nwe assign to them. A constructive approach to reform is\nvital for the future of the United Nations.\nThere is a real need to strengthen the ability of the\nUnited Nations to tackle the complex challenges of the\nmodern world. A case in point is the Working Group on\nthe reform of the Security Council, which has deliberated\nfor years without tangible results, with no end in sight.\nThis constant repetition can serve only to weaken the\nUnited Nations, which has proved itself on many\noccasions to be of fundamental importance to mankind.\nBut it is not only the organizational structures that\nneed to be adapted. We need also to look at the\nsubstance. In this regard, I welcome the emphasis placed\nby the Secretary-General in his recent report on creating\na culture of prevention. As he correctly points out, our\npolitical and organizational cultures and practices remain\noriented far more towards reaction than prevention. This\nneeds to be changed; the efficiency of the United Nations\nmight thereby be greatly enhanced.\nDuring a recent meeting of the Foreign Ministers of\nthe five Nordic countries held in Iceland, we issued a\njoint declaration against the use of child soldiers. In the\ndeclaration it is noted that the current protection of\nchildren in armed conflicts is insufficient and that\ninternational standards must be raised. On the occasion of\nthe tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child this year, the Nordic Ministers support the\nurgent finalization of an optional protocol to ensure that\npersons below the age of 18 years are not recruited into\narmed forces or into armed groups distinct from\ngovernmental forces. Children should not be forced to\ntake part in hostilities under any circumstances.\nIn this regard, I would like to express my\nsatisfaction with the work carried out by the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children and\nArmed Conflict, especially for his efforts to make non-\ngovernmental forces around the world refrain from using\nchild soldiers.\nThe vast majority of United Nations Member States\nhave ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nWe have committed ourselves to certain actions to\npromote children's rights. Causing children to take part in\narmed conflicts or otherwise putting them at risk of\nbecoming victims of such hostilities is clearly against the\nbest interests of the child, which should always be our\nprimary consideration. There is another powerful reason\nto protect children: they are our future. Protecting today's\nchildren is in itself an important contribution towards\npeace and towards creating a culture of prevention. We\nshould also strive to ensure that children are able to enjoy\ntheir rights during transitional periods following armed\n30\n\n\nconflicts or other emergency situations until enough\nstability has been achieved to start reconstruction.\nIt seems that not a week goes by in our world without\ncountries and indeed the international community having to\nwatch in horror as cowardly terrorists target people going\nabout the business of their everyday lives. The murdering\nof innocents will never further any cause or put an end to\nany conflict; it will only add names to the roster of the\ndead. We urge States to sign and ratify counter-terrorism\nconventions.\nIn this connection, I would further like to reiterate our\nresolve in combatting transnational crime and the\ninternational trade in drugs. No country is immune from\nthese modern evils. Given their global scope and the\nresources available to criminals, Governments the world\nover must work together to put an end to these activities.\nThis year we have recognized the importance of the\nelderly and their contributions to our lives and society by\nobserving 1999 as the International Year of Older Persons.\nThe Icelandic authorities have done their utmost to enhance\nthe visibility of issues facing the elderly in today's society.\nThis has been done through a number of projects, including\nprojects designed to bridge the generation gap by\nencouraging interaction between age groups.\nAt a time of unparalleled economic growth spurred on\nby the globalization of the world's economy, the fruits of\nthis growth, unfortunately, are not evenly distributed. We\nare witnessing a growing gap in the distribution of wealth\nwithin societies as well as between the North and the\nSouth. Moreover, we have been witnessing an appalling\ntrend whereby the curse of poverty has increasingly been\nfalling upon the shoulders of women. There are no easy\nanswers on how to tackle this problem in the short term,\nbut two long-term approaches stand out regarding the\nempowerment and advancement of women. They are\neducation and respect for human rights.\nAn educated woman passes knowledge to her children,\nwhich is not as often the case with men. It is universally\naccepted that education and social development go hand in\nhand and are conditions for a peaceful and prosperous\nworld. In this age of globalization and technology, it\nbecomes ever more important to ensure universal education.\nTherefore, it is crucial to incorporate education into\ndevelopment projects. For the past few years we have been\ndoing that through training in the fisheries sector as well as\nby conducting adult literacy programmes for women in\ncountries such as Namibia. Similar programmes are being\nprepared for Malawi and Mozambique.\nVigorous efforts also have to be made to end other\nforms of discrimination against women. This applies not\nonly at the national level but also at the international\nlevel, where the actions of international organizations are\nincreasingly having a direct impact on peoples' lives, for\nexample through crisis management. When carrying out\nsuch tasks, it is the duty of the organizations concerned\nto ensure that women and their interests are represented\nat the negotiating table.\nDuring the high-level segment of this year's session\nof the Economic and Social Council, the Icelandic\ndelegation paid special attention to the plight of the urban\npoor who inhabit coastal regions around the world.\nToday, my country, Iceland, has a thriving economy\nbased on our fishing industry. The development of a\nviable fishing industry has strengthened the economy by\ncreating employment opportunities and prosperity, which\nin turn have benefitted the population at large. It is self-\nevident that a developed fisheries sector can be a crucial\nfactor in enhancing the food security of developing\ncountries. The Icelandic authorities have urged private\ncompanies to invest in the fisheries sectors of many\ndeveloping countries. Partnerships forged in this manner\nbetween firms in my country and a number of developing\ncountries have led to transfer of technology in this field,\nthereby spurring economic growth and development in the\ncoastal regions in question.\nWe believe that many developing countries can\nbenefit much more from rational utilization of the\nresources of the oceans. Therefore, approximately half of\nour development cooperation has been concentrated on\nresearch and training in the fisheries sector, putting an\nemphasis on the sustainable utilization of natural\nresources.\nThrough the years, Iceland has placed particular\nimportance on the work of the Commission on\nSustainable Development. During its seventh session,\nearlier this year, the Icelandic Government noted the\nnecessity of abolishing State subsidies that contribute to\novercapacity in the fisheries sector worldwide, and\nparticipated actively in discussions on the need for\nimproved coordination within the United Nations system\nin the field of ocean affairs. It is our view that the overall\ndebate on the oceans can be improved. It is, however, our\nfirm belief that efforts to improve the handling of ocean\nissues should draw upon existing institutional resources.\n31\n\n\nThese efforts should also carefully take into account the\nprinciple that global bodies should not try to solve local or\nregional problems of fisheries management. The\nmanagement of living marine resources is a very complex\nand sensitive task that has to be dealt with using the most\nadvanced scientific knowledge available and in harmony\nwith local socio-economic and environmental\ncircumstances.\nConflicts where the civilian population is expressly\ntargeted are abhorrent and leave scars that take generations\nto heal. Once again, we have witnessed the emergence of\nthe dark and evil side of human nature in the horrible\nethnic cleansing that took place in the recent conflict in\nKosovo. It would have been desirable if the United Nations\ncould have played an all-encompassing role in the\nsettlement of that conflict.\nIn this regard, I would like to endorse the position put\nforward on humanitarian intervention by the Secretary-\nGeneral. When a State not only stops protecting the rights\nof its citizens but turns against them through gross\nviolations of human rights, the international community\ncannot and should not stand idly by.\nIceland currently holds the chair of the Council of\nEurope, which encompasses 41 European countries. I would\nlike to take this opportunity to stress the value and\nimportance of close cooperation between the Council and\nthe United Nations in the field of human rights. We have\nrecent examples of such practical cooperation in Kosovo,\nwhere the Council of Europe is working together with the\nUnited Nations and other organizations in fulfilment of\nSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the European\nUnion-led Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe.\nReferring again to the benefits of prevention, I should say\nthat prevention is at the very centre of the Council of\nEurope's work on human rights, democracy and the rule of\nlaw.\nThe agreement between Portugal and Indonesia on the\nfuture of East Timor was historic, as was the referendum\nwhich took place. The appalling violence that followed is\na cause of great concern. Every effort has to be made to\nhalt it and to punish those responsible. My Government\nfully supports Security Council resolution 1264 (1999) and\nwelcomes the speedy deployment of the multinational force.\nNothing should be allowed to delay the process towards the\nindependence of East Timor.\nWe welcome also the change of pace in the Middle\nEast peace process. The positive developments in the last\nfew months between the Israelis and the Palestinians have\nbeen very encouraging, and we sincerely hope that this\nrenewed momentum will carry us towards a lasting peace\nin the region. We urge other countries in the region to\nseize this particular moment and to start the healing of\nwounds that have been festering for so long.\nIcelanders are no strangers to natural disasters, and\nwe know the devastation they can unleash upon countries\nand peoples. Our hearts and sympathy go out to our\nfriends in Turkey, Greece and now, most recently, on the\nisland of Taiwan, who face the aftermath of earthquakes\nthat claimed the lives of a great number of people. We\nhave now decided to join the United Nations Disaster\nAssessment and Coordination Stand-by Team because we\nbelieve we can make a contribution.\nDuring this century we have witnessed mankind's\ngreatest achievements as well as its greatest failures.\nWhile many countries have gone from war to peace and\nfrom poverty to prosperity, others have been unable to\ngrasp these often elusive goals of humanity. It is clear\nthat we will be entering the new millennium with\nunsolved problems and with challenges of such a\nmagnitude that they will continue to confront us into an\nunforeseen future.\nI would like, in closing, to stress what I said in the\nbeginning \u2014 that only with a renewed and revitalized\nUnited Nations can we hope to deal with the threats and\nchallenges that lie ahead. If we, the Member States,\nshoulder our responsibilities and implement the changes\nnecessary, then the United Nations will always be at the\nforefront of the quest for peace and prosperity. If we do\nnot have the courage to adopt the necessary changes, we\ncannot expect our children to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "This is the sixth time that I have had the\nhonour to address the General Assembly, and it is a great\npleasure for me to be back here in this body.\nI would, at the outset, like to congratulate Mr.\nGurirab warmly on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Both\nLiechtenstein and Namibia figure among the younger\nMembers of this Organization, since both our countries\nwere admitted to the United Nations in 1990. The\n32\n\n\nPresident can count on Liechtenstein's support as he guides\nthe Assembly to fruitful outcomes.\nI would also like to extend our warm welcome to the\nKingdom of Tonga, the Republic of Kiribati and the\nRepublic of Nauru.\nThe general debate is an important opportunity for all\nof us to take stock, to comment on the state of the\nOrganization, to voice our concerns and, if necessary,\ndissatisfaction and, most important, to offer constructive\nthoughts and ideas for the future.\nAt the time when Liechtenstein became a Member of\nthe United Nations, nine years ago, the cold war had just\ncome to an end, and we tried to identify the challenges and\nopportunities created by the new situation. The hopes and\nexpectations were high, the concerns and problems\nmanifold. It was clear to many of us that our Organization\nwas not fully equipped to face the upcoming challenges,\nand, indeed, mistakes have happened along the way.\nToday, we can say that the somewhat perverse order\nof the cold war has been replaced by the era of\nglobalization. Some of us welcome this new era, some of\nus fear it. However different our opinions, there can and\nshould be one common denominator: that we acknowledge\nthe arrival of this new era and that we join our forces to\nface its challenges.\nGlobalization has two faces: it offers a potential, from\nwhich \u2014 if properly explored \u2014 mankind as a whole can\nbenefit. It also contains risks, especially for those who are\nalready in a perilous position.\nIn order to be able to face these two enormous tasks\nefficiently, we have to work together, because that is the\nonly way for us to succeed. The United Nations is the sole\nforum that is of truly global range, and thus it offers the\nonly opportunity for us to address these issues \u2014 assuming\nwe are equipped with the right tools.\nThe past years have been characterized by important\nand far-reaching reform efforts. The challenges of\nglobalization make further measures necessary, such as the\nenhanced inclusion, participation and accountability of non-\nState actors. In a globalized world, such actors play\nincreasingly influential roles, both positive and negative.\nPersons and organizations that constitute significant\neconomic forces have to be involved in our considerations\nand decision-making processes. Actors such as terrorists\nand parties to internal armed conflicts have to be held\naccountable for their actions and for the consequences\nthereof.\nThe public at large often mistakenly equates the\nUnited Nations with the work of only the Security\nCouncil. This is factually wrong, and we should use every\nopportunity to inform people worldwide about the wide\nrange of activities carried out by our Organization and its\nspecialized agencies. But we also have to bear in mind\nthe immense importance of the work of the Council and\nmust have a certain appreciation of why the public\nfocuses only on the Council's work, erroneous as this\napproach may be. It is simply a fact that the credibility of\nthe United Nations depends to a very large extent on the\ncredibility of the work of the Security Council. This\ncredibility has suffered serious blows in the recent past,\nand we cannot afford to ignore the root causes of the\nproblem.\nWe have to address the existing problems and to\ndesign ways and means to avoid further, perhaps\nirreversible, damage. Strict observance of the key\nprovisions of the Charter is one essential element in this\nrespect, and reform of the Security Council is another.\nFor a long time we have talked about all aspects of such\na reform, including the composition of the Council. The\nmoment has come for us to recognize that the question of\nthe veto is at the core of every credible and sustainable\nSecurity Council reform.\nMy country has long expressed concern about the\nsituation in Kosovo and has asked for preventive efforts\nin order to avoid an escalation of this situation. In\nsolidarity with the victims and wanting to take some\nresponsibility for them, Liechtenstein has given temporary\nshelter to a large number of Kosovar refugees, has\nparticipated in the provision of humanitarian assistance,\nin particular through the relevant United Nations agencies,\nand has expressed full support to the United Nations\nMission in Kosovo and to the ongoing efforts of\nreconstruction.\nAt the same time, we also have questions, and we\nnotice that others do too. How can we reconcile the role\ngiven to the Security Council under the Charter of the\nUnited Nations with a \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d not\nmandated by the Council? What does this mean for the\nfuture of the Security Council and of the Organization as\na whole? Are regional organizations to assume a leading\nrole that goes beyond what is contained in Chapter VIII\nof the Charter? It will be important to discuss these\n33\n\n\nquestions, though finding satisfactory answers is certainly\ndifficult.\nTo our mind, Kosovo has made it very clear once\nmore that the prevention of conflicts must be the key\nconcept in conflict-resolution as well as in other areas.\nPreventive measures are the best means of saving lives and\nresources of every kind, and they can be carried out quickly\nand with discretion. Prevention does not make big news\nheadlines, but it reduces the number of headlines on\ndisasters, of which we continue to see just too many. The\npotential of prevention is enormous, but its application so\nfar is too modest and far too limited.\nWe know that there is still reluctance and hesitation,\nbut we feel a sense of urgency, a pressing need to enhance\npreventive activities and to replace a classical concept of\nsovereignty \u2014 a concept that is outdated in many aspects\n\u2014 with a new one which enables us to tackle situations of\npotential and actual crisis with determination and efficiency.\nWe thus welcome the report of the Secretary-General on\nthe work of the Organization and his very inspiring and\ntimely remarks on a \u201cculture of prevention\u201d. We are\nconvinced that this is the right way for the international\ncommunity to go.\nKosovo has been and somewhat sadly remains a prime\nexample of the need for prevention. Liechtenstein has for\nseveral years now promoted ideas and suggestions on a\npreventive approach with regard to problems arising from\nthe application of the right of self-determination. The\ninternational community remains stuck in a situation in\nwhich the exercise of the right of self-determination \u2014\nwhich is the prerequisite for the enjoyment of all human\nrights \u2014 is denied because it is misunderstood as a claim\nto independence and statehood. We all have known for very\nlong, since the adoption by the General Assembly of the\nFriendly Relations Declaration in 1970, that this is not\ncorrect. Self-determination can mean many other things, if\nexercised in a flexible manner and based on a dialogue\nbetween the parties concerned. It does not have to lead to\nthe break-up of States; it should rather facilitate the\npeaceful coexistence of States and communities which are\nprovided a degree of self-administration or self-governance\nas an expression of their right of self-determination.\nIt is time to free ourselves from biased and obsolete\nthinking and to recognize that the effective application and\nexercise of the right of self-determination is the basis for\npreventing violent disintegration of States as well as\ninternal armed conflicts with all their gruesome aspects and\nendless human suffering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First, I\nwish to express my very great pleasure at speaking for the\nfirst time in this world forum as head of State and at\ngreeting its members on behalf of the people of Venezuela\nand my Government, and particularly at speaking at this\nsession of the General Assembly, the last of this century\nand millennium, which, for us, adds special meaning to\nthe event.\nMy presence here also affords me an opportunity to\nexpress some ideas on the times and circumstances in\nwhich we are now living, all of us worldwide but also,\nand a little more specifically, about times and\ncircumstances in my own country. These are times and\ncircumstances, Mr. President and members, which of\ncourse we share with you.\nA few years ago, when the Berlin Wall fell, I think\nsomeone said that peace had broken out. I truly believe\nthat that expression covers a series of phenomena which\nbegan to surface at that time and subsequently evolved\nand developed to become part of the global scenario. In\nmy view, this rapid emergence of phenomena,\nsimultaneously all round the world, each of them with so\nmany distinguishing characteristics, has made it more\ndifficult to understand, appreciate and realistically\nperceive what is actually happening in the world today.\nMany analysts of that time spoke of quantum leaps.\nI believe that a quantum leap is indeed under way; there\nis an ongoing process of universal change, mutation even.\nI also believe that we must sharpen our ability to analyse\nand observe this phenomenon \u2014 open conflicts, resurgent\nnationalisms, racial and religious conflicts \u2014 which are\noccurring in a world that is undergoing processes of\nfusion while at the same time undergoing dangerous and\nalarming processes of fission. We are entering the new\n\n\ncentury with these signs around us which at one and the\nsame time are cause for concern and reason for optimism\nat the changes unfolding. Actually, there are many\npraiseworthy things about the century that is closing, but\nthere are also many things worthy of condemnation and\nfrom which we should learn our lesson so that they do not\nrecur.\nWithin that process of universal change, there is a\ncountry small in size, a nearby country \u2014 Venezuela \u2014\nthat faces its own changes; a country that is undertaking its\nown irrevocable and necessary changes; a country that is\nbeing reborn from its own ashes; a country that is once\nagain raising the flag of true, authentic democracy. I shall\nspeak a few words here about that country, my country, our\ncountry, your country: Venezuela. Venezuela, blessed by\nthe hand of God; Venezuela, in the very north with an\noutstanding geographic location; Venezuela, full of\nincalculable natural wealth; Venezuela, which has one of\nthe world\u2019s largest oil reserves and mineral resources of all\nkinds, such as gold, diamonds, bauxite and iron ore;\nVenezuela, which has water; Venezuela, which has fertile\nsoil; Venezuela, which has scarcely 20 million inhabitants\nfor almost 1 million square kilometres. But 80 per cent of\nthe inhabitants of this wealth-filled country are poor.\nFor many years it was said of Venezuela that it was a\nmodel of democracy in the world and in Latin America.\nHowever, today it is undergoing a process of profound\nchange, a crisis unprecedented in our history \u2014 a moral\ncrisis, an economic crisis, a political crisis, a social\ncrisis \u2014 which has brought it to dangerous extremes, with\nexplosive forces that have been building for decades.\nEven so, in Venezuela we have found a peaceful way\nout of the morass, the tragedy. We have discovered a way\nthat is fully democratic. We have encouraged changes in\nVenezuela towards respect for human rights, as is right and\nproper, because, however tragic the situation, however\nurgent the need for change, never, in our view, should\nhuman rights, respect for freedom of expression, respect for\nthe intrinsic values of the individual, respect for freedom of\nthe press and respect for freedom of thought be set aside.\nThe Venezuelan people has arisen from its own ashes.\nI should also like to add \u2014 and you, Mr. President,\nand members undoubtedly know this \u2014 that the\nVenezuelan people is a people with a great historical\nlegacy: it is the birthplace of Sim\u00f3n Bol'var, the Liberator,\none of the greats of the millennium. Venezuela carries in its\nessence the seed of democracy, of fraternity and solidarity.\nWe must therefore acknowledge the ability of Venezuelan\npeople, which we represent here in this Assembly, to find\npeaceful and democratic solutions to a profound crisis\nwhich in other places and other eras, would have given\nrise to the violent and regrettable acts that have\nsubmerged many peoples in fratricidal conflict for years\nand even decades at a time.\nWe know that the world has had a great deal of\nnews about Venezuela in recent months, some of it a little\ndisturbing as a result of the confusion and speed of the\nchanges. I thank representatives for allowing me a few\nminutes to take the opportunity to assure the entire world\nthat in Venezuela there was respect, is respect and will\ncontinue to be respect for a democratic process which\nemanates from the will of the people. For example, last\nDecember there were elections in Venezuela, which\nproduced a positive result for democracy. We won the\nelections with almost 60 per cent of the popular vote.\nSubsequently, on 2 February this year, the very day\nthat we arrived at the Government Palace, we did\nsomething which had never before happened in my\ncountry: we called for a national referendum. In that\nreferendum, held on 25 April, the country voted for the\nelectoral path leading to a constituent assembly. Ninety-\ntwo per cent said \u201cYes\u201d, and on 25 July there were open\nelections, in which all political and social sectors\nparticipated, with absolute freedom of expression,\nfreedom of criticism and freedom of the press, the likes\nof which had never occurred in my country.\nThe National Constituent Assembly that resulted\nfrom that electoral process consists of 131 Venezuelan\nmen and women, representing the broadest segments of\nsociety, including indigenous peoples, because for the first\ntime in Venezuela's history a group of aborigines\nrepresent the indigenous peoples of Venezuela in the great\nAssembly. The Assembly members have been working\ntogether for a month and a half on a new national\nconstitution in a mechanism of cooperation. The entire\ncountry is promoting progress towards this new\nConstitution; for the sake of the democracy we are\ndefending and advocating, it will be approved only by the\ncountry. It will not enter into force until it is approved by\nthe Venezuelans in a new referendum, which we hope\nwill be held in November, or at the latest in December.\nIn other words, when the new century dawns next\nyear Venezuela will have a new political project, a\nfundamental new charter as the foundation of the new\nRepublic and of truly legitimate executive power\ngoverning by democracy \u2014 as Abraham Lincoln said, for\n2\n\n\nthe people and by the people. We will have a genuine\njudicial power, which we had lost in the past few years\nowing to corruption. This judicial power will administer\njustice. We rely on true legislative power to respond to the\ncalls and needs of the Venezuelan people.\nWe also propose the establishment of a fourth\npower \u2014 moral power \u2014 to combat corruption, the mother\nof all Venezuelan crises of recent years, and to fight for\neducation, especially for children. We further propose an\nelectoral power to achieve a balance of power. There will\nbe a division of powers, particularly legitimate powers, with\nthe profound popular content of true democracy.\nWe are also promoting a new economic model for\nVenezuela. For 20 years we experienced a terrible crisis\nthat produced the breakdown of a country, the breakdown\nof a model. We are now promoting a humanistic,\nproductive, competitive and diversified economic model,\nbased on the great potential of our country and\nincorporating the world currents of a new international\neconomic order, with greater justice and a human face,\nwhich will facilitate satisfying the needs of the human\nbeing. This must be one of the fundamental goals of any\neconomic process.\nIn just over six months we have been able to come\nhere to tell the world of our successes \u2014 small successes,\nbut they presage what is going to happen in Venezuela. We\nhave undertaken an economic revitalization, respecting all\neconomic freedoms. In a healthy coexistence between the\nState and the market, we have been gaining ground in the\nmacroeconomic area. We have started to bring down\ninflation; maintained our international reserves; helped raise\nthe price of a barrel of oil, in cooperation with the other\noil-producing countries; and brought about an exchange\nbalance. We have also been revitalizing some production\nsectors, and we are calling on global investors to invest in\nvarious petrochemical, gas, touristic, industrial and\nagricultural projects and enterprises. We are thus building\na new economic model.\nWe are also building a new society based on public\nmorality in respect of human rights. I shall give an\nexample, small, but one which says a lot about what is\nhappening in Venezuela in terms of the social order. Barely\nthree days ago the 1999-2000 school year began. This year\nthe school matriculation \u2014 that is, the number of students\nin public schools \u2014 increased by 25 per cent. As a result\nof a model of privatization of education, and of the poverty\nthat has been invading the social strata, many children and\nyoung people did not go to school; they could not pay the\nfees, nor could they pay for school supplies. This year we\nhave opened up the schools and we have been repairing\nthem. Now we are very happy to tell the world that in\njust six months the number of children and young people\nstarting a new school year has increased by 25 per cent.\nFurthermore, attention to education has gone beyond\nbeing one of the principal national priorities; it is now a\nmatter of States.\nThe same can be said of health. We have activated\na special plan which we call \u201cProject Bolivar 2000\u201d. For\nsix months we have been dealing with Venezuelans'\ngreatest needs, such as health, road repairs and opening\nways of penetration and activation of some sectors of\nmicroenterprises. We have set up a people's bank to\nprovide microcredit especially to bring about the recovery\nof the economy, the microeconomy. We have created a\nunique social fund to promote solutions basically for\nhealth and education.\nAs can be seen, we are promoting a genuine process\nof transition: politically, socially, economically and, above\nall, ethically. A new Venezuela is being born, born to\npresent itself to the world free and sovereign, ready to\ntake up firmly the flags of a new world, a fairer world.\nWe are in solidarity with the struggles of the world. The\nworld of the century to come must be much better than\nthe world of the twentieth century which is ending. We\ncall out for justice for the peoples of the third world, for\nequality and human development. We appeal for the\nintegration of peoples and for peace. Only a country\nrevitalized from within can be incorporated by its own\nstrength into the international relations of a modern world,\nsuch as the world which is dawning.\nIn this part of South America, Venezuela is being\nreborn and offering the world its heart, its arms of\nintegration. I give a special salute to all the peoples of the\nLatin American continent and the Caribbean, Central\nAmerica, North America, Asia, Africa, Europe and\nOceania. We must continue together, with a new sense of\nbrotherhood, to struggle for a better world.\nIn this my first statement to the General Assembly,\nin the last session of the century, when we are preparing\nfor the Millennium Assembly, I should like to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, the Secretary-General\nand all the world representatives gathered here at the\nUnited Nations, because we are aware of the great effort\nbeing made to reform and perfect the machinery to\nachieve peace, brotherhood and solidarity in a world that\n3\n\n\nis, as I said at the beginning, undergoing profound change.\nThese words come from my heart and go out to the\nentire world in the name of a people who are themselves\nbeing reborn \u2014 the Venezuelan people \u2014 with our best\nwishes that each day we may find greater strength and\ncome closer to attaining \u2014 as I said before \u2014 the path to\npeace, brotherhood, development, justice and self-\ndetermination. Let us not say as someone else has said that\npeace has broken out. Rather, let us say that in the next few\nyears we may all be able to proclaim loudly that peace,\ndemocracy and development have triumphed.\nI send a warm embrace to you all on behalf of the\npeople of Simon Bolivar, the people of Venezuela.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "In my\nstatement, I should like to dwell on those questions, which,\nin our opinion, demand special attention. First among these\nis the issue of security and the maintenance of regional and\nglobal stability.\nToday, we are forced to recognize that terrorism is one\nof the principal challenges and threats to international\nsecurity and stability in the twentieth century. Should the\nUnited Nations react to this most daunting challenge? Yes.\nThe coordination of the efforts of the international\ncommunity in the search for legal mechanisms to fight\nterrorism at the global level has become urgent. The\nstruggle against terrorism transcends the problems of one\ncountry or even groups of countries. I take this opportunity\nto emphasize in particular the serious threat of terrorism\nfacing the States of Central Asia. In this respect, I wish to\nsay the following.\nFirst, terrorists, using Islam \u2014 one of the world\u2019s\nmost peaceful religions, founded on the greatest cultures of\ncivilization \u2014 as a cover, are seeking to attain the broadest\nof political goals: the creation of a new regional and\nultimately global order. The terrorists\u2019 methods of\nassassinating peaceful civilians and creating diversions\nradically contradict the principles and values of Islam.\nSecondly, terrorism is undergoing an intensive\nprocess of internationalization. Extremists working in\nCentral Asia are consolidating their ranks with recruits\nfrom throughout the world. Terrorism has neither\nnationality, borders nor any particular belief. Attempts to\ngive terrorism, and international terrorism in particular, a\nnational or ethnic character do not reflect reality and have\ntheir own dangerous consequences.\nThirdly, the fight against terrorism requires\ncoordinated international efforts and wide recognition of\nthe legitimate rights of States to protect their citizens\nfrom terrorist assaults. Terrorists casually and most\ninsolently attack peaceful populations and deprive human\nbeings of their fundamental right to life.\nFourthly, the global danger of terrorism is obvious\ntoday. There is an understanding at the international level\nof the need for coordinated action. At the same time, we\ndo not fully understand the rather subdued reaction of the\ninternational community and the major States to the most\ndangerous spread of terrorism in Central Asia, posing the\nthreat of regional and global destabilization.\nFinally, the contemporary wellsprings of terrorism,\nwhere it is born and nurtured, are the theatres of military\nconflict. In our region, that means Afghanistan.\nA working meeting of the \u201csix plus two\u201d group in\nthe special format, with the participation of\nrepresentatives of the two main parties to the Afghan\nconflict, was held in Tashkent two month ago. The\ndiscussion resulted in the signing of the Tashkent\nDeclaration, defining the fundamental principles for the\npeaceful settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan.\nUzbekistan supports increased international efforts to\nfurther assist the stabilization of the situation in Tajikistan\nand the rapid elimination of new hotbeds of tension in\nsouthern Kyrgyzstan, which has become a new target for\ninvasion by international terrorists and extremist forces.\nIn this regard, I would propose the adoption of a\nresolution by the General Assembly to consider the\nproblem of terrorism in the framework of the Security\nCouncil, as well as the establishment of an informal\ngroup to coordinate efforts aimed at fighting terrorism and\nextremist crimes. We also support the proposal to\nconvene an international conference on the fight against\nterrorism. We believe that the international community, in\n29\n\n\npreparing for the Millennium Assembly in the year 2000,\nshould show its determination by defining extremist crimes\nand drafting its explicit understanding of the threat of\nterrorism.\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan is recognized around the\nworld as an authoritative supporter of the non-proliferation\nof the nuclear weapons. Uzbekistan is party to the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the\nConvention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The\nRepublic was among first countries to sign an Additional\nProtocol to its agreement with the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency on the application of safeguards in\nconnection with the NPT. These actions revealed not only\na deep understanding of the importance of these\ninternational documents, but also our desire to make a real\ncontribution to solving the problem of the non-proliferation\nof nuclear weapons, improving the planet\u2019s ecology and\nstrengthening global security and regional stability.\nThe issue of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones is\nfirmly established on the disarmament agenda. It is already\nwidely recognized that the creation of such zones is a\nunique instrument in the process of nuclear\nnon-proliferation and disarmament, which undoubtedly\nstrengthens international and regional peace and security.\nLet me express the conviction that this topic will be\nconsidered as one of the major issues in the work of the\n2000 NPT Review Conference. The value of this step is of\nspecial importance in the light of nuclear testing in South\nAsia and the clear tendency towards a global arms race.\nSubstantial progress has been achieved towards the\nrealization of the Central Asian initiative to establish a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. The Central Asian countries,\nthrough their common efforts and with the support of the\nUnited Nations, have come considerably closer to\nconcluding a treaty on the establishment of a Central Asian\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. I hope that, at the meeting to\nprepare the draft treaty to be held in Japan in few days, the\nexperts of the Central Asian countries will be able to\nfinalize the draft.\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan supports the measures\nproposed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to reform the\nUnited Nations. The implementation of the reform\nprogramme will go a long way towards adapting the United\nNations to the demands of the modern world. The\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposal to convene the Millennium\nAssembly and the Millennium Summit in the year 2000\nmust be implemented. The year 2000 is a unique symbolic\nmoment to affirm the position of the United Nations and\nto strengthen its role as a leading force in the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan continues to consider\nSecurity Council reform to be a necessary and urgent\nprocess. Any delay in this process will prevent the United\nNations from adapting efficiently to the dynamics of the\ncoming millennium. We are convinced that Germany and\nJapan can rightly claim permanent membership of the\nSecurity Council. We are also in favour of an increase in\nthe number of new non-permanent members of the\nSecurity Council.\nThe deteriorating problem of the Aral Sea requires\nme once again to call on the Assembly for support. With\nthe help of international organizations, the opinion that\nthe Aral Sea crisis can be resolved only through\nhumanitarian intervention has gradually taken root in the\nperception of the international community. But this is not\nthe case.\nMeasures of this kind have not given positive results\non any continent where mankind has been faced with\necological catastrophes. In this connection, it is necessary\nto develop and implement, with the assistance of the\nUnited Nations specialized agencies and donors, a\nspecific, long-term strategy and programme of\nrevitalization for the Aral area, that would affirm the\nprinciples of sustainable development, prevent a\ndeterioration of quality of life for people living in the\nregion and ensure a dignified standard of living for future\ngenerations.\nWe are hoping for the effective support of such\ninternational financial and economic institutions as the\nWorld Bank, the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) and others, as well as donor countries, in the\nnormalization of the ecological situation and in meeting\nthe pressing needs of the population living in the affected\narea. The problem of Aral Sea can be solved only with\nthe help of an adjusted financing mechanism and the\nconscientious work of experts.\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan comprehensively\nsupports efforts of the United Nations and the\ninternational community aimed at counteracting the illegal\ncultivation, transportation and consumption of narcotic\nsubstances. The problem of drugs should be considered a\ndanger in that it gives rise to terrorism, international\ncrime and money-laundering.\n30\n\n\nThe illegal sale of drugs is the most profitable shady\nactivity in the modern world. The transnational structures\ncontrolling global trade in drugs appear in most cases to be\nmore mobile than the structures opposing them. Today, as\nhas been pointed out by previous speakers, more than 90\nper cent of the drugs in some European countries are of\nAfghan origin.\nAccording to a 1998 annual report on international\ndrug control, starting in 1995 Uzbek customs employees\nhalted the attempted illegal export from Europe to\nAfghanistan of 72 tons of raw chemical material used for\nheroin manufacturing. This reaffirms the conclusion about\nthe internationalization of the narcotic business and the\nemergence of international terrorism, which is no less\ndangerous.\nDuring the twentieth special session of the General\nAssembly, devoted to the fight against the illegal\nmanufacturing, sale, purchase, transport, trafficking and\nspread of narcotic substances, we advanced many concrete\nproposals, including the establishment of a regional\ncoordination centre to fight drug-trafficking and the drug\nbusiness. Concrete forms of cooperation between Central\nAsian countries and the European Union were defined.\nWe call for more work by the United Nations\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) in the\nregion of Central Asia. The conclusions of experts show\nthat the Central Asian region is considered by the criminal\nworld an important transit area for the transport of drugs to\nEurope and North America.\nSpecific UNDCP projects aimed at the development of\ntechnical possibilities to control the transit of goods by\nproviding border services with up-to-date methods of drug\ndetection could contribute to this fight, which can hardly be\nregarded as the problem of one region alone. In this regard,\nwe welcome the establishment, on the initiative of the\nSecretary-General, of the United Nations Office on Drug\nControl and Crime Prevention\u2019s regional office operating in\nUzbekistan.\nThe process of democratization is long and\ncomplicated, especially if it runs parallel to large, extensive\neconomic reforms. However, the real threat to democracy,\nsecurity and stability in the region stems from the sphere of\ntransnational crime. In this respect, we state our firm\nsupport for the work of the Commission on Crime\nPrevention and Criminal Justice.\nFor this reason, the Republic of Uzbekistan has\nexpressed its intention to present its candidature for\nmembership of the United Nations Commission on Crime\nPrevention and Criminal Justice for the period of\n2001-2004. We hope that the tenth United Nations\nCongress on the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of\nOffenders, to be held from 10 to 17 April 2000, in\nVienna, will be devoted to the search for answers to the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, as indicated in a\nnumber of its main topics.\nWe would like to focus on the work of UNDP in\nUzbekistan. As the largest United Nations programme\nrendering assistance to developing countries in their\nprocess of development, UNDP, together with the\nGovernment of Uzbekistan, is carrying out a number of\nuseful projects. We hope that such cooperation will be\ncontinued in the future as well.\nNevertheless, I would like to say a few words about\none problem that has emerged in our cooperation with\nUNDP and that, in our view, must be explained. The\nproposed regional UNDP Programme for development of\nthe Fergana Valley has not received the support of our\nGovernment. In our opinion, the substance of the project\nhas not been sufficiently considered and could entail\nnegative consequences.\nDespite the exhaustive and comprehensive\nsubstantiation by our Government of the unacceptability\nof this project, which interferes with the security of the\nregion, attempts to involve our country in the participation\nof the programme by distributing erroneous information\nthroughout the international community have been\nundertaken during the last three years by UNDP and the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nWe sincerely hope that the new UNDP\nAdministrator, Mr. Brown, will take note of Uzbekistan\u2019s\nassessments. At the same time, we note with satisfaction\nthe new style of work at the UNDP mission in\nUzbekistan, which was recently headed by Mr. Kral.\nIn conclusion, I wish to refer to the book written by\nthe President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, His\nExcellency Mr. Islam A. Karimov, Uzbekistan at the\nThreshold of the Twenty-first Century: Threats to\nSecurity, Conditions and Guarantees of Progress, which\nsays,\n\u201cAs we enter the new millennium, we extend to\neveryone the hand of friendship and mutual\n31\n\n\nunderstanding, symbolizing this with the words\nsecurity, stability and sustainability of growth and\ndevelopment. For we believe that the realities these\nwords signify constitute the most solid foundation for\nglobal geopolitical balance, and for the peace,\nprosperity and well-being of every individual country,\nwhich will enable every human being to face the\nfuture with confidence\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is an\nhonour and a pleasure for me to take the floor once again\nbefore this Assembly. At the outset I would like to\ncongratulate the President on his brilliant election to lead\nour work at this session. His election is an unparalleled\ntribute to all of Africa and particularly to his fraternal\ncountry, Namibia, which today sees one of its sons\npresiding over the destinies of this fifty-fourth session of\nthe General Assembly. We are confident that his qualities\nas an eminent diplomat and his great experience guarantee\nthe success of our work.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\nglowing tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\nDidier Opertti, for the devotion and the ability with which\nhe conducted the previous session.\nAt the same time, allow me to express appreciation\nfor the full value of the efforts deployed by our Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, in the service\nof our Organization. The evidence he gives of an untiring\nwill and of constant dedication to the human cause,\nespecially in the field of peace, deserve saluting, and I\nwould like to express all of our gratitude to him.\nAt the same time, I would like to wholeheartedly\nwelcome the delegations of the Republics of Kiribati and\nNauru and of the Kingdom of Tonga, and to express to\nall of them our congratulations on their having been\nadmitted to the great family of the United Nations.\nThe time has come to assess the century that is\ncoming to a close and to see together how we are going\nto face the challenges of the next millennium \u2014 a\nmillennium that we hope will be one of peace and\nprosperity, bringing hope to our peoples and our\ncountries. This is the wish of the Comorien people for all\nthe nations of the world. But how can we realize this\nwish?\nOur Organization offers the best framework for\nfacing the challenges of the third millennium, but it will\nneed to be supported by a more active commitment on\nour part, a greater willingness to face problems and a real\nwill to deal with them \u2014 without excessive fervour or\nuncertainty \u2014 and to resolve them rationally. With such\nwill we can achieve the objectives of the founders of our\nOrganization in the field of peace, justice and progress.\nAchieving a disarmed world, which will at the same\ntime guarantee peace, social justice and progress, is the\nfundamental purpose of our Organization. In addition, we\nall hoped that the 1990s would be the decade of peace\nand solidarity among nations, because certain positive\naspects led us to expect this. The various day-to-day\n15\n\n\nrealities we have experienced unfortunately are reviving our\nfears that the next millennium will begin in uncertainty\nabout the future of humanity.\nIn fact, the wars that are tearing our continents apart,\nthe grave violations of human rights, the extreme poverty\nto which many peoples have been reduced and which\nreveals the enormous disparities between the social strata,\nand the recent tragedies such as that in Kosovo make us\nfear the worst and require us to be more vigilant. Our\nOrganization, the efforts of which we salute, must persevere\nin the search for solutions for eliminating the major and\nvarious problems besetting the world today.\nHuman rights has always been an essential concern of\nour Organization. Thus, how can we not deplore that, at the\nthreshold of the next millennium, humanity is still\nwitnessing flagrant violations of fundamental rights. It is\nbecause of this major concern that I would like to salute\nhere the efforts to establish an international criminal court,\nwhich, I am certain, will contribute to greater justice. We\nhope that this court, once it becomes operational, will enjoy\nall the necessary independence to carry out its functions\nfully and effectively and to apply the fundamental\nprinciples of humanitarian law.\nWith regard to economic issues, we must agree that\neconomic recovery is not yet in sight for many countries,\nespecially those suffering from armed conflicts. Certainly\nmany agreements emerging from international meetings\nhave highlighted the special attention that must be paid to\nthe problems of developing countries. But we must insist\nfurther on this and demand that genuine solidarity with\nthese countries be shown. Through such solidarity positive\naction could be mobilized.\nWith regard to Africa, in general it continues to be\nmarked by several things. First, its external debt has\nbecome a major obstacle to development, especially\nbecause financial flows are often used for debt servicing\nrather than for promoting the expansion of the economy\nand sustainable development. Also, the level of debt has\ndiscouraged domestic and foreign investment. Secondly, the\ncontinent is heavily scarred by wars which have sharply\nchecked development. Thirdly, global trade practices have\nreduced the commercial prospects of the continent.\nFourthly, the continent is to some extent excluded from the\nglobal information revolution. In Africa the basic education\nsystem is generally the most limited, the effects of poverty\nare extreme, and the health system needs reforming.\nTo create the necessary conditions to solve these\ndifferent problems which are hampering the development\nof our African countries, national, regional and\ninternational initiatives must be undertaken, encouraged\nand supported by the international community. A genuine\npartnership among African countries must be the basis for\nsolid and effective cooperation that allows these countries\nto share their experiences and promotes the rapid\nintegration of regional economies.\nIn the context of this need for South-South\ncooperation, my country welcomed most favourably the\nholding of the special summit in Sirte, which revealed\nonce again the solidarity of African States and their\nsupport for Libya, a brother country. We believe that the\nconditions are now in place for the total and final lifting\nof the embargo imposed on that country. The summit also\nput in place new rules to improve the structures of the\nOrganization of African Unity, with a view to an effective\nunion of its countries through the strengthening of\nsecurity and cooperation arrangements. In this regard the\nSirte summit continues to serve as a point of reference,\nand we hope its objectives will be achieved.\nI also take this opportunity to express our thanks to\nthe Government of Libya for the generosity it showed to\ncertain African countries, allowing them to honour their\ncommitments to the pan-African organization.\nMoreover, the international community, especially\nthe international financial institutions, must support these\nnational and regional efforts by facilitating their access to\nmarkets and investments, reducing debt constraints and\nallowing developing countries to benefit from new trade\nagreements.\nLike all developing countries, the Islamic Federal\nRepublic of the Comoros also faces enormous difficulties.\nThe regrettable events that have unfolded there since\nMarch 1997 have further weakened an economy that was\nalready in decline and beset by considerable deficits in\npublic finance; a chronic deficit in the balance of\npayments; a large foreign debt; and strong competition for\nexport resources by synthetic products.\nThis situation is of great concern to the Government\nwhich I have the honour to represent. It is firmly engaged\nin a process of development through the establishment of\nsolid bases for the rule of law and the adoption of a\npolicy of rehabilitation and economic and political\nrecovery through the strict management of public finances\nand the promotion of morality in administrative practices\n16\n\n\nand political customs. This rehabilitation policy should\nallow the State to fulfil its priority domestic commitments\ndomestically and to honour its commitments to its foreign\npartners.\nIn addition, other objectives to complement this good\ngovernance policy are being considered by the current\nGovernment. They include respect for human rights; the\nimprovement of social policies and hence of the efficacy of\nhealth and education services for all; the protection of\nchildren and women; the implementation of the Convention\non the Rights of the Child; the advancement and\nmainstreaming of women; guaranteed autonomy for the\njudiciary; freedom of the press; and so on.\nTo encourage private investment and promote the\nintroduction of new technology and foreign capital,\nopportunities have been opened to domestic and foreign\ninvestors by suppressing constraints on approvals of foreign\ninvestments.\nFurthermore, aware of the enormous contribution\nSouth-South cooperation makes to development by offering\nthe opportunity to exploit the economic prosperity of other\nregions, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros must\nrespond to the two-fold necessity of participating fully in\nthe globalization process and of steadfastly prospering in its\nown regional and subregional environment. That is why it\nis striving further to consolidate its participation in the\nIndian Ocean Commission and planning to join other\ngroups of the region. These endeavours, undertaken since\nthe accession to power of the current Government, may\nwell be insufficient, but they constitute a serious and\nessential foundation, and a guarantee of in-depth reform.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nAfter this general summary, I would be remiss if I\nfailed to report the prevailing political situation in the\nComoros. My country is experiencing a secessionist crisis\nin the sister island of Anjouan, which has shaken the very\nfoundations of the Republic and threatened its unity,\nterritorial integrity and, above all, the peace and tolerance\nthat have always characterized relations among the\ninhabitants of our four islands.\nMy country\u2019s Government cannot endorse secession or\nindependence, which could dislocate the Comoros, whose\nunity and social coherence are the only guarantees for the\nevolution of harmonious social and economic development.\nThree inter-island conferences have been held under the\nauspices of the OAU and the League of Arab States with a\nview to rapidly settling this crisis. The most recent, held\nin Antananarivo, Madagascar, in April, resulted in an\nagreement to establish a new institutional framework to\nmeet the aspirations of the Comorians, guarantee unity\nand territorial integrity, and give each island greater\nautonomy. In this respect, I have the pleasant duty once\nagain to convey our sincere thanks to the Malagasy\nauthorities, not only for having held that important\nmeeting on the sisterly large island, but also for having\nestablished conditions conducive to our debate.\nAt the conference, the lack of cooperation and the\nintransigence of the representatives of the island of\nAnjouan \u2014 who postponed the signing of the final\ndocument \u2014 provoked extremist groups among the\npopulation of Grande-Comore, where anti-Anjouan riots\nbroke out. The threat of civil war, of hateful \u201cinsular\ncleansing\u201d and the violent and forcible separation of\nfamilies led the National Development Army, in the face\nof the inertia of the political authorities, to act to avoid\nthe worse by assuming control of the country. A\ntransition Government was immediately formed to restore\nand guarantee civil peace and to create new republican\nand democratic institutions to ensure greater autonomy for\nthe islands, in compliance with the Antananarivo\nagreement. Thus, the consolidation of the Antananarivo\nagreement remains a Government priority and we are\ndoing everything possible to establish the conditions\nessential to the implementation of the agreement.\nIn the context of the settlement of the crisis, a frank,\ndirect and constructive dialogue has been established for\nthe first time between the central authorities and the\nAnjouan separatists. In this respect, a joint communiqu\u00e9\nsigned on the Comorian island of Moh\u00e9li in July by the\nleaders of the two parties to the summit. I wish to stress\nthat Comorians view this act as a step towards the\nsettlement of the crisis. In his meetings with Comorians,\nthe Head of State, Mr. Azali Assoumani, is seeking the\nnecessary breakthrough to achieve an honourable peace to\nthe benefit of all that unites us.\nWe hope that the ratification of this agreement by\nour Anjouan brethren will not be long in coming so that\nthe process may continue in the interests of the united\nComorian people. The Comorian Government has begun\nin-depth reflection in order to draft the fundamental texts\nto govern the future union of the Comoros. The next step\nis very crucial in order to implement the published\nelectoral timetable, which anticipates, inter alia, a popular\nreferendum on the constitution and mayoral, legislative\nand presidential elections.\n17\n\n\nThe Comorian Government welcomed the relevant\nresolutions adopted by the OAU at its thirty-fifth Summit\nin Algiers; the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference at their most recent\nConference in Ouagadougou; the Ministers for Foreign\nAffairs of the League of Arab States at their 112th session\nin Cairo (A/50/864/Annex II, res. 1) and the Permanent\nCouncil of French-speaking Countries, meeting in Paris, in\nthe framework of the speedy establishment of constitutional\norder and of the settlement of the separatist crisis. To that\nend, we invite all people of good will and friendly,\nbrotherly and neighbour countries, as well as organizations,\nto come see with their own eyes the process that has been\nlaunched and to contribute to the consolidation of\ndemocracy and the rule of law in the Comoros.\nNevertheless, we remain concerned by the fact that\nholding elections in Anjouan would be tantamount to\nrecognizing secession or ratifying independence. Indeed,\nsuch a formula is contrary to the principle of unity of the\ncountry, the spirit of the Antananarivo agreement and the\nvery principles of the OAU, the sponsor of the agreement.\nIn this regard, we invite the OAU and the entire\ninternational community to join us in the consideration\nnecessary to overcome this dilemma.\nIn this vein, I should also like to take this opportunity\nto express the sympathy and profound gratitude of the\npeople and the Government of the Comoros to the countries\nof the region, especially South Africa and Madagascar;\nfriendly countries such as France and Egypt; and\ninstitutions such as the OAU, the League of Arab States,\nthe International Organization of La Francophonie and the\nEuropean Union, which have never ceased attaching their\nspecial interest to this problem. I should like to tell them\nonce again that the people of the Comoros hopes to be able\nto rely on them, again and always, to find a speedy solution\nto this crisis.\nThe Anjouan crisis, in the view of Comorians, is all\nthe more threatening to unity, peace and love among them\nas it is added to a painful 24-year-old problem, that of the\nComorian island of Mayotte. The Assembly will understand\nthe helplessness of a people threatened with dispersion,\nfollowing the amputation of part of the territory of its\ncountry, Mayotte, and witnessing an attempt by a sister\nisland to leave the Comorian union. This crisis has revived\nthe pain of the Comoros people caused by the problem of\nMayotte, which still shows no signs of being resolved. Our\nOrganization, which is regularly seized of this question, has\nalways recognized that Mayotte belongs to the Comoros\nand has adopted resolutions in favour of the integration of\nthe island into its natural family.\nThe Comorian Government, faithful to the\nfundamental principles of the Charter of our Organization,\ncontinues to give priority to dialogue to resolve this\nproblem. It is with deep respect for these principles that\nit appeals to France, a country with which the Comoros\nhas for long had close ties of friendship and cooperation,\nto consider opening a direct, constructive dialogue to find\na rapid, negotiated solution to this unfortunate dispute.\nMy country is very concerned about the situation in\nthe Middle East. It hopes that the new Israeli\nAdministration will commit itself more to the peace\nprocess begun on 4 September at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt,\nfor a lasting, fair and harmonious resolution of the Israel-\nPalestine crisis. We also hope that the other problems,\nregarding Syria and Lebanon, will soon be settled.\nThe question of Jammu and Kashmir continues to be\nof concern to us. We appeal to India and Pakistan to\nshow restraint in order to prevent any escalation in the\nregion.\nMy country welcomes the diplomatic initiatives of\nthe United Nations which made it possible for peace to be\nrestored to Kosovo and East Timor.\nWe also welcome the Lom\u00e9 Peace Agreement of 7\nJuly 1999, with regard to the Sierra Leone conflict; the\nAbuja Agreement and its additional protocols regarding\nthe conflict in Guinea-Bissau; and the Lusaka ceasefire\nagreement, signed on 10 July 1999 by the parties to the\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nHaving noted these hopes reasons for hope, we\ncannot forget the situation in Angola and Somalia and the\nsituation prevailing between Ethiopia and Eritrea, where\nthere are no signs of a solution. The efforts made by the\nOAU should be supported by our Organization in order to\nachieve peace and reconciliation in these fraternal\ncountries.\nThe ideals of peace, security and development are\nthe responsibility of the international community, which\nmust work to make them a reality. Each of us must\ncontribute to ensure these values and to build a more\nhuman, peaceful and just world which is a harbinger of\nhope for future generations.\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to join the\nspeakers preceding me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as the President of the General Assembly at this\nsession, the last of the present century. You surely are\nwell versed in this high office through your experience\nwith the United Nations, which will make of the\ncentennial transition the launching platform for ever-\nmore-fruitful future undertakings.\nAs we embark on the next century, the survival of\nthe United Nations as an effective global institution\ncomes into question. Can its role develop in the dawn of\na new era? Or will it be more like a brilliant sunset?\nFrom the League of Nations to the United Nations, we\nhave continuously pinned our hopes on the United\nNations system, looking forward to a promising world\nruled by law, governed by justice and blessed with peace.\nHowever, the wide-ranging challenges \u2014 from\nquestions relating to the maintenance of international\npeace and security, the eradication of poverty, sustainable\ndevelopment, economic growth and social progress to\nglobalization in meaningful terms \u2014 all yet to be met and\nrequire firm resolve and certainly not mere rhetoric.\nAs crises continue to unfold throughout the world,\nwe must ask, and answer, certain important questions.\nWhy are threats to international peace and security\nvariably defined and selectively determined from place to\nplace? Why are State violators of the United Nations\nCharter and international law, including the principle of\nnon-interference, not brought to justice? Why are the\ninstigators of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and the perpetrators of\n9\n\n\ngenocide and of crimes against humanity not checked? Why\nis the fight against terrorism and narcotics so limited? And\nfinally, where and when will gender apartheid come to an\nend?\nWe are convinced that those challenges and crises can\nbest be dealt with if the United Nations actively functions\nwithin a framework similar to that of a state system. In this\ncontext, the United Nations Charter serves as an explicit\nand clear reference outlining the rights and responsibilities,\nin their entirety, of the Member States.\nThe advent of the new millennium marks the closing\nof the twentieth century. This is a time for the United\nNations to pause and assess the gains and losses, and the\nsuccesses and setbacks, it has experienced since its\nfounding. The United Nations cannot truly embark on the\nnext millennium until it has conclusively addressed the\nunfinished items on its agenda and the many existing global\nthreats. One item on \u2014 and perhaps at the top of \u2014 that\nagenda, though it is far from finalized, relates to Pakistani\nhegemonic actions and that country\u2019s collusion with\nTalibanism in our region.\nThe Pakistani-Taliban occupation of land in\nAfghanistan represents a clear breach of a fundamental\nprinciple of international law, namely, the inadmissibility of\nthe acquisition of territory by force. It is trans-border\naggression. In addition, as the report of the Special\nRapporteur (E/CN.4/1999/40), states in paragraph 18, the\nTaliban\n\u201ccontinue to pursue policies which are in conflict with\ninternational human rights standards by which\nAfghanistan is bound as a party to the major\ninternational human rights instruments.\u201d\nFurthermore, the Taliban has committed repeated war\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, including forced\ndeportation; the forced displacement of hundreds of\nthousands of people; the separation of thousands of men\nfrom their families; the widespread burning and leveling of\nhouses and entire villages; the systematic destruction of the\nagricultural base and the irrigation systems, resulting in the\nloss of crops due for harvesting; and the execution of a\nscorched-earth policy. This has been particularly true, on a\nmassive scale, in the Shamali Plains, following the July 19\nTashkent meeting of the group of \u201csix plus two\u201d, and just\nthis week in Khoja Ghar, in north-eastern Afghanistan.\nTheir policies of genocide, gender apartheid, trafficking of\nwomen and girls, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, religious and sectarian\nextermination, rigid interpretation of religion, and the\npursuit of a military solution spell out the Taliban actions\nin Afghanistan. They persist in their extremist agenda and\nadvocacy of terrorism. The increase in drug production\nand trafficking, the Talibanization of the region and their\ndenunciation of the international community continue\nunabated.\nIn sum, over 50 per cent of the Afghan population\nhas been placed under virtual house arrest, and the entire\npopulation remains terrorized by the Taliban. The\ninternational community is greatly disturbed and\nconcerned by the ominous nature of the Taliban agenda.\nThe responsibility of the much-discussed yet\nunresolved turmoil in Afghanistan continues to lie with\nthe Pakistani leadership. Pakistan remains a proponent of\narm-twisting, both nuclear and conventional, in South\nAsia. Afghanistan\u2019s Pakistani-dictated position of\nsubordination, through the Taliban, has long undermined\nthe peace process. Pakistan remains implacably opposed\nto the formation of a fully representative, multi-ethnic\ngovernment in Afghanistan, insisting that the Taliban not\nrelinquish power but gain further control. To this end,\ninter alia, thousands of Pakistani military personnel,\nmembers of the paramilitary, former commissioned\nofficers and thousands of recruits and \u201cvolunteers\u201d from\nPakistani religious schools have been trained and\ndispatched into Afghanistan for what has been called a\n\u201cjihad\u201d.\nThe remarks made on 30 July 1999 by Ambassador\nLakhdar Brahimi, head of the United Nations Special\nMission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), regarding the presence\nof thousands of armed Pakistani nationals fighting\nalongside the Taliban, provide credible testimony.\nIn this context, perhaps the article by retired\nBrigadier Usman Khalid, published in the Pakistani daily\nThe Frontier Post of 29 September 1999, just three days\nago, best spells out the Pakistani security dilemma in the\nform of a bold confession. It states that\n\u201cthe armed forces of Pakistan have been steadfast in\nplaying their role in safeguarding the security of the\ncountry [Pakistan]. They have sought to safeguard\nthe nuclear deterrent of Pakistan, resisted pressures\nto withdraw support from the mujahidin in Kashmir,\nand have been steadfast in their support to the\nTaliban in Afghanistan. All of these are of vital\nimportance to Pakistan\u2019s security and survival.\u201d\n10\n\n\nIn fact, it is the intervention of Pakistan in\nAfghanistan, its support for the Taliban and its attempts to\njustify the Taliban\u2019s defiance of the aspirations of the\ninternational community, including reprehensible attempts\nat Taliban recognition, which has eroded Pakistan\u2019s\nreputation, causing its political isolation throughout the\nworld. Those who are aware of the Afghan situation and\nthe Afghan resolve to resist any foreign rule continue to be\nperplexed and puzzled in the face of the Pakistani position.\nHowever, despite Talibanism and Pakistan\u2019s massive\nmilitary intervention in Afghanistan \u2014 both of which\nrepresent obvious breaches of the United Nations Charter,\ninternational law and international humanitarian law \u2014 we\nare delighted to note that the United Nations, following\nyears of skepticism or illusory thinking, appears, perhaps\nfor the first time and only since the open escalation of\nforeign military involvement in Afghanistan, to have\ndeveloped an in-depth perception of the longstanding bitter\nreality of the Pakistani role, its intervention, and the Taliban\nagenda in Afghanistan.\nYet to our dismay, while this in-depth perception has\nbeen so long in developing, the plight of the Afghan nation\nhas remained unresolved. It is doomed to the terrible\npredicament prevailing in many parts of Afghanistan: the\ninadmissible acquisition of territory by force and\ninterference in its internal affairs. It is because of those\nfundamental questions that at the outset of my statement I\nraised the question of the survival of the United Nations as\nan effective global institution. Given its approach to\nAfghanistan, can we still put our hope in the United\nNations system for the resolution of the Afghan crisis or\nother similar or dissimilar crises? It is our earnest\nconviction that the litmus test for United Nations survival\nwill be its engagement, without any selectivity and in the\nframework of the State system, in the rigorous\nimplementation and enforcement of its Charter.\nPakistan is blatantly breaching the United Nations\nCharter, which explicitly requires all Member States to\nrefrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial\nintegrity or political independence of any State, as well as\nnumerous General Assembly and Security Council\nresolutions and other resolutions on terrorism and the use\nof mercenaries. The reports of the Secretary-General, his\nSpecial Envoy for Afghanistan and the United Nations\nSpecial Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in\nAfghanistan clearly bring to light the bellicose, obstinate\nand intransigent attitude of the Taliban mercenaries.\nIn this context, the United Nations, acting through\nthe Security Council, has a duty to maintain international\npeace and security, in accordance with the Charter. The\nPakistani aggression, State-sponsored terrorism and other\nactivities, which threaten the peace and security of the\nregion and hamper regional development and cooperation,\nshould be identified, condemned and dealt with by taking\nappropriate measures.\nFurthermore, the Islamic State of Afghanistan\nearnestly expects the Security Council to consider the\nimposition of immediate sanctions against both the\nTaliban and their Pakistani mentors, in accordance with\nparagraph 15 of Security Council resolution 1214 (1998)\nof 8 December 1998 and in conformity with its\nresponsibility under the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations is also expected to use its good\noffices to convince the Pakistani leadership, including its\nmilitary intelligence wing, the Inter-Services Intelligence\n(ISI), to steer its policy away from intervention in\nAfghanistan and towards non-intervention, so that we can\nmove from a Pakistani-dictated position of subordination\nto a mutually dictated position of cooperation. The\nPakistani ISI should no longer thwart peace initiatives. A\nfirst step in this regard would be the withdrawal from\nAfghanistan of all armed Pakistanis, whether military\npersonnel or so-called religious volunteers. Pakistan\nshould also put a halt to its direct assistance to the\nTaliban, ranging from military hardware and oil to\nexpertise and tactical advice. Only under such pressure\nwill the Taliban resume peace negotiations.\nOn the verge of the next millennium, the Islamic\nState of Afghanistan genuinely hopes that, with the\nresolution of the Afghan crisis, it will be able to serve as\na factor for peace and stability in the region, promoting\ngood-neighbourliness, mutual respect and cooperation and\nacting as a transit country for trade between all its\nneighbours, without any distinction or preference.\nThe United Nations is earnestly expected to step up\nits efforts in the Afghan peace process. In this respect, we\ngreatly appreciate the untiring efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral and Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, his Special\nEnvoy for Afghanistan. The Islamic State of Afghanistan\nwelcomes and fully supports the 19 July Tashkent\nDeclaration of the Member States that make up the \u201csix\nplus two\u201d group, which it hopes will be fully observed.\n\n\n\nRegrettably, the Taliban continue to voice their\nadamant opposition not only to the Tashkent Declaration\nbut to all other peace initiatives. We sincerely welcome\nparagraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General\n(A/54/378) of 21 September 1999, which states,\n\u201cit is noteworthy that only one week after the\nTashkent meeting, the Taliban began a major offensive\nagainst the United Front in the Shomali plains, located\nto the north of Kabul.\u201d\nParagraph 3 further states,\n\u201cThe Taliban insist that the UF [United Front] must\nembrace the Emirate system while the UF question the\nTaliban's popular mandate to make this demand.\u201d\nMindful of the principle that there should be a\npeaceful resolution of the conflict, the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan earnestly desires a broad-based, fully\nrepresentative and multi-ethnic government in Afghanistan.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan, which is struggling for\nsovereignty and the return of peace and normalcy through\nthe institution of such a government, earnestly aspires to the\nresolution of fundamental issues such as the restoration of\nand full respect for human rights in Afghanistan,\nparticularly the rights of women. Under the Taliban, women\nhave now been reduced to a voiceless and invisible state of\nnon-being, condemned to stay in their houses and stripped\nof their basic rights, even the rights to work and education,\nall of which is against the genuine tenets of Islam.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan welcomes the fact\nthat the first year of the new millennium will be observed\nas the Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, as called for\nby the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we believe that it will\nprepare suitable ground for further understanding among the\nglobal family, thereby contributing to collective human\ncivilization.\nThis century introduced a new paradigm based on\ncollective security and international organizations, concerted\napproaches and international order, all based on the equal\nsovereignty of States. From the United Nations Charter to\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the new\nparadigm has affected all corners of the world. As a\ntroubled member of this global family, Afghanistan awaits\na collective endeavour by the international community to\ndeal with its problems, thereby helping the world, or at\nleast a part of the world, to become a better place for\nhumankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me join\nother delegations in congratulating Mr. Gurirab on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nfourth session. His skill and experience will serve us well\nas he directs the vital work to be undertaken at this\nsession. I should also like to take this opportunity to\nthank his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his\noutstanding stewardship of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session.\nThe Government of the Republic of Moldova\nwarmly welcomes the admission of the three new\nMembers of the United Nations: the Republic of Kiribati,\nthe Republic of Nauru, and the Kingdom of Tonga.\nSince its admission to the United Nations in 1992,\nthe Republic of Moldova has consistently been an active\nsupporter of the world Organization. As a small country,\nwe depend on the United Nations for our security and for\nour very existence. We want to see it further strengthened\nand the sphere of its activities expanded. We believe that\nin this emerging new international order, it is more\nnecessary than ever that the United Nations be capable of\nfulfilling the role entrusted to it by the Charter, as the\nguarantor of peace, security and social justice throughout\nthe world.\nIt is from that perspective that we evaluate the\nUnited Nations reform process launched by the Secretary-\nGeneral; as we see it, reform means the rational\nadaptation of United Nations mechanisms to present and\nfuture needs. We owe the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, our gratitude and support for his reform proposals.\nEspecially, we welcome the implementation of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s reform proposals aimed at fostering\ngreater internal coordination, streamlining procedures and\nrationalizing the activities of the Organization. In this\ncontext, I would like to underline the positive results thus\nfar achieved by the United Nations Development Group\nand the Executive Committee on Economic and Social\nAffairs. The preliminary application of the United Nations\nDevelopment Assistance Framework in 18 pilot countries\nand more intense cooperation between Bretton Woods\ninstitutions and the United Nations are also producing\npromising results.\nIntegration within the United Nations system is also\nmoving ahead at the country level. I can already see some\n12\n\n\nencouraging results from the Republic of Moldova\u2019s \u201cOne\ncountry, one United Nations\u201d policy. From this perspective,\nwe believe also that the integration of United Nations\nrepresentation at the country level will lead to substantive\nimprovements and greater coherence in the relationship\nbetween the United Nations system and the host country. I\ntake this opportunity to inform members that in the near\nfuture a United Nations common house will be officially\ninaugurated in the capital of our country, Chisinau.\nI would like to mention in this context the substantial\nassistance provided by the United Nations to my country\nthrough the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) office in the Republic of Moldova. The activities\ncarried out by the UNDP office contribute significantly to\nthe ongoing reform process.\nWe believe that the diversification and deepening of\ncollaboration among States has enhanced the development\nof regional and subregional cooperation as well. In fact, the\nCharter itself attaches great significance to regional\norganizations. Documents laying the foundations for\ncollaboration between the United Nations and various\nregional organizations have been drawn up, in particular in\nrecent years. General Assembly resolutions pertaining to\ncooperation between the United Nations on the one hand,\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE), the League of Arab States and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on the other, are\nrelevant from that point of view. Some regional\norganizations have acquired new areas of competence,\nincluding in the field of peace and security, and have\nbecome a trustworthy support for the United Nations in\ncontaining and eliminating local conflicts. For the near\nfuture, we may expect that additional regional organizations\nand groupings will be interested in setting up a cooperation\nframework with the United Nations, similar those that exist\nwith other regional organizations. The Republic of Moldova\nsupports that trend.\nAs a founding member of the Black Sea Economic\nCooperation Organization, and as the country which at the\nend of this month will assume the presidency of that\norganization, the Republic of Moldova welcomes the recent\ndecision of the General Committee to include in the agenda\nof the fifty-fourth session an item concerning the granting\nof observer status in the General Assembly to the Black\nSea Economic Cooperation Organization. To this effect, the\nRepublic of Moldova would very much appreciate it if\nMember States lent their valuable support to the granting of\nobserver status in the Assembly to that organization.\nWe are fully aware of the fact that because of its\noutstanding role in dealing with world problems, the\nUnited Nations is confronted with a growing number of\nnew threats to international security and stability. In this\ncontext, peacekeeping operations represent one of the\nworld Organization\u2019s main instruments with which to stop\nconflicts in various parts of the world and to create\nfavourable conditions for their political settlement. It is\nalso obvious that in recent years the United Nations has\nnearly exhausted its ability to respond to the increasing\nnumber of requests for such operations. Under these\ncircumstances, we support and encourage the trend\ntowards involving regional organizations and\narrangements, in cooperation with the United Nations, in\nthe mitigation of certain conflicts. At the same time, we\nconsider that peacekeeping operations should as a rule be\nundertaken under the auspices of the United Nations and\nin conformity with United Nations standards.\nStatements made during the general debate have\noffered an eloquent perspective on the major challenges\nconfronting the present-day system of international\nrelations and on the role that international organizations,\nand primarily the United Nations, have to play in order to\nmeet them. One of the most important issues spoken of in\nthis context is the maintenance of peace, security and\nstability in various regions affected by crisis and internal\nconflict. Unfortunately, developments in those regions\ncompel us to acknowledge the insoluble character of\nmany such conflicts. These so-called frozen conflicts have\na huge potential for destabilization and destruction. The\nKosovo tragedy has clearly shown how they can\ndegenerate if we do not succeed in working out timely\nlong-lasting solutions. The Secretary-General is absolutely\nright when he stresses that a tragic irony of many of the\ncrises that continue to go unnoticed and unchallenged\ntoday is that they could be dealt with by far less perilous\nacts of intervention than the one we witnessed recently in\nYugoslavia.\nAt the same time, one of the main conclusions to be\ndrawn from conflicts such as those in Kosovo and in\nBosnia is that no single organization or State is capable\nof solving conflicts of such complexity and scale on its\nown.\nThe uniqueness of the United Nations is defined\nparticularly by its capacity to efficiently mobilize the\nresources of the international community and to\norchestrate its efforts in order to defuse and solve crisis\nand conflict situations. That unique potential has to be\nmore actively and more efficiently used, particularly in\n13\n\n\nrelation to the internal conflicts confronted by some newly\nindependent States. Since 1992, when the majority of the\nex-Soviet republics became members of the United Nations,\ndozens of interventions concerning conflicts in these States,\nMoldova among them, have been spoken of in this\nAssembly. One of the main conclusions of those statements\nwas that without more active involvement by the\ninternational community those conflicts will remain\n\u201cfrozen\u201d.\nIn this context, it bears mention that the United\nNations, as well as other international bodies and individual\nStates, have made an important contribution to ending the\nviolence and military clashes and in bringing the parties\ninvolved to the negotiating table. Another positive result\nfrom the actions of the international community has been\nthe parties\u2019 acceptance of the idea of resolving their\ndifferences through peaceful means.\nFor this reason, the Republic of Moldova, like other\ncountries with similar problems in our own region, has\ncontinued to support more active involvement by the United\nNations and regional organizations in managing the\nconflicts which they have faced for many years now. We\nthink that the time is ripe to give more consideration to the\nquestion of how the root causes of those conflicts should be\nidentified and dealt with. In this respect the United Nations\ncan efficiently use its potential only through intensive\ncooperation and interaction with the European organizations\nand institutions, particularly OSCE. Through enhanced\nsynergy and avoidance of duplication, and by using and\nmaintaining consulting mechanisms at various levels and\nexchanging information about plans and activities between\nitself and those organizations, the United Nations can\nimprove the situation in countries affected by internal\nconflicts.\nHowever, there must be firm decisions about what\naction must be taken to ensure the implementation of the\nrelevant resolutions and decisions adopted of the United\nNations and the OSCE, the main international organizations\ninvolved in settling those conflicts. We believe that the\nGeneral Assembly should evaluate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of cooperation between the United Nations\nand OSCE from this point of view also.\nThat I refer to the issue of conflicts in some detail is\nnot incidental. The problem of the eastern region of the\nRepublic of Moldova has been repeatedly described, from\nthis rostrum, by representatives of my country. To my\nregret, I must inform of the Assembly that there has been\nno tangible progress towards a comprehensive settlement.\nThroughout the negotiations, we have sought to\naccomplish the purpose for which the Assembly was\nestablished: to replace mistrust and violent confrontation\nwith dialogue and agreement between the parties to the\nconflict.\nThe Government of my country has shown more\nthan once that it strongly advocates a peaceful resolution,\nthrough negotiations, of the conflict situation in\nTransnistria, in accordance with the norms and practice of\ninternational law and in collaboration with international\norganizations, primarily OSCE, and with the Russian\nFederation and Ukraine as mediators. Although it has\nmade the spirit of compromise evident, the Government\nfirmly believes that any proposal for a settlement must\nprovide for territorial integrity to be maintained and for\ncontrol over the territory of the whole country to be\nensured.\nDespite a reasonable compromise on the part of the\nconstitutional authorities, separatist tendencies still persist.\nA number of documents \u2014 elaborated with the active\nparticipation of OSCE and other mediators and signed by\nall parties involved \u2014 are being interpreted unilaterally,\nand in a manner contrary to their meaning, by the\nTransnistrian leaders. Moreover, these leaders are trying\nto impose certain concepts that do not exist in law and\nterritorial practice and are contrary to the principle of\nterritorial integrity. Here I refer to am referring to the\nconcept of \u201ccommon State,\u201d which has very frequently\nbeen imposed in discussions to define relations between\nthe central and local authorities in certain conflict zones.\nWe consider this concept dangerous due as it attempts to\ndistort the notion of statehood and State sovereignty and\nprovide a legal framework for the ideology of aggressive\nseparatism. I believe that the United Nations and other\ninternational organizations will also find this concept both\ninadequate and counter-productive as a means of\nresolving internal conflicts.\nIn Transnistria, we are striving for a rapid and\ndefinitive solution and a return to stability, and a return\nalso to respect for human rights, which continue to be\nviolated in this region. The case of the Ilascu group, and\nviolation of fundamental human rights and freedoms it\nrepresents are eloquent in this respect.\nWe consider it imperative for international efforts to\nsolve the current crisis situations, most of which have\nseparatism as their main cause, to be strengthened. In this\nconnection, I would mention that we fully share the views\nexpressed earlier by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\n14\n\n\nthe Russian Federation concerning aggressive separatism.\nIndeed, the international community and, first of all, the\nUnited Nations should decisively suppress any\nmanifestations of separatism and rigorously and consistently\ndefend the principles of sovereignty, integrity and the\ninviolability of national frontiers. To this end, the complete\neradication of outside encouragement and support for\nseparatist forces is most certainly necessary.\nAnother aspect of the Transnistrian problem is\nmilitary: this zone is famously overmilitarized, which has\nvery negatively affected the settlement process. Thousands\nof tons of shells and armaments \u2014 both accounted for and\nunaccounted for, and including equipment limited by the\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty \u2014 are\nstationed there. This military presence is in evident\ncontradiction to the Constitution of the Republic of\nMoldova, which declared the State\u2019s neutrality and that\nforeign troops are not admissible in our country.\nAnother premise for accelerating the settlement\nprocess is, would undoubtedly be the immediate, complete,\nunconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops, as\nstipulated in OSCE summit decisions required by the CFE\nTreaty, the keystone of European security and may on no\naccount be violated.\nI hope that, together with our partners and the relevant\ninternational organizations, we can establish, very soon, an\neffective mechanism and detailed schedule for the takeover,\ndestruction or removal of the foreign military arsenal from\nRepublic of Moldova territory. I express my gratitude for\nthe political support and, especially, for the financial\nassistance provided by many United Nations Member States\nfor the withdrawal or elimination of those arsenals.\nI voice our hope that the proceedings of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session will be conducted in a\nspirit of solidarity and with a realistic and constructive\napproach to the complex issues confronting the\ncontemporary world at the end of this millennium. The\ndelegation of the Republic of Moldova is committed to\ncontributing, alongside other Member States, to the\nfulfilment of the lofty goals of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That\nview cannot differ basically from the one I am now\nexpressing as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay.\nIn order to contribute to the debate of ideas, we did\nnot silence then, nor will we now, certain views on the\ninternational community, on the changes it is experiencing\nand on the response capability of the United Nations to\nface the new situations or expectations of the Member\nStates, especially the demands of regions or areas of the\nworld experiencing diverse types of suffering.\nThis suffering is at times basically economic in\norigin \u2014 call it underdevelopment or more simply,\npoverty and even extreme destitution \u2014 with all the\nattending consequences of marginalization and exclusion.\nIn other cases, suffering stems from problems of\ncivilization that tend to show alarming signs of\ndeterioration. We must also emphasize that the turmoil\nand instability experienced by peoples are not in every\ncase due to one and the same cause, whether of a material\nor economic nature or because of the lack of resources.\nWe observe phenomena such as violence,\ndramatically present at the individual or collective level;\nterrorism of all kinds, blind and relentless; and, of course,\nthe drug problem in its diverse stages, including the\nentrepreneurial business of its traffic and its perverse\ndestabilizing effect, and drug consumption, which is\ndestructive to the individual and is also related to family\ndissolution. There is also the absence of or weakness in\neducational standards that adequately prioritize the ethical\ndimension and human values as a great pedagogical goal.\nPerhaps none of us yet possesses the key to explain\nthe real origin of these pathological phenomena, but what\nis very clear is that we cannot affect ignorance about\nthem, as if they were foreign to us \u2014 Governments,\nStates, peoples and organizations.\nWithout prejudice to what was just said, we\nrecognize first the central role the Organization must play\nin terms of international peacekeeping and security. On\nthe other hand, it is necessary to give special attention to\nthe dreadful consequences of nationalist excesses, to\nconfront the exclusive and unfair fundamentalism of\nreligions, to fight discrimination, whatever the basic\nclaims or pretexts are, and to make tolerance a basic\nprinciple of relations among individuals and peoples. All\nare unavoidable duties of the United Nations.\nWe must now establish and reaffirm our position as\na Member State on those main items \u2014 some of which\nare planned, others under way and others still to come \u2014\nregarding what is to be done.\nI refer first to the reform of the Organization and of\nthe Charter, and in particular to the reform of the Security\n22\n\n\nCouncil. These are priorities that must continue at a pace\nimposed by the complexity of the matter, by the current\nstate of international relations and, above all, by the\nexpectation of world public opinion that moves\nmomentarily from hope to anxiety. If it is true, as it is said,\nthat time takes revenge on things done without prior\nconsultation, it is just as true that medicine refined for a\nlong time, as the Italian master Carnelutti reminds us, could\narrive too late, when the patient is already dead.\nReform requires a balance, a balance between sudden\nneed and efficiency, between rigidity and flexibility and\nbetween unavoidable principles and the just appreciation of\nnew realities. In favour of this balance, the General\nAssembly approved in November 1998 resolution 53/30,\nrequiring at least a two-thirds majority for the approval of\nany reform relating to the membership of the Security\nCouncil. This dispelled concern about a reform being\napproved by non-representative majorities, opening up a\nnew phase. This is contained in the report of the Open-\nended Working Group on reform of the Security Council,\nestablished by consensus by the General Assembly by\nresolution 48/26, in the chapter entitled \u201cObservations\u201d.\nIt will be your task, Mr. President, to give renewed\nmomentum to this process on the basis of its progress and\nof other steps which, however modest and far from\nresolving the matter, advance in denoting certain basic\npoints concerning which there is at least a common\ndiagnosis. Although distant from final solutions, these\npoints are always adjustable to the changes of the\ninternational community.\nThe Government of Uruguay, my country \u2014 an active\nMember State of this Organization and of other world and\nregional organizations, both political and integration\nones \u2014 has observed and continues to see well-constituted\ninternational institutions as the main guarantee for the\nobservance a more just, foreseeable and fair international\norder. Therefore, when distinguishing the vital from the\nsuperficial and rhetorical speech from the true search for\nagreements, which can involve reciprocal concessions, the\ndelegation of Uruguay will be in favour of change and\nagainst stagnation \u2014 but not just any change. It will favour\nchange that restores to the United Nations a level of\ninternational recognition which, without sacrificing efficacy,\nwould make the Member States and their regions feel that\nthey are a tangible and active reality, that those subregions\ncannot be under-represented.\nThere is no longer a place for an elitist international\nsociety that freezes obsolete historical periods in time,\ntypical of a dialectic of confrontation measured in terms\nof the cold war. We must propose new formulas to avoid\nthe effect of blockage that in many cases produces the\nconspicuous right to veto, granting the Security Council\nthe procedural means to break it and even entrusting the\nGeneral Assembly, under certain conditions, as proposed\nby my delegation, with new competencies so that it could\nbe formally informed and its decision be required in\nsituations which demand it, particularly when it concerns\ncases that could involve the legitimate use of force.\nThe recent problem in Kosovo, which continues,\ncould serve as a typical example of the aforementioned\nparalysing effect of the veto in the Security Council,\nwithout forgetting the disturbing consequences that effect\nwould have in producing the marginalization of the\nUnited Nations system of peace and security, with the\nresulting questioning of the Organization itself and its real\npossibilities.\nThis, naturally, requires the foresight of international\nlaw as the sole source of legitimacy, without ignoring the\nauthentic and grave humanitarian situations that are\nimposed on us by the drama of the real facts at a time\nwhen they require a formal framework of timely,\nlegitimate and efficient international action.\nWe also attach special meaning to the improvement\nof the rules of procedure and the working methods of the\nSecurity Council, and we therefore trust that the proposals\nelaborated by the Open-ended Working Group will be\nadopted.\nAn optimistic initiative of the Organization,\nencouraged by the Secretariat and the Member States, is\nundoubtedly the so-called millennium summit, which will\ntake place at the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly. Regarding its agenda, there will be a certain\ntendency in favour of approving a main topic of common\ninterest, capable of stirring the attention and participation\nof heads of State and Government.\nAs this is the most important point now under debate\nhere, and since I wished to contribute when I was\nPresident of the General Assembly, I now say quite\nsimply that in our view the main theme should be \u201cThe\nUnited Nations: its future viability\u201d. This would generate,\nlike the organs of a single body, related fundamental\nissues, perhaps formulated as important questions, such\nas: Towards a new system of international security? Does\nglobalization demand new strategies of the world\nOrganization? What more concrete strategies can there be\n23\n\n\nfor the elimination of poverty and underdevelopment? How\ncan we review the system for the protection of human\nrights, with a view to strengthening and improving them,\nparticularly in the fields of the family, children, education\nand international cooperation?\nNaturally, we are aware that for the millennium\nsummit to be successful and give hope for the next century,\nits agenda must reflect the expectations of Member States,\nwhich still show marked differences. My Government will\ncontinue to participate in the preparation of the summit with\ninterest and in a responsible manner.\nThe initiative for dialogue between civilizations \u2014\n2001 is to be the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\nCivilizations \u2014 proposed by Iran and approved by\nconsensus by the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession \u2014 is the kind of topic that is at the heart of the\nUnited Nations role and should be studied in depth. We are\nconvinced of the great importance of examining with\nextreme care the cultural diversity of Member States in\norder to know each other better, but at the same time\nunderstand the profound reasons why, despite our diversity,\nwe are all Member States of a unique universal\nOrganization: the United Nations.\nSupport and respect for the San Francisco Charter is\nundoubtedly the starting point of any responsible dialogue.\nThe Government of Uruguay will contribute its ideas and\ninitiatives, joining in the efforts of all delegations to\nimprove the international habitat through understanding and\ntolerance of peoples and ideas.\nWithout prejudice to the important progress made\ntowards the establishment of a normative system against the\nproliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,\nUruguay considers it essential to take new steps in this\ndirection through the universalization of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), whose\nnorms must be recognized and accepted by all States.\nThe abusive use of light weapons or small arms \u2014 a\nsubject of great debate \u2014 whose uncontrolled proliferation\nis reaching unacceptable levels, with devastating effects, in\nsome cases worse than those caused by weapons of massive\ndestruction, is a field in which the United Nations must\nplay a fundamental role, as already reflected in the\nconvening of an international conference to deal with the\nillicit traffic in small arms, a conference which Uruguay\nfirmly supports.\nMy country strongly believes in the need to replace\nthe \u201cculture of conflict\u201d with a \u201cculture of peace\u201d, so that,\nas wisely stated by the Under-Secretary-General for\nDisarmament Affairs, Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, \u201cAs the\ntwentieth century witnessed the creation of nuclear\nweapons, the twenty-first century will see their\ndestruction\u201d. The entry into force last March of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction is an auspicious sign.\nA most significant milestone in the endless search\nfor effective international ways to protect human rights\nwas the signing of the Statute of the International\nCriminal Court in Rome in July 1998, during the same\nyear in which the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights was celebrated. Uruguay is\nparticipating and will continue to participate seriously in\nthe elaboration of complementary rules and procedural\nprovisions to give the Court the basic elements to\nguarantee that it can work properly. When that process is\ncompleted the matter will come before our legislative\nbodies for consideration, in accordance with our\nConstitution.\nIn conclusion, the topics that concern and will\ncontinue to concern the United Nations are multiple and\ndiverse. At this very moment, for example, an instrument\nthat has shown its effectiveness on various occasions is\nbeing employed again: the peacekeeping operation. I refer\nhere to the one taking place in East Timor, with the prime\ngoal of ensuring that the mandate of the Timorese people\nis implemented, and of preserving the lives and physical\nintegrity of that people.\nNaturally, the environment, which is under attack,\nparadoxically as much by unregulated over-development\nas by poverty, will continue to be on the Organization's\nagenda, as well as the topic of population and\ndevelopment.\nBut perhaps the essential need is to make the\nmaximum effort to make the United Nations the point of\nreference for all States, the most powerful and the\nweakest \u2014 the former so that they yield to the\ninternational order and the latter so that they adjust to it,\nand find in the Organization their best shield. For all\nStates it means access to a modernity that will develop\nthem and make them part of the current technical\ninnovation, which is supported by the information\nrevolution through which all of us, in one way or another,\nwill be introduced to the coming century.\n24\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation\nof Panama is particularly gratified to welcome your\nelection, Sir, to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nthis session. We are pleased that the noble people of Africa,\nwhose aspiration to progress is shared by Panamanians, are\nso well represented in this forum, with you at the head of\nour deliberations and another distinguished African,\nMr. Kofi Annan, leading the Secretariat. We join in the\ncongratulations conveyed to you in recognition of your\ncapacity and your skills, as well as in the expressions of\ngratitude addressed to the Secretary-General for his\ndedication to the Organization and his tireless efforts to\nmaintain international peace and security.\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, I also wish to\nconvey our appreciation for the outstanding way in which\nhe conducted our debates and his contribution to the\nsuccess of the deliberations of the Assembly.\nMy warmest congratulations, on behalf of the people\nand the Government of Panama, go also to the\nrepresentatives of Kiribati, Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga, States which were admitted to the United Nations\non the first day of this session. This event confirms\nbeyond question the universal and inclusive nature and\npurpose of this body devoted to fostering world peace and\npeoples' well-being.\nToday I am speaking on behalf of a young, proud\nnation that has written some illustrious pages in the\nhistory of the Latin American peoples' struggle to achieve\nnationhood. I am the spokesperson of a country where,\naccording to the design of the liberator, Sim\u00f3n Bol'var,\nthe first congress of the new nations of the continent took\nplace.\nHere before the Assembly, I represent a State whose\ngeographical location has given it an extraordinary role as\na transit route, a country that has devoted itself heart and\nsoul to the service of inter-oceanic transport and that, as\na result, has had to wait until the end of the twentieth\ncentury to recover dominion over the whole of its\nterritory.\n\n\nAlong with my compatriots, I am filled with\nenthusiasm at the approach of the far-reaching event that is\nthe handing over of the Panama Canal to Panamanian\nhands. On the eve of this tremendous event that arouses\nsuch great expectations, we must recognize the efforts of\nthe many Panamanian men and women who, from the time\nwe became an independent State, began the nationalist\nstruggle to free ourselves from the burdens imposed on us\nby the first Canal Treaty, which was signed in 1903. Their\npatriotic deeds have been indelibly engraved in the history\nand the tradition of our people.\nSince its opening in 1914, the Canal has been an\nimportant symbol of our nationhood and the centre of the\nhopes of the Panamanian people to attain its development\nas a nation. The Canal, which turned us into the world's\nbridge and the heart of the universe, has given impetus to\nthe economic progress of the international community in the\ncourse of eight and a half decades. The Panamanian people\nwill now be able to participate fully in the prosperity that\nthe inter-oceanic waterway generates because, at the\nthreshold of the twenty-first century, Panama has\ndetermined that the Canal will be operated not only to\npunctually serve international trade, but also to promote\nsustainable human development. The administration of the\nCanal is therefore not simply a right, but also a\nresponsibility that obligates all Panamanians to administer\nthe waterway responsibly, efficiently and with absolute\nprobity. We have prepared ourselves for this with redoubled\ncare.\nThe process for the legal transition of the Canal began\nin 1977 with the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty. That\nagreement recorded the commitment of the United States to\ntransfer to Panama the administration and total control of\nthe inter-oceanic waterway on 31 December 1999. Since\nthen, the Governments of Panama and the United States of\nAmerica have worked in harmony to bring about a seamless\ntransition. Furthermore, and particularly since the 1989\nrestoration of constitutional rule, we Panamanians have\nagreed on the need to place the Canal above and beyond\npolitical differences. The fruit of this consensus was the\nfact that our political Constitution incorporates a provision\nfor the Canal that stipulates how the waterway is to be\nadministered from 31 December 1999. On the basis of that\nconstitutional provision, adopted in 1994, and with the wide\nparticipation of society, we developed the Panama Canal\nAuthority Act, which was adopted unanimously in the\nLegislative Assembly.\nThose two legal instruments, the constitutional\nprovision and the Act, provide the necessary legal\nmechanisms to ensure proper operation of the inter-\noceanic waterway. In recent years, the Canal has handled\nunprecedented volumes of traffic and cargo and has dealt\nwith them with exemplary care and efficiency,\nfundamentally thanks to our precious human resources,\nwho are almost all of Panamanian nationality.\nIn order to guarantee its future operation, Panama is\ncurrently implementing an intensive programme of\ninvestment at an approximate cost of one billion balboas\nin order to modernize and improve the inter-oceanic\nwaterway and to ensure that it is ready to cope with\ndemand and to maintain the quality of its services. It is\nhoped that this modernization and improvement\nprogramme will augment the capacity of the Canal by 20\nper cent.\nOne of the priorities of the Canal Authority is to\nprotect the environment. As the Act establishes, as of 31\nDecember 1999 the Authority will have the responsibility\nof vigilance over and conservation of the Canal basin, as\nwell as for coordinating the administration, conservation\nand use of the natural resources of that immense region.\nI should like to recognize the faultless way in which\nsuccessive United States Governments have fulfilled the\nprovisions of the Canal Treaty since it was signed in\n1977. Thanks to them, it has been possible to overcome\nthe obstacles that have been encountered over a long\nperiod of 20 years in the transfer of the inter-oceanic\nwaterway and in the hand-over of the military bases that\nwere established on our territory. Although there are\nseveral matters remaining for both Governments to\nconfront, such as decontamination of certain areas\ndesigned for military use by the United States Army, my\nGovernment trusts that the differences that continue to\nexist on this point will be resolved satisfactorily in a\nreasonable period of time.\nThe handover of the Canal to the jurisdiction of the\nRepublic of Panama is an event of far-reaching\nimportance not only for Panama and the United States,\nbut for the international community as well.\nConsequently, Panamanians hope that the representatives\nof the international community will join in celebrating the\ncommemorative events associated with the transition.\nPanamanians also hope that from now on the relations\nbetween Panama and the United States will be based on\nmutual respect, cooperation and equity in trade, in view\nof the tremendously strong nature of the historical, social,\npolitical and trading bonds that have joined the two\nnations since the last century. The benefits that control\n2\n\n\nover the Canal have yielded for the economy and the\npolitical standing of the United States determine that that\nnation should value the feeling of brotherhood that its\nleaders have for decades professed and truly act on them in\norder to begin a new period of relations with Panama that\nwill enable us to boost sustainable human development,\nwhich is something the Panamanian people very much\naspire to.\nIn recent years, my country, like many others, has\nsuffered the imposition of an economic orthodoxy applied\nmore with an eye towards the interests of the major\ninternational economic sectors than to the true development\nof peoples, without any consideration being given to the\nvalues that underpin our nationhood. This is the real state\nof affairs that obliges my Government to review the\norientation of our economic policy in order to promote the\ndevelopment of our people.\nWe are particularly concerned with the development\nof rural communities. These communities make an\ninvaluable contribution to the strength of our nationhood,\nbut they are also the ones that have the greatest difficulties\nin the struggle to ensure their survival. The fundamental\nconcern of my Government is bound up with improving the\nquality of life of the neediest. That objective depends to a\nlarge extent upon our efforts, but it also depends on our\nsucceeding in opening new markets for our products and\nachieving greater participation for private investment in our\ncountry and greater cooperation with developed nations.\nAt a time when the rights of women to equality and\nparticipation in the public life of nations are constantly\nbeing reaffirmed, I am proud to be the first Panamanian\nwoman ever to receive from her people, in an\nunmistakeable manifestation of confidence, the mandate to\nserve the Republic as President. I interpret this mandate as\na challenge calling on me to promote sustainable human\ndevelopment honestly and devotedly, in accordance with the\nuniversal political values that for half a century the\nOrganization has been upholding with admirable\npersistence: the democratic system of government and\nrespect for human rights.\nConsequently, I bear the heavy responsibility in\nfollowing in the steps of my predecessors \u2014 exceptional\nleaders elected in democratic elections, such as Golda Meir,\nIndira Ghandi and Coraz\u00f3n Aquino, among others; and, in\nthe western hemisphere, Eugenia Charles, Violeta Chamorro\nand Janet Jagan. They helped to realize the warranted\naspiration that society should recognize women's skills and\nmerits to share on an equal footing in the great political\nresponsibility of presiding over a nation.\nFor Panamanian women I represent a dream come\ntrue. In this respect, my election is a significant advance\nin the campaign to ensure political equality for the\nwomen of my country and the rest of the continent.\nHowever, many Panamanian women are being hard hit by\npoverty and destitution, an unacceptable situation that\nthey share with children, older adults and men, whom so-\ncalled globalization takes no account of.\nIf we wish to secure the sustainability of human life\non this God-given earth, and if we wish to keep our\npromises as leaders, we must strive to eradicate hunger,\npoverty and destitution, which in my country afflict\nalmost two-fifths of the population.\nIf we wish to achieve these goals \u2014 which is what\nwe were elected to do \u2014 we must root out corruption,\nwhich is the major obstacle standing in the way of\nachieving the lofty results that our societies expect of us.\nIn this respect, I am pleased to assure the Assembly that\nPanama is doing everything in its power to put an end to\nthe use and trafficking of drugs as well as to the money-\nlaundering that is the result of that heinous phenomenon.\nWe the leaders of nations have the opportunity to\nundertake measures that will significantly help to fashion\na more just, more humane and fairer world governed by\nthe fundamental principles of democracy, justice and\nliberty, for which my people, together with all the peoples\nof the world, have fought throughout history.\nI urge dignitaries and the representatives of Member\nStates to embark resolutely on the struggle against\npoverty, destitution and corruption, which so adversely\naffect the living conditions of humankind. I would ask\nthem to come with us to the rescue of the weak, of those\nwho suffer unspeakable injustice and those whose way of\nlife is threatened by invisible forces that they can neither\nunderstand nor control.\nMy presence here is evidence of the Panamanians'\nfirm belief in the order provided by this Organization,\nwhose struggle to achieve equality among peoples and\npeace among nations dates back more than 50 years. This\nOrganization has wholeheartedly championed human\nrights and battled against discrimination on all fronts.\nThat is why we believe in the need to strengthen it,\nbecause the United Nations is the court in which the\n3\n\n\nvoice of smaller States can be heard, as well as the ultimate\nchampion of all of our rights.\nOn account of the trust that my people have in the\nUnited Nations, I invite all of the dignitaries and\nrepresentatives of Member States to join with us in\ncelebrating the recovery of the sovereignty that we never\nresigned ourselves to losing. At this historic moment, which\nPanamanians wish to share with the whole of humankind,\nthe bells of the world will ring out in jubilation because the\nprinciple of sovereignty, so often proclaimed in this and\nother international forums, will have been translated into\nreality in my country.\nMay God, the source of all authority, guide the\ndeliberations of the Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to\nextend to you, Sir, my warm congratulations on your\nelection to the helm of our General Assembly at its fifty-\nfourth session. We are confident that, in view of your\nlong experience in the affairs of our Organization, we\nmay look forward to a fruitful and constructive year for\nthe work of the General Assembly and its Main\nCommittees.\nAllow me also to thank Mr. Didier Opertti, who led\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-third session with\nremarkable distinction and efficiency.\n\n\n\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, we wish\nto express our sincere gratitude for his dynamic leadership\nand his continued efforts to promote durable peace and\nsecurity.\nFurthermore, I would like to join previous speakers in\nwelcoming the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru\nand the Kingdom of Tonga as new Members of the United\nNations family.\nThe ongoing globalization process has increased the\ninfluence of markets, benefiting a small group of countries,\ntheir corporations and people. At the same time, it has\nmarginalized the majority of developing nations, in\nparticular the small and vulnerable ones, undermining\ndecades-long efforts by these countries to create economic\nwell-being, social justice and sustainable human\ndevelopment.\nIt has, furthermore, eroded trade preferences and\nchallenged and undermined the basic principles of\ninternational cooperation. It has also eroded international\ncommitments to financing for development through the non-\nfulfilment of agreed targets of official development\nassistance and through the reduction in contributions to the\ncore resources of the different programmes and funds of the\nUnited Nations system.\nThe drop in prices of primary commodities to their\nlowest level in a century and a half and the reduction of\nofficial development assistance have brought many\nGovernments in developing countries face to face with the\ndangers of not being in a position to address in a\nsatisfactory manner the just socio-economic demands of\ntheir respective peoples. In many cases, this has triggered\nsocial unrest and political instability and hampered efforts\nto achieve sustainable development.\nAccess to financing for development has been\nrendered more difficult, since the flow of private capital\nresources has been limited to certain regions and to a few\ndeveloping countries, resulting in a further widening of the\ngap between developed and the majority of developing\ncountries. As a consequence of this widening gap, poverty\ncontinues to rise, leading to increased migration,\nenvironmental deterioration, political conflicts and\ninstability, which eventually will have long-term negative\nconsequences not only for developing, but for developed\ncountries as well.\nThe international community therefore has a moral\nobligation to ensure that these negative influences of\nglobalization are contained so that the benefits of\nglobalization are shared among all nations. It must also\nguarantee special and differential treatment to small,\nvulnerable developing countries in the international\nsystem. Such treatment must, specifically, extend to the\nfinancial, monetary and trading system, in order to\nsupport these countries in successfully adjusting to the\ndemands of globalization.\nThe traffic in illegal drugs has become a serious\nthreat to the national security of many nations, in\nparticular the small and vulnerable ones such as\nSuriname, because it promotes violence, corruption,\nmoney-laundering and illegal arms trafficking. In this\nway, countries can be manoeuvred into dangerous waters\nand be accused of interference in the internal affairs of\nothers. It has become practically impossible for Suriname,\nwith its limited resources, to combat this scourge on its\nown. We are therefore actively pursuing bilateral\nagreements with friendly nations to assist us in this\ndifficult task. In this context, I would mention the\nagreement on cooperation in maritime law enforcement\nwhich we recently signed with the Government of the\nUnited States of America. We will continue to work\nclosely with our neighbours, with friendly nations and\nwith the relevant regional and international institutions to\ncontribute to the ongoing fight to eradicate this evil from\nour region.\nThe information superhighway, the Internet, is\nnowadays the means of choice for the exchange of\ninformation, with a great impact on the social and\neconomic life of the international community. This new\nform of technology offers great possibilities for\naccelerated development in many fields. At the same\ntime, however, we should note that the development of\nthis technology involves the risk of further marginalizing\nvulnerable economies.\nIn addition to the positive effects of the Internet, we\nsee that the adverse effects on trade, the ever widening\ngap in the field of education, the threat to social and\ncultural values and the abuse of this technology by people\nwith malicious intentions often cause great concern in\nthird world societies. I am convinced that in applying\ninnovative technology, equal attention should be given to\nthe negative effects for societies with limited or no access\nto it.\nI therefore urge the United Nations to ensure that\nthis disparity, with its far-reaching consequences in the\nsocio-economic, educational and cultural fields, is\n12\n\n\neliminated by augmenting the availability of and access to\nthis technology. Furthermore, it is of great importance to\nset up a legal framework to prevent the abuse and crime\nwhich can emanate from use of the Internet.\nThe Surinamese Government is of the opinion that its\nforeign policy must be fully at the service of its social and\neconomic development. In our view, the State should no\nlonger fulfil the role it has traditionally performed of\nbearing full responsibility for development strategies and\nacting as a dirigiste and sometimes even as a welfare State:\ndevelopment requires a State which is effective, fulfils the\nrole of catalyst and facilitator, and encourages and\ncomplements the activities of the private sector.\nGood governance is not a luxury, but an absolute\nnecessity. In addition, I should say that without an\neffectively operating State it would be impossible, from\nboth the economic and the social points of view, to\nimplement a policy for sustainable development. For\ndevelopment does not presuppose that there will be only the\nappropriate economic, social and technical inputs: in today's\nworld, sustainable development and welfare can be attained\nonly if regulations in a country are supportive so that the\nState can contribute to the effectiveness of the intended\ndevelopment.\nIt is my Government's objective to develop our natural\nresources in cooperation with identified partners in the\ninternational community in such a manner that the\nenvironment and the ecosystem will be preserved for future\ngenerations. In this light, may the unique decision by\nSuriname to offer almost 10 per cent of its territory as a\ngift to humankind by creating a nature reserve of nearly\n1.16 million hectares, serve as an example. The\nenvironment and its biodiversity shall, especially in this\nnature reserve, always be fully protected.\nThe Government of Suriname is convinced that\neffective democratic structures are fundamental to a\nsatisfactory enjoyment of democracy, so conditions have\nbeen created for the fullest development of Suriname's\ncitizens. Since the beginning of its period of administration,\nthe Government has devoted itself to strengthening\ndemocratic institutions and anchoring the rule of law. Law\nand justice, and effective institutions to implement them,\nare the basis for the comprehensive and balanced\ndevelopment of the nation.\nMy Government's policy is aimed also at promoting\nand safeguarding fundamental human rights and freedoms.\nThus, we are creating ideal conditions for the optimal\nemployment of human and natural resources in the\ninterests of the development of our nation. We realize that\ndemocracy, development, peace and social progress do\nnot enjoy special attention only within the borders of\nSuriname, but that the international community, more\nparticularly the United Nations, thoroughly examines,\npromotes and safeguards them.\nOn 25 May 2000, the Surinamese people will decide,\nthrough general and free elections by secret ballot, on the\nappointment of a national Government at the highest level\nof State. My Government and the independent institutions\ndesignated by law are engaged in preparations for the\napproaching elections. In this respect, we know we have\nthe support of the Organization of American States and\nthe United Nations, as well as other international\norganizations. Talks on possible financial assistance by\nthe European Union are in a phase of conclusion. The\nprimary goal of the Government is to hold general and\nfree elections, with the greatest possible care, by secret\nballot, and once again to confirm to the world Suriname's\nexcellent reputation in this field.\nOur world is closing this millennium, in which\nhumankind has made enormous progress in science and\ntechnology, enhancing its capacity for its own security\nand survival. The millennium has been an era of untold\nhuman suffering caused by wars waged between and\nwithin States, with the means capable of destroying all\nthat which the human race has so far achieved. It has also\nbeen an era in which many developing countries gained\nconstitutional independence. Unfortunately, however, it\nhas not brought them economic independence and hence\nactual decolonization. Consequently, their full\nparticipation in developments relating to the formation of\neconomic blocs was seriously impeded.\nThis millennium has also seen the birth of a unique\nworld Organization, the United Nations, to assist us in\novercoming the threat of complete destruction. Let us\nallow this unique instrument to assist humanity in\nachieving its noble desire for a peaceful world \u2014 a world\nwith equitable economic, trade and development systems;\na world with a protected and safe environment and\necosystem; a world in which human rights and\nfundamental freedoms are protected, promoted and\nguaranteed to all its citizens; a world with adequate\ndevelopment opportunities for everyone; a world in which\nhuman potential can be fully developed, irrespective of\nrace, sex, creed or religion; and a world from which all\ntendencies and signals regarding recolonization originating\nfrom former colonizers are banished.\n13\n\n\nLet us all, upon entering the new millennium,\ncontribute wholeheartedly to these noble goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish to express\nmy warm congratulations to you upon your election to the\npresidency of this fifty-fourth session of the United\nNations General Assembly. Your unanimous election to\nthe presidency is not only an attestation to the confidence\nwe in Africa have in your leadership ability, but is also\nan affirmation of the faith the international community\nhas in you to steer this organ successfully into the twenty-\nfirst century. You take up the helm of this body at a\ncritical juncture, when we are here taking stock of where\nwe stand on the eve of the new millennium.\nLet me avail myself of this opportunity to express\nour sincere gratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency\nMinister Didier Opertti of Uruguay, who presided over\nthe affairs of this Assembly in a diligent and exemplary\nmanner. We thank him for his conscientious efforts and\nsterling contribution.\nMay I also express our great appreciation of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, having\nrecognized the great opportunities and challenges ahead\nof us, has worked tirelessly to help us map a noble vision\nfor the future of our Organization.\n6\n\n\nWe are also witnessing another historic moment for\nour Organization, as we admit into our midst three new\nmembers: Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga. We welcome them to\nour brotherhood of nations and wish them all the best as\nthey chart their own destinies and make their contribution\nwithin our community of nations.\nOn our African continent, the holding of free and fair\nelections in Nigeria has ushered in a democratic\ndispensation worthy of our attention. This transformation\nserves as a monument erected to inform the international\ncommunity that Africa has said \\\"No\\\" to the\ninstitutionalization of the route map from barracks to the\nState House, which hitherto the military has traversed with\nimpunity. Further, the return to peace and democracy in\nLiberia and Sierra Leone bears ample testimony to Africa\u2019s\nrenewed quest for democracy, peace and stability. It is,\ntherefore, our fervent hope that the implementation of these\npeace agreements will lead to the restoration of normality\nin the region.\nIn the same spirit, the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) alliance intervened in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo to uphold one of the most\nfundamental tenets of the United Nations Charter: respect\nfor the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nAggression, under whatever pretext, should be condemned\nand opposed by the United Nations. We are, therefore,\nencouraged by the eventual participation of the rebels in the\npeace process.\nWe wish to register our most sincere gratitude to His\nExcellency President Chiluba of Zambia for his untiring\nefforts that succeeded in bringing the rebels on board this\npeace process. It must be emphasized, though, that the\nsuccess or failure of a peacekeeping mission to the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo will be determined by\nthe availability of both human and material resources. We\nare, however, worried that an inadequately funded\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo peacekeeping operation\nwould be a clear manifestation of Africa\u2019s increasing\nmarginalization in the new world order. We trust, therefore,\nthat the United Nations will now render the requisite\nsupport to sustain this achievement.\nWe find this an opportune moment to call upon the\ninternational community not only to put its full weight\nbehind African peace initiatives, but also to assess and\nbuttress the institutional and operational capacity of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) in the prevention,\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts in Africa. In this\nvein, we hail the European Union\u2019s declaration that its\nfuture engagement with the belligerents involved in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo conflict would depend\non the latter\u2019s fulfilment of their obligations as spelt out\nin the Lusaka ceasefire agreement.\nSadly, the gains that we registered in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo peace process are being negated\nby the renewed bloodbath in Angola, where, for the\nsecond time this decade, UNITA has resumed war,\ndisregarding the 1994 Lusaka Peace Agreement. We\ntherefore call upon the international community to put in\nplace effective mechanisms that tighten the embargo\nagainst UNITA, particularly in the light of the recently\nconcluded mission of Ambassador Robert Fowler,\nChairman of the Security Council sanctions committee on\nUNITA.\nZimbabwe hails the acceptance by Eritrea and\nEthiopia of the OAU Framework Agreement to end the\nwar in the Horn of Africa. Zimbabwe, as a member of the\nhigh-level committee that coordinated the effort to end the\nwar between the two African States, calls upon the United\nNations to undergird this successful regional peace\ninitiative with the necessary technical and other resources\nto make the process irreversible and permanent.\nSince its inception the United Nations has had on its\nagenda a concern for economic and social development.\nThe follow-up to the implementation of the goals of the\nWorld Summit for Social Development is currently being\nassessed, and it has become evident that a potentially\nexplosive social situation confronts the world today. The\nsoaring levels of unemployment, the deteriorating\nstandards of living, the abject poverty in most\ndeveloping countries, especially on our continent, Africa,\nare cause for serious concern.\nWe note that Africa\u2019s fortunes have continued to\nworsen despite the continent\u2019s best efforts. Growth\nslowed in the majority of African countries and, at 2.6 per\ncent in 1998, average gross domestic product for all of\nAfrica fell far short of the eight per cent annual growth\nrate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable of\nsignificantly reducing poverty levels on the continent.\nAdverse factors that contribute to this decline include\nslower growth of the world economy, declining\ncommodity prices, the contagious effects of the Asian\nfinancial crisis, the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, civil strife\nand political turmoil in several spots.\nAt a time when greater challenges and opportunities\nare emerging within the context of globalization, it is\n7\n\n\ncrucial that Africa\u2019s nagging vulnerabilities are highlighted\nand addressed. Total African export revenues fell by nearly\n$14 billion in 1998, to just $112 billion, an 11 per cent\ndrop from the 1997 level, mainly due to price declines.\nThat negative trend has continued in 1999.\nWe are concerned that at a time when prospects for\naid effectiveness in Africa are improving significantly,\nofficial development assistance to Africa has fallen to its\nlowest level. Between 1993 and 1997, total aid receipts in\nAfrica fell by nearly 13 per cent, from $21 billion to $18.7\nbillion. At this rate, official development assistance flows\nhave fallen far short of the $30 billion a year that\neconomists estimate is needed to reduce poverty in Africa.\nThe net rate of return on investment in African\ncountries remains higher than in other developing countries.\nIt was estimated at 20 to 30 per cent during 1990 to 1994,\non average, as opposed to 16 to 18 per cent for all\ndeveloping countries. Yet in contrast to this great potential,\nAfrica has not been a significant beneficiary of the dramatic\nincrease in global foreign direct investment flows.\nAfrica\u2019s debt is essentially non-payable and certainly\nunsustainable under any sensible growth-oriented\nmacroeconomic scenario. There is an urgent need to release\nmore resources from debt servicing to financing\ndevelopment and creating conditions that encourage inflows\nof private foreign investment. Although the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative constitutes\nan important mechanism for debt relief, its eligibility\ncriteria are rather restrictive. While the need for better debt\nmanagement by Africa in the future is acknowledged, any\ncredible solution to Africa\u2019s debt problem must indeed\nentail substantial debt cancellation.\nWe in Africa are therefore fully persuaded that it is\ntime the international community deliberates on the\nsubstance and prospects for new aid modalities which\nemphasize a holistic and comprehensive approach. There is\nneed for us to share views on how best to foster a new\ndonor-beneficiary relationship in which multi-donor\nprogrammes focus on supporting an African-driven agenda.\nIn our own region of southern Africa, we are at an\nadvanced stage of setting up a trade protocol meant to\nmaximize our earnings from trade. With a majority of our\nmembers having ratified this protocol, only a couple more\nremain before it is operational.\nWe are also keenly aware of the critical role of\ntelecommunications as an effective vehicle for successful\ninternational trade. Accordingly, my country only recently\nagreed to be a subregional host for the AFRITEL, an\nAfrican regional telecommunications centre. We trust that\ninternational investors will see this as positive\npreparedness on the part of our continent not only to\nattract them and their investments, but indeed to\nconcretely ensure that they also prosper in their\nendeavours on our continent.\nThe United Nations decade for the progressive\ndevelopment and codification of international law is\ncoming to a close on an important note, with the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court.\nHowever, the Court can be successful only if it is\nuniversally accepted. We must, therefore, lend our\nunwavering support to this process so that we can\ncomplete this important milestone in the history of our\nOrganization.\nAs we look into the new millennium, let us aspire to\nhave an international order that espouses the twin\nobjectives of universal peace and security on the one\nhand, and an improved quality of life for all the earth\u2019s\ninhabitants on the other. It must be an order characterized\nby justice and respect for international law. Such\ninternational law must surely have the effect of restraining\nboth regional and international belligerent countries. We\nshould join enthusiastically in the promotion of the\nachievements of the decade for the development of\ninternational law.\nZimbabwe is greatly disturbed at the cataclysmic\nturn of events in East Timor following the self-\ndetermination referendum there. The crisis chronicled in\nthe report of the Security Council Mission to Jakarta and\nDili was most disquieting. Zimbabwe therefore welcomes\nthe deployment of the multinational force to restore peace\nand security in East Timor and to facilitate the delivery of\nhumanitarian assistance. We sincerely hope that the\nSecurity Council will soon authorize the deployment of a\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force whose financial and\nother resource requirements are vouched for by the entire\nmembership of this Organization.\nIt would be remiss of me not to mention how\ninequitable it is that the membership of the Security\nCouncil should remain unreflective of the vastly altered\ninternational circumstances. The need for the reform of\nthe Security Council is no longer just a lofty ideal we\nstrive to achieve, but a prerequisite for the very existence\nof this Organization. The Security Council, as a principal\norgan of the United Nations, is entrusted to act on behalf\n8\n\n\nof the entire membership, which to date has risen to 188\ncountries. The stark realities of the situation in the world\nmust be reflected not only in the sheer increase in numbers,\nbut also in consideration of the democratic principle of\nequitable geographical representation and participation.\nIt is grossly unjust that we, the developing countries,\nshould remain totally unrepresented in the permanent\nmembership of a body entrusted with such power and\nauthority. The powers and privileges that the current\nmembers of the Security Council enjoy should be extended\nto all new members if the Council is to be effective.\nAnd so, as we hold the last session of the General\nAssembly in the current millennium, it behooves us to\nmake one giant leap into the future, not only in terms of\nwise and bold decisions, but also in terms of the\ncommitment to implement them and see them bear fruit for\nus and for posterity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab on his election to the presidency of this session of\nthe General Assembly. I am confident that his vision and\nenergy will guide this session to a successful conclusion.\nI also thank Mr. Didier Opertti, who led the fifty-third\nsession of the General Assembly with remarkable\ndistinction and efficiency. I commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nesteemed Secretary-General of this Organization, of whom\nthe people of the Caribbean are particularly proud for his\nvision and managerial skills as he heads the United Nations,\nin precarious financial circumstances, responding to\nincreased demands with diminishing resources. I wish to\nassure the Secretary-General of the continued support and\ncooperation of the Government of Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines.\nI join previous speakers in welcoming the Republic\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga as new Members of the United Nations family.\nTheir membership strengthens the universal character of\nour Organization.\nI extend condolences to the families of the victims\nof the earthquakes in Turkey, Greece and, more recently,\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan. I reiterate the\nsentiments of sympathy already transmitted to the\nGovernment and people of the Bahamas, a sister country\nin the Caribbean Community, and to the United States of\nAmerica in relation to the devastation wrought by\nHurricane Floyd.\nThe fifty-fourth anniversary of the founding of the\nUnited Nations, coming at the end of a century that has\nseen war and destruction on the one hand and\nunprecedented developments in science and technology on\nthe other, provides a timely opportunity to reflect on the\nOrganization's achievements, assess its continued\nrelevance in a radically changed environment and chart an\nappropriate course of action for the future. Many\npowerful forces believe that the United Nations has\nperhaps outlived its usefulness and exists now only as the\nworld's most expensive debating club. Ministers of\nFinance are presently convened in Washington, D.C., at\nthe annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund\nand the World Bank Group. There, too, the opinion can\nno doubt be heard that circumstances have now overtaken\nthe Bretton Woods institutions.\nThe big and powerful nations of the world can\nafford to argue thus, but for small, vulnerable, developing\ncountries such as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, these\ninstitutions are important buffers in the interplay between\nfinance and politics in the international arena. The\noperating budgets of many transnational corporations are\nfar greater than the national budgets of developing\ncountries such as mine, and we are painfully aware that\nthe international development agenda is controlled by\nthese corporations.\nDespite the technological advances of the last decade\nand the tremendous increase in worldwide commerce, the\nbenefits of globalization have not been evenly distributed\nand it is abundantly clear that developing countries\ncontinue to be marginalized. While we acknowledge and\n25\n\n\nrespect the general thrust towards open markets,\ncompetition and free trade, I must reiterate my country's\nposition regarding our vital trade in bananas. Even as we\nmove to diversify, improve quality and pursue alternative\nstrategies and options for development in tourism, financial\nservices and informatics, our economic survival and social\nstability remain closely linked to the banana trade and the\nincome it provides for our farmers. Indeed, there is a strong\nand persistent correlation between the rate of economic\ngrowth and the performance of the industry. This is further\nillustrated by the following facts: in Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines, the contribution of the banana industry to direct\nemployment is 40 per cent; in the Windward Islands as a\nwhole, banana export earnings account for over 50 per cent\nof the gross domestic product; and windward Islands\nexports account for only 1 per cent of the world trade in\nbananas.\nThe imminent collapse of our major banana market\ndemonstrates just how powerless small developing States\ncontinue to be against powerful countries and mega-\ncorporations. The disregard for our interests and, indeed,\nour survival, by the United States of America, which does\nnot export a single hand of bananas, is truly inexplicable.\nThe inevitable consequences of this stance will be economic\nand social dislocation, manifested in increased\nunemployment, impoverishment for our farmers, crime and\nthe erosion of basic human rights and dignity.\nThe iniquitous and restrictive immigration policies of\ncertain developed countries have served only to exacerbate\nthe social disintegration of our societies, which are already\nunder severe stress.\nIf small developing economies are to be able to attract\ninvestment, expand production, improve product quality and\nmeet standards \u2014 in short, compete effectively and grasp\nthe opportunities presented in the World Trade Organization\nagreements \u2014 it is imperative that recognition should be\ngiven to their need for support and for adequate transitional\nperiods to fully liberalized world trade, which should apply\nalso to the banana trade.\nAs a corollary to our overall economic development\nstrategy, the Government of Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines continues to explore, with the assistance of\nfriendly nations, options for enhanced airport development\non mainland Saint Vincent. The requirements for\nagricultural and economic diversification make this\nendeavour even more urgent.\nWe are exceptionally grateful to the European Union\nfor the support which it is continuing to give to ensure\nour survival, even in the face of threats to its own\neconomic prosperity. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is\ninvolved, with other members of the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM), in a fundamental process of\ndeepening regional integration through the establishment\nof a single market and economy by 2001. We are taking\nimportant steps to facilitate the free movement of goods,\nservices, capital and people in the countries of the\nCommunity. We are doing this at a time when the\nmomentum of trade liberalization and economic\nglobalization has never been greater.\nThe region is also committed to the establishment of\nthe Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2004.\nCARICOM has established regional negotiating\nmachinery to coordinate the region's participation in\nexternal trade negotiations, including the Seattle Round of\nmultinational trade negotiations.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is resolute in its\nopposition to the international trade in drugs. To this end,\nmy Government is moving bilaterally and with member\ncountries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States\nand CARICOM, to establish agreements with third\ncountries on mutual assistance in criminal matters. The\nGovernment of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\nrecognizing its own limitations in confronting the\nenormous power and resources of drug traffickers, has\nsigned a \u201cship rider\u201d agreement that gives authority to\npursue such criminals in the territorial waters of our\narchipelagic State.\nGovernments in the small developing countries of\nthe Caribbean pay a high political price for cooperating\nwith the developed countries in the fight against drugs.\nThere were loud protests from certain sections of the\npopulation against the Government when the security\nforces of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, in\ncollaboration with the Regional Security Service and\ncontingents from other friendly countries, launched an\neradication campaign in our mountainous interior: they\nquestioned the Government's cooperation at a time when\naccess for bananas and other products from the Caribbean\nto the European market was being challenged.\nMy Government will continue to honour its\ncommitments under all international agreements to which\nwe are signatory. We have enacted appropriate stringent\nmeasures in our financial regulations to ensure that\nproceeds from the illicit drug trade are not laundered in\n26\n\n\nour financial system. The efforts of economically vulnerable\ncountries such as ours in combatting the scourge of drugs\nmust be recognized and supported by the international\ncommunity in general, and by traditionally friendly\ncountries in particular.\nOur countries do not wish to be forced out of the\nworld trade in legitimate products, causing our peoples to\nturn in desperation to trafficking in illegal products. In\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines and in other countries\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), we\nbelieve in stability based on a solid foundation of\ndemocracy, respect for human rights and the creation of\neconomic and other opportunities for the development of\nour peoples. CARICOM has built an outstanding record in\nthis regard. The recent mission to Haiti headed by our own\nPrime Minister, The Right Honourable Sir James Mitchell,\nto examine that country's readiness to conduct general\nelections, is another example of CARICOM's commitment\nto those principles.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines places very high\npriority on education, training and human-resource\ndevelopment. These are a very important part of the\ndeclaration of principles adopted by the leaders of the 34\ncountries of the western hemisphere at the second Summit\nof the Americas, held at Santiago, Chile, in 1998.\nI take this opportunity to reiterate the gratitude of the\nGovernment and the people of Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines to the Government and the people of Cuba,\nwhich despite their difficult economic circumstances,\ncaused by the continuing trade embargo against that\nCaribbean country, have offered numerous scholarships to\nthe young people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines places great value on this\nunmistakable act of friendship and assistance.\nSmall island developing States such as Saint Vincent\nand the Grenadines attach great importance to such issues\nas the integrity of our coastal and marine resources, solid-\nwaste management and natural-disaster preparedness,\nbecause we are conscious of the negative repercussions that\ncan result if effective measures are not put in place. We run\nthe risk of damaging our fragile ecosystems to the\ndetriment of development and tourism, and moreover\ncompromising their sustainable use and enjoyment by future\ngenerations. It is for that reason that CARICOM condemns\nin the strongest terms the shipment of hazardous material\nthrough the territorial waters of the Caribbean countries.\nWithout the benefit of scientific proof of the origins and\nreasons for the recent fish kill in our waters, there is cause\nfor serious concern; investigation in this regard is\nongoing. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines shares the\nconcerns expressed by other small island developing\nStates and strongly supports the adoption of a draft\nresolution on small island developing States recognizing\nthe Caribbean Sea as a special area in the context of\nsustainable development.\nThe vulnerability of small States has been made\nmore acute because of lack of capacity, declining aid\nflows, graduation from concessionary financing, the\ndisappearance of trade preferences, and a lack of\ncompetitiveness. The implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States is therefore imperative for\nour survival.\nMy delegation fully supports the efforts of the\ninternational community in addressing the conflicts in\nKosovo and in East Timor. We look forward to lasting\npeace and stability in those areas.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines also applauds the\nefforts and commitment of Prime Minister Barak of Israel\nand Chairman Arafat of the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization to bring peace and security to the people of\ntheir region.\nA draft resolution on the readmission to this body of\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan was once again\ndefeated. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, however,\nstrongly supports the aspiration of those 21 million people\nto exercise their right to share and participate in the\nactivities of this community of nations.\nMy country has consistently expressed its views in\nrelation to reform of the United Nations in general and of\nthe Security Council in particular. I will not revisit them\nnow, but I wish to reiterate that Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines strongly favours reform of the United Nations\nto give more equitable consideration to the concerns of\nthe majority of countries comprising the General\nAssembly. Let us remodel it along more democratic lines\nto address the realities of the world today.\nAs we approach the new millennium, my delegation\nwould like to urge all Member States to demonstrate their\nunwavering support for the goals and ideals enshrined in\nthe Charter of the United Nations: peace, security, human\nrights, fundamental freedoms, international cooperation,\nand development for all mankind.\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all,\npermit me to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs\nof Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly. I would also like to\nexpress words of gratitude to Mr. Didier Opertti Bad\u00e1n for\nhis dynamic and competent work during the entire course\nof the preceding session.\nFor the United Nations, last year \u2014 if it were\nmeasured by the magnitude of military and political\nupheavals \u2014 would be equal to a calendar year that thrust\nupon mankind natural calamities that had catastrophic\neffects on people. In many respects it was a year from\nwhich we had to draw lessons. It made us ponder seriously\nthe political survival of States and the physical protection\nof people. It made us take a fresh look at the system of\ninternational relations, which was helpless in the face of the\nnew challenges of the times. Nowadays we can no longer\nwrite everything off as costs of the cold war.\nThat is why we have paid special attention to the part\nof the Secretary-General\u2019s report in which he tried to give\na analysis of present-day conflicts. Those conflicts, because\nof the nature of their origins and the dynamics of their\nevolution, did not always yield to traditional forms and\nmethods for their successful resolution. There is a fact\ndescribed in the report that requires special consideration,\nnamely, that over the past decade 90 per cent of armed\nconflicts took place inside States and not between them.\nThis phenomenon shows how relevant the problem of\nstatehood is, as well as defining the correct orientation, in\nchoosing the road to development in today\u2019s world. The\npreservation of national unity, inter-ethnic harmony and\nsocial guarantees, coupled with a reasonable pace of\nreform, can today be considered as the basic universal\ncriteria for ensuring the peaceful development of every\nnation. This statement is substantiated by the experience\nof our newly independent State, which managed to avoid\nmany cataclysms in the difficult period of its emerging\nstatehood.\nThis is the eighth time that Turkmenistan has taken\npart in a session of the General Assembly as an\nindependent subject of international relations. Without the\nactive support of our friends, it would be hard to imagine\nthe state of Turkmenistan\u2019s development today, which\nallows us to look with optimism at the future and to\nestablish long-term programmes of social and economic\ndevelopment. In this regard, we are grateful to our close\nneighbours \u2014 Iran, Russia, Turkey, Pakistan, China and\nIndia \u2014 and our partners in the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe. From a conceptual point of\nview, the system of Turkmenistan\u2019s international relations\nis based on sincerity and reciprocity of mutual interests,\nneutrality and non-alignment, which form the two pillars\nof our statehood.\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to\nexpress words of gratitude to the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and to emphasize its\nlarge-scale activities, which merit all-round support. The\nGovernment of Turkmenistan, together with UNDP, has\nundertaken a number of major national projects that have\nyielded concrete results in the reforms of the social\nsphere, public health, the system of education and other\nareas. Turkmenistan intends to continue to maintain close\nties with that important agency of the United Nations,\nwith the aim of identifying and implementing new\nopportunities for cooperation. In view of the major\ndevelopment tasks lying ahead, UNDP personifies for us\nthe United Nations system as a whole.\nPurposeful cooperation between specialized agencies\nof the United Nations and national Governments makes it\npossible to identify the main parameters of the conflict-\nprevention strategy in each individual region. Ever-\nincreasing flows of refugees and displaced persons to\n44\n\n\nneighbouring countries from conflict areas and zones of\nnational disasters are fraught with a certain potential for\ntension. As regards this important matter, we attach great\nimportance to the work of the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The\nGovernment of Turkmenistan, together with UNHCR, is\nimplementing an ad hoc programme of assistance to\nrefugees that is based on a joint plan of action.\nIn close relation to the above subject, I would like to\ndraw attention to the situation in Afghanistan, which\ncontinues to cause serious concern. Historically,\nTurkmenistan had close fraternal ties with that long-\nsuffering nation. Hence, we have a sincere interest in the\nre-establishment of peace and the restoration of\nAfghanistan. Since the first days of independence,\nTurkmenistan built its relations with Afghanistan on the\nbasis of mutual trust and respect. Our position is absolutely\ntransparent and clear: neutrality with respect to the parties\nto the conflict; a constructive attitude towards and a due\naccounting of the realities of today\u2019s Afghanistan; a desire\nto engage conflicting parties in a dialogue; and creative\neconomic reconstruction programmes.\nIt is precisely this desire that underpinned our\ninitiative of holding two rounds of direct inter-Afghan talks\nin Ashgabat early this year, which were supported by the\ntwo key factions and bore fruit, giving hope for the future.\nHowever, in our opinion, this process did not receive\nadequate support from the outside, from those who are\nmore prone to making declarations of good intentions and\nadvancing their own interests rather than taking practical\nsteps to help the Afghan people. Turkmenistan has been\nworking on the Afghan issue and will continue to work on\nit under any format of international cooperation, including\nthe mechanism of the \u201csix plus two\u201d group under the\nauspices of the United Nations, as that mechanism\npossesses an enormous untapped potential. We all have\ngrounds to raise this issue because we have actually\nencountered a situation that may not be the best one for the\nUnited Nations, which has financed a Special Mission in\nAfghanistan \u2014 a Mission that until now has failed to\nproduce any practical results. Smoothly written reports\nshould not substitute for real political work in the field.\nWe share a commonly held view that the United\nNations system needs rational reform in the twenty-first\ncentury. The Millennium Assembly, on the theme of the\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century, will become a\nmajor landmark in this process, and Turkmenistan\nwholeheartedly supports the idea of holding such a session.\nThat Assembly could provide a unique opportunity to\nidentify the problems that we will face in the future and\nto undertake a creative process of strengthening and\nenhancing this unique institution.\nStatements by heads of delegations at the current\nsession contain many ideas regarding the need to reform\nthe United Nations and the Security Council and to\nbalance the right of veto, among many others.\nTurkmenistan adheres to the view that while seeking to\nimprove the situation, the most important thing is to take\na well-considered and balanced approach to the solution\nof the issues concerning the destiny of the Organization,\nrather than cause it harm by becoming hostage to\nemotions. It is our opinion that while encountering some\nglitches in the work of the mechanism, we should not\nrush into its complete replacement but should try to\nproperly diagnose the weakness in the available resources.\nIt may be a case of the problem not being in the system\nitself, but rather in those who are called to represent it at\nvarious levels.\nTurning once again to the problem of the elaboration\nand implementation of a system to prevent conflicts and\nensure safe development, I would like to emphasize that\nthe foreign policy course of neutrality pursued from the\noutset by Turkmenistan has always been aimed at\nprecisely this goal. It is explicitly mentioned in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report that the struggle for control\nover economic resources is one of the main causes of\nconflicts. Therefore the implementation of the foreign\npolicy initiative concerning Turkmenistan\u2019s permanent\nneutrality, in the form of a special resolution adopted by\nthe General Assembly on 12 December 1995, has a very\nimportant meaning in this regard. The development of the\nextremely rich hydrocarbon resources of the Caspian\nbasin is tied to the interests not only of regional countries\nbut also to those of major Powers and transnational\ncompanies. Turkmenistan\u2019s neutrality is aimed at a\nsituation of combined rather than conflicting interests.\nWe believe that in today\u2019s world there can, and\nshould, exist zones of interest, but we resolutely oppose\nthe concept of spheres of influence. The issue concerning\nthe status of the Caspian Sea is highly relevant in this\nrespect. We have on numerous occasions stated our\nposition on this issue: we would like to prevent the work\non the status of the Caspian Sea from turning from an\ninternational law problem into a political problem. In any\ncase, we consider it appropriate at this forum to draw\nattention to this issue, so that we can avoid the\npoliticization of issues concerning the legal definition and\ndevelopment of the energy resources of the sea and\n45\n\n\nunderline Turkmenistan\u2019s readiness for constructive\npartnership and clearly defined reasonable compromises.\nThe highly complex nature of the tasks facing States\nMembers of the United Nations is clear. The momentous\nchallenges confronting the Organization are commensurate\nwith the hopes of people around the globe, who believe that\nreal change for the better will take place with the change of\nepochs. This concerns both large and small nations, the rich\nand the poor, newly independent and long-existing States.\nWe all face challenges that can be overcome only by means\nof collective efforts, recognizing at the same time individual\nresponsibilities. Such is the logic of Turkmenistan\u2019s\npolitical behaviour and its readiness to be an active Member\nof the Organization.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should\nlike at the outset, Sir, warmly to congratulate you on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly, which\nmarks the opening of the regular annual session. Your wise\nand dynamic leadership will determine the scope and\noutcome of our work.\nI would like also to thank Mr. Didier Opertti for his\ndedication and commitment throughout the fifty-third\nsession of the General Assembly.\nLet me also reiterate Luxembourg's confidence, given\nour Secretary-General's characteristic tireless determination\nto promote dialogue, knowledge and mutual recognition,\nthat his efforts will lead to greater mutual understanding.\nThe respect accorded to, and the effectiveness of, our\nOrganization will depend on the strong cohesiveness of its\nmembership. Within its modest means, my country intends\nto contribute to this key objective. Luxembourg is proud of\nhaving participated in the definition of the European\nUnion's core positions. These were explained to the\nAssembly by Mrs. Tarja Halonen, the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Finland, in the statement she made in her\ncapacity as current Chairman-in-Office of the European\nUnion.\nThis fall will mark the tenth anniversary of the end of\nthe cold war, which for more than four decades hampered\nthe harmonious development of international relations.\nAmong other things, it prevented our Organization from\nfully discharging its mandate to maintain international\npeace and cooperation. This anniversary is definitely a\nhappy one, even if much of what had been hoped for in\n1989 has failed to materialize and the consequences of\ncertain upheavals are still being felt.\nNonetheless, today's international environment has\nseen far-reaching changes, and the international\ncommunity is now in a position to tackle very complex\nchallenges. My country hopes that this historic\nbreakthrough at century's end will be further consolidated.\nToday is my first opportunity to represent my\ncountry from this rostrum and to address the Assembly,\nwhich comprises nearly all the countries of the world.\nLuxembourg is one of the founding Members of our\nOrganization, and in October 1945, it was the smallest.\nOur presence in San Francisco was due to our\ndetermination to cooperate with the international\ncommunity and to reaffirm our sovereignty. Today I\nwould reiterate the commitment of the people of\nLuxembourg to our Organization, which is called upon to\nplay a pivotal role in an international environment that is\nbecoming increasingly globalized yet, at the same time,\nmore and more fragmented.\nWhile the first aspect of this process, globalization,\nis most apparent in the economic field, the second,\nfragmentation, is more clearly felt in the political arena,\nas social inequities are increasing. This process will\nundoubtedly result in very complex tensions, heightening\nthose that already exist and creating new ones. These will\nhave to be analyzed and dealt with; to do this we will\nneed imagination, clear-sightedness and, above all, an\neffective resolve and capacity to act. Our security and\nprosperity will depend on the way in which our\nOrganization confronts these challenges.\nIt would be unrealistic to expect a solution from the\nOrganization every time humanitarian disaster strikes or\na conflict breaks out. There is no such thing as a world\ngovernment, and it would be a disservice to the United\nNations to fail to acknowledge this obvious fact.\nNevertheless, the United Nations is a platform and\na forum for negotiations at the global level, and we\nshould therefore exert every effort to ensure its smooth\nfunctioning. To do this it must have adequate funding to\nduty bound to respect their Charter obligation to pay in\nfull, unconditionally and on time the amounts they owe to\nthe Organization. This also means that increasingly, the\n13\n\n\nmajor political orientations of the Organization are decided\nupon by consensus, thereby ensuring the support of all\nStates for its actions. It also means that the effort to update\nand reform the United Nations mechanisms still remains\nfully relevant.\nIt is only through cooperation, understanding and\nsolidarity, together with respect for commitments entered\ninto and for the rule of law, that progress towards a true\ncohesiveness will be possible. All the Members of our\nOrganization are directly responsible for ensuring that their\ncontribution to the common undertaking and to its progress\nis not lacking. This was the case during the decision to\ncreate an International Criminal Court. We have thus\nreached an important stage in the field of international\nethics and morality by providing ourselves with an\ninstrument through which those responsible for atrocities in\ntime of war and for crimes against humanity will be held\nto account. The international community will henceforth be\nmore vigilant and will no longer allow those who have been\nfound guilty of such crimes to continue to enjoy impunity.\nMy country will ratify the Statute of the Court as soon as\npossible, and we hope that it will soon become a reality.\nMy country's profound commitment to the European\nUnion, which is preparing to enlarge its membership, is a\nsure reflection of our strong aspiration to strengthen both\nthe internal cohesion of the countries of the region and to\npromote cooperation at an international level. The\ncontribution of the European Union to the life of our\nOrganization is intended to be a driving force for its further\ndevelopment.\nSmall countries like mine tend to develop an acute\nawareness of their own vulnerability. This is often further\naggravated by a considerable difficulty: that of making\nknown to our foreign partners a little-known national\nreality. That explains our commitment to the vitality and\nsmooth functioning of intergovernmental organizations. For\nus, the United Nations represents an irreplaceable forum for\nthe exchange of ideas and experiences, but to an even\ngreater extent it must be a tool for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, development and respect\nfor universal values.\nA new Government has just taken office in\nLuxembourg. Its first task will be to ensure the continuity\nof our foreign commitments. But it also intends consistently\nto develop our policy of demonstrating our presence,\nparticipation and solidarity at the international level. This\ndetermination will be expressed through the major\nintergovernmental organizations, which define the rules of\ncoexistence between nations and peoples. The United\nNations unquestionably takes pride of place among them.\nMy Government also intends to further develop its\nrelations with the more remote regions of the world. This\nis an effort to respond to a real deficiency, which can be\nexplained by our size and our limited human resources. It\nis important for us to remedy that situation through a\nbalanced programme of contacts. The United Nations, and\nthe presence of numerous delegations at United Nations\nHeadquarters in New York and at Geneva, will doubtless\nprovide us opportunities conducive to achieving that end.\nThe United Nations Development Programme\nHuman Development Report this year undertakes an in-\ndepth analysis of the phenomenon of globalization. It\nclearly brings out the beneficial aspects and the\nopportunities provided by this process, while at the same\ntime showing the negative consequences, which are very\nserious and worrying: instability in financial relations,\nhigh unemployment, an unsteady job market, the ravages\nof AIDS, the increasing inequalities between North and\nSouth, the extension of those inequalities to the field of\nknowledge and the constantly growing marginalization of\na large number of developing countries.\nThe political and social effects of these\ndevelopments are no less worrying: increased\nimpoverishment, new forms of crime and violence,\nincreased migration, the destabilization of States and the\ngrowing number of conflicts. Faced with these issues, the\nStates Members of this Organization have a major\nresponsibility to assume. The proposals contained in the\nreport therefore deserve constructive examination, and my\ndelegation is ready to take part in it. Ensuring that there\nis a social and ethical dimension to globalization, agreeing\non new rules for good world governance and protecting\nthe environment are some of the major issues to be\nagreed on in forthcoming discussions. That is why we\nintend to deepen our commitment in areas related to\nhuman development.\nThe fight against poverty, which the United Nations\nhas declared to be a priority objective, cannot be\nconducted only in the economic sphere. It should be part\nof an overall plan that also deals with related factors such\nas the lack of family care facilities, shortcomings in\neducation and health and insufficient administrative\nstructures. A reallocation of resources is also required as\npart of this effort. In that spirit, Luxembourg is now in\nthe process of meeting the targets of our Organization.\nStarting in the year 2000, it will be devoting 0.7 per cent\n14\n\n\nof its gross national product to official development\nassistance. The Government of Luxembourg has decided to\nincrease that contribution to 1 per cent of its gross national\nproduct over the next five years. Education and health will\nbe priority areas for our cooperation.\nDuring the negotiations in the Millennium Round in\nthe World Trade Organization we must take account of that\ncontext and pay particular attention to the interests of the\ndeveloping countries. We also support all the efforts\ndesigned to alleviate the debt problem, particularly in the\ncase of the least developed countries.\nThe vast majority of the people of Luxembourg uphold\na model of society that strikes a fair balance between free\nenterprise and social justice. This model of a social market\neconomy ensures development and social cohesion, even if\nit may require periodic adjustment. This should prove an\ninspiration at the regional and international levels.\nThrough the experience that we have gained over one\nand a half centuries of independence, Luxembourg is\nconvinced that the principles of democracy, respect for\nhuman rights, the functioning of the rule of law and the\ntransparent and ordered management of public affairs are\nthe essential elements that help to promote development.\nThe major conferences that have taken place during the past\ndecade on the subjects of human rights, social development,\npopulation, the advancement of women and human\nsettlements have opened a new era of constructive dialogue\nand shared responsibility, which has made a major\ncontribution to defining and redefining the action of the\nUnited Nations in the field of development. We must\nensure that henceforth there will be coordinated, integrated\nand effective follow-up to the steps that have been taken.\nThose who represent civil society, the non-\ngovernmental organizations, are essential partners of our\nGovernments in the implementation of the programmes and\naction plans developed and adopted during the major\nconferences. It is those people who work in the field in\ndirect contact with women, men and children who are at the\nvery centre or our efforts. We therefore attach great\nimportance to their close association with the follow-up\nprocess for the conferences and the preparations for future\nactivities.\nOther meetings are in preparation, notably those on the\nsubjects of racism and development financing. Each of\nthese initiatives is part of our effort to promote a fairer and\nmore equitable society, both internationally and within our\nown national societies. The United Nations serves as a\ncatalyst in this process. It is undeniable that in this field\nour Organization has found an innovative and useful role\nto play.\nIt is indeed paradoxical that a decade that was\noriginally marked by a desire for openness has ended with\na disturbing new outbreak of bloody conflicts and\npractices that we thought had become things of the past.\nHow can we overlook the growing number of\nhumanitarian tragedies and fail to see the increasing\nexpressions of nationalism, intolerance and refusal to\naccept those who are different? They highlight the\nhistorical or newly erected barriers which have made\nimpractical any dialogue between majorities and\nminorities.\nIn these circumstances, there is a new requirement.\nAs the Secretary-General has said, strict adherence to the\ntraditional concept of State sovereignty is no longer\nsufficient to meet present-day realities. We must\ninvestigate new ways to live together in society that will\nrespect the character of each individual. We must find\nways to improve the functioning of democracy so that it\nwill be better able to accommodate internal diversity.\nThis Organization, especially the organ responsible\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\nhas not been given sufficient means to adapt to new\nsituations. The structures of the Security Council are\ninadequate after several decades during which it has been\nimpossible to carry out a thorough review. Although\ndiscussions on Council reform have been under way for\nmore than five years, there is a prevailing feeling of\npowerlessness. It seems unlikely that any new movement\ncan result from the repeated clash of known positions.\nSince last autumn, Security Council action has been\nhamstrung by the reemergence of schisms harking back\nto a bygone age. Now as then, the result is an inability to\nact, so the matter of Iraq has been bogged down. For\nmore than a year, Council members have been unable to\nwork together and formulate a viable monitoring system\nthat would guarantee that the Iraqi regime no longer\npossesses weapons of mass destruction. This dispute\nbenefits only those who continue to flout international\nlaw. The credibility of the United Nations can hardly gain\nfrom this prevarication.\nThe recent political and humanitarian crisis in\nKosovo has shown that the community of nations no\nlonger has either sufficient determination or sufficient\nmeans to prevent tragedies of that scale. In the face of the\n15\n\n\nhorror of ethnic cleansing, a number of countries were\nobliged to shoulder their responsibilities. The tragic\ndeterioration of the situation on the ground and the lack of\nrealism at the negotiating table made military action\ninevitable. My country demonstrated its active solidarity\nduring that tragedy, because a passive response to such\ncrimes is no more acceptable in the international arena than\nit is at home. Today, pacification is under way in Kosovo,\nbut minorities must be protected, respect for the law must\nbe guaranteed, and democratic institutions must be set up.\nThe Organization, in collaboration with other institutions,\nhas taken these tasks in hand.\nThe international community's commitment to build\nmulti-ethnic, multicultural, democratic societies in the\nBalkans holds out to the Serbian leadership and the Serbian\npopulation the prospect of a peaceful, secure and\nprosperous future in the community of Europe. It is up to\nthem to seize this opportunity.\nThe Secretary-General has said that United Nations\naction cannot stop until stability, security and peace return\nto the entire African continent. That goal is far from having\nbeen achieved, with serious conflicts taking place in central\nAfrica and in Angola. But there are glimmers of light in\nSierra Leone, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\nin the Horn of Africa. The crises there, while not yet\nresolved, are at least on the path of negotiation. It is\nencouraging to note that this progress has been achieved\nthanks to the active participation of the countries of the\nregion.\nWe cannot allow the fate of Africa to slip out of the\nfield of action of the international community. We must\ncontrol the diverse situations relating to politics,\ndevelopment and the democratization of society to enable\nthe continent to recover its proper place in the comity of\nnations. That can be achieved only through sustained,\nconcerted medium-term and long-term action by the\ninternational community and by the United Nations system.\nMy country will participate fully in these efforts.\nIn East Timor it seemed that, after 25 years of\ninjustice and oppression, there was a process that would\ngive the Timorese people an opportunity peacefully to take\ncharge of their future. Their desire for independence was\nfreely and clearly expressed under United Nations auspices.\nDespite the Indonesian authorities having committed\nthemselves to guaranteeing order and security before and\nafter the popular consultation, grave violations occurred in\nEast Timor, followed by massacres and the large-scale\ndeportation of civilians. We welcome the dispatch of a\nmultinational force under United Nations authority to put\na rapid end to the violence and the atrocities, and to\nrepatriate people in decent conditions. We support the\nefforts of the Secretary-General and of the United Nations\nMission in East Timor to continue the process leading to\nthe independence of East Timor. We must quickly\nimprove the island's humanitarian situation, which\ncontinues to deteriorate, inflicting suffering on the\npopulation concerned.\nIn the Middle East, after years of deadlock, Israelis\nand Palestinians have resumed negotiations with the\nparticipation of other parties to the peace process, with\nthe declared intention of concluding them by the autumn\nof 2000, which would coincide with the Millennium\nAssembly. Could anyone imagine a finer symbol of\nconcerted international action to restore peace and\nsecurity than lasting reconciliation in a land that is the\ncradle of so many religions and so many civilizations?\nThe Millennium Summit will give us the chance to\ntake stock of what has been accomplished and of what the\ncomplex decade of the 1990s has brought us, as well as\nto chart the course for future action. The Secretary-\nGeneral has outlined this in his report on the work of the\nOrganization. We must give him effective tools to\nforestall catastrophes, whether caused by the elements or\nby the hand of man, and to coordinate our work to\nminimize the consequences of tragedies we are unable to\navert.\nIn declaring its determination to tackle humanitarian\nchallenges in a spirit of prevention rather than of reaction,\nthe Organization has set itself an ambitious goal. It is up\nto us to prove our will and our capacity to work\neffectively to reach that goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I join other speakers who have\nalready addressed the Assembly, Sir, in congratulating\nyou on your well-deserved election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Your\nunanimous election is a clear demonstration of the\nconfidence this Assembly has in you and in your country,\nNamibia, with which my country enjoys very friendly and\nwarm relations. It is especially significant that you come\nfrom Namibia, a country whose independence stands as\na crowning moment in our Organization\u2019s support for the\nright of peoples under colonial and foreign domination to\nself-determination and independence. I am confident that,\ngiven your experience and diplomatic skills, you will\nguide the work of this session successfully.\nI wish to take this opportunity to commend your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti of\nUruguay, for the able manner in which he presided over\nthe fifty-third session.\nIn the same vein, I would like to place on record my\ncountry\u2019s deepest appreciation of the work of the\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\nwhose leadership is well respected and has given new\nimpetus to the implementation of the United Nations\nreform programme.\n19\n\n\nAs you rightly observed in your statement to this\nAssembly, Sir, the fifty-fourth session is the last to be\nconvened in the twentieth century, a century that saw the\ncreation of the United Nations from the ashes and ravages\nof the Second World War. Indeed, the world cannot but\nthank the founding fathers of our Organization for their\nforesight and wisdom. The relevance of this Organization\nhas continued to grow since its inception, and is today\nexemplified by the universality of its membership, which\nhas grown from the original 51 States in 1945 to the\npresent 188 States.\nIt goes without saying that since the membership of\nthe United Nations has been growing, there should have\nbeen a continuous and corresponding process of reform of\nthe decision-making structures and processes of the\nOrganization in order to make the world body as\nrepresentative as possible. It is a matter of considerable\ndisappointment, however, that while reform of the\nadministrative structures has, to a large degree, been\naccomplished, reform of the Security Council has not\nmoved in tandem.\nAs members are all aware, the creation of the United\nNations was intended to strengthen international peace and\nsecurity. Regrettably, a number of States continue to be\nthreatened in our time by the dangerous proliferation of\nsmall arms and light weapons acquired by non-state entities.\nThe continued proliferation and illegal transfer of small\narms, among other factors, are responsible for the supply of\nthe weapons being used in conflict situations across the\nAfrican continent. I would therefore like to appeal to all\nMember States to support and strengthen the United\nNations monitoring mechanisms on the transfer of these\narms, particularly to non-state entities, in order to forestall\nthis problem.\nRelated to the problem of small arms is the question\nof landmines planted in large tracts of land in many\ncountries, rendering unusable what otherwise is productive\nland. The impact of landmines has also had a telling toll on\nthe provision of social services in the affected countries. I\nequally appeal to Member States, parties to the United\nNations Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction, to implement the Maputo\nDeclaration and programme of action, adopted in May this\nyear. Only a strong and viable United Nations can\nconstitute the much-needed viable vehicle to achieve this\ngoal.\nMy delegation is therefore deeply concerned about\nthe continued deterioration of the financial situation of the\nUnited Nations. This situation is well known to all of us\nin this Assembly, as it has been the focus of our\ndiscussions for the past five years. Reform of the United\nNations will not be implemented effectively if the\nfinancial situation is not seriously addressed. It is the\ninescapable duty of all of us to honour our obligations by\nensuring that we pay our assessed contributions in full, on\ntime and without conditions. This will enable the\nOrganization to function smoothly and more effectively to\nexecute the mandate we have entrusted to it.\nThat among many other reasons is why we want to\nbuild strong economies in Africa to enable us shoulder\nour obligations. But external debt remains both a burden\nand a major impediment to the development process of\nmany developing countries, including my country,\nZambia. While we welcome the recent outcome of the\nGroup of Eight meeting held in Cologne, Germany, on\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC)\nInitiative, the measures for faster, broader and deeper debt\nrelief, in our view, will not be sufficient to resolve the\nexternal debt problem of developing countries, especially\nthe poorest among them, unless they are translated into\nreal tangible, practical economic development\nprogrammes.\nIt is the view of my Government that the Group of\nEight target for debt relief of about $100 billion for the\npoorest countries in the world, the majority of which are\nin Africa, will have little effect on the problem unless the\nterms of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\nInitiative are further revised in such a way as to make\nthem more flexible and better tailored to suit the specific\nconditions of the targeted countries.\nMany of us in the developing countries understand\nthat, in order to survive and contribute positively in the\nglobal markets, we need to make our economies more\ncompetitive. In this regard, many of our countries have\nembarked on the implementation of structural adjustment\nprogrammes. Our efforts are, however, hampered by the\nhuge debt burden which takes away large amounts of\nresources from our countries through debt servicing. The\ndeclining levels of official development assistance and\nforeign direct investment to our countries, combined with\nthe debt burden, have made economic reforms difficult\nand have slowed down the pace of economic growth and\ndevelopment.\n20\n\n\nThe solution to this is for all concerned to approach\nthe question of debt with open minds, with a view to\nfinding a lasting solution to the problem.\nAdded to that problem is the spread of HIV/AIDS.\nThis is a matter of grave concern to my country and to\nAfrica as a whole. This disease has continued to overwhelm\nthe continent and to rob it of its meagre material and\nfinancial resources through devastation of its youthful and\nactive population. It is therefore necessary for all humanity\nto rise to regard HIV/AIDS as a global problem and to act\nin unison. I therefore call upon the international community\nto redouble its efforts in fighting this scourge. Let me take\nthis opportunity to report to this body that last week, from\n12 to 16 September 1999, Zambia hosted the eleventh\nInternational Conference on AIDS and Sexually\nTransmitted Diseases in Africa. The holding of that\nConference, which adopted a programme of action to fight\nthe spread of this deadly disease in Africa in the twenty-\nfirst century, is among other things a demonstration of the\nAfrican continent\u2019s commitment to fight against this deadly\ndisease. It is my hope that the United Nations will therefore\nembrace the outcome of the Conference and provide the\nnecessary leadership in the fight against this pandemic,\nwhich threatens the very survival of humankind. The AIDS\nproblem deserves our collective moral and political will to\ncombat it successfully.\nLet me now turn to the phenomenon of the conflicts\nwhich have continued to bedevil Africa. In our own\nSouthern African subregion, the conflicts in Angola and the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo are not only a threat to\npeace and security but have also been a major impediment\nto the economic development of the region.\nThe resumption of hostilities in Angola in December\n1998, after four years of relative peace following the\nsigning of the Lusaka Protocol, is regrettable. As the\nAssembly is aware, this unfortunate state of affairs was\noccasioned by the intransigence of UNITA with regard to\nthe implementation of the remaining tasks under the Lusaka\nProtocol. Every effort should therefore be made to bring an\nend to the hostilities.\nWith regard to the Democratic Republic of Congo, the\nAssembly will recall that on 2 August 1998 a conflict\nerupted in that country. In response to this serious\ndevelopment, a series of efforts by regional heads of State\nand the Organization of African Unity (OAU) were\nimmediately undertaken in search of a peaceful solution to\nthe conflict. At the summit held at Victoria Falls,\nZimbabwe, from 7 to 8 September 1998, the regional heads\nof State mandated me to chair the regional mediation\neffort, with the assistance of OAU.\nFor a period of almost a year, I have, on behalf of\nour region, carried out exhaustive consultations inside and\noutside Zambia, and convened a number of meetings at\nthe level of experts and Foreign Affairs and Defence\nMinisters.\nLet me state here that, right from the outset, regional\nleaders acknowledged the need to involve the Congolese\nrebel movement in the mediation process to ensure that\nthe outcome would be respected by and acceptable to all.\nThe process initially engaged the rebel movement through\na proximity mechanism. Later, however, the rebels, who\nnow included the Movement for the Liberation of the\nCongo (MLC), were invited to participate directly in the\npeace talks with all the other parties to the conflict.\nOn 10 July 1999, our perseverance on the regional\nand Pan-African levels finally paid off when heads of\nState of all the six States parties to the conflict signed the\nCeasefire Agreement in Lusaka. Unfortunately, a split in\nthe Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) the previous\nMay led to differences over who should sign the\nAgreement on behalf of the movement, which prevented\nthem from appending their signature on that occasion.\nThe other non-State party to the conflict, the MLC, also\nchose not to sign the Agreement until the differences\nwithin the RCD were resolved.\nIn order to secure the signatures of the RCD and the\nMLC, I was mandated by the regional heads of State to\ncarry out further consultations with the two movements.\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that these efforts\nculminated in the signing of the Ceasefire Agreement by\nthe MLC and the RCD on 1 August and 31 August 1999\nrespectively.\nAllow me at this juncture to place on record my\nsincere appreciation for the cooperation and assistance I\nreceived from all my colleagues in the region and other\nAfrican leaders, the United Nations, OAU and the\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) in\nthe execution of my mandate. The Ceasefire Agreement\nis an all-embracing document which addresses all aspects\nof the conflict, including the security concerns of all the\ncountries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\nI wish to inform the Assembly that the\nimplementation process of the Agreement has already\n21\n\n\nbegun in earnest. Both the Political Committee and the\nJoint Military Commission met on 2 and 3 September 1999\nin Lusaka with the participation of all members except the\nMLC, whose representatives were not able to travel to\nLusaka because of logistical constraints.\nAmong the issues considered by the meetings were:\nfirst, the formal installation of the Chairman of the\nCommission, Brigadier-General Rachid Lallali, from\nAlgeria; the budget of the Joint Military Commission; its\nstructures; and its programme of work.\nThe representative of OAU briefed the meetings on\nOAU activities in support of the peace process in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, and the United Nations\nrepresentative briefed them on the relationship that is\nexpected to prevail between the United Nations and the\nJoint Military Commission. The Commission is scheduled\nto meet again on 10 October 1999.\nFor peace to prevail in the Democratic Republic of\nCongo, United Nations support for the successful and\ncomprehensive implementation of the Ceasefire Agreement\nis of paramount importance. For this reason, I wish to\ncommend the Secretary-General for his timely and positive\nresponse in sending a team of military liaison personnel to\nthe region. The United Nations must move more\nexpeditiously than it has in the past if the job it does is to\nbe commensurate with the tasks facing it in the field.\nTo this end, I make an earnest appeal to the United\nNations that the Organization, first, should authorize and\nsupport the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping\nforce in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with an\nappropriate mandate and, on an appropriate scale, based on\nthe assessed needs on the ground; second, it should quickly\ndispatch the technical survey team to the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo in addition to the team of military\nliaison personnel which has already been sent to that\ncountry and some of its neighbours; third, it should make\navailable adequate resources for the peacekeeping mission;\nfourth, it should extend necessary and adequate support to\nfacilitate the process of internal dialogue within the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo; fifth, it should help in\nthe mobilization of humanitarian assistance for the\nCongolese refugees and internally displaced persons and\nfacilitate their return and resettlement; and sixth, it should\nassist with resources for the economic reconstruction of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nI need not remind the Assembly of the solemn and\nimportant responsibility that the United Nations bears on\nbehalf of us all in the maintenance of international peace\nand security. It is, therefore, incumbent upon it to ensure\nthat peace prevails in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. To this end, it should learn from the lessons of\nthe past and avoid costly mistakes.\nTime is of the essence. What is equally of the\nessence is the need to address the root causes of the\npoverty confronting third world countries. The world\ncommunity must tackle those root causes with speed and\nurgency.\nThis session of the General Assembly is meeting\nagainst a backdrop of growing tensions and armed\nconflicts, especially in the third world. These\ndevelopments, coming towards the close of the twentieth\ncentury, are an indictment of the world\u2019s global\nstructures, which pose today, more than at any other time\nin history, a challenge to the very articles of faith upon\nwhich this organization was founded. The challenges\ncannot be wished away, nor can they be remedied by\nempty words. Global poverty can be eradicated only with\na concerted global programme. Solving the issue of\npoverty would solve the problem of conflict and\ninstability in the developing countries, and unless the\nworld addresses these underlying causes of conflict, they\nwill continue to be major sources of friction that will\nthreaten and undermine international peace and security.\nEvents in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in\nKosovo and now in East Timor cannot but exert more\npressure on the time and resources of the international\ncommunity in general and particularly on the Security\nCouncil. But this is the mission of that world body: to\nattend to just such areas of conflict. Admittedly, these are\nthe most perilous times Africa has ever faced. The\nmultiple dangers of armed conflict and general political\ninstability and the ever-growing danger posed by the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic can only call for concerted joint\nworld efforts to help reduce the dangers that face Africa\nand the world in general.\nThere are various ways the world can come to the\naid of Africa, the most important of which are through\naid and by creating conditions to make it possible for\nAfrica to trade with the international community on terms\nacceptable to all. Africa is not asking for charity. No,\nAfrica is asking for genuine trade. Africa is not asking for\narms. No, Africa is asking for fair and equitable\nrecompense for its labour and resources. Africa is not\nasking for pity, but genuine partnership based on mutual\ninterests.\n22\n\n\nThe relationship between poverty and political\ninstability can no longer be in any way doubted. It is not\ngood enough for the developed world to demand good\ngovernance \u2014 an indefinable term \u2014 while creating\nconditions of poverty by bad governance in the economic\narea. Justice must prevail in our economic relations in order\nto lay the foundation for political and social justice.\nA start should now be made by reviewing the\ninequitable conditions imposed by the World Trade\nOrganization, which, if maintained, will only ensure\ncontinued marginalization of third world countries,\ncondemning them to poverty and further instability.\nI am quite aware that this forum may not be the\nappropriate one for addressing these issues, but it definitely\nhas the right people to address the issues I have raised.\nTherefore, my fervent prayer and hope is that we enter the\nnew millennium with a renewed sense of unity of purpose\nto eradicate manifest global injustices and create a more\nequitable world where want will not create chaos and\ninstability.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I congratulate\nyou, the Foreign Minister of Namibia, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. Your experience as the Namibian people's chief\nrepresentative in New York during your country's struggle\nfor independence and your role in guiding Namibia into the\nfamily of nations will serve you well in directing the\nimportant work of this session.\nOur thanks are also due to Foreign Minister Opertti of\nUruguay for his dedicated efforts in leading the Assembly\nover the past 12 months. I, too, would like to warmly\nwelcome our three new Members to the United Nations, the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga.\nIn January of this year, my Government had the\nprivilege of hosting a visit by Secretary-General Annan. As\nthe first United Nations Secretary-General to emerge from\nwithin the international civil service, his personal\ncommitment to the United Nations and its founding\nprinciples is evidenced in his efforts to steer the\nOrganization into the new millennium.\nMy colleague Foreign Minister Halonen of Finland\nset out the views of the European Union on the main\nchallenges facing the international community today, and,\nof course, Ireland fully associates itself with our respected\nFinnish Presidency's remarks.\nThe responsibility of the United Nations to maintain\ninternational peace and security has been severely tested\nthis year. In Africa, in the Balkans and, most recently, in\nEast Timor, we have seen bloody and vicious outbreaks\nof violence which could have been avoided. At the same\ntime, the incidence and scale of natural disasters has\nincreased, adding to the pressures facing the already\noverstretched relief agencies. We need to take up the\nchallenge which the Secretary-General set out in his\nthought-provoking address earlier this week \u2014 to think\nanew about how the United Nations and the Member\nStates respond to the political, human rights and\nhumanitarian crises affecting so much of the world. We\nare all haunted by the collective failure to prevent\nhumanitarian disasters \u2014 including genocide \u2014 as well\nas the outbreak of conflict in many regions.\nThe case for better prevention strategies is\noverwhelming. Even the costliest policy of prevention is\nfar cheaper, in lives and resources, than the least\nexpensive use of armed force. It is simply unacceptable\nthat the United Nations should be starved of the resources\nthat are vital to this conflict prevention. Where conflict\nprevention fails, more fundamental questions relating to\ncapabilities for crisis management arise. How is it\npossible, for example, that the international community\nfinds itself repeatedly incapable of taking effective action?\nHow has it come to pass that questions are being raised\nabout the adequacy of the Charter itself? Or that the\nconstraints impairing the effectiveness of the Organization\nhave led to searching elsewhere for effective response? It\nis indeed a paradox that, in a world of unprecedented\ninterdependence and technological capabilities, we should\nbe confronted by such a dilemma.\nThe Charter, I think, has been fairly described as a\n\u201cliving document\u201d. I believe that this provides the key to\nresolving our dilemma. We have not used sufficiently the\npossibilities that already exist under the Charter, not only\nin the area of peace and security, but also in the social\nand economic fields. I would suggest that we should\nscrutinize its provisions and use them imaginatively. That\ncould make possible a reinvigoration of the United\n25\n\n\nNations, injecting a new sense of purpose and a new\ndynamic.\nI believe we should similarly look to see how we can\nsupport the Secretary-General in his immense labours. His\nreport on the work of the Organization has diagnosed\naccurately the challenges that exist and has genuinely\npointed out what needs to be done. He has powers under\nthe Charter, and he should be encouraged to use them to\nthe full. Greater empowerment of the Secretary-General is\none practical step that we, the Member States, should take.\nWe should seize the opportunity provided by the\nMillennium Assembly next year to reaffirm our\ncommitment to the goals and principles set out in the\nCharter, in a pragmatic, action-oriented and forward-looking\nmanner.\nWe can learn, as has been said by previous speakers,\nfrom the crisis in East Timor. As the Personal\nRepresentative of the European Union Presidency, I\nwitnessed at first hand the consultation process on 30\nAugust. I wish particularly to pay tribute to the outstanding\nwork of the United Nations Mission in East Timor\n(UNAMET). It has received criticism, and I reject that\ncriticism. I saw the work at first hand. They were an\nunarmed force \u2014 a group of very brave men and women.\nMen and women of my own country were among that very\nbrave group of people, and I salute them.\nIreland, together with our European Union partners, is\nfully committed to seeing that the people of East Timor\nenjoy the independence which they have freely chosen. The\npoll itself took place peacefully in a fair and free\nmanner \u2014 we witnessed it first hand \u2014 and reflected, as\nI understand it, the views of the people. It was, however,\nfollowed by systematic and ruthless attacks on the\npopulation. We have condemned these atrocities in the\nstrongest terms. The perpetrators of crimes against\nhumanity must be brought to justice. The United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary\nRobinson, has called for an international commission of\ninquiry, and, of course, we all fully support this, as I\nunderstand it.\nHad those seeking to frustrate and overturn the process\ninitiated by President Habibie last January succeeded, they\nwould have denied the democratic rights of the people of\nEast Timor, posing a very serious challenge to the\ncredibility and authority of the United Nations. I welcome\nthe decisive action taken by the Security Council which led\nto the adoption of its resolution 1264 (1999), although I\nregret that this action could not have been taken more\nspeedily. I pay sincere tribute to all involved, and in\nparticular to the members of the Security Council mission\nwho went to Jakarta and Dili in very very difficult\ncircumstances. I pay sincere tribute to all involved. All of\nthe provisions of Security Council resolution 1264 (1999)\nmust now be fully implemented in all respects, as it says,\nand as is required by it.\nWe fully support the deployment of the international\nforce for East Timor under the leadership of Australia.\nIreland is among the contributors to this force.\nWe are facing a humanitarian disaster in both East\nand West Timor. All East Timorese refugees, wherever\nthey are, must be allowed to return to their homes. The\nresponse that is now being made will go some way to\nrestoring the credibility and authority of this Organization\nat a time when the restoration of that credibility and\nauthority is so urgently required. In Ireland we will be\ncontinuing to support, in every way we can, the work of\nthe United Nations and, of course, the international\nhumanitarian agencies in East Timor.\nThe dilemma which I earlier described is also\nillustrated clearly by the response to crises in many parts\nof Africa, as has been outlined by so many other\nspeakers, and by the previous speaker in particular, my\ncolleague Foreign Minister Godana of Kenya. This\nresponse has in the past been totally inadequate, leading\nin turn to further conflict, human suffering and neglect on\nan even greater scale.\nI welcome the steps recently taken towards national\nreconciliation in a number of the African countries,\nincluding, as was mentioned by the previous speaker,\nSierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe patient diplomacy and determination of individual\nAfrican leaders has laid the groundwork for the resolution\nof a number of recent conflicts. We received a timely\nreminder of these efforts a few days ago from President\nChiluba of Zambia in his excellent address to the Security\nCouncil. But these efforts deserve and require the support\nand commitment of the international community. The\nSecretary-General's report on conflict prevention in Africa\nhas set out clear goals and proposals on the promotion of\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa, and\nwe must all ensure that real progress is achieved on these\nissues.\nCountries emerging from conflict situations, in\nparticular, face the need to rebuild lives and livelihoods.\n26\n\n\nMany of these are among the poorest Member States. In\nthat context, I wish to highlight the extent of the debt\nburden on developing countries, particularly on the heavily\nindebted poor countries \u2014 the so-called HIPC countries.\nServicing this debt deprives many of these nations of scarce\nresources, resources which are required to meet the most\nbasic human needs, and some of the debt repayments based\non the moneys given to some of these countries are nothing\nshort of disgraceful.\nThe launch of the joint World Bank/International\nMonetary Fund Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative\ntwo years ago gave hope that substantive action would at\nlast be taken to relieve the debt crisis, particularly the large\nand growing burden of multilateral debt. Some progress has\nbeen made, but, unfortunately again, in the nature of those\ninstitutions \u2014 and I do not say it by way of great criticism\n\u2014 there is a slowness in their movement. That is why the\nInitiative has benefited so few of the countries to which it\nis directed. We need to extend it to more countries, with a\ngreater degree of flexibility, and maybe a little bit of\nimagination.\nIreland wishes to see the strongest possible link\nbetween debt relief and poverty alleviation. It is the poorest\nand most marginalized who have borne much of the burden.\nI saw this in recent visits to a number of these countries in\nAfrica. We recognize the strength of international concern\nabout the debt of poor countries, including the urgent\ndemands for debt forgiveness. The Irish Government\ndecided last year to direct resources to both bilateral and\nmultilateral debt relief, and also to make it integral to\nIreland's overall development cooperation strategy. The goal\nof poverty reduction, the primary focus of this strategy,\ncannot be met without concerted international action to\nstem the haemorrhage of resources caused by this burden.\nIreland regrets the decline in flows of official\ndevelopment assistance to what can only be described as\nhistoric lows. This situation must be reversed. Developing\ncountries, especially the poorest among them, need\ninternational solidarity now more than ever.\nThe forthcoming special session on small island\ndeveloping States is an important opportunity to focus\ninternational attention on countries with which Ireland has\na natural affinity. Remote from major markets and\necologically fragile, they face the twin challenges of\nglobalization and climate change. Ireland recognizes their\nunique situation and supports further work on an index\nwhich would reflect their vulnerability.\nThe special session should give a renewed impetus\nto the Barbados Programme of Action \u2014 a Programme\nthat I salute. The small island States, particularly the\npoorest, must not be further marginalized. For our part,\nwe have placed a new emphasis on small island\ndeveloping States in our multilateral aid programme. We\nare also working with our partners in the European Union\nand the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries towards\na successful conclusion \u2014 a just and equitable conclusion\n\u2014 of the post-Lom\u00e9 negotiations.\nThe scourge of drug trafficking is a global problem\nwhich affects us all. Ireland is fully committed to the\nfight against drugs and to supporting the efforts of those\ncountries which are already very much affected by this\nheinous traffic.\nFull respect for human rights is of fundamental\nimportance to the achievement of all our other goals. As\nthis millennium draws to a close, a series of the most\nbarbaric violations of human rights imaginable in Bosnia,\nRwanda, Kosovo and now in East Timor are testaments\nto our inhumanity to one another.\nThe Secretary-General has produced a compelling\nreport (S/1999/957) to the Security Council on the\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict. We must\naddress, with the utmost speed and seriousness, the\nSecretary-General's recommendations which are aimed at\ncreating, in his words, a \u201cclimate of compliance\u201d with\ninternational human rights and humanitarian standards, as\nset out. The Secretary-General has rightly placed great\nstress on the necessity to enhance efforts aimed at conflict\nprevention. His recommendations offer us an opportunity\nto redeem the pledges we made last year on the occasion\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights.\nIt is imperative that the Statute of the International\nCriminal Court enter into force as soon as possible. A\nglobal enforcement mechanism which addresses impunity\ncould also serve as a deterrent to genocide and crimes\nagainst humanity, some of which I have just articulated.\nIreland will shortly assume the chairmanship of the\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, an\nimportant political forum for enhancing democratic values\nand stability throughout the continent of Europe. We will\nseek to promote further cooperation between the Council\nof Europe and the United Nations in areas of common\ninterest.\n27\n\n\nThe shadow of nuclear weapons hangs over us all as\nwe enter the new millennium. We can no longer remain\ncomplacent at the absence of progress towards the early\nelimination of nuclear arsenals. The limited steps that have\nbeen taken to date \u2014 which we welcome \u2014 do not amount\nto a determined process of elimination.\nIntent on securing a new consensus on the way\nforward, I and my colleagues from Brazil, Egypt, Mexico,\nNew Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden last year\nlaunched an initiative called \u201cTowards a nuclear-weapon-\nfree world: the need for a new agenda\u201d.\nWith the adoption of a resolution on the new agenda\nin the General Assembly, the international community has\ndemanded a clear perspective for the closure of the nuclear-\nweapons era.\nThe approach of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) 2000 Review Conference\nunderlines the imperatives of a fundamental change in\napproach. We require a new commitment on the part of the\nnuclear-weapon States. This would make the elimination of\nthese weapons an immediate objective rather than an\nultimate goal.\nEarlier this year I had the honour of participating in\nthe first meeting of the States Parties to the Ottawa\nConvention, held in Maputo. The conclusion of the global\nban on landmines is, of course, one of the striking\nachievements of our time. In this I salute the leadership of\nCanada, working with determined Governments, including\nmy own, and in cooperation with the non-governmental\ncommunity. It is the clearest demonstration of what can be\nachieved when the political will exists.\nThe spread of small arms and the consequences for\ncivilian populations in armed conflict must be confronted\nnow. This traffic in arms is an obscenity and, in many\ncases, totally and absolutely irresponsible; its brokers know\nno morality. We must redouble our efforts to address both\nthe supply and demand sides of a threat to the security of\ncivilians that has reached epidemic proportions.\nWe in Ireland are proud of our contribution to world\npeace through peacekeeping. Just under a year ago Ireland\nbecame a full participant in the United Nations standby\narrangements system. We currently contribute to eight\npeacekeeping operations, with over 700 personnel in the\nfield. Our largest commitment is to the United Nations\nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon.\nOur service has not, of course, been without cost. To date\n78 Irish peacekeepers have paid the highest price in the\nservice of the United Nations.\nThe changing and more complex nature of\npeacekeeping involves additional tasks, such as\nhumanitarian assistance, the protection of human rights\nand civilian police work. Through our participation in the\nmultinational forces operating under United Nations\nauthorization in Kosovo, and soon in East Timor, Ireland\nis already playing its part in these new arrangements. Our\ncommitment to United Nations peacekeeping remains, as\never, strong, steadfast and loyal.\nI will conclude by giving a short resume of the\nsituation in Northern Ireland. A number of speakers have\nreferred to the peace process in Northern Ireland during\nthe course of their contributions to this session of the\nGeneral Assembly, and I very deeply appreciate their\nremarks in that regard. Their support and, indeed, all the\nsupport of all the nations in the United Nations is very\ndeeply appreciated.\nI will now turn to the evolving situation in that part\nof my benighted land, Northern Ireland. When I spoke\nhere last year, I was honoured to be the first Minister to\nbe able to report that a comprehensive and broadly based\npolitical accommodation had been reached, that is, the\nGood Friday Agreement of April 1998. The Agreement\nwas reached by the British and Irish Governments and by\neight political parties in Northern Ireland following almost\ntwo years of intensive negotiations. It was subsequently\nendorsed by the people of the island with decisive\nmajorities in referendums held in both the north and\nsouth, an average between the two parts of the island in\nthe nature of 72 per cent for a permanent peace on the\nisland of Ireland and in favour of the Good Friday\nAgreement. As I say, it was subsequently endorsed by the\npeople of the island with a decisive majority in a\ncombined context, which I have just spoken about,\nnamely, referendums in the north and south. The\nAgreement covers not just constitutional issues and\npolitical institutions, but a wide range of other matters\nessential to conflict resolution and the promotion of a fair\nand just society.\nAll of us gathered here know, often from direct\nexperience, that, though it can be hard to reach an\nagreement, it is often harder still to implement it. I doubt\nvery much if anyone in Ireland expected the path ahead\nto be smooth and straight. While very substantial progress\nhas been made, there continue to be frustrations and, of\ncourse, difficulties, and I would not seek to minimize the\n28\n\n\nproblems we face. But there is still much that is valuable\nand encouraging.\nIt is true that the peace we have remains imperfect,\nand there can be no tolerable or acceptable level of\nviolence. In places, tensions between the two communities\nare worryingly high. But, overall, Northern Ireland is more\npeaceful than it has been at any time for a generation.\nRelationships between the two parts of Ireland, and between\nBritain and Ireland, are closer and more relaxed than they\nhave ever been. And the longer it continues, it is peace\nwhich becomes the norm. The people were always entitled\nto peace. My belief is that now they are coming to expect\nit. I am confident that no attempt to return to the full-scale\nviolence of the past would win any meaningful support or\ncould be sustained for long. We have turned the corner and\nthere can be no going back.\nDuring the past year, much good work has been done\nto carry the Agreement forward. For instance, its human\nrights and equality provisions are being given concrete\neffect, as are measures to promote cultural equality and\nreconciliation and to assist the victims of violence. The\nindependent commission established under the Agreement\nto make recommendations on a new beginning to policing\nin Northern Ireland has recently produced an excellent and\nthorough report on this very sensitive and important issue.\nThe Irish Government looks forward to playing our part in\nits implementation.\nMoreover, the Governments and the parties in the\nnorth have completed all of the preparatory technical work\nnecessary to establish the new political institutions\nenvisaged by the Agreement. You can understand,\ntherefore, the disappointment we feel that it has not yet\nproved possible actually to establish those political\ninstitutions. While there is disagreement among some\npolitical parties on the precise relationship between the\nformation of an inclusive executive within Northern Ireland\nand the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, there is\nno difference of view on the desirability of both objectives.\nHowever, there is a persistent mutual distrust and lack of\nconfidence, with doubts about future intentions continuing\nto linger.\nUnder the dedicated and committed leadership of the\nTaoiseach \u2014 my Prime Minister, Mr. Bertie Ahern \u2014 and\nthe British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, the Irish and British\nGovernments and all the parties have devoted enormous\nenergy to the task of seeking to find a generally acceptable\nway forward. But so far, despite some progress, we have\nnot succeeded in bridging that particular gap. For that\nreason, we have invited Senator George Mitchell of the\nUnited States, who chaired with such skill and judgement\nthe talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement itself,\nto act as a facilitator of a review. That review is now\nunder way. There is no good reason why it should fail. I\ncannot believe that is in the interests of anyone that it\nshould fail.\nThe institutional blueprint sketched out in the\nAgreement and endorsed by the people offers the only\nrational basis for a lasting peace and for reconciliation\nthrough practical partnership and common action. No\nother conceivable course of action represents a remotely\nsatisfactory alternative. Whatever the short-term\ndifficulties, the Irish Government, in continued\ncooperation with the British Government, will not cease\nto work for its implementation.\nIt is not surprising that the stalemate of the past\nmonths has led to some doubt and, indeed,\ndisillusionment. But I am convinced that there remains a\nhuge reservoir of support for the Agreement within both\nthe unionist and nationalist communities, provided each\ncan be confident that all aspects will be implemented in\nfull. People are open to persuasion if a reasonable\naccommodation is on offer. There is therefore an onus on\nall political representatives to be generous and creative\nand to be prepared to offer leadership to their own\nconstituencies while reaching out to others \u2014 not\nrecklessly, but courageously and honourably.\nI am convinced that there will be no return to our\noften bitter past. But it will be possible to realize the full\npotential of the future only when the Good Friday\nAgreement is implemented as a totality. The Agreement\noffers a bold and generous vision of tolerance and\npartnership between those who together share the island\nof Ireland. Moreover, it offers a framework within which\nprofound differences can be accommodated without\ncoercion and on the basis of consent. Those of us from\nwithin the Irish nationalist tradition value the unionist\ntradition. We have come to understand, to cherish and to\nrespect its authenticity and, of course, its validity. It is a\nvital and irreplaceable strand of that diversity of cultures\nand identities which makes up Ireland as it really is.\nAll over the world, we can see the tragic\nconsequences of policies of domination and exclusion.\nThe future of Ireland can be, should be and, I believe,\nwill be radically different. That is why the task of\nimplementing the Agreement should be completed now,\nand not left to another generation.\n29\n\n\nIn conclusion, as we go forward we know that we\nretain the support and solidarity of the international\ncommunity. In this regard I would like to pay particular\ntribute to the role of the United States and, of course, of\nPresident Bill Clinton, who has stood steadfastly beside us\nthroughout the historic process in which we have been\nengaged. As always, we are deeply grateful for the\nencouragement of all of our friends, which is and will\ncontinue to be hugely important to us.\nAs we benefit from the support of the international\ncommunity, I wish in turn to pledge Ireland's continuing\ncommitment to the fulfilment of the aims and principles of\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am\ndelighted to have the opportunity at this fifty-fourth\nsession of the General Assembly to share with the entire\ninternational community the concerns \u2014 but also the\nhope \u2014 that inspire the nation of Niger in the progress of\nworld events.\nThe Niger welcomes the new Member States \u2014 the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga \u2014 to membership of the United\nNations community.\nI would also like to say how proud and pleased we\nare, Sir, over your unanimous election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly for this session. On behalf of the\ndelegation of the Niger, I wish to sincerely congratulate\nyou and the other members of the Bureau. Your\nprofessional skills and your well-known human qualities,\nas well as your unceasing commitment to your country,\nNamibia, and to the defence of the noble causes of\nhumanity, guarantee the successful outcome of the\nAssembly\u2019s work.\nMy delegation also has the agreeable duty of paying\na well-deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Didier\nOpertti, for the excellent work done during his term of\noffice.\n9\n\n\nThe presence at your side of Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan, whose devotion and constant desire to serve the\ncauses I have mentioned are well-established, reinforces our\nconviction that the outcome of this session will make it\npossible to lay a sound basis for the future of a world that\nis less unjust, more peaceful, more prosperous \u2014 and, in a\nword, more human.\nThe Niger is a landlocked, heavily indebted country\nwhich has for almost a decade suffered from chronic\ninstitutional instability. This situation has seriously\nundermined its people\u2019s efforts to establish a viable\npolitical, economic and social environment. Since its\naccession to independence in August 1960 the Republic of\nthe Niger has experienced profound upheavals which have\naffected its progress towards the establishment of a\ndemocratic, harmonious and prosperous society.\nBut these upheavals, far from weakening the\ndemocratic ideal of our people, have strengthened its\nresolve to overcome these challenges. Strengthened by this\nconviction, the Council for National Reconciliation and the\nGovernment resulting from the events of 9 April 1999 have\nmade the strong commitment that the people of the Niger,\nat peace with itself and possessing stable and durable\ndemocratic institutions, will be able to meet the challenges\nof the third millennium.\nOn 18 July, in a referendum, the people of the Niger\nadopted the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, which will\nlead to the establishment of lasting democratic institutions.\nThe timetable decided on by our Independent National\nElectoral Commission sets the first round of presidential\nelections for 17 October. The second round will be held at\nthe same time as the general elections, on 24 November.\nThe investiture and assumption of office of the President-\nelect of the Republic will take place on 31 December 1999.\nIn this respect, every step has been taken to organize\nthe elections in the most transparent, honest and neutral\nway possible. The measures taken include a ban on the\nmilitary\u2019s submitting candidates for the presidential and\ngeneral elections, even if those candidates are on leave of\nabsence or have resigned from the military. The\nGovernment will ensure that the elections are held in a\nspirit of impartiality.\nWith this same aim, the Independent National\nElectoral Commission was institutionalized and a national\ncommunications monitor set up to guarantee equal access\nto public media and to ensure that the press is free and\nconstructive.\nBasically, therefore, our political transition is on the\nright track, and the instruments for this transition will be\nactive until power is handed over to the duly, freely\nelected authorities.\nIn view of all this, we hope that our traditional\nexternal partners will help us establish true democracy in\nthe Niger. We expect their support, which is necessary to\nhelp us in the process of establishing dialogue among all\nparties concerned to guarantee the holding of credible,\nhonest elections.\nBut as the Assembly is aware, democracy does not\njust mean holding a series of elections. A legal arsenal\nand a different way of thinking are essential to\nconsolidate democracy, and this is why we have started\ngiving organized, concerted consideration to the drafting\nof basic texts that will govern the future Republic.\nVaried and burning issues, such as the\ndepoliticization of the administration, the electoral code,\nthe charter of political parties, the status of the opposition\nand the role of the army in a democratic context have\nbeen tackled.\nIn this context, I call upon interested States to take\npart in the national workshop to be held next December\non the theme \u201cThe army and democracy in Africa: the\ncase of the Niger\u201d.\nI wish very sincerely to thank all bilateral and\nmultilateral partners of the Niger, in particular United\nNations agencies, and more specifically the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), for having\ncontinued to support my country\u2019s efforts to create the\nright institutional environment to restore social peace and\nto enable men and women of the Niger to meet the major\nchallenges they face. This highly appreciated assistance\nwill continue to be necessary in this decisive phase of the\ndemocratic process and the process of national\nreconciliation.\nThe recurrent theme of post-conflict insecurity\ndeserves special attention from the United Nations\nsystem. The Niger, resolutely committed to the process of\ncantonment, disarmament and socio-economic\nreintegration of elements of the former rebel army which\nrampaged in the north and far east of the country a few\n10\n\n\nyears ago, fully supports the programme for collecting and\ndestroying small arms.\nIt is in this spirit that my country submitted to the\nSecretariat a plan to put an end to the illicit circulation of\nsmall arms and light weapons. It endorsed the decision\ntaken by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in June\n1998 and the declaration adopted by the heads of State and\nGovernment of member countries of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) in October\n1998 to deal with the destabilizing effects and the threat to\npeace and security posed by the illicit circulation of small\narms and light weapons for the West African region and for\nthe entire continent.\nWe welcome the emerging concordance of views and\naction regarding the priority nature of this question among\nAfrican organizations on the one hand, and other\ninternational institutions \u2014 including those of the United\nNations system, the European Union and the Organization\nof American States \u2014 on the other. This international\nconsensus will make it possible to take effective steps in\ntime for the upcoming international conference on all\naspects of the illicit arms trade, to be held in 2001.\nThe Niger has always sought to make its modest\ncontribution to the settlement of conflicts that threaten\npeace and security in Africa and throughout the rest of the\nworld. Despite our limited resources, we sent troops to\nLiberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau, as well as civilian\npolice officers to Haiti. In this regard, my Government\nwishes to reaffirm its constant willingness to send military\nand police contingents to all United Nations peacekeeping\noperations when needed.\nIn Africa, thanks to the efforts of the international\ncommunity, we have reason to hope that the process\nleading to the referendum on self-determination for the\nSahraoui people will soon lead to a final settlement of this\nquestion.\nThe conclusion of the Peace Agreement in Sierra\nLeone under the aegis of ECOWAS and the Ceasefire\nAgreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have\ngiven us a glimmer of hope. These efforts must be\ncontinued and must serve as an example for those involved\nin other conflicts, such as in Angola, in Somalia or in the\narmed confrontation between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nIt must be acknowledged that these situations of crisis\nand insecurity demand first and foremost that African\nGovernments and leaders of public opinion commit\nthemselves resolutely to dealing with factors of instability\non a consensus basis. In this respect, my Government and\nmy people would like through me to welcome the\nindividual and collective initiatives to create or\nconsolidate an environment of peace and security in\nAfrica, which is a sine qua non for development.\nOutstanding and effective initiatives have been taken\nin various places and should be welcomed. Among these\nis the action initiated by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika\nof Algeria, who had the praiseworthy idea of holding on\n16 September last, a referendum on civil concord, which\nwas massively supported by the Algerian people. The\nGovernment and the people of the Niger welcome this\ngenuine plebiscite and the prospects it ushers in for that\nfraternal country.\nThe Niger also welcomes the positive developments\nin the Lockerbie case. We believe that conditions now\nexist for the total lifting of sanctions against the great\nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\nIn the Middle East, the attention of the international\ncommunity is still focused on the Israeli-Palestinian peace\nprocess, which, fortunately, seems to have been revived\nwith the change in the leadership of the Israeli\nGovernment.\nIn Asia, the Jammu and Kashmir conflict remains a\nsource of great tension between two nuclear States, India\nand Pakistan, and a persistent, serious threat to peace and\nsecurity in that part of South Asia.\nThe Niger, therefore, as a member of the contact\ngroup established by the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, reiterates its appeal to both parties to step up\ntheir negotiations in order to reach a peaceful settlement\nof the conflict by recognizing the Kashmiri people\u2019s right\nto self-determination pursuant to the relevant resolutions\nof the United Nations.\nIn Europe, my Government welcomes the return of\npeace to the Balkans. The establishment of an\nadministration under United Nations control is a sure\nguarantee for the safe return of the refugees.\nIt is more essential and urgent than ever to reverse\nthe decline in official development assistance which, it\nmust be recalled, is at its lowest level in 50 years. In\norder to meet this challenge, the international community\nmust consider the possibility of mobilizing additional\nresources. It is therefore urgent that progress be made\n\n\n\nwithin the framework of the initiatives taken at world\nsummits. At the same time, we must pool our efforts to\nincrease the effectiveness of aid by reviewing its modalities\nand through its sound and rigorous management.\nIt is on the basis of this experience that my\nGovernment adopted a national strategy note and an\neconomic recovery programme that clearly defines the\ncoherent networks for action by our development partners.\nFurthermore, the crucial problem of African countries\u2019\ndebt \u2014 which is wiping out all development efforts \u2014\ncalls for the international community as a whole to\nimplement, without delay or conditions other than good\npublic administration, appropriate regulatory policies and\nmechanisms.\nIn this connection, the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt (HIPC) Initiative of the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as the recent\ninitiative undertaken in Cologne at the Group of 7 Summit,\nmust be extended to all the least developed countries in\norder to produce the effects we hope to see. This must take\nthe form of an outright cancellation of the debt.\nDespite the outstanding efforts made by many African\ncountries in the area of economic reform, foreign private\ninvestment flows are still meagre, notwithstanding the\nenabling environment that has been established. We very\nmuch hope that the positive initiative taken by the\nSecretary-General at Davos will allow greater involvement\nby the private sector in implementing adequate measures to\nreverse that tendency. It is in this connection that my\ndelegation would like to appeal to all development partners\nto help reinforce the institutional capacities of our States\nand to create adequate infrastructures, which are guarantees\nof balanced development.\nThe second special dialogue between the Economic\nand Social Council and the Bretton Woods institutions held\nhere on 29 April 1999 reaffirmed the need to continue the\nreform of the international financial system, bearing in\nmind social imperatives and the external debt situation, that\nis to say, the close link between settling debt, poverty\nreduction and lasting development.\nNiger belongs to the group of least developed\ncountries and has a population that is growing at an annual\nrate of 3.4 per cent. It has a fertility rate of 7.4 children per\nwoman and a life expectancy of 47 years, and is ranked\namong the poorest countries of the world. Despite all these\nconstraints, my country has made efforts to design and\nimplement initiatives in keeping with the\nrecommendations of the population conferences.\nThese various difficulties have exacerbated the\npolitical instability I referred to before and have kept our\ncountry at the bottom of the human development table.\nPoverty affects 63 per cent of our compatriots, 34 per\ncent of whom live below the extreme poverty threshold.\nThose people are victims of continued declining maternal,\nchildhood and adolescent health standards \u2014 a critical\nsocial and health situation marked by high mortality and\nilliteracy rates, one of the lowest standards of education\nand insufficient drinking water resources. They even lack\nbasic social services.\nThe economic and financial crisis that has hit my\ncountry has, among other things, led to a drastic reduction\nin public investment, particularly in the social sectors,\nthus depriving 80 per cent of the rural population of\nadequate living standards. With the valuable assistance of\ninternational financial institutions we have initiated an\nenormous economic recovery programme to confront this\nsituation. This programme includes, among other things,\na series of economic and financial reforms and framework\nprogrammes to restore the macroeconomic balance,\nreduce poverty and stimulate growth.\nI wish, from this rostrum, to reiterate our great\nappreciation for the ongoing support that the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) and other development\npartners have been steadily providing to implement our\nnational framework programme to combat poverty. This\nprogramme we are implementing is one of the priorities\nof the first country cooperation framework adopted by the\nUNDP Governing Council last January.\nI would like here to make a heartfelt appeal to the\nUnited Nations system to allocate sufficient\nsupplementary resources to UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA\nso that they can complete their development activities in\nthe least developed countries. This appeal also goes out\nto the international community to supply all the necessary\nsupport to my country so that the major challenges we are\nconfronting can be met.\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, special\nattention should be given to making a reality of the\nuniversality of our world Organization. Peace, security\nand development are too important to be the sole\nresponsibility of a club of military, economic and\n12\n\n\nfinancial Powers. Africa, which now figures prominently\namong international initiatives and hopes to become an\nactive partner in those initiatives, must play an important\nrole within a reformed Security Council. Africa has\ncountries that can play a decisive role in that regard.\nA large number of countries, including my own, that\nshare the use of French with other States of the world very\nmuch hope that they can work in all United Nations bodies\nand agencies in their official language. The member States\nof the Organisation international de la Francophonie, which\nis increasingly establishing itself as an essential actor in\nworld affairs, will make an additional contribution in the\ngive-and-take process in the third millennium.\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the confidence\nthat Niger and its people have in the United Nations, which\nis trying very hard to be an institution that embodies hope\non the basis of justice, equity, peace, freedom and progress.\nThese values will build the coming twenty-first century we\nare expecting if the United Nations is stronger and more\neffective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

His\nelection to preside over this last session of the closing\nmillennium is a fitting tribute to his outstanding qualities.\nI congratulate him warmly and assure him of the total\nsupport and cooperation of my delegation.\nWe also thank His Excellency Mr. Opertti for the\nexcellent manner in which he presided over the work of the\nfifty-third session. The Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nwhose strong commitment to the cause of the United\nNations needs hardly be emphasized, has continued to lead\nthe Organization with vision, vigour and great dedication.\nMauritius welcomes very warmly the admission of the\nKingdom of Tonga, the Republic of Kiribati and the\nRepublic of Nauru to the United Nations.\nThe curtain will soon fall on our eventful twentieth\ncentury, a century of tremendous achievements by mankind.\nThe wide world has been reduced to a global village\nthrough progress in the field of science and technology\nduring this century. The political map of the world has\nundergone tremendous transformation. It is hardly\nrecognizable from what it used to be at this century's outset.\nToday, our world is made of independent nations, with\npeoples themselves in charge of their destinies. On the\nother hand, we did experience the horrors of wars in the\nfirst half of the century but decided never to let it happen\nagain. We created the United Nations in the aftermath of\nthe Second World War as a forum for all nations to carry\nforward together a common pledge for lasting world peace\nand promote development and progress for all humanity.\nDuring this century man has paradoxically also\ncreated weapons of mass destruction that threaten his very\nexistence. Disarmament, including nuclear disarmament,\nremains a major preoccupation for all of us as we step\ninto the new millennium. The United Nations,\nrepresenting the collective conscience of nations, has\nendeavoured to serve humanity and the cause of peace\nand development. The United Nations is the sole\nmechanism through which universal peace can be secured.\nWe unanimously agree also that reforms to the Charter of\nthe United Nations are necessary \u2014 indeed, overdue \u2014\nas in its present form it does not reflect the tremendous\nchanges the world has undergone since the Organization\nwas founded half a century ago.\nIt is now almost six years since the General\nAssembly established the Open-ended Working Group on\nthe Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\nMatters Related to the Security Council. Progress has\nbeen slow and has taken place on a limited set of issues\nonly.\nWhat is lacking for the process to move forward is\npolitical will on the part of some members. The fact is\nthat the Security Council in its present form is neither\nadequately representative nor sufficiently transparent in its\nwork for its decisions to be universally accepted.\nMauritius supports the proposals of the Non-Aligned\nMovement and of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) on the reform of the Security Council. We appeal\nto all Members of the United Nations to work together\nconstructively and advance the much needed reform\nprocess expeditiously.\nWhile the international community has largely been\nsuccessful in averting global wars, armed conflicts have\ncontinued to endanger national, regional and international\npeace. In particular, the African continent has continued\nto be afflicted with conflicts, the worst being the crisis in\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo and the continued civil\nwar in Angola.\nHowever, the international community should take\ncomfort in the fact that the leaders on the African\ncontinent have spared no efforts to find solutions and\nrestore peace in the countries and areas in question.\nThrough tireless and extensive efforts of African leaders,\nthe OAU and the United Nations, and all the parties\nconcerned in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of\nCongo, have signed the Lusaka Agreement in order to\n8\n\n\nrestore peace and stability in the country. One of the\nfundamental aspects of the Agreement is the deployment of\na United Nations peacekeeping force, with the task of\nensuring that all parties respect the terms of the Lusaka\nAgreement. We deplore the fact that the United Nations\npeacekeeping force has still not assumed its crucial\nresponsibility in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We\ncall upon the Security Council to give due priority to this\nmatter so that a peacekeeping force is dispatched\nexpeditiously, as delay to do so may imperil the\nimplementation of the Agreement.\nThe rebellion in Angola continues because of arms\nsupplies from outside to the forces of destabilization. The\nSecurity Council is fully apprised of this and confident that\nthose guilty of breaking the embargo on arms supply to\nUNITA will be identified and held responsible. The people\nof Angola have indeed suffered too long. We therefore\nappeal to all nations to take necessary steps to ensure that\nunscrupulous elements do not channel weapons to the\nforces of rebellion in Angola out of their greed of monetary\nwindfalls. The international community needs to intensify\nits efforts to end the rebellion in Angola.\nThe armed conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea ended\nwith the signing recently of an agreement with the help of\nthe OAU and several African leaders and friendly countries.\nWe hope that the spirit in which the two countries have\nagreed to end their differences will continue and that lasting\npeace will return to the region. We are also heartened by\nthe fact that an agreement has been signed between the\nparties concerned to end the internal strife in Sierra Leone.\nWe are confident that peace and stability will now return to\nSierra Leone.\nIn the Comoros, forces of destabilization have\ncontinued to thwart the return to normalcy. Through tireless\nefforts by the OAU and countries of the region, a\nconference of all the Comoros parties concerned was held\nearlier this year in Madagascar with a view to reaching an\nagreement under which peace and stability would return to\nthe Comoros and territorial integrity and sovereignty would\nbe maintained. Unfortunately, the military coup derailed the\nwhole process. We therefore call for the establishment of\ndemocratic rule in the Comoros so that the agreement\nreached at the Antananarivo conference can be fully\nimplemented.\nThe Kosovo conflict has distressed us all. We have\nwitnessed the horrors of ethnic cleansing, massive\ndisruption of the life of a people and terrible destruction\ninflicted on a country. We must all remember many\nmessages from the events in Kosovo. Humanity will not\nsit idly by when people are flagrantly subjected to\ngenocide for reason of ethnic bigotry or political\nexpediency. Quick-fix military action to resolve\ndeep-rooted problems is not necessarily the best option.\nThe United Nations remains the most appropriate\nmechanism for addressing issues that relate to\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nMauritius is deeply distressed by the violence in East\nTimor, the loss of so many innocent lives and the terrible\nsufferings inflicted on the Timorese people in the\naftermath of the recent referendum. We welcome the\naction undertaken by the United Nations to send a\npeacekeeping force to restore peace and security on the\nisland. The verdict of the referendum must be respected\nby the Indonesian Government and all parties concerned.\nIn the Middle East, the determination shown by the\nnew Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Ehud Barak, to move\nthe peace process forward, together with President Arafat,\nis most encouraging not only to the parties concerned in\nthe region but also to the international community as a\nwhole. This moment of great optimism must be seized in\norder to work out a comprehensive and just settlement\nthat will bring lasting peace and stability to the region.\nIn 1996 our delegation, led by the Prime Minister of\nMauritius, The Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam,\ndrew special attention to the situation in Fiji. We are\npleased that the new constitutional process under which\ngeneral elections were recently held has removed the\niniquities which were written into that nation's\nConstitution before. We welcome this change and\ncongratulate the people of Fiji on their courage and\ndetermination to bring the change in a democratic and\npeaceful manner.\n(spoke in French)\nConflicts and wars, even after they have ended,\ninvariably leave serious humanitarian situations behind\nthem. The humanitarian crises in Africa seem of little\ninterest to the cameras of international television\nnetworks. There are more than 12 million people who\nneed urgent humanitarian assistance in Africa. The\nhumanitarian agencies have received only $352 million\nalthough their needs for Africa in 1999 are in the order of\n$796 million.\nPeacemaking efforts must be supported by effective\nhumanitarian aid, especially for refugees. The host\n9\n\n\ncountries, already faced with their own difficulties, cannot\ntake on this heavy burden. To give lasting peace a real\nchance, it is also necessary to support the return of refugees\nso as to make the stabilization of society possible. A special\nfinancing effort on the part of the international community\nis necessary to that end.\n(spoke in English)\nRespect for human rights is of primordial importance\nfor the prevention of conflicts and for the maintenance of\ndurable peace. We believe that all countries should make\nstrict adherence to the human rights instruments of the\nUnited Nations a matter of national priority. We in\nMauritius always place human rights high on our national\nand international agenda. Mauritius was honoured to host\nthe First OAU ministerial conference on human rights, held\nearlier this year in the context of the celebration of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. The conference reviewed the human rights situation\nin Africa and adopted a declaration and plan of action\nwhich aim at strengthening the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights.\nWe have witnessed gross violations of human rights,\nparticularly under military regimes. In this regard, the\ndecision at the recent OAU summit in Algiers to exclude\nfrom that organization those leaders who assume power in\nthe continent through military coups is an important step\nthat will help the cause of democracy and human rights.\n\nMauritius has welcomed the International Criminal\nCourt and was amongst the first to ratify the Statute\nestablishing it. We look forward to an early conclusion of\nthe work of our experts who are currently engaged in\nfinalizing the rules to enable the International Criminal\nCourt to commence its work.\nThe easy availability of light and small-calibre\nweapons has given rise to numerous conflicts, particularly\nin Africa. These small arms, besides exacerbating conflicts,\ngive rise to social disruption, insecurity, instability, violence\nand crime. In view of the magnitude of the problem, the\nOAU summit in Algiers last July decided to convene a\nregional conference to address the issue fully. We urge the\ninternational community to take measures to control the\nflow of small arms.\nDisarmament is essential for international peace. It\nis regrettable that the threat of nuclear holocaust will\naccompany humanity into the new millennium because of\nthe international community's failure to work out a regime\nfor the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Under the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty we have\ntaken important steps on the issue of nuclear\ndisarmament, but these alone cannot eliminate the threat\nof nuclear weapons. Mauritius continues to be firmly of\nthe belief that the best way for the international\ncommunity to address the nuclear disarmament issue\neffectively is to establish a clear timetable for nuclear-\nweapon Powers to commit themselves to dismantle all\nnuclear weapons and for all nations to commit themselves\nto not develop such weapons in the future. So far we\nhave adopted half-way measures only; it is time for a\nbold step to be taken that would eliminate nuclear\nweapons once and for all.\nChemical weapons, as weapons of mass destruction,\ncan inflict untold miseries on their victims. The\nConvention on Chemical Weapons \u2014 a very significant\nachievement \u2014 must be adhered to by all nations,\nparticularly countries that have chemical weapons in their\npossession.\nThe lives of many people around the world, in\nAfrica in particular, continue to be affected by landmines.\nWe believe it is the responsibility of all nations to address\nthis problem collectively. We appeal to those countries\nthat have not yet acceded to the Ottawa Convention on\nanti-personnel mines to do so and also to contribute\nfinancially to the efforts to remove all landmines.\nPeace, security and development are indivisible and\nmutually reinforcing. As we stand at the threshold of the\ntwenty-first century we have a historic opportunity to\ncreate a long-term visionary strategy for the sustainable\ndevelopment of all countries of the world, in particular\nAfrican States, and thus promote international peace and\nsecurity. This is extremely important if we really want to\navoid the marginalization in the wake of the irreversible\nprocess of globalization and unbridled liberalization. It is\nincreasingly being realized that market forces alone\ncannot resolve the problems of poverty, deprivation and\nmarginalization, particularly in Africa, which comprises\nthe largest number of least-developed countries. The\nUnited Nations system, in our view, has an important role\nto play in this respect as there is a crying need for\ncoherence in the formulation and implementation of\npolicies in the trade, finance and social sectors.\n10\n\n\nIt is true that globalization brings both challenges and\nopportunities, but to many developing countries the\nchallenges are proving overwhelming. But there does not\nseem to be any alternative, in a world characterized by the\n\u201cpens\u00e9e unique\u201d, to making the necessary adjustments to\njoin a fast globalizing world economy. Higher levels of\ninvestment; technology transfer; and institutional, human\nresource and infrastructure capacity-building, will be\nrequired especially for African countries, if they are to\nmake the necessary transition.\nThe developed world and the major financial and\ntrading organizations must be not only cognizant of the\nsituation but also responsive to the constraints on and needs\nof the developing world in general and the least-developed\ncountries and vulnerable small island developing States in\nparticular.\nThe heavy debt burden, the declining level of official\ndevelopment assistance \u2014 which currently stands at 0.22\nper cent of gross domestic product compared to the target\nof 0.7 per cent \u2014 and insignificant private investment\nflows into Africa do not allow many African countries to\nimplement successfully the necessary adjustment\nprogrammes to compete effectively in the world market.\nOnly decisive action to resolve the debt problem can\nprovide the necessary impetus.\nAlthough we recognize that the Cologne Summit\ninitiative represents an improvement over the original\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, we\nbelieve that the unsustainable debt of Africa \u2014 which\ncontains 33 of the 41 HIPC countries \u2014 should be written\noff, for only then can those countries embark on the path of\nsustainable growth and development.\nIn that connection, we welcome the recently\nannounced plan to cancel $27 billion of debt owed by the\npoorest countries to allow them to use those resources to\nfinance education and health, which are important in\ndealing with the problem of poverty.\nWe also commend the World Bank for establishing the\n$400 million Infrastructure Investment Fund, whose\nadvisory board will be headed by Mr. Nelson Mandela,\nformer President of South Africa.\nCapacity-building in all sectors of the economy is\nimportant if developing countries are to benefit from the\nopportunities arising from globalization and trade\nliberalization. But in view of the lack of a level playing\nfield and the inherent obstacles facing African, Caribbean\nand Pacific countries, it is imperative for them to continue\nto benefit from trade preferences in the European Union\nunder the successor to the fourth ACP-CEE Convention\nof Lom\u00e9 for a sufficiently long transitional period before\nthey implement any alternative trade arrangement.\nThe euphoria created following the signing of the\nMarrakesh agreement in 1994 after the conclusion of the\nUruguay Round has been short-lived; many developing\ncountries today recognize that they are overburdened with\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) commitments and\nobligations. There is indeed a growing recognition that\nimplementation of these commitments is simply beyond\ntheir capacity, or rather that there is a limit to trade\nliberalization and deregulation.\nIt is, therefore, important to allow developing\ncountries flexibility within the world trading system to\nimplement policies in harmony with their sustainable\ndevelopment needs. The provisions on special and\ndifferential treatment in all areas covered by WTO\nagreements should be fully and effectively implemented.\nIn this regard, it is also crucial that the multilateral\ntrading system should facilitate the process of regional\nintegration, because for many countries regional\nintegration is an important step towards their integration\ninto the global economy.\nWe welcome and support the recent OAU decision\nto accelerate implementation of the 1991 Abuja Treaty for\nthe establishment of an African Economic Community.\nThis process could be facilitated by effective\nimplementation of the United States of America-Africa\nBlueprint adopted in March 1999 and more importantly,\nof the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. We urge the\nUnited States to ensure early passage of this long-standing\nBill with its original provisions on textiles and clothing.\nTwo days ago, I had the opportunity in my address\nto the recent Assembly special session to highlight both\nthe inherent constraints on small island developing\ncountries and their development needs. The special\nsession gave us an opportunity to review the\nimplementation of the Barbados Declaration and\nProgramme of Action for the sustainable development of\nsmall island developing States (SIDS): we must take the\nprocess further to embrace other issues, such as\nconcessional loans and trade preferences for SIDS.\nI reiterate my appeal to the international community\nto give special attention to the plight of SIDS, in terms\nboth of providing financial resources, and of encouraging\n\n\n\nforeign direct investment, and also in the context of the\nnegotiations for the third WTO Ministerial Conference, in\nSeattle. We must ensure that the Conference, which is to be\nheld later this year, addresses the marginalization of small\neconomies and the problems of developing countries that\nare net importers of food by adopting specific and practical\nmeasures. We must also see to it that the Seattle Round of\nmultilateral trade negotiations is a \u201cdevelopment round\u201d that\nputs the issue of development firmly on the international\nagenda. The WTO negotiations in Seattle should be broad-\nbased and should provide a balanced outcome from which\nall countries will benefit.\nIn this connection, it should be emphasized that\nagricultural trade is of vital importance to a number of\ndeveloping countries, in particular to small economies\nincluding small and vulnerable island developing States. In\nthe agricultural trade negotiations we should give just as\nmuch importance to non-trade issues such as food security,\nenvironmental protection and the viability of rural\npopulations.\nThese are vital issues for Mauritius, and for many\nother SIDS and small economics and small economies. And\nthat is why we are emphasizing the multifunctionality of\nagriculture. Planting sugar cane, which is the only crop\nsuitable to our difficult terrains, and which is resistant to\nadverse climatic conditions like cyclones and droughts, also\ncontributes to environmental protection by providing a\nrenewable source of energy. Sugar exports earnings assure\nfood security. Many small island developing countries are\nin the same situation as Mauritius. We would therefore urge\nthat this important dimension be fully taken into account in\nthe WTO negotiations on agriculture.\nEconomic growth by itself does not bring about\nsustainable socio-economic development. Social\ndevelopment should continue to be given due consideration\nby our Organization. We therefore welcome the follow-up\nconferences on social development and on women, which\nwill be organized next year.\nFor the majority of small States, the United Nations\ncontinues to be the main bulwark against infringements on\ntheir sovereignty and territorial integrity. We have\nconsistently drawn the attention of the Assembly to the\nissue of the Chagos Archipelago, which was detached from\nMauritius by the former colonial Power prior to our\nindependence in 1968, and also to the plight of over 2000\npeople who were forced to leave the land of their birth,\nwhere they had lived for generations, for resettlement in\nMauritius. This was done in total disregard of the United\nNations declaration embodied in resolution 1514 (XV), of\n14 December 1960, and resolution 2066 (XX), of 16\nDecember 1965, which prohibit the dismemberment of\ncolonial Territories prior to independence.\nMauritius has repeatedly asked for the return of the\nChagos Archipelago, including Diego Garcia, on which a\nUnited States military base has been built, and thereby the\nrestoration of its territorial integrity. The over 2,000\ndisplaced Ilois people have been facing tremendous\ndifficulties in adapting in mainland Mauritius, in spite of\nall the efforts that Mauritius has made to assist them in\nthis process.\nSo far the issue has been discussed within the\nframework of our friendly relations with the United\nKingdom, with a view to arriving at an acceptable\nsolution. Unfortunately, there has not been significant\nprogress. The United Kingdom has been maintaining that\nthe Chagos Archipelago will be returned to Mauritius\nonly when it is no longer required for defence purposes\nby the West. While we continue the dialogue for an early\nresolution of the issue on a bilateral basis, we urge the\nUnited Kingdom in the meantime to allow the displaced\ninhabitants to return to the Chagos Archipelago. At the\ndawn of the new millennium, when we so strongly uphold\nuniversal recognition of and respect for fundamental\nhuman rights, the inhabitants of Chagos should not\ncontinue to be denied the right to return to the Chagos\nArchipelago.\nThe restoration of the territorial integrity of the State\nof Mauritius will not be complete without the return of\nTromelin. We therefore call upon France to resume\nconstructive discussions with us on the question of\nTromelin.\nThis is the last session of the General Assembly for\nthis century. When we meet next year it will be a new\nmillennium. The question that comes to our minds is\nwhether we want to come back next year and discuss the\nsame issues and the same problems. Should we not,\nrather, make a pledge here and now that by the time we\nmeet next year we will have taken the necessary measures\nthat will put an end to regional and ethnic problems and\nto the abuse of human rights, and will instead create the\nnecessary environment to enable the human race to enjoy\nbasic freedom and basic rights in peace and prosperity?\nMauritius is ready to make such a pledge.\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You may count on the\nfull support of my delegation, on behalf of which it is my\nhonour to address the General Assembly today. I am\nconvinced that with your talent and your experience as an\nestimable diplomat you will guide the work of the\nAssembly to a successful conclusion.\nI wish also to take this opportunity to convey to\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti, our\nsatisfaction at the commitment and skill with which he\nguided the work of the Assembly at its fifty-third session.\nLet me also reaffirm the gratitude of the Government\nof Mali to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for the determination and wisdom he has shown\nin the quest for solutions to the central concerns of the\ninternational community.\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is\ntaking place at the dawn of the third millennium, at a\ntime when the gap between the developed and the\ndeveloping worlds is growing ever larger. Imbalances in\n9\n\n\nthe world economy, the unequal distribution of wealth,\npoverty, grave and massive violations of human rights,\nmassacres and conflicts of every kind pose a serious threat\nto international stability.\nDespite significant progress in many areas, the United\nNations continues to face daunting challenges. It must\nformulate a collective approach with shared responsibility\nand greater, more effective solidarity to bring about the\neconomic cooperation that is indispensable for lasting peace\nand security for all. In that context, many and varied\nchallenges face Mali, Africa, the world at large, and the\nUnited Nations at the end of the twentieth century, such as\ndebt, development financing, security including\ndisarmament and international terrorism, democracy, human\nrights, international migration and United Nations reform.\nLast year we spoke out from this rostrum against a\nglobalization dominated by market forces and a financial\napproach, and in favour of a globalization based on\nsustainable human development. That is the real challenge,\nand our growing conviction is that we can resolve all\npresent imbalances if, through renewed, responsible and\ncandid political dialogue, we tackle them with a global and\nunified vision, with commitment to genuine partnership, and\nwith a sense of shared, equal responsibility in the building\nof a better world, a world for mankind. That is the\napproach we must take to addressing the problems of\ndeveloping countries: indebtedness, their integration as real\nactors in the world economy, and development financing.\nThe problem of developing-country indebtedness must\ncontinue to be a focus of the attention of the international\ncommunity with a view to finding a lasting solution that\nwill be acceptable to all. To be sure, the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative and the initiative\nadopted at the Cologne summit of the Group of Seven in\nJune 1999 were important steps. But, because it absorbs\nmore than a third of the export income of developing\ncountries and because debt-servicing costs imperil the\nfuture of generations to come, debt is an insurmountable\nobstacle to any development effort. The debt burden must\nnot merely be lightened; debts must be cancelled. Without\nplaying down any responsibility here, debt cancellation has\nbecome necessary in order to enable the efforts and\nsacrifices made by developing countries to yield their full\nbenefits for their peoples. Debt cancellation, along with a\nnew, more rational debt policy based on the productive\ncapacities of these countries, would lay the foundations for\ntrue, sustainable development financing.\nLong seen as an act of generosity by the rich\ntowards the poor, development assistance is now viewed\nas a tangible expression of a solidarity that is\nindispensable. It has significantly declined in recent years,\nand we must do everything possible to reverse that trend\nin order to better meet the financing needs of developing\ncountries. My country, Mali \u2014 which has already enacted\nsignificant political, economic and structural reforms \u2014\nhopes that special attention will be given to the situation\nof African countries in any consideration of this matter.\nI appeal to developed countries completely to fulfil their\ncommitment to increase official development assistance,\nto build up our economic capacities in the areas of\nprocessing and marketing our commodities, and to pay\nproper prices for our products and facilitate market\naccess.\nThe current state of affairs demands a new\npartnership based on an acknowledgement that\ndevelopment financing is a shared responsibility, which\nshould be reflected in more equitable burden-sharing\namong donors. Here, the high-level meeting on\ndevelopment financing is of crucial importance. My\ndelegation believes that that meeting should be seen in the\ntwo-fold context of follow-up to the major summits and\ninternational conferences of the 1990s and of the General\nAssembly\u2019s Agenda for Development.\nMore than half a century after the creation of the\nUnited Nations, there is no further need to prove its\nrelevance and contribution to the disarmament agenda and\nto building international peace and security. Here I stress\nthe particular importance that Mali attaches to\ndisarmament in general and to micro-disarmament in\nparticular. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free\nzones on the basis of arrangements freely entered into\namong the States of the region concerned, and the\nextension of such zones to all regions of the world, will\nmake a significant contribution to international peace and\nsecurity. In that connection, I would recall that Mali has\nratified the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty \u2014\nthe Pelindaba Treaty \u2014 to manifest its support for the\ninitiative to make Africa a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nHowever, let us make no mistake about it, what\ntoday seriously threatens peace, the security of women,\nmen and children in Africa are small arms and anti-\npersonnel mines.\nAs we take stock of the progress made in combating\nthe proliferation of small arms since the fifty-third\nsession, while we appreciate the efforts of the United\n10\n\n\nNations Panel of Governmental Experts, we totally support\nthe appeal for action adopted by the International\nConference on Sustainable Disarmament for Sustainable\nDevelopment, held in Brussels on 12 and 13 October 1998.\nWe should welcome the historic decision of the member\ncountries of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), on the initiative of Mali, to declare a\nmoratorium on the export, import and production of small\narms starting on 1 November 1998 and lasting for three\nyears, a moratorium that is supported by a code of conduct.\nThe meeting of the ECOWAS Ministers for Foreign Affairs\nthat was held in Bamako in March 1999, defined the\nmodalities for the implementation of the programme of\ncoordination and assistance for security and development,\nand adopted a plan of action in nine priority areas to make\nthe moratorium operational. These efforts deserve support\nfrom the international community so that there will be more\noverall cooperation to stem the proliferation of small arms\nand mitigate their devastating effects.\nAlso, it is essential to support and extend this\nmoratorium, to apply more strictly the laws and rules in\nforce on arms transfers, to improve them and strengthen\nthem at all levels and to back them up with codes of\nconduct. We also need to strengthen the capacity of States\nand increase coordination to deal with this phenomenon.\nBut we also need to work on a progressive and effective\ninternational normative mechanism to control the circulation\nof small arms. We support very strongly the decision of the\nAssembly to convene an international conference on this\nquestion.\nSimilarly, we must continue our work to free the\nworld of the scourge of anti-personnel mines, and in\nparticular we need to rid Africa of them, for they continue\nto sow death and mayhem even after conflicts end. We will\nachieve this by working in the context of the Maputo\nDeclaration and seeing to it that everyone, without\nexception, ratifies and implements the Convention on the\nbanning of anti-personnel mines. We ratified the\nConvention very early on, and our country has destroyed its\nmeagre stock of these weapons, which we never in fact\nused. Mali is now adopting the national legislation required\nby the Convention on the banning of anti-personnel mines.\nIn the last 50 years, peacekeeping operations have\nbecome an important tool for resolving conflicts by\npeaceful means and for promoting international peace and\nsecurity. However, I would like to say that in and of\nthemselves, they are not a solution to conflicts, but only\nspecial measures to prevent conflicts from getting worse\npending a peaceful solution.\nOur constant quest for peace is reflected in our\neffective participation in peacekeeping operations and our\ntotal support for the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution in Africa, to which the\ninternational community should give special attention. We\nask the international community to mobilize quickly, in\ngood time and to a greater extent to support the\nimmediate implementation of hard-to-reach and always\nprecarious peace agreements, as well as peace-building\nprogrammes.\nMali also supports any measures to help create a\nclimate allowing us to confront the causes of conflicts,\nwhich now relate primarily to underdevelopment, poor\ngovernance, deficiencies in democracy and bad\ncooperation policies. We pin great hopes on the decision\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to make the\nyear 2000 a year of peace and security in Africa, and we\nvery much hope that the international community will\ngive strong support to our continent in its prevention and\npeacekeeping efforts.\nI cannot fail to mention here the close link between\nsecurity and development and the consequent need to\nfinance security as an integral part of development action.\nNor can I conclude without mentioning the ghastly,\nappalling question of child soldiers.\nPresident Konar\u00e9 has said in this regard,\n\u201cwe have an absolute responsibility for the sad lot of\nchild soldiers, which is not acceptable and cannot be\nborne; we must put an end to it by unambiguously\ncondemning all those who use these children and\nwho instil in them a culture of violence, thus sowing\nthe seeds of the perpetuation of violence and\nconflicts ... We must work for a real culture of\npeace. The place of our children is in school; it is\nour responsibility to put an end to this heinous\nphenomenon by denouncing it and taking vigorous\nsteps against it, including international criminal\nsanctions. Post-conflict programmes must include\namong their priorities the reintegration through\neducation of child soldiers; and in a general way it\nmust make education the heart of the strategy for\nbuilding peace and sustainable development.\u201d\nThe decision to hold a special session of the General\nAssembly to follow-up to the World Summit for Children\nin 2001 coincides with the commemoration of the tenth\nanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nWe must take that opportunity to hasten our attainment of\n\n\n\nthe objectives that we have set for ourselves with regard to\nchildren.\nWe have a unique responsibility towards them. The\nleast we can do on the eve of the new millennium is to\nprovide all boys and girls better health, schools and\nprotection from wars and famines.\nMali is staunchly committed to democracy and human\nrights. Observance of human, political, civil, economic,\nsocial and cultural rights is an integral part of economic\nprosperity, social equity and the promotion of peace and\nsecurity. In this context, a certain number of minimum\nstandards are necessary in any democracy based on law and\nrespect for human rights. I am referring to values that we\nall deem to be fundamental and the observance of which\nwe are committed to: rule of law, respect for human rights,\na system of democratic government and the conditions for\nnecessary changes of government in a republican and\ndemocratic system. In a democracy, this is the minimum\nthat we must all, each and every one of us, consolidate,\nbuild and develop.\nThe situation in the Middle East remains a source of\nconcern, despite the revival of the peace process. I wish to\nreaffirm here the unreserved support of Mali for the just\nstruggle of the Palestinian people as well as for a\ncomprehensive just and lasting solution based on the\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council and the\nprinciple of land for peace.\nTurning now to the Lockerbie crisis, Mali, basing\nitself on the progress made in dealing with this question,\nappeals for the complete, immediate lifting of the sanctions\nthat have been unjustly imposed on the fraternal people of\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahirya, and I am pleased to renew to\nthem the support and solidarity of the people of Mali.\nLikewise, we are still concerned at the humanitarian cost to\ncivilians in other countries that have been unjustly targeted\nby sanctions.\nSecurity and stability are facing new threats, including\nthe problem of drugs \u2014 which has become worse with\nglobalization \u2014 organized crime, international terrorism,\nmoney-laundering and corruption. In the face of these\nthreats and their adverse effects of them, the international\ncommunity must step up its efforts to put in place the\nmechanisms necessary to eradicate them and cooperate\nbetter in order to combat them. In regard to international\nterrorism, Mali signed the African convention in Algiers,\nand we support the appeal of the OAU for the speedy\nconclusion of an international convention in order better\nto prevent terrorism and to combat it more effectively.\nToday, when mankind is preparing for a new\nmillennium, it is essential to adapt the United Nations to\nthe needs of our time. The challenges that we will be\nfacing demand that we adopt appropriate measures now\nso that the next century will enjoy more peace and more\njustice in a new partnership based on solidarity among all\nnations.\nIf the United Nations is to remain the gathering\nplace in which all countries can make their voices heard\nto find solutions to problems that confront them, it must\nnot be marginalized. Therefore, it is necessary today more\nthan ever to review the functioning of the system of the\nOrganization in order to adapt it to present and future\ncircumstances.\nMy delegation is convinced of the need to\ndemocratize further our Organization through a\ncomprehensive restructuring of its main organs,\nparticularly the Security Council, the composition of\nwhich reflects the state of the world as it was 50 years\nago and which does not in any way reflect the political,\neconomic and social realities of today\u2019s or tomorrow\u2019s\nworld.\nIn addition, my delegation reaffirms Africa\u2019s demand\nfor an equitable division among the two categories of\nseats. We call upon Member States to reinforce the\nprestige, the authority, the effectiveness and the\nlegitimacy of the Council.\nThis session gives the international community a\nunique opportunity to demonstrate once again that the\nUnited Nations is an active, dynamic institution, capable\nof confronting the major concerns of the world. In order\nto do this it must prove that, despite the sometimes\ndiscouraging complexity of the issues involved and the\noften divergent national interests of Member States, the\nOrganization is capable of working with determination,\ncreativity and effectiveness for the common good of all.\nThis is what we aspire to.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr.President, it is an honour to\naddress the General Assembly at this session, the last to be\nheld in the twentieth century.\nMay I begin by welcoming the Republic of Kiribati,\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to the\nfamily of the United Nations. We look forward to working\nclosely with the new Members.\nThe twentieth century has been described as the age of\nextremes. In this century, human civilization made quantum\nstrides in progress and prosperity. We discovered the ocean\ndepths, travelled into the outer space and landed on the\nmoon. We have witnessed the technological and\ninformation revolutions transforming the wide world into a\nglobal village.\nThe twentieth century has also been a violent and\ntragic century. Millions died in the two world wars and\nhundreds of other conflicts. Millions perished as a result\nof poverty and disease.\nThis session of the Assembly offers an opportunity\nto identify the major global challenges which humankind\nis likely to confront in the next century. The United\nNations should therefore devote the next year to evolving\nways and means to address these challenges and to\npromoting an agreed approach next year at the\nMillennium Assembly.\nPeace remains the foremost challenge of our times.\nThe end of the cold war and the triumph of the principles\nof democracy and free markets created hope for the dawn\nof universal peace. This, unfortunately, turned out to be\nelusive. Instead, conflicts have continued to ravage the\nworld.\nLong-suppressed national aspirations, as well as\nfrustration with continuing inequity and deprivation, have\nled to widespread violence and wars, between and within\nStates. The several conflicts afflicting Africa, the Balkans\nand the Caucasus, as well as Palestine, Kashmir and\nAfghanistan, are painful reminders of the ascendance of\nwar and the absence of peace.\nThe United Nations, under the wise leadership of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, has endeavoured to cope\nwith these conflicts and crises. Unilateral approaches,\naccompanying the centralization of global influence, have\nnot always ensured just and durable solutions to complex\nproblems rooted in history, religion, politics and\neconomics in various parts of the world.\nIn the final and decisive confrontation of the cold\nwar, 1.5 million Afghans were killed, a million were\nmaimed, and a whole country was destroyed. Ten years\nafter the foreign intervention ended, almost 3 million\nAfghan refugees are still in Pakistan and Iran. With no\nreconstruction and no development in that poor country,\nthe new generation knows nothing but war. Rehabilitation\nand reconstruction are the right of the valiant Afghan\npeople. Economic development, accompanied by\neducation and modernization, is the best way to end\nviolence, promote human rights and improve social\nconditions in Afghanistan.\nPeace in Afghanistan is vital for Pakistan. Turmoil\nin Afghanistan creates turbulence on our frontier. The\npreservation of Afghanistan\u2019s territorial integrity is pivotal\n28\n\n\nfor peace and stability throughout Central Asia. Peace in\nAfghanistan will open vast opportunities for commerce and\neconomic interaction between Central Asia and South Asia\nand beyond.\nPakistan has persisted in promoting peace and\nreconciliation in Afghanistan. We support the efforts of the\nUnited Nations as well as the \u201csix plus two\u201d process.\nPakistan is constantly endeavouring to bring about an end\nto the fighting and promote reconciliation and political\naccommodation between the Taliban Government and the\nNorthern Alliance.\nThe world has welcomed the resumption of the peace\nprocess in the Middle East. We earnestly hope that it will\nproceed smoothly to culminate in the establishment of a just\nand durable peace based on the fundamental rights of the\nPalestinian people, including their right to their own State,\nand the withdrawal of Israel from the Syrian Golan Heights\nand southern Lebanon.\nWe are glad that the tension between morality and\nlegality has been overcome in Kosovo. We are happy the\nKosovar refugees have returned home. Yet Kosovo\u2019s\ntravails are not over. Pakistan will continue to support the\nefforts of the United Nations for peace in the Balkans.\nIn East Timor, we trust that the human tragedy has\nended, even as the United Nations peacekeepers arrive\nthere. I wish to pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan and my compatriot, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker,\nwho were greatly challenged in the process of fostering\nfreedom in East Timor while safeguarding stability.\nWe have learned valuable lessons from Kosovo and\nEast Timor: a people\u2019s aspiration for freedom cannot be\nsuppressed indefinitely; a free exercise of the right of\nself-determination is indispensable for peace; self-\ndetermination can be best exercised in an environment free\nof fear and coercion; and the United Nations is best placed\nto oversee the exercise of self-determination.\nThese conclusions were already accepted for Kashmir\n50 years ago. The Security Council decided that the final\ndisposition of the disputed State of Kashmir should be\ndetermined by its people, in a free and impartial plebiscite\nheld under United Nations auspices. India resiled from its\nacceptance of this agreement and from its own pledge to\nallow the Kashmiri people to decide their own future. On\none pretext or another, it refused to implement the\nprovisions of Security Council resolutions.\nIndia's repression in Jammu and Kashmir has killed\nthousands of Kashmiris, forced hundreds of thousands\ninto exile, led to three wars between Pakistan and India\nand consigned the two countries to a relationship of\nendemic conflict and mistrust. Pakistan and India can and\nmust overcome this unfortunate legacy.\nTo this end, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, soon after\nassuming office two and a half years ago, proposed the\ninitiation of a comprehensive, structured and sustained\ndialogue between Pakistan and India to address Kashmir,\npeace and security and other outstanding issues. India\nagreed, after one year, to a dialogue on Kashmir. To\nprovide political momentum to the bilateral dialogue,\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif invited Prime Minister\nVajpayee to visit Pakistan.\nAt the Lahore summit, India and Pakistan committed\nthemselves to intensify their efforts to resolve Kashmir,\nbuild mutual confidence and peace and pave the way for\nbroader cooperation. In Lahore, the Pakistan Prime\nMinister urged his Indian counterpart to ease the\nrepression in Kashmir. He cautioned that without progress\non Kashmir political dynamics could compromise the\ngood intentions reflected in the Lahore Declaration. But\nIndia displayed no desire to genuinely address, let alone\nresolve, the Kashmir issue. Its cruel repression of the\nKashmiri people continued unabated.\nThe Kargil crisis was a manifestation of the deeper\nmalaise spawned by the unresolved Kashmir problem and\nIndia's escalating repression of the Kashmiri people. India\nlaunched a massive military operation in Kargil and\nthreatened a wider conflict by mobilizing its armed forces\nall along the Pakistan-India international border. Pakistan\nacted with restraint. We believed that war between two\nnuclear-armed neighbours must be avoided. We offered\nimmediate de-escalation and negotiations to address\nproblems along the Line of Control, including India's\nviolation of this Line and occupation of Chorbatla,\nSiachen and Qamar. Pakistan's efforts led to the\ndisengagement by the Kashmiri freedom fighters from the\nKargil heights and offered a renewed opportunity for\nnegotiation and dialogue.\nPakistan is ready for the resumption of the Lahore\nprocess with India. However, instead of reciprocating\nPakistan's willingness to pursue negotiations, India has\nposed preconditions for resuming the talks. The Indian\nmilitary deliberately shot down an unarmed Pakistan\nnaval aircraft on a routine flight within our airspace,\nkilling 16 of our naval personnel \u2014 mostly young\n29\n\n\ntrainees \u2014 in cold blood and without any warning. India is\nalso continuing hostilities along the Line of Control and has\nrepeatedly launched attacks across the Line in several\nsectors.\nKashmir is not a dispute over land. It is about the\ndestiny of a people; it is about implementation of the\nresolutions of the Security Council; it is about respect for\nthe fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, especially\ntheir right to self-determination. The complete boycott by\nthe Kashmiris of the sham elections in Kashmir organized\nby India earlier this month is clear testimony of their total\nalienation from India. No settlement can be durable if it is\ncontrary to their wishes.\nThe Kashmir issue cannot be frozen while its people\nare determined to secure their freedom; while the blood of\nKashmiri martyrs is being shed by the bullets and bayonets\nof the 700,000-strong Indian occupation force. Human\nrights must be upheld not only in Kosovo and Timor, but\nalso in Kashmir. To make progress towards a settlement,\nthe world must demand that India take immediate steps to\nhalt its repression of the Kashmiri people.\nFor this purpose, India must: first, stop the cruel\ncrackdowns against Kashmiri villages and urban areas;\nsecond, release the thousands of Kashmiris held in\ndetention centres and jails; third, remove military pickets\nand troops stationed in Kashmiri towns and villages; fourth,\nallow the presence of international human rights\norganizations in Kashmir; fifth, agree to the stationing of\nimpartial human rights monitors in Jammu and Kashmir;\nsixth, entrust the International Committee of the Red Cross\n(ICRC) with a larger role in Kashmir, including the\nprovision of relief and help to the thousands of Kashmiri\nwidows and orphans; and, seventh, agree to a progressive\nreduction of the 700,000 Indian troops deployed in\nKashmir.\nThe international community is increasingly conscious\nof the imperative for a just resolution of the Jammu and\nKashmir dispute. The risk of a wider conflict cannot be\ncontemplated in a nuclear environment. Kashmir remains on\nthe Security Council's agenda. The Council's resolutions\nremain to be implemented. The promise of self-\ndetermination made by the United Nations to the Kashmiri\npeople remains to be fulfilled. Therefore, while we will,\nhopefully, soon resume bilateral talks with India, Pakistan\nwould welcome the association of the genuine\nrepresentatives of the Kashmiri people with the negotiating\nprocess to promote a solution consistent with the United\nNations Security Council resolutions.\nIndia's ambitions threaten to further propel our\nregion towards a dangerous nuclear and conventional\narms race. For decades \u2014 even after India's first nuclear\nexplosion in 1974 \u2014 Pakistan sought to exclude nuclear\nweapons from South Asia. Ironically, the advocates of\nnon-proliferation imposed discriminatory restrictions\nagainst Pakistan while ignoring India's steady\ndevelopment of nuclear and missile capabilities. Last May\nIndia put the final nail in the coffin of South Asian non-\nproliferation when it conducted five nuclear tests and\ndeclared itself a nuclear-weapon State. Its leaders then\nproceeded to threaten Pakistan. Confronted by an\naggressive nuclear India, Pakistan was obliged to\ndemonstrate its nuclear capability and thus restore nuclear\ndeterrence and strategic balance in South Asia. The\nresponse of the major Powers, to penalize not only the\noffender but also the victim, was patently unfair.\nEven after our tests, Pakistan proposed nuclear\nrestraint to India, consistent with our conviction that\nnuclear deterrence can and should be maintained between\nPakistan and India at the lowest possible level. In our\nseparate dialogues with the United States and India, we\nproposed a strategic restraint regime outlining specific\nmeasures for nuclear restraint and stabilization,\nconventional arms balance and the resolution of\noutstanding disputes. Hopes for restraint have been\nshattered by the announcement of India's nuclear doctrine,\nsetting out plans to acquire and operationally deploy a\nhuge arsenal of land-, air- and sea-based nuclear weapons\nand to further build up its conventional forces, almost all\nof which are deployed against Pakistan. Even the Indian\noffer of non-first use of nuclear weapons is designed to\ngain it acceptance as a nuclear-weapon State and to\njustify the acquisition of a massive nuclear arsenal as a\nsecond-strike capability.\nIndia's pursuit of this doctrine will destabilize South\nAsia. Pakistan will be compelled to enhance its nuclear\nand missile capabilities and operational readiness to\npreserve deterrence. India must test again to develop\nwarheads for its missiles. This would subvert the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). India's\nquest for its large nuclear arsenal could jeopardize\nprospects for the conclusion of a fissile material cut-off\ntreaty. India's ambitions threaten peace and stability not\nonly in South Asia, but also in adjacent regions, including\nthe Gulf and the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean.\nThe international community must act \u2014 and it must\nact immediately \u2014 if it is to avoid a hair-trigger security\nenvironment in South Asia, with grave implications for\n30\n\n\nglobal peace, security and disarmament. To this end, the\nAssembly should endorse the concept of strategic restraint\nin South Asia.\nFor this purpose, it should urge India to do the\nfollowing.\nFirst, India should disavow the proposed nuclear\ndoctrine. Secondly, it should refrain from any further\nnuclear tests and adhere to the CTBT. For its part, Pakistan\nremains committed to adhering to the CTBT in an\natmosphere free of coercion. Thirdly, it should undertake\nnot to operationally deploy nuclear weapons on land, air or\nsea. Fourthly, it should open negotiations with Pakistan for\nan agreement to achieve balance in fissile material stocks,\nwhile both India and Pakistan participate in the fissile\nmaterial treaty negotiations, expected to commence early\nnext year in Geneva. Fifthly, India should eschew the\nacquisition of anti-ballistic missile systems and any\nmilitary-related capabilities in space; and sixthly, cut back\ndrastically on its plans to purchase and develop various\nadvanced and destabilizing conventional weapons systems.\nIn this context, Pakistan appeals to those countries which\nintend to supply these conventional weapons to India to\nreconsider their policies.\nPakistan believes that it is now essential to convene a\nconference, with the participation of all the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council and other interested\nPowers, as well as Pakistan and India, to promote the goals\nof strategic restraint and stability in South Asia.\nThe threat of nuclear war does not emanate only from\nSouth Asia. Although the strategic confrontation of the cold\nwar is over, the major nuclear Powers, even while pressing\nfor non-proliferation by others, have asserted their own\nright to possess nuclear weapons indefinitely. The\nimplementation of strategic arms reduction agreements is\nstalled. If the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty is\nrescinded or revised, and missile defence plans are\nimplemented, the nuclear-arms race may well be revived\namong the nuclear-weapon States. And heightened tensions\namong them, over new or old disputes, could once again\nmove the nuclear doomsday clock closer to midnight.\nPakistan supports the endeavours to achieve nuclear\ndisarmament and the early elimination of all nuclear\nweapons. Multilateral negotiations can evolve agreed plans\nto realize these vital objectives. We also support the call for\npreserving the ABM Treaty and avoiding the development\nand deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems.\nNegotiations to prevent the further militarization of outer\nspace should be initiated forthwith in the Geneva\nConference on Disarmament.\nIn a globalized yet divided world, with modern\nweaponry and communications available to almost\neveryone, terrorism has emerged as a pervasive challenge\nin many parts of the world. It is a complex phenomenon\nwith many manifestations, a lethal tool used by ruthless\nindividuals, groups and States.\nPakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations, wherever it occurs. For a decade, during\nthe Afghan war, Pakistan was the single largest target of\nterrorism from across our borders. Even today, our\nadversaries foment fear in Pakistani cities by sponsoring\nand financing terrorist bomb blasts and random violence.\nOur eastern neighbour has mastered the black art of state\nterrorism in Kashmir, utilizing the tactics of crack-downs,\ncustodial killings, disappearances, arson, torture and rape,\nas tools of repression against the Kashmiri people's\nstruggle for freedom and self-determination. It is with\ngood reason that the non-aligned countries have\ndenounced the repression of peoples under foreign\noccupation as the worst form of terrorism.\nPakistan condemns the reprehensible tendency in\ncertain quarters to link manifestations of terrorism with\nIslam. We welcome the resolution adopted earlier this\nyear by the Commission on Human Rights which\ndenounced attempts, including in the media, to defame\nIslam and link it with terrorism.\nFree markets and free political systems, accompanied\nby breath-taking technological advances, are rapidly\nintegrating our world across frontiers and continents.\nUnfortunately, most developing countries have been\nbypassed by the benefits of globalization. Income\ninequality has increased among and within countries. And,\nas the Asian financial crisis showed, growth has often\nbeen fragile.\nMarket forces alone will not yield an equitable\neconomic outcome for all peoples. At the tenth United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD X) and other international conferences, we\nneed to rethink current development strategies and\nformulate new approaches for broad-based development,\nguided by the need for economic equity for individuals\nand nations.\nAction is required in three main areas. First, in the\narea of trade, we need a truly level playing field to\n31\n\n\nencourage greater balance in the benefits of a rules-based\nmultilateral trading system for the developing countries.\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial\nConference in Seattle can advance this goal by resolving\nproblems involved in the implementation of the Uruguay\nRound agreements on textiles and agriculture and\naddressing priority issues for developing countries in future\nnegotiations \u2014 not by insisting on premature liberalization\nin sectors where they are unable to compete. In Seattle, we\nmust also oppose the forces of protectionism disguised as\nmovements to promote environmental and social standards.\nSecondly, in the financial area, we need a more stable\nfinancial order which can control the volatility of capital\nflows, make available adequate liquidity, especially for the\ndeveloping countries, alleviate their debt burden, and ensure\ncoherence between global financial and trade policies. The\nhigh level \u201cevent\u201d on financing for development could help\nto build agreement on these issues.\nThirdly, technology: in an increasingly knowledge-\nbased global economy, the technology and knowledge gap\nbetween the developed and developing countries must be\nrapidly narrowed. To this end, it would be useful to evolve\nglobal principles and guidelines for access to and transfer\nof technology.\nIn our globalizing yet fractured world, marked by stark\ncontrasts between prosperity and poverty, between\ntranquillity and turbulence, the hopes of hundreds of\nmillions of people lie in the United Nations, the most\nuniversal global institution. The United Nations must play\nits role, as prescribed in the Charter, as the centre for the\nharmonization of the policies of Member States and as the\ncentral instrument for collective security. The Security\nCouncil's procedures must be made more transparent and\ndemocratic, to reflect the collective will and views of all\nStates Members of the United Nations.\nThe Assembly must also agree on the objectives and\nprinciples and the approaches and instruments which will\nenable the international community to respond to the\nemerging challenges posed by conflicts, arms proliferation\nand unequal globalization. It is here, at the United Nations,\nthat we must seek consistent respect for the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations Charter, and respect for its\nbinding decisions. Only thus can we realize the vision of\npeace and prosperity for all peoples in a global environment\nof freedom and democracy.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like\nfirst of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly. It attests to the esteem in which the\ninternational community holds you and your country. I\nwould like to include in this tribute the Secretary-\nGeneral, who bears the weighty responsibility of\npromoting the universality of the Organization and the\neffectiveness of its action. Lastly, I wish to congratulate\nthe three new Members of the United Nations. The great\nand fine ideal that the United Nations embodies is very\nmuch alive \u2014 of this I am firmly convinced.\nThe United Nations is undertaking a grand civilizing\nendeavour, a task that is constantly being challenged but\never necessary. To unite peoples to work together for\npeace and development, to affirm a body of legal rules\nframing relations among States and to achieve common\nstandards: that is the goal of the United Nations \u2014 a\ncivilizing goal.\nThat goal is achieved first of all through the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts. The role of the Security Council\nin this mission is more vital than ever, a pre-eminence it\nderives from the Charter. France will recall this\nfundamental rule as often as necessary. To be sure, there\nhave been circumstances when an urgent humanitarian\nsituation dictated we should act immediately, but such an\n26\n\n\napproach must remain an exception. We must take care, as\nin the case of Kosovo, to reintegrate this action into the\ncontext of the Charter. Our fundamental rule is that it is for\nthe Security Council to resolve crisis situations. For that\nreason, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s new\nstrategic concept recalls that the Washington Treaty\nrecognizes the primary responsibility of the Security\nCouncil in the maintenance of peace.\nIndeed, the universal nature of the Organization is\nintangible. The United Nations must strive to respond to\ncrises, wherever they may occur. While we have not\nhesitated to do precisely that in recent years and on several\ncontinents, I would like to express regret at the relative\ntimidity of the Organization where Africa is concerned. The\nextent of the tragedies on that continent requires us to take\nmore resolute action.\nUniversality is compatible with complementarity in\naction. In the interests of efficiency, the United Nations\nmust encourage, in every part of the world, regional\narrangements among States capable of handling crises in\nthe first instance. Such is the spirit of Chapter VIII of the\nCharter. Tasks should be realistically shared between the\nregional organizations and the Security Council without\nweakening the latter\u2019s authority. For instance, my country\nhas, through the RECAMP programme, along with others,\nstrengthened African peacekeeping capabilities through\nassistance provided under United Nations auspices in\ncooperation with the Organization of African Unity.\nInternational security also demands continued\ndisarmament in the context of multilateral and verifiable\nagreements. This is an ongoing objective for France, which\nhopes that the work of the Conference on Disarmament will\nbe relaunched in the months prior to the Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. France would like to see\nthe prompt entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty, the start of negotiations on banning the\nproduction of fissile materials for nuclear-weapon use, and\nthe conclusion of a verification protocol to the Biological\nWeapons Convention. We would not support any\ndevelopment that might bring the Anti-Ballistic Missile\nTreaty into question and upset strategic balances.\nThe United Nations mission is not limited to the\nsettlement of conflicts between States. With humankind\u2019s\ngrowing aspirations for greater freedom and responsibility,\nthis mission extends to the safeguarding of human dignity,\nwithin each State and, when necessary \u2014 as the Charter\nallows \u2014 against States. State-instigated violence has\nspawned serious humanitarian crises over the past few\nyears. Civilians have been targeted, whole populations\nhave been forcibly displaced, and refugee camps are not\nlonger secure. This is unacceptable. Consequently, we\nmust uphold the principle of international intervention,\nunder United Nations auspices, to assist the victims.\nEvery crisis recalls the need for the founding\nprinciple of working for peace and for respect for the law\nand the human person. A case in point is the conflict in\nKosovo. Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which\nlaid down the foundations of the settlement, illustrates\nthese principles and this resolve.\nWe have set ourselves ambitious objectives: ensuring\nsecurity for all, organizing reconstruction, ensuring\ncoexistence between communities, transferring authority\nto local leaders, and promoting democracy and pluralism.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative and the\nKFOR Commander have done remarkable work. Much,\nhowever, remains to be done. The atrocities must be\nstopped, the exodus stemmed and housing built before\nwinter. On the political front, preparations must be made\nfor the future, which will require establishing dialogue\nbetween the communities. Elections will, I hope, be held\nin the year 2000. France has made resolute efforts in this\nrespect, alongside its partners in the European Union,\nwhich is providing half the international financing agreed\nupon by the conference of donors for Kosovo.\nIn East Timor, another people is asking that its\nrights be recognized. Overwhelmingly, it chose\nindependence through a referendum. Some have tried to\noppose that choice with violence. I therefore welcome the\nadoption, on 15 September, of Security Council resolution\n1264 (1999). It paves the way for the restoration of peace\nand should enable the democratic process to be\nsuccessfully concluded. France is participating in the\ninternational force established by decision of the Security\nCouncil.\nOur Organization therefore remains true to the\nvalues we celebrated last year, on its fiftieth anniversary.\nBut much effort is still needed for these values to be\nrespected everywhere. To achieve this, it is essential to\nstrengthen international criminal law. France actively\nsupports the work of the international criminal tribunals\nof The Hague and Arusha. The establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court will be a new and decisive\nstep in the progress of law. France hopes that it will be\nset up quickly; to that end, it has already amended its\nown Constitution.\n27\n\n\nTo carry out its mission, the United Nations needs\nassured means. In order to deal with financial difficulties\nand prevent these from becoming a pretext for inaction, all\nMember States must meet their financial obligations\nvis-\u00e0-vis the Organization. France does so completely and\nunreservedly. A responsible attitude on the part of\ncontributing States would advance the necessary reform of\nthe Organization, including that of its Security Council.\nI should like to share with the Assembly my second\nfirm conviction: that the United Nations is admirably suited\nto meeting the challenges of our new world. Indeed, its\nmission is strengthened by globalization.\nInitially, the idea of organizing relations between\nStates at the world level may have seemed utopian to some.\nIt was merely before its time. Indeed, I consider the United\nNations to be modern for the following reasons. Our global\nand unstable world needs organization and the goal of the\nUnited Nations has always been to seek a better\norganization of the world. The United Nations is in step\nwith a networked world. It is itself a network, a rich and\nunique panoply of specialized but independent and\ncoordinated agencies. In half a century, the United Nations\nhas made a tool for action which can be adapted to our\nworld. The United Nations has not aged; it has grown with\nthe world. It must allow us to face the new challenges\nemerging in today\u2019s world.\nA contradictory state of affairs has replaced the\neuphoric illusion which followed the end of the\nconfrontation between blocs 10 years ago. Globalization is\nnot monolithic. While it is unifying, it also divides. While\nit generates remarkable progress, it also leads to\nunacceptable inequalities. While it opens societies to one\nanother, it carries with it the threat of creating uniformity.\nWhile it frees up energy, it also releases negative forces\nthat must be brought under control. The movement of\npopulations and the clash of cultures are therefore\naccompanied by rising fears as to identity, by religious\nintolerance and by xenophobia. France, which has a\npresence on five continents and is itself a land of\nimmigration, has had experience of such confrontations in\nits history. It knows the risks they entail and the wealth\nthey bring. We will give our full support to the world\nconference on racism, to be held in 2001. Preventing the\nemergence of prejudice, which too often has deadly\nconsequences, will prepare the way for peace for future\ngenerations.\nThe fruits of globalization are not shared equally. The\nopening of economies, the increase in trade and the\nacceleration of technological progress all fuel growth. But\ninequalities are growing between countries and within\neach economy. Nearly one in four human beings lives in\ngreat poverty. We cannot leave matters as they stand. The\nrapid expansion of communications networks does not\nbenefit everyone. Yet the multiplication of sources of\ninformation, the increased circulation of ideas and the\nprofusion of new inventions are full of promise. Lower\ncommunications costs made possible by the Internet can\nbe an asset for businesses in countries in the South. But\ninequalities in education hinder access to these\ntechnologies. These impressive instruments for furthering\nknowledge may become formidable factors in inequality.\nCommunication is also a right. It is essential that this\nright not be threatened by the concentration in just a few\nhands of sources of information and the means of\nproduction and distribution. France will staunchly defend\ncultural diversity.\nGlobalization must encourage all of us to take\naccount of the fragility of our world \u2014 our Earth and our\ncommonweal. Our environment is not a product, a simple\nstock of raw materials on which we can draw without\ngiving thought to future generations. True development is\nsustainable development. Since the Rio Summit in 1992\nthis realization has been behind the adoption of important\ncommitments with regard to the climate, biodiversity and\ndesertification. The Kyoto Protocol on climate change and\nthe current negotiations on a protocol on biosafety attest\nto the importance of the achievements. But the uncertain\nfuture of climates and the recurrence of natural\ncatastrophes urge us to make further efforts.\nThe Earth is fragile, but so, too, is the human\nspecies. The spread of new epidemics endangers the\nhealth of entire populations. Inequalities in development\nexacerbate those scourges. Some 40 million people live\nwith the AIDS virus today, the majority of them in\ndeveloping countries. The spread of the pandemic in\nAfrica is a matter of major concern for us. I shall come\nback to that issue.\nGlobalization is changing the nature of organized\ncrime, an area in which there has been a real explosion.\nThe much greater fluidity in movement allows criminal\nnetworks to exploit the inconsistencies between one\nnational law and another and the weaknesses of some of\nthem so as to hide from justice. My country is ready to\nmake every effort to combat this scourge. The President\nof the French Republic made that clear last year at the\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to that\nissue. The United Nations has long been engaged in the\n28\n\n\nfight against international drug-trafficking, building up\nexpertise, establishing specialized services and drafting a\nbody of doctrine and a legal framework. These must be\nstrengthened. But, above all, States must be more\ncommitted to action. In January negotiations began in\nVienna on a convention against transnational organized\ncrime. We must bring this to a satisfactory conclusion in\nthe year 2000.\nFaced with globalization, we have a choice to make.\nWe can either go along with the supposedly universal\neconomic laws, and in so doing abdicate our political\nresponsibilities, or we can seek to impose order on\nglobalization and thereby achieve control of our collective\nfuture. For my part, I believe that global problems call for\nglobal responses and that an unstable world needs to be\nregulated, requiring what our Anglo-Saxon friends might\ncall \u201crules and regulations\u201d. This world needs rules. It\nneeds the United Nations.\nThis choice is also a matter of sovereignty. As the\nSecretary-General pointed out on 8 December last year in\nParis, the first words of our Charter, \u201cWe the Peoples of\nthe United Nations\u201d, make it an expression of popular\nsovereignty. But in order for the sovereignty of peoples to\nbe affirmed they must find the means to acquire the\nmechanisms, the means of control and the benefits of\nglobalization. That is my third conviction. The more the\nworld becomes globalized, the more it needs rules. Faced\nwith the temptation of unilateralism, it is more necessary\nthan ever to base our action on multilateral rules respected\nby all. First of all, these concern the economy. We must\ndefine the rules of the game so that everyone can benefit\nfrom globalization. We must define the rules of the game\nbetween the industrial and developing countries and\nbetween the major economic actors, small and medium-\nsized business and the citizens of our countries who work\nand produce.\nIn the financial sphere, we have to strengthen the\nstability of the monetary and financial system by ensuring\nthe political legitimacy of the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF), involving the developing countries more closely in\nthe adoption of common rules and making private financial\noperators liable for the consequences of their decisions for\ncountries in crisis. Real progress has been made since the\ncrises of 1997 and 1998. France contributed to this by its\nproposals, especially in regard to hedge funds and fiscal\nhavens. It will continue to work to this end, as much\nremains to be done.\nThese rules of the game have to be based on better\ncoordination among international institutions. Since 1945,\ninternational cooperation has respected the principle of\nspecialization of institutions. In the future, the task is to\nmake them more complementary. Economic and trade\nrules cannot disregard the most elementary social and\nenvironmental norms. Accordingly, France supported the\nadoption by the International Labour Conference a year\nago of a declaration on the fundamental principles and\nrights involved in labour. The International Labour\nOrganization (ILO) is an irreplaceable forum for dialogue\nbetween government and social partners and for the\nformulation of minimal standards. It is desirable that it\nestablish close relations with other organizations, such as\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World\nBank.\nFor these rules of the game to be better respected,\nappropriate cooperation has to be established with the\npoorest countries. Their debt burden continues to be the\nprimary obstacle to development. At their meeting in\nCologne, the G-7 countries pledged to grant further debt\nrelief. France contributed to this. Three principles will be\napplied: solidarity, which calls for us to grant the poorest\ncountries the most favourable debt treatment; fairness,\nwhich requires the rich countries to share the financial\neffort in a balanced way; and responsibility, whereby the\ncountries benefiting from this aid undertake policies\ndirected towards sustainable development and the fight\nagainst poverty. For these countries, official development\nassistance remains indispensable. France will continue to\nadvocate greater effort on the part of the richest countries.\nOur action should be increasingly inspired by the\naffirmation of common values and rules. Human rights\nare central to this approach. I am referring in particular to\nthe weakest children. The ILO Convention which outlaws\nthe worst forms of child labour is a new case in point.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the\nChild must be supplemented as soon as possible by the\ntwo protocols now being negotiated, one against the\nrecruitment of children in armed conflicts, the other\nagainst the sale of children and child prostitution and\npornography.\nTo affirm the rights of women is to recognize their\ndecisive role in education, in the production of wealth and\nin development. But it is also to combat the\ndiscrimination and violence which they suffer. France has\nmade equality between women and men one of the\ncornerstones in the renewal of its public life. The\nadditional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination\n29\n\n\nof All Forms Discrimination against Women, submitted to\nthe General Assembly for approval, offers women the\npossibility to assert their rights in an individual capacity.\nThat is a major step forward. The special session of the\nGeneral Assembly in June 2000 will highlight the progress\nthat has been achieved since the 1995 Conference in\nBeijing.\nReaffirming the right of all human beings to health\nmeans combating pandemics everywhere. In December\n1997, in Abidjan, France proposed the establishment of a\n\u201ctherapeutic solidarity fund\u201d to mobilize the international\ncommunity to care for and treat AIDS sufferers. The\ncountries of the South and associations involved in\ncombating the disease welcomed the proposal warmly. But\nthe impact of AIDS on development remains dramatic. We\nmust intensify our efforts to reduce this plague. Only the\nUnited Nations can give these efforts the necessary breadth.\nThe principle of precaution has to be the basis for our\naction regarding the environment and health safety. The\nMontreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer,\nbased on the principle of differentiated commitments\nbetween the North and South, is an example of well-\nconceived international action. These efforts must be\ncontinued. We will do so by advocating, with our European\nUnion partners, a world convention on forests and by\nredoubling efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the\natmosphere. Precaution must also be the guiding principle\nin monitoring food safety. The combination of concern for\nsustainable agriculture, the quality of products and the\npreservation of food traditions in each country explain the\nintensity of recent reactions. France therefore intends to see\nthese demands taken into account at the forthcoming WTO\nnegotiations.\nIn order to address and overcome the world\u2019s\nproblems, to derive the best from globalization, we need\nnations to be aware of their responsibilities, and we need\nalso to have \u201cmore\u201d of the United Nations. Through an\nOrganization strengthened by a renewed sense of mission,\nsupported by sovereign States and regional organizations,\nwe will be able to further respect for human rights, promote\ndemocracy, work for sustainable development and help all\nto achieve their potential.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to associate myself with previous\nspeakers in expressing to you, Sir, and to the members of\nthe Bureau, my delegation's warm congratulations on your\nelection to lead us in the General Assembly at this\nsession. You can count on our total support for the\naccomplishment of your difficult task.\nI would also like to express my appreciation to your\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the skill and\ncompetence he exhibited during his mandate.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on having joined the\ngreat family of the United Nations.\nFinally, allow me to pay tribute to the work of Mr.\nKofi Annan, the Secretary-General of our Organization,\nfor his ceaseless efforts in favour of international peace\nand security. My country, Burundi, fully appreciates his\nvaluable contribution to the search for a negotiated\npolitical solution to the crisis it has suffered since October\n1993.\nAs the work of the current session of the General\nAssembly is taking place, my country is striving to turn\na new page in its history. Burundis have decidedly chosen\ndialogue and negotiation to put an end to the armed\nconflict that has lasted for almost six years. The Arusha\npeace talks that began in June 1998 under the aegis of the\nformer President of the sisterly country of Tanzania,\nMwalimu Julius Nyerere, are being actively pursued and\nare now at a crucial stage.\nThe sixth round of the Arusha peace talks, which\nended a few days ago, was preceded by fruitful\nconsultations held in Dar-Es-Salaam among the six\nprincipal negotiators aimed at reaching a compromise\n23\n\n\nbased on the drafts submitted by the negotiating parties or\ngroups of parties. These consultations, which represent the\nkeystone of the peace process, should resume on 4 October.\nWe hope that this time they will have tangible results that\ncould serve as a basis for the final Arusha agreement.\nLet me briefly recall the specific context in which the\nArusha process was initiated in June 1998: five years of\nrelentless fratricidal war between the rebels and the\nGovernment, in which the principal victims had been, as\nthey continue to be, hundreds of thousands of innocent\nchildren, women and elderly people, for the most part\nunarmed. More than 30 years of massacres and killings\nhave torn asunder the very fabric of society and resulted in\nentrenched hatred and extreme mistrust among the various\nethnic and political groups. Repeated crises have resulted in\nmassive flows of refugees and a major diaspora.\nFurthermore, economic development plans have been\nconsistently hamstrung by recurring political instability.\nIt was in that context that the Government objectively\nand deliberately decided to abandon the logic of war and to\nchoose political dialogue in which all the people of Burundi\ncould participate without exception, regardless of the\nmanner \u2014 peaceful or armed \u2014 in which they previously\nhad chosen to make their political demands. The armed\ngroups were a particular focus of this dialogue, and it was\nmainly because of them that the negotiations were held\noutside the country.\nThe goal is to reach a comprehensive peace agreement\nand ultimately achieve full national reconciliation among\nthe entire population of Burundi, without exception.\nSeveral obstacles continue to stand in the way of that\nlofty goal, which will not be attained if timely efforts are\nnot made to overcome those challenges.\nThe first obstacle is the failure of the armed rebel\nfactions to participate in the negotiations. Differences of\nopinion within those movements, where the armed groups\nno longer recognize the authority of the political leaders\nwho are participating in the Arusha negotiations and thus\nreject the outcome ahead of time, have resulted in a\nsituation in which the validity and viability of any peace\nagreement reached without those parties would be in doubt.\nThe Government of Burundi believes that it is\nimperative to set aside the formalities advocated by the\nmediators and to invite the armed factions to participate\nfully in the peace process. The Government of Burundi is\nwilling to consider any form of negotiation with them,\nwithin or outside the process.\nMediation should take place immediately, because\nwe are working against the clock in this fragile peace\nprocess, which could be jeopardized or brought to a halt\nby events. If, after being invited, the armed factions or\nother parties to the negotiations refuse to participate in the\npeace process, we would agree with the mediators that\nBurundi, in close and steadfast cooperation with its\nneighbours, must isolate and neutralize the rebels or other\nparties that are unwilling to participate in the negotiations.\nThe second obstacle is the continuing violence. In\nother crisis situations, political dialogue for conflict\nsettlement is preceded by a ceasefire or a suspension of\nhostilities. In the case of Burundi, however, that necessary\ncondition for negotiation has been neglected since the\nbeginning, as if it were optional. The Government draws\nto the attention of the subregion and of the international\ncommunity the serious and continuing acts of violence\ncommitted by the rebels despite the ongoing peace\nnegotiations. These unrestrained and cowardly acts of\nviolence, whose main target is unarmed civilians, have no\nmoral or political justification. No one even claims\nresponsibility; it is pure terrorism.\nIf the rebels were eventually to use as a pretext the\nfact that they had wished to participate in the\nnegotiations, it would have no validity because, as I have\njust stated, the Government is open to any initiative that\nmight lead to the cessation of the hostilities, which have\ngone on for far too long. The situation is serious, and the\nGovernment of Burundi requests the international and\nregional communities to help it in the following ways.\nFirst, through effective cooperation with\nneighbouring countries in the area of security, including\nwith the Republic of Tanzania, with which cooperation\ndecisions were taken at the ministerial level on two\noccasions, in February and August 1999; those decisions\nhave not been implemented. There is no doubt that if\nthose decisions were translated into joint action on the\nground, both external and internal rebel activities would\nsoon cease.\nSecondly, it is necessary to disarm and neutralize\nthose Burundi rebels who are active in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, where they are able to obtain a\nready supply of arms and ammunition for their bases in\nTanzania, as they have not been able to re-establish those\n24\n\n\nthey lost in South Kivu in 1997 after the first war in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nThirdly, the countries of the region must wage a\ncommon struggle against transnational rebel movements,\narms trafficking and genocidal ideology. Those movements\nhave created alliances without borders. Among the rebels\nwho operate in Burundi are the Interahamwe, the former\nRwandan armed forces and Ugandan rebels, among others.\nThe Burundi rebellion has become regional in scope and\nmust be combated from that perspective. Intensified activity\nhas been noted on the part of the factions in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo since the Lusaka agreement, which\nprovided for their disarmament. The conflict is thus being\nregionalized, with Burundi and/or Tanzania as its epicentre.\nPrevention is better than cure. There is a real risk of\nanother regional conflagration resulting from the countries\nconcerned taking measures to protect themselves against\nthese widespread rebellions. In any case, the Government\nwill find it difficult to sign the peace agreement if it is not\npreceded by an effective halt to the violence on the ground.\nThe population, parts of which are still being massacred,\nwould simply reject it.\nThe third \u2014 although not the least significant \u2014\nobstacle to the peace process is the extreme poverty that\nthreatens the people of Burundi with social and economic\nannihilation. That poverty is not the result of a reduction in\nagricultural production, which has continued somehow\nthanks to the hard-working nature of our countryfolk. Nor\nis it the result of the embargo imposed by the countries of\nthe region, since economic and financial cooperation with\nthose countries was and still is very limited. It results above\nall from the freezing of bilateral and multilateral\ncooperation by certain partners, countries and financial\ninstitutions in line with the economic sanctions imposed by\nthe subregion. Those regional sanctions were suspended on\n23 January this year, and Burundi expected that, mutatis\nmutandis, our international partners would resume their\ncooperation in conformity with the subregional action. That\nhas not yet happened, and some financial institutions, which\nanticipate no practical problems, are blocked by their\nshareholders at the political level. It is said that we will\nhave to wait for the signing, or even the implementation, of\nthe Arusha Agreement.\nPeace and national reconciliation in Burundi will not\nbe restored through revolution. It is a process that will be\nconsolidated over time. Nothing spectacular will happen the\nday the peace agreement is signed. It is progressive reform\nactivities, taking place as a result of courageous and\ndetermined political will, that will stabilize the country\nover the months and years following the signing of the\nagreement. All the parties involved in the negotiations\nagrees that peace will be not an event, but a process.\nFurthermore, the rate at which negotiations proceed will\nnot be subject to the Government\u2019s control; it will be\nlinked to the procedures followed by the mediators and to\nthe willingness of the 17 other parties to the negotiations\nto place the national interest above all else, to distinguish\nbetween what is essential and what is of secondary\nimportance, and to realize that the true road to peace will\nbegin after the signing of the Arusha Agreement, among\nthe citizens of Burundi themselves.\nThe Government of Burundi calls on its partners to\nreassess the situation and consider the realities on the\nground as a matter of great urgency. The extreme stress\nunder which the population has been suffering for six\nyears is pushing it towards a popular uprising. The\nresponsibility lies with the international community,\nwhich is committed in this respect. The Government has\nprovided all it can: proof of its irreversible political will\nto negotiate until a peace agreement is reached.\nThe Great Lakes region has become a real powder\nkeg because of the persistence of insecurity. With regard\nto the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi\nwelcomes the signing in July of the Lusaka Peace\nAgreement. We call on all the parties to that conflict to\ncontinue to make efforts to restore a climate of dialogue,\ntrust and reconciliation, so that energy can be\nconcentrated on actions aimed at economic recovery and\ndevelopment.\nBurundi is not a belligerent in the war that is pitting\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo against some of its\nneighbours. The Government of Burundi has already had\nthe opportunity to explain that fact to the international\ncommunity on several occasions in various forums,\nincluding from this lofty rostrum last year; in Lusaka,\nwhere it participated in all the meetings as an observer\nand as one of the countries neighbouring the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo that were concerned about the\nsecurity of their common border; and in meetings of the\nOrganization of African Unity.\nListening to the statement made in this Assembly by\nthe Chairman of the delegation of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo on 29 September, I was astonished\nby his confusion and the degree of malice he expressed\ntowards my country, Burundi. I should like to respond by\nmaking several comments.\n25\n\n\nFirst, Burundi is not at war with the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, either individually or in alliance\nwith any other party.\nSecond, Burundi has no reason to be at war with the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. It is true that it is poor\nand that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is rich. But\nBurundi has never wanted, does not want, and will never\nwant to live off the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It\nwill develop a policy of normal cooperation with that\ncountry, as has always been the case, in particular within\nthe Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries.\nFurthermore, the trading arrangements that exist between\nthe border towns and border provinces do not cause\nBurundi any problems and should continue.\nThird, Burundi has no political ambitions in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, at either the central or\nthe provincial level.\nFourth, Burundi had just signed an agreement for\ncooperation on border security when war broke out.\nFifth, Burundi has adopted an attitude of strict\nneutrality with regard to the conflict, and has no interest in\nit.\nSixth, several months after war broke out Burundi was\ninformed of the presence among the Congolese troops of\nthe armed Burundi rebel movement, the FDD. Burundi\u2019s\nassessment was that the FDD had a threefold objective:\nfirst, to obtain arms and munitions to strengthen their bases\nin Tanzania; secondly, to cross Lake Tanganyika and\nrecover the bases they had lost in south Kivu facing the\ncapital, Bujumbura, and the provinces of Bubanza and\nCibitoke, where the civil war broke out in 1994; and,\nthirdly, to obstruct trade on Lake Tanganyika to and from\nBurundi through the port of Mpulungu in Zambia, which is\nthe only import-export corridor remaining following the\neconomic blockade imposed by the region in an attempt to\nsuffocate the country.\nSeventh, Burundi had to defend itself, and decided to\nadopt necessary border defence and security measures on\nland and on Lake Tanganyika in order to counter-attack the\nFDD rebels. It was a question of life or death. Those\nmeasures will remain in place as long as the threat of\ninsecurity caused by the FDD, and coming from the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, remains.\nThat is the absolute truth. The allegations made by the\ndelegation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo that\nBurundi is acting aggressively towards their country, are\ngroundless and based on invention and misinformation.\nBurundi is ready to do all it can to help to resolve the\nconflict. It welcomes in particular the fact that two\nmilitary observers were sent to Burundi in the framework\nof the pre-deployment exercise decided upon by the\nUnited Nations.\nBurundi cannot fail to welcome the prospects for a\nfinal resolution of the crisis in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, which would immediately remove the threat\nof insecurity at the common border and, we hope, involve\nthe FDD rebels in the peace process in Burundi.\nAt this final General Assembly session of the\nmillennium, my delegation hails the giant steps taken by\nmankind in science and technology, information and\ncommunication, democracy and development \u2014\nespecially during the twentieth century, which is now\ndrawing to a close. At the same time, we deplore the\nscourges that have marked this century, such as all\nmanner of wars and conflicts and a range of evils and\nnatural or man-made catastrophes. Our greatest wish is\nthat the new millennium will bolster our achievements\nand add new triumphs for the well-being of the whole of\nmankind. We want to see in the next millennium a world\nin which peace will prevail over conflict, justice over\ninjustice and impunity, freedom over oppression and\ngenerosity over selfishness.\nWe seek the creation of a world in which the gap\nbetween rich countries and poor countries will be bridged;\na world in which all men and all women will live decent\nlives, work in peace and eat their fill; a world in which\nthe concepts of freedom, democracy, brotherhood and\ndevelopment can have true meaning in every corner of the\nearth.\nFor all peoples and all nations to set about attaining\nthese purposes, the United Nations must play the role of\nvanguard and catalyst to generate and maximize all the\nnecessary energy. The key to such success is, first and\nforemost, peace. The peace that we desire for Africa we\nalso want to see benefitting all mankind everywhere on\nearth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Socialist\nRepublic of Viet Nam and on my own behalf, I should\nlike to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. I am convinced that, thanks to your experience\nand wisdom, this session will have a successful outcome.\nI should like also to express my thanks and great\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for\nhis important contribution and the effectiveness of his\npresidency during the fifty-third session.\nI should also like to congratulate and warmly\nwelcome the three new States Members of the\nOrganization: the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. The Government and\nthe people of Viet Nam are pleased to greet those three\nPacific countries and to assure them of our willingness to\nestablish and develop fruitful and close cooperation.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is of\nspecial significance. As a bridge between the twentieth\nand twenty-first centuries, it will prepare us for entering\na new century and a new millennium. This is therefore an\nimportant moment, as it affords us the opportunity to take\nstock of the advent and evolution and the highs and lows\nof this greatest international Organization over more than\nhalf a century. Such an assessment will help us draw\nlessons and provide us with the necessary valuable\nexperience from which we can identify what needs to be\ndone so as to allow the United Nations to continue to\nplay its role and exercise its influence in the world today\nand in the future.\nThe twentieth century, which is drawing to a close,\nhas been marked by great achievements for humankind at\nevery level of its development, but it also requires us to\nreflect deeply about problems unforeseen in previous\ncenturies. Two world wars and hundreds of protracted\nconflicts, civil wars and situations of local tension in\nvarious regions of the world have claimed the lives of\nmore than 150 million people and left permanent scars,\nboth spiritual and physical, on hundreds of millions of\nothers. They have destroyed the creative achievements of\nmany generations, some of which was irreplaceable. That\nhas given human beings a deeper, more burning desire to\nlive in peace, security, freedom and happiness, and to\nachieve stable and sustainable development for the benefit\n16\n\n\nof humankind and our beautiful planet. The creation of the\nUnited Nations more than 50 years ago, with its clearly\ndefined statutes and objectives, contributed to the\nrealization of those aspirations. Indeed, during the twenty-\nfirst century humankind has witnessed extraordinary\nprogress in the decolonization process, the collapse of the\ncolonial system and the successful promotion of the sacred\nright of peoples to national self-determination, resulting in\nthe birth of many independent States and, therefore, in\nfundamental changes in international relations. The\nachievements of the United Nations over the past 54 years\nare due in large part to the contribution of those young,\nindependent countries.\nIn spite of the important progress made towards the\ndevelopment of nation States during the twentieth century,\nwe must acknowledge that humanity is confronted with\nmany unresolved problems. Over the past few decades of\nthis century, the explosion in science and technology,\nespecially in the field of information technology, has\nchanged the structure of many economies and profoundly\naffected the cultural and social life of every State. Our\nworld has become a global village, geographic distance is\nless of a factor than it used to be, and interdependence,\ninteraction and cooperation among States, regions and\ncontinents have continued to increase. It is unfortunate,\nhowever, that many of these achievements have not been\nused purely for the benefit humankind, but have been\nmisused or even used abusively against humankind. The\narms race, especially the development of nuclear weapons\nand other new weapons that are more and more\nsophisticated, dangerous and deadly weapons, is not only\ndraining significant resources but also threatening to destroy\npeople's lives and the environment.\nIn the past year, the situation in certain regions has\nfaced the international community with the challenge of the\npolitics of diktat practised by a group of countries and\nregional organizations. The unilateral military attacks\nagainst the territorial integrity of sovereign States in the\nBalkans and the Gulf have set a dangerous precedent in\ninternational relations, running counter to the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations and in violation of the\nfundamental principles of international law, especially those\nof respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of Member States. This presented a serious\nchallenge to the role and effectiveness of the United\nNations, as well as to its legal foundations.\nThe first lesson to be learned from those events is that\nit is not possible for the United Nations to build or\nguarantee peace and security in the world at large or at the\nregional level unless international law and the United\nNations Charter are fully respected and strictly\nimplemented. Secondly, the United Nations can play the\nrole and exert the influence that is commensurate with its\nmagnitude only if, now as well as in the future, it\nsteadfastly upholds the purposes and principles defined at\nSan Francisco 54 years ago and carries out a thorough\nand in-depth reform of its organizational structure and\noperation, in order to imbue our Organization with inner\nstrength.\nBy so doing, the United Nations will be able to\nprevent any country or regional organization from using\na pretext, or a cause such as human rights, for example,\nto trample on the independence, sovereignty or territorial\nintegrity of another country or to interfere in its internal\naffairs. By so doing, the United Nations will be able to\npreserve its important role and to meet the expectations of\nMember States with respect to preventing policies of\ndiktat and the use or threat of use of force in international\nrelations. And by so doing, the United Nations will be\nable to help create and foster the climate of lasting peace\nand security that is needed for the solid, sustainable\ndevelopment that all Member countries need today and\nwill need in the coming century.\nToday, peace and security have a dialectical and\nconsistent link with development. Development has\nbecome an important element in the broadly accepted\nconcept of security. This has made every country more\nglobally relevant while making all States less isolated. It\nshould be no surprise that socio-economic development\nhas become the main focus of the policy of the majority\nof States and an area in which the United Nations will\ncontinue to have an important role to play.\nIt is undeniable that over the past decade the process\nof regionalization and globalization has transformed the\nworld and benefitted many countries. But the side-effects\nand adverse consequences of this trend have also been\nincreasingly evident. Obvious examples have indicated\nover the past two years that those consequences could\ndestroy the achievements of long years of development\nand could lead to instability, locally and on a broader\nscale. The first victims are none other than the least\ndeveloped countries: those that face the greatest\ndifficulties in their process of socio-economic\ndevelopment and that should have enjoyed greater\nattention and more favourable conditions in the process of\nregional and global integration. Those countries can and\nshould count on United Nation support as they engage in\nthis process.\n17\n\n\nThe role of the United Nations is to promote\ninteraction among peace, security and development in order\nto ensure that globalization and regionalization will not\nevolve in a way that is incompatible with the needs, levels\nof development and specific conditions of each State and\neach region. Only then will nations be able to contribute to\nthat process and enjoy the legitimate and rightful benefits\nderived from it. Only then can equality be secured and the\npainful side-effect of this process, namely the widening gap\nbetween the rich and the poor, be addressed.\nDespite the striking progress we have made on the\nlong road of civilization, the end of the twentieth century\nis still marked by poverty and hunger, which are among the\ngravest tragedies and the greatest challenges facing\nmankind. Poverty and hunger not only lower living\nstandards in certain countries; they have become a global\nproblem, a factor for socio-political instability in many\nregions, and a problem that at present many countries\ncannot resolve by themselves. This problem will grow more\nserious if early efforts are not made to adequately address\nthe adverse consequences of globalization and\nregionalization. Over the past half century, the United\nNations and its specialized agencies have made an active\nand effective contribution to the fight against hunger and\npoverty; they have gained a great deal of valuable\nexperience, of which the Organization should now make\ngreater use. The eradication of hunger and the alleviation of\npoverty have become a primary, pressing task for the\nUnited Nations. They also form part of the Organization's\nresponsibility towards Member countries that are now\nsuffering under these twin scourges.\nThe United Nations has set as a target the halving\nworld hunger and poverty by 2015. To this end, it is crucial\nthat every country's internal resources be mobilized, but\nexternal cooperation to create an enabling environment for\ndevelopment is equally important; it is, indeed,\nindispensable. We are convinced that the United Nations\ncould play an important role in promoting North-South\ncooperation by encouraging developed countries to expand\ndirect investment, provide and secure long-term financing,\nopen their own markets and grant preferential terms of\ntrade to developing and least developed countries, fulfil\ntheir commitment of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product for official development assistance,\npromote technology transfer, support human-resource\ndevelopment, vocational education and training and join\nother countries in implementing the 20/20 initiative on\nsocial development, especially the commitments embodied\nin the October 1998 Hanoi declaration on the 20/20\ninitiative. Such support by the United Nations will facilitate\nevery nation's efforts and will gradually and effectively\ntackle the issue of poverty and hunger.\nThe problems facing the United Nations at the turn\nof the century are large, complex and difficult. But, with\nthe benefit of the experience of 54 years, the support of\nMember countries and the opportunities that mankind has\ngenerated, the Organization will be able to tackle them if\nUnited Nations reform is accelerated and implemented at\nan early date. In this regard, we welcome the efforts of\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to make the\nadministrative structure more effective and to cut\nunnecessary spending.\nWe consider that United Nations reform involves\nenhancement of the role of the General Assembly, the\nprincipal organ in which the vast majority of members of\nthe international community are represented, to reflect\nfully the principles of democracy and equality among\nMember States. Reform of the Security Council is the\nmost important part of the process. Viet Nam's consistent\nview is that the Security Council needs to be made more\nrepresentative by increasing the number of both\npermanent and non-permanent members and by bringing\nabout greater democratization, transparency and\naccountability. Viet Nam is of the view that an\nindispensable element of reform is that a representative of\nthe developing countries must be a permanent member of\nthe Security Council.\nWith regard to the expansion of the Security\nCouncil, we support those candidates, such as India,\nJapan and Germany, that have the capacity to make a\nmajor contribution to the work of that important organ. At\nthe same time, it should be stressed that the veto power\nshould be used only in accordance with the letter and the\nspirit of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\nViet Nam welcomes the encouraging prospects of a\npeaceful settlement of conflicts and tensions in certain\nregions of the world, such as the Great Lakes region of\nAfrica, and the resumption of the peace and reconciliation\nprocess in the Middle East. We follow with interest the\ndevelopments in East Timor and hope that there will be\nno further complications, so that the situation there can be\nstabilized soon, thus contributing to peace and stability in\nthe region. Viet Nam calls for an early and complete end\nto the policy of embargo and blockade against Cuba and\nother countries. Such policies are not only outdated, but\nrun counter to current trends towards democratization and\nequality in international relations, causing damage and\n18\n\n\nsuffering to the populations of the countries concerned,\nespecially women, the elderly and children.\nIn South-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region the\neconomic recovery in many countries over the past year has\nrestored confidence in the future. The countries of the\nregion have learned lessons, found effective solutions and\ntaken full advantage of assistance from the international\ncommunity. As a result, the growth rate has gradually\nrecovered; exports, cooperation and investment have step by\nstep been revitalized. However, full economic recovery and\novercoming the adverse impact of the crisis to ensure\nsustainable development is a continuing, long-term process,\na challenge that the countries of the region must take up.\nThe Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) has taken new steps forward. The success of its\nsixth summit, held in Hanoi in December 1998, and the\nadmission of Cambodia, which means that all 10 countries\nof the region are now members, have demonstrated a high\nlevel of unanimity and the determination and capacity of\nthe ASEAN countries to promote solidarity, expand\ncooperation and overcome difficulties to give the group its\nappropriate role, status and strength. ASEAN with 10\nmembers is now better placed to make its voice heard in\ninternational and regional forums, such as the ASEAN\nRegional Forum (ARF), the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation (APEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, on\nregional and global problems pertaining to peace, security,\ndevelopment and the survival of humankind.\nMaintaining peace and security in Asia in general, and\nin South-East Asia in particular, remains a shared concern\nof all member States. We hope that countries outside the\nregion, especially the nuclear-weapon States, will cooperate\nwith the South-East Asian countries for the implementation\nof the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone\n(SEANWFZ) Treaty. This Treaty, which came into effect\nin 1997, reflects the keen desire of the South-East Asian\ncountries for peace and security in the region, and their\nserious commitment to the disarmament goal of a nuclear-\nweapon-free world. We are pleased to note, and greatly\nappreciate, the support for the Treaty expressed by China\nand Russia.\nWhen referring to the situation in the region, one\ncannot fail to mention the situation in the Eastern Sea \u2014\nthe South China Sea \u2014 where there are still incidents that\ncause concern to the countries of the region. Viet Nam\nbelieves that disputes in that sea should be settled by\npeaceful means, through bilateral and multilateral\nnegotiations between the parties directly concerned, with\nrespect for international law, especially the 1982 United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1992\nDeclaration of ASEAN Foreign Ministers on the South\nChina Sea. While seeking a lasting solution, all the parties\nconcerned should exercise self-restraint, refrain from any\nact that may further complicate the situation and take\nconfidence-building measures to ensure regional peace\nand stability, thus facilitating the search for fundamental,\npermanent solutions. In this regard, ASEAN's current\nefforts to draw up a code of conduct in the South China\nSea, in accordance with the spirit of the sixth ASEAN\nsummit, held in Hanoi, are a step in the right direction\nand a constructive measure, contributing to confidence-\nbuilding and the peaceful settlement of disagreements in\nthe region.\nAs a Member of the United Nations and the\ninternational community, Viet Nam has done its utmost,\nand will continue to do so, to contribute to the common\nwork of humankind. Viet Nam's consistent position is to\npursue an independent, sovereign foreign policy, seeking\nthe multilateralization and diversification of external\nrelations, with regional and global integration. It wishes\nto be the friend of all the members of the international\ncommunity struggling for peace, independence and\ndevelopment. Viet Nam is an active member of ASEAN\nand APEC and is preparing to join the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) as soon as possible.\nViet Nam's diplomatic activities have been founded\non the achievements recorded over the past 12 years in\nour work of national reconstruction, the industrialization\nand modernization of the country to achieve our goal of\na wealthy people, a strong State and a just and advanced\nsociety. We have maintained a high rate of economic\ngrowth, reduced the poverty rate from 30 per cent in 1992\nto 15.7 per cent at the end of 1998, and created more than\na million jobs each year. These are tangible proofs of our\neconomic and social development. The United Nations\nand its specialized agencies have greatly contributed to\nthis achievement, as was acknowledged at the conference\nto review cooperation between Viet Nam and the United\nNations development bodies, held in Hanoi two years ago.\nFurthermore, Viet Nam has, as a member of the\nEconomic and Social Council and of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme/United Nations Population Fund\nExecutive Board, played an active part in the joint\nundertakings of the international community.\nViet Nam highly appreciates the role played by the\nUnited Nations in international life, both today and for\ntomorrow. It will make its contribution to the\n19\n\n\nOrganization's activities and will join other Members in\nrebuilding and renewing the United Nations so that it can\nlive up to the expectations of Member States and their\npeoples, and meet the demands of our time.\nDuring its more than five decades of existence as the\nworld's largest international body the United Nations has\nmade fundamental contributions to humankind's\ndevelopment in all areas and has created a legal framework\nfor international relations. What the United Nations has\nachieved to date will come with us into the new century,\nalong with the conviction that it will contribute to new\nachievements, to further progress and the resolution of\noutstanding differences between nations. While placing a\ngreat deal of hope in the United Nations, the Member\nStates also understand that its effectiveness depends on the\nactive participation of all of them.\nLooking back over the path we have travelled, we now\nappreciate more than ever the role of the United Nations\nand its capability, as well as the complexity and tenacity of\nthe problems before it. We can reaffirm that the United\nNations \u2014 when it has been reformed on both the\norganizational and institutional levels and its objectives\nhave been adjusted \u2014 will remain an irreplaceable\norganization. The fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly is entrusted with a great mandate: to complete\nthe necessary preparations so that the United Nations can\nenter a new stage in its development.\nAllow me to express from this rostrum our great\nconfidence in the capability and crucial role of the United\nNations to promote peace, security, cooperation and\ndevelopment for a better future for mankind. In this regard,\nViet Nam pledges to work closely with other Member\nStates to contribute actively to this noble cause, the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The present session\nprovides Member States with an opportunity to hold a\nserious and substantive review of world affairs and the role\nof the United Nations, with particular focus on the\nforthcoming twenty-first century. In this respect, I have no\ndoubt that the deliberations here will be useful in preparing\nfor the millennium summit and the Millennium Assembly\nnext year, to which events the Mongolian Government\nattaches great importance.\nThe United Nations is a truly universal organization\ncomprising large and small, developed and developing\ncountries. This year its membership reached 188 with the\nadmission of three new members: I take this opportunity to\nconvey the warm congratulations of the Mongolian people\nto the peoples of Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga on this\nauspicious occasion.\nIt is gratifying to note that our Organization is not\nonly enlarging its ranks but is also making tangible efforts\nto restructure its activities in order to enhance its efficiency\nand effectiveness. This is a movement in the right direction.\nFurther promotion of reforms is in the interests of the entire\ninternational community, especially the small and medium-\nsized States. Mongolia consistently supports United Nations\nreforms aimed at further strengthening the Organization\u2019s\nrole in ensuring international peace and security and\npromoting disarmament, development, social progress and\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts in various parts of the\nworld.\nIncreasing globalization and interdependence make it\nimperative that the international community should redouble\nits cooperative efforts to meet existing and future\nchallenges and ensure a more secure environment for all\nnations. Globalization and interdependence also demonstrate\nthe growing importance of multilateralism in world affairs\nand thus the need to further strengthen and invigorate the\nUnited Nations and other international institutions. As a\nresult of its reforms, the United Nations should become\nmore viable and effective, addressing the world\u2019s problems\nequitably.\nThe 1999 report of the Secretary-General on the work\nof the Organization (A/54/1) gives, in our view, a clear and\nanalytical review of United Nations activities, its\nachievements and setbacks, and the challenges that lie\nahead; it contains specific proposals on further measures to\nimprove the Organization\u2019s performance the better to serve\nthe interests of its Member States. The Mongolian\nGovernment is supportive of the idea advanced by the\nSecretary-General in paragraph 61 of his report concerning\nthe need to shift from a culture of reaction, to a culture of\nprevention. It is in this spirit that Mongolia will next\nweek sign a memorandum of understanding with the\nUnited Nations on standby agreements whereby it would\npledge to participate in future United Nations operations\nby contributing staff officers, military observers and\nmedical officers.\nMongolia is consistently pursuing its all-embracing\ndemocratic reforms and its transition to a market\neconomy. Neither is easy. However, the Government and\nthe people of Mongolia are strongly committed to the\nchoice they made 10 years ago. From this rostrum, I\nwould like to reaffirm that the democratic process in\nMongolia is irreversible and that Mongolia\u2019s foreign\npolicy will remain constant. My Government greatly\nappreciates the support and assistance given Mongolia by\nthe international community of donor countries and\ninternational organizations. That support and assistance\ncontinue to be an important factor in our reform and\ndevelopment efforts.\nThe major thrust of Mongolia\u2019s development strategy\nis to accelerate economic growth by further advancing\nmacroeconomic stabilization and development of a\nprivate-sector-led economy. Mongolia is giving high\npriority to creating an economic system that is flexible,\nopen, allows a free flow of foreign capital, ensures a\ncompetitive environment and is underpinned by stable\ngovernment policies and a reinvigorated, modern financial\nsector that encourages economic growth. In pursuing this\npolicy, my Government pays particular attention to the\nsocial dimensions of economic reforms, namely poverty\nalleviation, unemployment reduction and protection for\nthe vulnerable strata of the country\u2019s population.\nMongolia\u2019s foreign policy activities aim to create a\nfavourable external environment for implementing this\ndevelopment strategy. At the same time, my country is\nstriving to make its contribution to strengthening\ninternational peace and stability generally as well as\npromoting dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific\nregion. Active participation in regional affairs \u2014\nintegration into regional processes coupled with\nconsolidation of our bilateral ties with the countries of the\nregion \u2014 is one of Mongolia\u2019s foreign policy priorities.\nI am pleased to say that this year has been especially\nfruitful in this respect.\nInternational developments highlight once again the\nfragility of peace and stability in certain areas of the\nworld and the need for concerted actions and for the\n6\n\n\nincreased cooperation of States to prevent the outbreak of\nnew conflicts, seek viable solutions to the existing disputes\nand promote further mutual understanding and trust among\nnations.\nWhile noting some positive developments in\ninternational relations, Mongolia is seriously concerned with\nthe lingering zones of tension, ethnic strife and armed\nconflict in Africa, Asia and Europe. It calls on the parties\ninvolved to display restraint and seek peaceful solutions\nthrough political dialogue and negotiations. In this context\nMongolia welcomes the resumption of the peace process in\nthe Middle East, which in our view should lead to a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region in\ncompliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions\nand the principle of land for peace.\nMongolia also duly appreciates the steps taken by the\nSecurity Council to address the emergency situation in East\nTimor and welcomes the cooperative approach of the\nGovernment of Indonesia regarding the establishment of a\nmultinational force to halt and reverse the escalation of the\nhuman catastrophe there. The people of East Timor have\noverwhelmingly expressed themselves in favour of\nindependence.\nMy delegation stresses the importance of continuing\nthe intra-Korean dialogue and the four-party talks for peace\nand stability on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-\nPacific region in general.\nWe are concerned about the tension in South Asia and\nadd our voice to that of the international community, which\nis calling on India and Pakistan to proceed to political\ndialogue and search for a peaceful solution to their dispute.\nPeace and stability are essential prerequisites for\npromoting economic development and social progress. That\nis why arms control and disarmament, particularly nuclear\ndisarmament, remain at the top of the global agenda.\nEfforts to achieve further substantive progress in arms\ncontrol and disarmament should be intensified. Agreements\nshould be honoured and implemented. Nuclear tests, missile\ntechnology developments, concerns over the anti-ballistic\nmissile treaty \u2014 all point to the urgent need for\ninvigorating our activities in this field. International arms\ncontrol efforts need to be comprehensive and include all\naspects of arms and military technology. Strengthening of\nthe nuclear non-proliferation regime stands out as one of\nthe top priorities, due not only to the devastating nature of\nnuclear weapons and the enormous existing arsenal of them,\nbut also to the negative effect they have on the\ndisarmament process in general.\nMongolia fully supports adopting multilateral norms\nrestraining the development and possession of medium-\nrange missiles and preventing their proliferation. We\nbelieve that progress on the START track will be helpful\nin advancing disarmament negotiations in all areas.\nNuclear disarmament also calls for speedy agreement on\nbanning fissile materials for nuclear-weapons purposes.\nMongolia continues to attach great importance to\nestablishing effective international arrangements to assure\nnon-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use\nof nuclear weapons.\nMy delegation welcomes the outcome of the 1999\nsessions of the Disarmament Commission and of the\nPreparatory Committee for the year 2000 Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Mongolia attaches\ngreat importance to the role of the Review Conference in\nstrengthening the international regime of nuclear non-\nproliferation. It also favours the earliest possible\nconvening of the fourth special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to disarmament.\nThree years have elapsed since the adoption by the\nGeneral Assembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty, which was a landmark event in the field of\nnuclear disarmament. Regrettably, this important\ninternational instrument has not yet come into force.\nMongolia wishes to reiterate its call on those States that\nhave not done so to sign and ratify the Treaty as soon as\npossible and thus contribute to the expeditious realization\nof its noble objectives. We sincerely hope that the\nforthcoming conference of the States that have ratified\nthis Treaty will be conducive to taking the necessary\nmeasures to this end.\nIt is our belief that all States, irrespective of their\nsize and weight, can facilitate the attaining of the overall\ngoal of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. That\nis why we believe that the establishment of nuclear-\nweapon-free zones in different parts of the world should\nbe encouraged and supported. For its part, Mongolia is\nmaking efforts in this respect by declaring its territory a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone and taking the subsequent steps\nnecessary to institutionalize its nuclear-weapon-free status.\nLast year the General Assembly adopted by\nconsensus resolution 53/77 D on Mongolia\u2019s international\nsecurity and nuclear-weapon-free status. This was a\n7\n\n\nsignificant and encouraging event for Mongolia, testifying\nto the existence of broad international support for our\nobjectives and efforts. The adoption of the resolution\nconstitutes an important contribution not only to Mongolia\u2019s\nsecurity, but also \u2014 given Mongolia\u2019s strategic location \u2014\nto regional security. Implementation of the main provisions\nof the resolution \u2014 in cooperation with other Member\ncountries, including the five nuclear-weapon States, and the\nUnited Nations \u2014 is one of the major objectives of our\nforeign policy. The Mongolian Government has recently\ncirculated a memorandum on this issue as an official United\nNations document, in which it pointed out, inter alia, that\nthe Mongolian parliament is considering the adoption of\nlegislation defining its nuclear-weapon-free status.\nRecently Mongolia hosted a United Nations regional\ndisarmament meeting, one of the agenda items of which\nwas the issue of Mongolia\u2019s international security and\nnuclear-weapon-free status. The meeting proved to be\nuseful in clarifying the pressing security issues, and it\nprovided an opportunity for the first in-depth analysis and\ndiscussion of Mongolia\u2019s nuclear-weapon-free status in the\nlight of its external security. We believe that identifying\nand defining Mongolia\u2019s nuclear-weapon-free status will\ncontribute to enhancing predictability, stability and\nconfidence in north-east Asia.\nMy Government fully shares the aspirations to ban\nanti-personnel landmines and welcomes the entry into force\nof the Ottawa Convention. The illicit trafficking in small\narms and light weapons is a matter of growing concern for\nthe international community. Therefore Mongolia supports\nthe convening of an international conference to consider\nthis issue in 2001.\nConsidering that only comprehensive arms-control and\ndisarmament measures will be effective in ensuring\ninternational security, we, like many others, stand for\nprompt agreement on a new comprehensive and non-\nselective agenda for disarmament that will address the\nrelevant issues in a balanced manner, taking into account,\namong other things, the need to prevent the development\nand use of new weapons as well as to demilitarize the\nglobal economy by reducing military budgets and shifting\nresources towards human-security programmes.\nDevelopment issues continue to be the focus of\nattention of national Governments and international\norganizations and undoubtedly will be a major challenge in\nthe forthcoming century. Globalization affects all States,\nthough differently and unevenly. Many developing\ncountries, particularly the least developed, not only fail to\nenjoy the benefits of globalization, but are being further\nmarginalized. Therefore, the adverse effects of\nglobalization should be addressed seriously and the\nUnited Nations should be more actively involved in the\nissue.\nThe Asian economic and financial crisis has had\nsignificant socio-economic and security implications for\nthe countries of the region. Though the situation is\nsomehow stabilizing and the countries directly hit by the\ncrisis are showing some signs of recovery, the\ninternational community should draw the necessary\nlessons from this crisis and consider ways and means of\npreventing such crises in the future.\nWhile appreciating the work done by the United\nNations in the social and economic fields, my delegation\nwould like to underline the importance of taking further\neffective measures to ensure the best utilization of the\nexisting capacities and comparative advantages of the\nOrganization. Therefore, it seems appropriate to stress the\nnecessity of closer interaction and cooperation between\nthe United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and other relevant\ninternational organizations.\nThe financing of development represents a very\nsensitive and pressing issue that requires special attention\non the part of the international community. Mongolia\nbelieves that the high-level intergovernmental meeting on\nfinancing for development to be held in 2001 will be\ntimely in exploring the various options of promoting\nfinancial stability and development. In this respect,\nrelieving the debt burden of the highly indebted\ndeveloping countries would be a form of contribution to\ntheir development efforts. We also attach great\nimportance to the South-South summit and the tenth\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD X), to be held next year.\nMongolia supports the universality of the World\nTrade Organization. The new round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations should facilitate the integration of the\ndeveloping countries into the world economy. The\nexpansion of international cooperation for development\nshould place particular emphasis on assisting the most\nvulnerable countries, which find themselves more and\nmore marginalized and insecure. Unfavourable\ngeographical location serves as a major impediment to the\ndevelopment efforts of landlocked developing countries.\nThe problems of this group of States demand the\nincreased attention and support of the international\n8\n\n\ncommunity. The steps that could ease the hardships of these\ncountries were recently examined in New York at the\nfourth Meeting of Governmental Experts from Landlocked\nand Transit Developing Countries and Representatives of\nDonor Countries and Financial and Development\nInstitutions. Its outcome should be endorsed by the General\nAssembly.\nIn North-East Asia, efforts are under way to conclude\na subregional agreement on transit transportation as a\nfollow-up to the decisions of the 1997 Ulan Bator meeting\non transit transportation. The conclusion of this agreement\nwill create a legal framework for facilitating transit trade\nnot only within the subregion, but well beyond it.\nSustainable development, environmental degradation,\nillicit drug trafficking, HIV/AIDS, organized crime and\nother transboundary problems should be adequately\naddressed at the national, regional and global levels. The\n\u201c+5\u201d review special sessions of the General Assembly held\nor scheduled to be held as follow-ups to the United Nations\nsummit conferences are important not only for assessing the\nwork done, but also for giving a fresh impetus to the\nimplementation of their objectives at all levels.\nAt the national level, Mongolia, in close partnership\nwith the United Nations organizations and the non-\ngovernmental organizations, successfully organized the\nOne-World Conference Series in 1998-1999. The aim of the\nsix national conferences was to raise awareness at the\ngrass-roots level of the commitments made at the global\nconferences and to ensure their integrated and coordinated\nfollow-up.\nMongolia is committed to the promotion and\nprotection of human rights and supports the strengthening\nof the existing international instruments in this field. We\nbelieve that the approval at this session of the draft optional\nprotocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\nof Discrimination against Women would mark an important\ncontribution to the protection and promotion of human\nrights and the dignity of women the world over.\nContinued gross violations of human rights make it\nimperative to speed up the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court. Mongolia highly appreciates\nand fully supports the efforts of the international\ncommunity in this respect. Likewise, Mongolia joins other\nStates in condemning terrorist acts that are taking the lives\nof an increasing number of innocent people in various parts\nof the world and supports every effort of Member States\nand of the international community as a whole to fight all\nforms of terrorism and strengthen the relevant\ninternational instruments.\nThis year, the United Nations Decade of\nInternational Law is drawing to a close. The decade has\nbeen instrumental in drawing the international\ncommunity's attention to the need for the codification and\nprogressive development of international law. Today,\ninternational law is regulating many aspects of\ninternational relations. I agree with the Secretary-General\nthat one of the greatest accomplishments of the twentieth\ncentury is the creation of an international code of human\nrights, to which the outgoing Decade has duly\ncontributed. One of the practical results of the Decade\nwas the adoption last year, on Mongolia's initiative, by\nthe General Assembly of a set of principles and\nguidelines for international negotiations that could be\nuseful in conducting negotiations to manage international\nrelations, to peacefully settle disputes and to create new\ninternational norms of conduct for States.\nFully conscious of the challenges that lie ahead,\nmankind still looks forward to the twenty-first century\nwith great expectations and hope. I believe it is the\nearnest hope and keen desire of all the peoples of the\nworld that the next century be far better in all respects,\nmore progressive and prosperous, than the outgoing one.\nWhere there is a will, there will surely be a way to\nachieve it. It is up to Member States to make the dream\na reality. As the Secretary-General has underlined in his\nreport, we can do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it gives me great pleasure at the outset to offer\nyou my warmest congratulations on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. Your election to this high post reflects the value\nthe international community attaches to the role played by\nyour friendly country. We are confident of the friendly\nrelations between our two countries. We also know that\nyour expertise and commitment to international issues will\nenrich the discussions of this session of the General\nAssembly. My delegation pledges its full cooperation and\nsupport to you to make your presidency a success.\nI also take this opportunity to express my warmest\nthanks and appreciation to our colleague Mr. Didier\nOpertti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, for his\ngreat efforts as President at the previous session. I would\nalso like to salute Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\ngreat efforts in enhancing the administration and\nperformance of the United Nations and its mission to\nserve international peace and security.\nThe Sultanate of Oman welcomes the admission at\nthis session of the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to the membership of\nthe United Nations. We are confident that their\nmembership will reflect positively on the United Nations\nand will help us further consolidate our efforts as an\ninternational community to achieve the progress and\nprosperity we all aspire to, in a way that promotes the\n23\n\n\nnoble goals for which this important international forum\nwas created.\nThe unanimous decision to hold the millennium\nsummit during the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly is clear proof of the importance of that last\nsummit of this century. This is an essential and important\nstep that will enable our leaders to issue a declaration that\nmay be considered a plan of action. That declaration could\nreformulate a new concept for economic success and\ndevelopment for all peoples.\nAs we approach the next century with confidence, we\nmust focus our attention on restructuring the work of\ninternational organizations in order to enrich and develop\nthe work of the United Nations and its relevant agencies,\nsuch as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund\nand other international and regional institutions, so that they\nare able to function effectively for the future welfare and\nprosperity of humanity.\nWe recognize the importance of the effective\nmanagement of these international institutions through the\ngenerous and special financial and technical contributions\nof developed nations and institutions. These contributions\nmust always meet the needs and priorities of reforming the\neconomies of developing nations, which form the largest\npart of the global market and which provide a large part of\nthe world's natural resources and raw materials. The\ndevelopment of these economies will undoubtedly bring\nabout a more stable world economy.\nWe call for the establishment of balanced rules and\nregulations between the developed nations of the North and\nthe developing nations of the South in order to effect a\nqualitative change in their relations. While bold change and\nreal sacrifices are needed to restructure the economies of\nthe developing world so that they can meet the\nrequirements of the global free market, there is a greater\nneed for the economically developed nations to take bold\nand decisive steps in cancelling more debts, restructuring\nthe costs of manufactured goods and establishing a new\neconomic mechanism to provide loans and to re-regulate\nthe size of industries and lower global rates of inflation. We\nalso call for the establishment of an international reporting\nsystem that will draw up periodic regional plans to enable\nall regions to achieve the economic advances necessary to\novercome their economic difficulties.\nWe look with admiration and great interest to the\nEuropean Union's experience of economic integration as a\npilot project that aims at serving the economic prosperity of\nthe peoples of the European continent, the integration of\ntheir cultural heritage and the elimination of their social\nand political differences. Indeed, such a qualitative leap\nin European society would undoubtedly contribute to a\nmore stable and balanced world, especially if it were\nbased on moral norms of international transparency. It\nwould surely be an excellent model which could be\nemulated in other parts of the world in keeping with the\nspecific requirements of these regions and in a way that\nresponds to their traditions, their heritage and the\nparticularities of their culture. We believe that economic\ndevelopment and trade are a bridge for communication\nbetween civilizations.\nTherefore, negotiations leading to the admission of\nthe rest of the developing countries to the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) must be fair and just. Such\nnegotiations must recognize the importance of giving\ndeveloping nations an opportunity to see their trade and\ntheir infant industries grow and an opportunity also to\nconsolidate their competitive edge, in the context of a\ngeneral commitment to the free market principles of\nsupply and demand.\nOur world needs to rid the large markets of the\ndeveloped nations of dumping policies, market constraints\nand other obstacles to free trade: free trade should not be\na way to destroy the economies of the developing\ncountries. A realistic balance between the interests of the\ndeveloped and the developing nations should be the aim\nof the forthcoming WTO Ministerial-level conference in\nSeattle. Such a balance should draw on the world's\nexperience since the end of the cold war and the\nemergence of the new world order.\nIn the present international climate, the United\nNations bears the huge responsibility of creating the right\nsocial and economic circumstances for better, more\nharmonious coexistence and for peace and stability. That\nresponsibility creates an urgent need for more consultation\nand dialogue between Member States, especially at the\nregional level, towards restructuring United Nations\nbodies and expanding the membership of the Security\nCouncil.\nWe must encourage serious, realistic and flexible\nthinking about the Council's role, responsibilities and\nmandates in the service of international peace and security\nto enable the Council to be more receptive and\nrealistically responsive to cultural and educational\npluralism and to the various political schools of thought\nin human society. Expanded membership would also\n24\n\n\nenhance the role of the new forces that are currently\nbecoming more important through their influence on\ninternational events.\nSince the end of the cold war, we have heard the calls\nfor democracy, free trade and the free market economy as\nways of establishing greater harmony among humankind.\nWe believe that the road towards this objective must begin\nwith dialogue between civilizations on an international\nplatform of cultural norms, and based on the sound\nprinciples of balanced political relations, interests and\nmutual benefit in keeping with the needs of every culture\nand civilization. The new ideas emanating from this\ndialogue could be used as a new moral gateway to relations\nbetween people in the new millennium and as a bond of\ntrust and fruitful cooperation between all cultures and\ncivilizations. It would certainly create a new and common\nharmony in all patterns of life.\nWe support this human endeavour in the context of\nGeneral Assembly resolution 53/22 proclaiming the year\n2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\nCivilizations. We support any regional or multilateral action\nthat seeks to solve the political disputes still outstanding\nbetween States, especially between neighbouring States,\nwhich share common interests along with a common\nborder.\nThe Sultanate of Oman believes deeply in the\nimportance of quiet and meaningful dialogue between all\nStates and between all parties. Oman works alongside its\nbrothers in the Gulf Cooperation Council to consolidate a\npositive climate and extend our common ground with\nneighbouring countries. We do so in order to ensure that\ncommon principles and rules are adopted and accepted to\nform the basis for bilateral or collective dialogue on\noutstanding problems.\nIraq is still subject to the sanctions regime imposed by\nthe Security Council in the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of\nKuwait in August 1990. Although the Security Council,\nthrough the United Nations Special Commission\n(UNSCOM), has tried to enforce its resolutions on the\ndestruction of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction over the\nlast eight years, it has not yet been able to agree on a\nunanimous policy towards Iraq. Consequently, the Iraqi\npeople are suffering greatly from the continuing sanctions.\nAlthough the oil\u2014for\u2014food programme has been\nimplemented, it cannot satisfactorily meet the basic\nhumanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. In this context,\nmany international organizations and agencies working in\nthe field of health and other humanitarian services have\nexpressed their fears about the dire effects that threaten\nthe future of the Iraqi people.\nThe Council of the League of Arab States, in its\nconsultative session of 24 January 1999, adopted a call\nfor the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq to be lifted.\nThe Council appealed to all Arab Governments to make\nevery possible effort towards this end through cooperation\nwith the United Nations.\nThe Sultanate of Oman emphasizes the importance\nof lifting the economic sanctions in order to end the\nsuffering of the Iraqi people. We call on the Security\nCouncil to put its differences aside and adopt a positive\nand unanimous policy towards Iraq. We also call on the\nIraqi Government to cooperate positively and fully with\nthe United Nations in implementing the remaining\nresolutions, especially those relating to Kuwaiti prisoners\nof war and missing persons.\nThe early signs of the long-awaited peace in the\nMiddle East, to which its people have long aspired,\nfortunately coincide with the end of the century and the\nbeginning of the third millennium. All parties, especially\nthe Israeli Government, must take this opportunity to\nwrite a new history based on coexistence and cooperation\namong the peoples of the region, a region that so urgently\nneeds to enjoy the fruits of stability and development.\nThe establishment of an independent Palestinian\nState will undoubtedly be an important pillar for the\nconclusion of a comprehensive and just peace in the\nMiddle East. It will also serve as a real tool for the\ndevelopment of cooperation and coexistence between the\nArab States and Israel.\nWe call on the Israeli Government to respond\nquickly and implement the various obligations and\nagreements concluded since Madrid. We also call upon\nthe Israeli Government to implement Security Council\nresolutions on Lebanon: resolutions 425 (1978) and 426\n(1978). We call upon Israel to resume negotiations on the\nSyrian track at the point where they left off and to make\nevery effort to withdraw from occupied Syrian territory to\nthe established border of 4 June 1967.\nMutual security requirements between the Arabs and\nIsraelis on both sides of the border are of prime\nimportance. The legitimacy of such requirements justifies\nnegotiations on the basis of the principle of land for\npeace. Israel must feel secure and comfortable about the\ngeneral Arab attitude towards peace.\n25\n\n\nPeace agreements signed with Egypt and Jordan have\noffered the clearest proof of the Arabs' commitment to\npeace and their absolute willingness to participate, along\nwith Israel, in the establishment of a secure, peaceful and\ndeveloped Middle East. Arab positions across a range of\ninternational activities and forums have demonstrated the\nseriousness of their desire to live in peace and security with\nIsrael.\nWe are about to enter a new century. We feel hopeful\nand ambitious for a future in which the security and\nstability of human life will improve. However, a number of\nconflicts and hotbeds of tension continue to cause concern\nfor the international community.\nIn Africa, conflicts and confrontations among countries\nremain the biggest source of suffering for the African\npeople. Therefore, the United Nations is required to exert\ngreater efforts in support of the Organization of African\nUnity in its endeavour to mediate in the various conflicts,\nincluding those between Ethiopia and Eritrea, in the Great\nLakes region, in West Africa and in Somalia. We hope that\nAfrica will thus be able to free itself from the vestiges of\nthe past and enter a new era of freedom, economic\ndevelopment and security for its people and for the world\nat large.\nThe giant continent, Asia, continues to offer the most\ndynamic current force for human development. Despite the\nsuccesses achieved by the Asian people in various spheres\nof life, unrest, civil wars and sources of instability are still\nabundant.\nThe Muslim Asian country of Afghanistan still suffers\nfrom deep and complex internal conflicts. Therefore we\nsincerely hope that all the Afghan leaders will take\nadvantage of past lessons and use the world community's\ndesire to help them to end their crisis and to give the\nAfghan people the opportunity to heal their painful wounds.\nIn East Asia, we call on all parties in the Korean\npeninsula to work towards ending the conflict and the\nachievement of peace. Then the Korean people in North\nand South Korea can express their desire for a secure and\npeaceful future.\nWe have a deep sense of pain for the human tragedy\nin the Balkans. Reckless policies led to instability, a huge\nwaste of resources, the flight of defenceless people and loss\nof life and destruction of property. We are thankful for the\ntimely intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization in Kosovo, especially after the failure to carry\nout the Rambouillet Agreement, to put an end to the pain\nand suffering of the provinces' inhabitants.\nAs we praise the human role assumed by the world\ncommunity in helping the displaced and the refugees in\nthe Balkans, we hope that those great efforts will continue\nand thus conclude this noble task. We also appreciate the\nefforts of the Secretary-General to restore peace and\nstability to the region.\nThe world still faces the nuclear threat as a result of\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons technology and the\nefforts of many States outside what is known as the\nnuclear club to acquire the technology for this dreadful\nweapon. The States seeking these weapons still feel\nthreatened politically and militarily and are worried about\ntheir security, sovereignty and future capabilities.\nMaking a realistic and careful assessment of this\nsituation would definitely lead us to conclude that there\nmust have been fundamental and legitimate reasons why\nsuch countries would choose to spend large amounts of\nmoney to secure such weapons at a time when these\nassets could have been spent on the economic and social\ndevelopment of their people. Among the principal and\nlegitimate reasons for this choice is that the major States\nwhich already possess nuclear weapons and technology\ndid not do enough to guarantee the non-proliferation of\nthis technology.\nThe phenomenon that the major Powers alone can\nshape choices about peace and war in areas of the\ndeveloping world may be one of the strongest reasons for\nthe sudden eruption of conflagrations in such areas.\nTherefore nuclear States, especially the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, should undertake the\nnecessary measures that will guarantee the security of\nnon-nuclear States and deter the use or threat of use of\nnuclear weapons. The United Nations, through the\nSecurity Council, must adopt binding resolutions in\naccordance with the Charter to protect the world from the\nthreat of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction. The arms control conference which is still\ndebating secondary issues of technical dimensions must\ntherefore seek to reach positive conclusions as soon as\npossible.\nAt the last session we expressed our concern over\nwhat had befallen the economies of the Asian countries.\nWe also expressed our faith in the ability of these\ncountries to overcome the economic crisis and the crash\nthat hit the financial markets.\n26\n\n\nToday we witness an encouraging recovery in the\nAsian economies \u2014 a result of the determination of these\ncountries, especially the States of the Association of South-\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to protect their economies\nthrough exemplary solidarity.\nWe would like to applaud the important role played by\nthose States which provided financial assistance. We pay\ntribute to the role played by the world financial institutions,\nespecially the World Bank and the International Monetary\nFund. They halted the danger of deterioration in the world\neconomy and restored confidence in Asian markets.\nHowever, these two institutions should review their\nconditions for providing loans to developing nations to help\ntheir economies. In most cases, these conditions fail to\nachieve their planned and targeted goals primarily because\nof the enormous social and political problems which they\ncreate.\nThe Earth Summit for the environment and\ndevelopment, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992, set an\nagenda for the twenty-first century that is now viewed as\nthe basis upon which international partnership and\ncollective responsibility can work to put an end to poverty,\nhunger, ill health and the deterioration of ecosystems, and\nto achieve sustainable development the only way for\nhumanity to ensure progress and prosperity for present and\nfuture generations.\nMy country takes a comprehensive view of\nenvironmental issues. We believe that the protection of the\nenvironment is a responsibility for everyone to share. In\nthis context, my country devotes a great segment of its\nresources to continuing to implement the Rio agenda and\neffective and objective participation in environmental and\ndevelopment forums on many international, regional and\nnational levels. We also continue to enact and update\nenvironmental laws in order to assure adaptation to the best\nstandards of environmental protection against the dangers\nof pollution and to guarantee the implementation of the\ninternational and regional environmental agreements that\nmy country has signed.\nMy country looks forward to joining the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) soon. We hope to participate in the\nwork of the Organization as a fully fledged member and to\nplay our role effectively. We thank all our trade partners\nwhich have expressed encouragement and understanding for\nour application for membership. We are determined to work\nhand\u2014in\u2014hand with all members to consolidate the\nmultilateral trade system and help it flourish.\nNext November the American city of Seattle will\nhost the third ministerial conference of the World Trade\nOrganization. The Sultanate of Oman attaches special\nimportance to this conference because it will be a prelude\nto the new phase of multilateral trade negotiations, the\nMillennium Round, which should contribute to opening\nthe way for free and prosperous global trade.\nProbably one of the most important issues facing\ndeveloping countries is the issue of the liberalization of\nthe service sector. Although its liberalization may have\nsome benefits for developing countries in terms of the\nflow of foreign capital, technology and modern\nadministrative and technical expertise, it will inevitably be\naccompanied by huge challenges. This is particularly true\nin the light of open competition from the service sector in\ndeveloped nations. Oman expects the world community to\ntake measures that would help developing nations develop\ntheir service sectors in order to guarantee them a\ncomparable and viable share in the global services\nmarket.\nWe appreciate the admirable international efforts and\ngood intentions to establish an original global legislative\nstructure as a basis for international relations in different\nareas. However, we always return to the clear truth that\nin the Charter of the United Nations are enshrined the\npurposes and principles that we must all work to preserve\nin the interest of the future security and wellbeing of all\nhumanity.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my delegation\nand on my own behalf, it is with great satisfaction that I\nwish to extend to you, Sir, our congratulations on your\nwell-deserved election to preside over the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session, which is coinciding\nwith the end of a momentous century. It is indeed a\nsource of immense pleasure and pride to my delegation\nand myself to see you presiding over this forum where\nyou, as the representative here of the South West Africa\nPeople\u2019s Organization for many years, waged an\nunrelenting struggle for the independence of your country,\nNamibia, which was crowned with success in 1990. Your\nassumption of this high office is a fitting tribute to the\nstruggle of the many sons and daughters of Africa over\nthe years for the total emancipation of Africa from\ncolonial rule. I wish to assure you of the fullest\ncooperation of my delegation in the discharge of the\nheavy responsibilities entrusted to you. I wish also to\nseize this opportunity to convey to your predecessor, Mr.\nDidier Opertti, our appreciation for a job well done, and\nwe salute him for all the efforts he has made.\n23\n\n\nI should also like to welcome the new Members of our\nOrganization: the Republic of Nauru, the Kingdom of\nTonga and the Republic of Kiribati.\nTo our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for whom\nmy country has great esteem, I wish to renew our\nfriendship and to reiterate how much we have always\nappreciated his wisdom and his vision. His being at the\nhelm of the world body is indeed one of the few\nconsolations for Africa, a continent which otherwise has\nlittle voice within the Organization.\nThis annual occasion, here at this forum, affords us a\nunique opportunity to express our views as Member States\non issues that are of concern to us as members of the\nhuman family, as part of specific regions of the world and\nin our capacity as nations. The 170 items on the\nAssembly\u2019s agenda at this session are clear testimony to the\nrange of issues confronting the international community as\nwe approach the coming millennium. It is not, however,\nalways easy to separate these various levels of concern.\nThey are obviously interconnected, and all the more so for\ncountries such as Ethiopia, whose fates are affected,\npositively or negatively, by what takes place internationally\nand by what the United Nations does and does not do.\nIt goes without saying that developing countries in\ngeneral, and the least developed countries in particular, as\na group, face the most serious problems in all areas of\ninternational life. Problems of poverty, underdevelopment\nand the debt burden are among the multifarious problems\nthe developing countries are grappling with today. As a\nleast developed country, Ethiopia has its own share of these\nproblems, the magnitude of which is all too obvious, even\nas we are making a determined effort to overcome them.\nIn this statement I will not try to go into all the\nproblems facing developing countries today. Instead, I\nshould like to focus on one issue: collective security,\nespecially in relation to its impact on developing countries,\nthose in Africa in particular, and how the United Nations\nhas failed them in this critical area. For Ethiopia this is all\nthe more justified and timely inasmuch as we have been the\nvictim of aggression \u2014 not for the first time in our\nhistory \u2014 for over a year now.\nThe United Nations has been important to us, and the\npromise contained in its Charter to be our collective\ninstrument for international peace and security and a vehicle\nfor international cooperation in all areas of human\nendeavour has been a source of hope. But we in Ethiopia\nare not so sure that the hope we have is always justified,\nboth as Africans and as Ethiopians.\nFrom the vantage point of Africa, it is indeed\ndifficult to assert with confidence that the Organization is\nalso ours. This must also apply to the rest of the\ndeveloping world. But the African case is unique.\nWhether it is in the area of economic cooperation or with\nrespect to peace and security, our continent continues to\nbe a region of the world which is the least favoured for\neffective and meaningful cooperation. The \u201cWe the\npeoples of the United Nations\u201d mentioned in the Preamble\nto the Charter and the lofty aspirations contained therein\ncontinue to be distant dreams for Africa.\nThis might be regarded by some as an exaggerated\nclaim and an attempt to shift the blame for a predicament\nwhich is of Africa\u2019s own making and therefore a harsh\njudgment on the performance of the United Nations. We\nin Ethiopia would be the first to acknowledge the critical\nvalue for us of the very many types of cooperation we\nhave with the United Nations and its various agencies,\nsome of which have indeed been very effective. It would\nbe unfair to the Organization and to many of its dedicated\nstaff for us to fail to acknowledge this.\nIn this regard, a balanced evaluation of the\nperformance of the United Nations cannot fail to take\nnote of the good work being done by the Organization in\nthe economic, social and humanitarian areas. This is apart\nfrom the indispensable role that the United Nations and\nits various agencies, most particularly its specialized\nagencies, play in harmonizing the activities of nations in\nvarious critical spheres.\nIt is also true that Africa and, in particular, some of\nits individual countries, appear to have a unique way of\nensuring that available opportunities are missed for\nmaking progress for peace and development. But still the\nAfrican condition can hardly be explained only in terms\nof omission or commission by the people of the continent.\nIt would suffice to refer to the cold war and to the\nsuper-Power rivalry spawned by that episode and to the\nhavoc wrought by it in Africa to be reminded that\nAfrica\u2019s pains are not always of its own making.\nWhatever the causes for Africa\u2019s predicament,\nhowever, the spirit of common destiny, interdependence\nand the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations should\nhave obliged the international community to be more\nforthcoming in rendering effective cooperation to regions\n24\n\n\nsuch as Africa so that they can overcome the obstacles to\ndevelopment faced by their peoples.\nThe fact that there is no international cooperation at\npresent in the spirit of the United Nations Charter is\nnowhere more evident than in the circumstances\nsurrounding the debt burden, which continues to remain the\nmost critical factor hindering development and the\nalleviation of poverty. There have so far been no effective\nsteps taken internationally to alleviate this scourge, and\nthere is no visible remedy on the horizon. This is a telling\ntestimony to how much the promise contained in the\nCharter about international cooperation has remained an\nempty slogan. If our vision for the United Nations for the\ncentury we are entering does not incorporate a remedy to\nthis danger, then for the bulk of humanity the Organization\nis bound to be more irrelevant than it is today.\nIt is not only that the United Nations is about to enter\nthe next century with little to show in bringing about\ngenuine international cooperation for combating poverty.\nEven more worrying is that it is going to do so with its\ncredibility very much in tatters with regard to its collective\nsecurity system, which at present commands little trust as\na collective instrument of the international community for\nworld peace and security.\nWhether during the cold war or since it, in this area\nthe United Nations, more often than not, has remained a\ncustodian not of the collective security interests of the\npeople of the world, but of the special security interests of\nthose who count. Here is where double standards abound,\neven with respect to the defense of some sacrosanct\nprinciples of international law.\nAfrica can hardly be proud of the way it has handled\neven the very little opportunity it has had for establishing\ndurable peace and security in the continent. Even after\nhaving granted that the difficult socio-economic conditions\nof the region have been the major causes for the African\ndilemma in this area, the fact still remains that bad\ngovernance, mismanagement of resources, lack of tolerance\nfor diversity and human rights violations have indeed\nfuelled some of the conflicts in our continent. Therefore we\ncannot absolve ourselves fully from taking part of the\nblame. In the final analysis, we have to find our own\nsolution to these problems.\nBut, on the other hand, the fact remains that Africa\nhas received little effective international cooperation, in\nparticular from the United Nations, for sorting out its\ndifficulties in the area of peace and security. Conflicts in\nAfrica have had the fate of either being neglected or,\nwhen not neglected, being judged and handled by\ndifferent standards. Let me give a couple of illustrations.\nThe genocide in Rwanda is a source of shame for\nAfrica, but it was also a reminder of the double standards\nto which Africa has been subjected. The fact that Somalia\nand its people have been left to their own devices,\nregardless of the consequences for the people of Somalia\nand for the peace and stability of their neighbours, is yet\nanother indication of the types of conflicts which elicit, or\nfail to elicit, the serious concern of those who count for\ngalvanizing the efforts of the United Nations for action to\ndischarge its responsibilities for collective security. Why\nshould it matter to those who set the agenda for what the\nSecurity Council does if the chaos in Somalia becomes a\nbreeding ground for terrorism, as long as the threat is\nlimited only to those who have little voice in the Security\nCouncil?\nThe conflict in Somalia is indeed complex, but it is\nno more complex than other conflicts in other parts of the\nworld. Somalia is in turmoil and has been for the last\nnine years, not because the crisis is intractable, but\nbecause Somalia is neglected. That country has failed to\nbe on the top of the United Nations agenda, not because\nit has no legitimate claim to be a priority for the United\nNations collective security system, but because the\ninterests of those who count are not affected. This also\napplies more or less to Angola and Sierra Leone, and\nearlier to Liberia.\nIn short, the United Nations has failed Africa, and\nnow stands, one foot into the next century, with this\nrecord. In connection with Somalia, I should like to state\nthat Ethiopia, the country mandated by the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) to follow up and assist in\nresolving the crisis in Somalia, fully supports the\ninitiatives expounded by Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh,\nPresident of the Republic of Djibouti from this rostrum\nlast week in his capacity as current Chairman of the Inter-\nGovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\nThe experience of my own country over the last year\nand a half and more speaks volumes about how the\nUnited Nations can fail an African country deemed to\nhave no option other than submit to unjust decisions by\nthe powerful. In effect, what the United Nations said to\nEthiopia was that Article 51 of the Charter, which\nprovides for the inherent right of sovereign nations to\nself-defence, did not apply to poor nations such as\nEthiopia. That has been our experience in our attempts to\n25\n\n\nensure the peaceful resolution of the Ethiopian-Eritrean\ncrisis caused by the unprovoked Eritrean aggression against\nus.\nUntil May 1998, Ethiopia was nurturing the peace that\nit had finally achieved after decades of turmoil. The\nEritrean problem \u2014 one of the sources of instability for\nEthiopia \u2014 was settled, with Ethiopia leading the way in\nrecognizing the new nation of Eritrea. Ethiopia became a\nbulwark of peace in our subregion \u2014 a fact which was\nrecognized by many. By demobilizing half a million troops\nand allocating the barest minimum from its budget \u2014 less\nthan 2 per cent of its gross domestic product \u2014 to defence,\nthe country was making it clear in its actions that poor\nnations have time to wage war only against their principal\nenemy, poverty \u2014 poverty and backwardness.\nThe new orientation of the country did produce\ndividends, most of all in terms of economic growth:\naverage GDP growth of over 7 per cent per year was\nachieved, after a difficult period of transition. But then,\ntragedy struck and we fell victim to Eritrean aggression.\nThe unprovoked aggression against us by Eritrea in May\n1998 taught us the lesson that peace is not always achieved\nby the unilateral decision of nations so long as there are\nrogue States that worship the gun and with leaders who\nhave no domestic limitations on the power they exercise or\non the decisions they make.\nEritrea has become a source of tragedy not only for\nEthiopia but also for its own people and for the countries\nof the subregion. No sooner had it achieved formal\nindependence, in 1993, than it provoked a fight with the\nSudan, to be followed by an unprovoked onslaught on\nYemen in November 1995. Continuing the same pattern of\nlawlessness, in 1996 Eritrea again went ahead and claimed,\nby use of force, part of Djibouti\u2019s territory \u2014 a reckless\nattempt which was defused in time, thanks also to efforts\nby Ethiopia.\nThe Eritrean aggression against Ethiopia in May 1998\nwas therefore part of the same vivid pattern of behaviour as\nbefore, behaviour which has now made the country a major\nsource of instability for our subregion, particularly in\nSomalia, where Eritrea\u2019s destructive activities have caused\neven more havoc in a nation with no functioning State at\nall. Thus, consistent with its ignoble motive of exploiting\nthe anarchy and lawlessness in Somalia to advance its\nirresponsible policy of destabilizing the countries in the\nHorn of Africa, Eritrea is actively collaborating with the\nwarlords in Somalia by arming and training them and\nfinancing their fratricidal conflict, thereby exacerbating the\nalready volatile and unclear state of affairs in the country\nwith all the attendant adverse consequences for peace and\nstability in our subregion.\nEver since the onset of the Eritrean aggression\nagainst Ethiopia, people have been asking how one of the\nyoungest and poorest nations on earth, whose people have\nbarely emerged from the trauma of a protracted liberation\nstruggle, can have the capacity to embark upon one of the\nmost destructive campaigns of destabilization the entire\nHorn of Africa subregion \u2014 or even the whole of Africa\nfor that matter \u2014 has ever seen. Over and above the\nquestion of Eritrea\u2019s capacity, people have been\nwondering what the motive can be that is driving such\nacts on the part of a new Member of the family of\nnations, acts with serious implications for peace and\nsecurity in our region.\nThe answer to these questions is not difficult to find.\nTo be a destructive force among nations does not require\nany special capacity or resources. Small States can create\nhavoc and make life difficult for the international\ncommunity just as large States can. In fact, an extremist\ngroup on the fringes of international life, with no\nelaborate organizational structure, can without much effort\nsucceed in destabilizing an entire region let alone a\nvulnerable subregion like ours. In effect, it does not seem\nas if it requires any special capacity to be a rogue State.\nRogue States as such are not born, they become so of\ntheir own volition.\nThat is what we see in Eritrea today: the Eritrean\nGovernment is now working hand in glove not only with\ndisgruntled groups in our subregion but also with\ninternational terrorists, training, financing and giving them\nall-round support in their ultimate objective of\ndestabilizing the States of the subregion. We do not\nbelieve the source of this Eritrean behaviour is external.\nIt is internal: it emanates from the nature of the domestic\npolitical structure in that country. If the domestic political\nprocess in a country has no constraining factors to speak\nof on its leadership, this, sooner or later, is bound to have\na negative impact on the peace and security of the States\nof that subregion.\nIn Eritrea this phenomenon is clearly visible today.\nA total absence of domestic institutions necessary for a\nnormal State; the lack of accountability on the part of the\nleadership; the non-existence of even a semblance of\nchecks and balances \u2014 in effect the absence of a\nconstitutional order \u2014 are the distinguishing features of\nEritrea today. Pluralism; freedom of association and\n26\n\n\nexpression; the right to express dissent \u2014 are unknown in\nEritrea. Democratic elections are, of course, unheard of\nthere. In fact, Eritrea has nothing to do with the\ninternational community in terms of observance of\nfundamental human rights and freedoms and good\ngovernance since it is, for all practical purposes, ruled by\nthe whims of one man. The net effect of these domestic\npolitical characteristics and their impact on peace and\nsecurity in our subregion is that more than any other people\nit is, in the final analysis, the Eritrean people that are\nsuffering most, bearing the brunt of the hardship resulting\nfrom their Government\u2019s destabilizing policies and activities\nin the Horn of Africa.\nNo one who has closely followed this tragedy visited\non Ethiopia by the Eritrean leadership can be unaware of\nhow much effort Ethiopia has made, for over nine months,\nto ensure the reversal of the Eritrean aggression through\npeaceful means. But it was to no avail. And, most\nregrettably, the United Nations failed us. In contrast, I\nshould like to express my Government\u2019s admiration and\ngratitude for the commendable stand taken by OAU and\nAfrica throughout the crisis in defence of the principles on\nwhich this Organization was founded.\nHowever, despite the efforts of the OAU, Eritrea did\nnot listen. The United Nations pretended, even though it\nknew better, that there had been no aggression. The\nSecurity Council went even further, as did some in the\ninternational community, in a coordinated effort to punish\nthe victim of aggression, without so much as a word about\nthe aggression or about the gross violations of international\nlaw committed by a country known to have developed the\nhabit of acting in a lawless manner.\nThe members of the Security Council knew full well\nright from the outset that Eritrea had committed a naked\nand unprovoked act of aggression against Ethiopia. Yet they\nchose to characterize a blatant violation of a fundamental\nprinciple of international law as a mere border dispute.\nThis, to say the least, is an evasion of the primary\nresponsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance\nof international peace and security. It clearly signified a\nfailure on the part of the Council to uphold the most\nhallowed principle of international law, namely, the\nprohibition of the use of force in international relations,\nexcept in self-defence. It is a negation of the very concept\nof collective security in which all States, big and small,\nplaced their confidence when they subscribed to the Charter\nof the United Nations.\nAs if to underscore its failure to uphold the\ninternational rule of law, the Security Council, in its very\nfirst resolution on the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict, adopted\non 26 June 1998, demanded an immediate ceasefire, in\neffect rewarding aggression. What better demonstration\ncould there be of the Council\u2019s failure to take a\ndetermined stand against aggression by demanding that it\nbe reversed before calling for a ceasefire? What better\nincentive could there be for aggressors like Eritrea to\ncontinue with their aggression and reap even more fruits\nfrom their wanton acts?\nEven more disheartening and gratuitous was the\nstatement issued on 23 June 1999 by the Security Council\nreminding us of \u201cour primary responsibility to feed our\npeoples\u201d, as if poor nations did not have the right to\ndefend their sovereignty. Or was it meant to imply that\nthe very notion of sovereignty is of no consequence at all\nfor a poor country like Ethiopia? That, history will recall,\nwas what the League of Nations told us, if not in so\nmany words, more than 60 years ago. But this was not\nwhat we expected from the United Nations today.\nTo make matters worse, the Security Council chose,\non 10 February 1999, through resolution 1227 (1999), to\nurge States to end sales of arms both to the aggressor and\nto the victim, while at the same time continuing to\ndeliberate on how the peace proposal submitted by the\nOrganization of African Unity, and already accepted by\nEthiopia, could be modified to make it acceptable to the\naggressor at the expense of the victim.\nThis was again the essence of the informal\ndeliberations by the Security Council on 24 February\n1999. The aggressor country was in effect told to wait\nuntil the victim of aggression gave in to pressure.\nThe refusal by a poor nation to accept insult, a\nnation which happened to be the victim of aggression,\nobviously entails certain consequences. The punishment\nmeted out has had almost no limits. It has included\nfinancial institutions changing the rules of the game in\nmidstream. In the case of Ethiopia, they saw fit to\nabrogate ongoing programmes based on non-technical\nconsiderations that had absolutely nothing to do with the\nresults of actual performance evaluations. That has been\nthe experience of Ethiopia with the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), which suspended its cooperation\nwith Ethiopia on political grounds, although it knew full\nwell that it had absolutely no cause for that action on the\nbasis of the relevant criteria.\n27\n\n\nOnce the tone was set by the Security Council, others\nfound it easy to overlook the injustice involved and added\ntheir weight to a stance which made a mockery of\nelementary justice. The European Union and other\ninstitutions and countries jumped on the bandwagon,\nmaking it clear to Ethiopia that a poor nation is not entitled\nto defend itself and that not heeding this warning would\nhave its consequences. And it did. Ethiopia\u2019s fault was one\nand only one, and that was its insistence that aggression\ncannot and must not be rewarded through the use of\nwhatever pretext, including calls for an unconditional\nceasefire, which was demanded by the aggressor and\nthought to be in accord with the interests of those who\ncount. The sovereign rights of the victim did not count.\nThat was the implication for our whole region of the\nlawless Eritrean philosophy of grabbing land first and then\ninviting the victims for talks.\nI should not, however, give the impression that\neverybody has been inconsiderate to my country in its hour\nof need. Indeed, there are countries and institutions that\nduly value partnership in development which stood by us,\nrealizing that discontinuing development assistance to the\nvictim of aggression would be tantamount to rewarding that\naggression. Those countries have not only continued their\nassistance but also, in some cases, increased it. On behalf\nof the people of Ethiopia, I should like to express our deep\ngratitude to those countries and institutions, whose\ndemonstration of solidarity we will always cherish.\nIn the light of this experience, it is indeed difficult to\nkeep intact our trust in the United Nations and in\ninternational cooperation. It is also difficult to have faith in\nthe efficacy of the United Nations collective security\nsystem.\nThe United Nations cannot avoid sharing the blame for\nthe bloodshed and destruction that followed the nine-month\nEritrean intransigence. The Ethiopian-Eritrean crisis\neventually led to major fighting, not only because the\naggressor was intransigent and refused to give peace a\nchance, but also because the United Nations failed to speak\nin defence of principles of international law.\nWith respect to the aggression against Ethiopia by\nEritrea, it is the justified feeling of the Ethiopian people\nthat the failure of the United Nations to stand up for its\nprinciples is indeed comparable to the injustice done to my\ncountry by the League of Nations in 1936.\nBut this episode has wider implications over and\nabove Ethiopia. It raises a fundamental question with regard\nto the ability of the United Nations to be a guardian of\nthe principles of international law \u2014 a guardianship\nwhich would have no financial implications when limited\nto a mere affirmation of principles. The United Nations\nhas shown us that it cannot even do this. Why this should\nbe so calls for a response, which, if given with candour,\nshould invite drastic measures so that we can have a\nUnited Nations which provides a home to all in equal\nmeasure.\nAs for Ethiopia\u2019s commitment to peace, that cannot\nbe questioned, as has been made clear consistently since\nEritrea\u2019s aggression. Ethiopia\u2019s position has always been\nconsistent. Aggression, we have said, cannot be rewarded.\nPeace requires its reversal. That is what every nation\nwould have demanded if it had found itself in Ethiopia\u2019s\nposition. Ethiopia has asked for nothing more.\nEritrea now says it is prepared to do what it could\nhave done a year and half ago \u2014 something that the\nUnited Nations never dared to ask it to do. While this in\nitself is Ethiopia\u2019s vindication, experience has nonetheless\ntaught us a lesson: we must ensure that there are no\nloopholes in any agreement reached on the withdrawal of\nEritrean troops from Ethiopian territory occupied by\nforce. This is the nature of the ongoing dialogue we are\nnow engaged in with the OAU. There is absolutely no\nreason why it should be difficult to address the legitimate\nconcerns of the victim of aggression with regard to the\nclarity of the commitments undertaken by the aggressor\ncountry.\nIndeed, the principles involved should be protected\nin the interests not only of Ethiopia but also of our\nsubregion and beyond. The lawlessness and contempt for\nthe principles of international law demonstrated by\nEritrea, which have now poisoned the whole region, must\nbe contained. This can be done at the minimum by\nsending a clear message to its leadership that enough is\nenough and that aggression should not pay. This is all the\nmore necessary with respect to those who, in the absence\nof even a semblance of institutions of governance in the\ncountry, are above the law and have little accountability.\nThat is why we have insisted, and continue to insist, that\nEritrea must be allowed to gain nothing from its\nlawlessness. That is why we have insisted, and continue\nto insist \u2014 not without sacrifice \u2014 that there should be\nno loopholes in agreements concluded so that the\nprinciple that aggression should not be rewarded is\nunderlined clearly and with no ambiguity. We thus remain\nhopeful \u2014 hoping against hope \u2014 that Ethiopia\u2019s\nconcerns will be addressed adequately, thereby making it\n28\n\n\neasier to put behind us the nightmare created by the\nEritrean aggression.\nThe United Nations is at a crossroads. It cannot limp\nalong and enter the next century with all its weaknesses\nunattended. Reforms are necessary. The Security Council\ncannot remain as it is, unrepresentative and unresponsive to\nthe interests of the majority. It is still not too late to restore\nconfidence in the collective security system envisioned in\nthe Charter of our Organization more than half a century\nago. The credibility of the United Nations needs to be\nrevived. How can the United Nations command the trust of\nall Member States and their peoples? That is one of the\nquestions with which the United Nations will have to\ngrapple as we enter the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is a particular\nhonour for me to address the Assembly on behalf of the\nGovernment and people of the Dominican Republic and to\ntake this opportunity to express my warmest congratulations\nto you, Sir, on your recent election as President of the fifty-\nfourth session of the General Assembly.\nI would also like to commend the excellent work of\nthat outstanding representative of our region, the Foreign\nMinister of Uruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, who so efficiently\nconducted the proceedings of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nLet me also wish Mr. Kofi Annan every success in\nthe important and delicate tasks he is carrying out as\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\nThis venerable institution, the United Nations, was\nfounded more than half a century ago with the lofty goal\nof safeguarding peace among nations and the integrity of\npeoples. The United Nations has made a significant\ncontribution to preventing armed conflict, reducing\ntension, resolving differences, promoting negotiation and\nagreements, and encouraging tolerance and non-violence.\nBut in a world that is becoming increasingly\ncomplex in the wake of an era marked by bipolar\nconfrontation between two models of civilization, and\nwith the rise of a technological revolution that has\ncontributed to an accelerated sense of time, a reduction in\ndistances and an increase in expectations, the United\nNations must exercise renewed leadership in order to\nconfront this new set of circumstances which, while they\nrepresent tremendous opportunities for the peoples of the\nworld, may also threaten their future.\nIt is no longer just a matter of preventing war and\nconflict; that unavoidable task will always be expected of\nthe Organization. The United Nations must ensure for\nevery human being on this earth a dignified, hopeful and\ndecent existence.\nNever before has the world accumulated so much\nwealth. At no other time in history has humankind been\nable, as it is today, to produce everything it needs in the\nway of food, clothing, shelter, communications and\ntransportation. The level of wealth that exists today is\nsuch that each and every day, more than a trillion dollars\ncirculates in international capital markets for purely\nspeculative purposes, producing what today is known as\na \u201ccasino economy\u201d.\nIn order to give a rough idea of what that volume of\ncapital means, I must point out that a single day of\noperations in the financial markets is equivalent to twice\nthe annual gross national product of all the African\ncountries. However, that wealth is concentrated in just a\nfew countries that today are identified as central\ncountries, and inside each of them wealth is concentrated\nin a few hands that control industry, finance,\ntransportation and communications. The concentration of\nwealth in a few countries, and the influence that those\n4\n\n\ncountries exert in the media, leads to the dissemination of\na consumer philosophy that in turn contributes to the\nadoption of artificial lifestyles and behaviour patterns that\nare conducive to waste, luxury and ostentation.\nAlongside all this wealth, however, the world has\nnever suffered so much poverty. Today, 1.3 billion people\nlive in extreme poverty, and most of them suffer from\nhunger every day. In such a wealthy world, 3 billion people\nsurvive on less than $2 a day, and each year 50 million\nchildren are permanently harmed because of malnutrition.\nSome 1.5 billion people have no access to drinking water,\nand more than 2 billion have no access to drainage or\nsewerage facilities. A large percentage have very limited\naccess to education, health care and housing, and hundreds\nof millions are unemployed or have no secure or permanent\nincome.\nThis stark and horrifying contrast between wealth and\npoverty constitutes a huge challenge for all the nations of\nthe world and the United Nations system as we approach\nthe twenty-first century. There are no magic formulas for\nresolving this situation. Only the concerted efforts of all\nnations, rich and poor, working to the same end in a spirit\nof solidarity and a sense of humanity will make it possible\nfor the whole of humankind to share on a basis of equality\nand social justice in the prodigious and unprecedented\ncreation of wealth in this era.\nFor some time, in various international forums, a set\nof balanced and reasonable ideas have been put forward,\nand if they were applied they would contribute to a\nsignificant reduction in poverty and to the creation of\nopportunities.\nThe world welcomed with great joy and satisfaction\nthe decision adopted by the countries members of the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\nto use 0.7 of their gross national product to finance a\nprogramme aimed at halving by the year 2015 the\npercentage of the inhabitants of developing countries living\nin extreme poverty. Despite the public commitment made\nby those countries, cooperation for development fell to 0.22\nof the combined product of the donor countries in 1997,\nwhich is the lowest figure since the 1950s.\nIt is unfair that while there is a daily transfer of over\n$1 trillion from the central or highly developed countries,\nthere is a tendency to decrease official development\nassistance for the least developed countries.\nThe developing countries have watched their external\ndebt climb from $1.6 trillion in 1993 to $2.5 trillion in\n1998. The external debt of Latin America increased from\n$44.786 billion in 1980 to $669 billion in 1997 \u2014 an\nalmost fifteen-fold increase in 17 years. Interest payments,\nwhich remained stable between 1980 and 1994 at a level\nbetween $24 billion and $28 billion, increased sharply, in\n1997 reaching $42 billion.\nThe current proposal is to reduce the debt of only\nthe heavily indebted poor countries. It seems to us that\nalthough this is a very significant first initiative, it is not\nsufficient because it excludes a group of countries,\nincluding the Dominican Republic, that have made\nsignificant efforts to achieve progress and peace, yet face\na titanic struggle to overcome underdevelopment and\npoverty.\nForgiving external debt, or at least reducing it\nsignificantly, or eliminating the interest would be a just\nacknowledgement of those countries that, in spite of their\ninternal difficulties, have adopted strict adjustment\nmeasures that have made it possible for them scrupulously\nto honour their international obligations. Forgiving\nexternal debt, or reducing it in any other way, would be\na true gesture of international solidarity aimed at reducing\npoverty. Furthermore, the resources that would be freed\nas a result would greatly benefit the creditor countries and\nthe international commercial banking community, since\nthe purchasing power of poor nations would be increased,\nthereby generating a new dynamism in the world\neconomy.\nThe so-called Asian crisis generated international\nturbulence, led to the Russian crisis and had a similar\nimpact on the Brazilian economy, which in turn affected\nthe Southern Cone economies. In analysing that crisis, the\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund agreed\nthat it resulted from factors generated by the international\nflow of capital in the Asian stock markets. As a result of\nthat situation, which has been identified as the first major\ncrisis of the globalized economy, the economists of both\ninstitutions have proposed the creation of a new\ninternational financial architecture. That new architecture\nwould seek to stabilize the financial markets through the\nadoption of a set of careful measures, both national and\ninternational, to prevent another financial crisis in the\nfuture.\nThese proposals would seem to be wise and\nbeneficial. However, we believe that a true new\ninternational financial structure, as the focal point of a\n5\n\n\nglobal economy, should include the element of international\nsolidarity and cooperation aimed at the introduction of\nmeasures to reduce poverty. We cannot understand why\nmore than $1 trillion dollars circulates in international\nfinancial transactions every day while not a penny of those\nresources goes to the world's poor. All of Haiti's problems\nwould be solved with only a single minute's worth of\nbanking transactions on the international market. The same\ncould be said of Nicaragua and of Honduras, and even of\nour own country, the Dominican Republic.\nThe eradication of poverty is not an illusory goal.\nWith the wealth currently circulating world-wide, we could\nrestore a sense of dignity to each and every human being.\nDetermining how to achieve this is the big challenge facing\nthis Organization in the twenty-first century.\nTo meet that challenge the United Nations itself has to\ngo through a process of change and reform, beginning with\nacceptance that all its Member States are equal, with no\ndifferentiation between the powerful ones that possess the\nright of veto and the poor ones that have been marginalized\nin the very Organization that represents them. There is no\ndoubt that we now have a unique opportunity to reform the\nSecurity Council. The Dominican Republic is convinced\nthat reform of the Security Council must be carried out in\nkeeping with the principles of equitable geographical\ndistribution and the equal sovereignty of Member States,\nsince no reform will be acceptable if it leads to\ndiscriminatory treatment of developing nations by\ndeveloped nations.\nIt is in this spirit that the Dominican Republic aspires\nto election in the near future to a seat as a non-permanent\nmember of the Council. Our country, although small in\nsize, has a pacifist tradition that it would hope to channel\ninto and combine with the basic principles that should guide\nthe Security Council.\nThe Dominican Republic is proud to have introduced\nresolution 47/5, by which the Assembly proclaimed 1999 as\nthe International Year of Older Persons. Now that the Year\nis drawing to a close, we are especially proud of its\ninternational success. In the Dominican Republic, thanks to\nthe concerted efforts of the Government, in September\n1998, our Congress approved a bill of rights for older\npersons and established a national committee to oversee its\nimplementation. We consider this to have been our most\nimportant contribution the Year.\nAs host country to the International Research and\nTraining Institute for the Advancement of Women\n(INSTRAW), we wish once again to stress the\nfundamental importance of the Institute, which is one of\nonly three United Nations entities headquartered in a\ndeveloping country, and the only one situated in the\nregion of Latin America and the Caribbean. It is as\nimportant as it was in 1978, when it was created to\npromote the advancement of women, especially in our\ndeveloping nations. We therefore appeal to all\nGovernments to contribute to revitalizing the Institute so\nthat it may continue its important work.\nWe are confident that this great Organization will\nrenew itself and will act with the visionary leadership for\nwhich it was created for by its founders at the San\nFrancisco Conference, in a world that expects greater\nsolidarity among nations and a more just, equitable and\nhumane international order.\nI wish to conclude by calling on States Members of\nthe United Nations to participate in and support the\nMillennium Assembly. We believe that that important\nassembly will reaffirm our commitment to the United\nNations Charter, by highlighting the mission of the United\nNations system in the twenty-first century in the light of\nthe problems posed by globalization and of the need to\nensure that that process will be of benefit to us all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We appreciate and support his\nendeavours in the cause of peace, development and justice.\nThe Brazilian Government warmly greets the\nadmission of Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga, which have just\njoined the United Nations family.\nYear after year, for over half a century, we have\ngathered here to discuss and debate the issues of our time.\nYear after year, the representatives of the Member countries\nof the United Nations have come to this rostrum to set forth\ntheir vision of global affairs and to provide analysis and to\npropose solutions.\nAs the requirements of our societies become ever\ngreater over time, there grows a sense of an ever-widening\ngulf between our words and our deeds, a distance that\nserves only to feed the scepticism of some and the\npessimism of others.\nWhenever an unfolding crisis and its human tragedy\nbreak through international indifference and become\nnewsworthy, it is to the United Nations that the public\nopinion of our countries looks for meaningful answers.\nUnfortunately, however, the international community\nfeels compelled to act in a coordinated fashion, mobilizing\nthe necessary resources and political will, only when long-\nfestering problems threaten to get out of hand, making a\nsatisfactory solution all the more difficult.\nThe upshot is a sense of frustration and impatience\ntowards the United Nations. This may be because the\nnecessary initiatives are in the end adopted outside the\nUnited Nations framework, as was the case in Kosovo. Or\nit may be because the measures agreed are not up to the\nconcrete needs, as we have seen in East Timor. Or it may\neven be because the United Nations finds itself once again\nconfronted, as in Angola, with well-known conflicts of\ncatastrophic proportions that the international community\nhas failed to address in a timely manner.\nWhy is it that certain predicaments generate intense\nmobilization of ways and means, but not others? Why\ndoes human suffering in some parts of the globe fuel\ngreater indignation than when it takes place elsewhere?\nThe plight of Angola and that of East Timor offer two\nglaring examples of what amounts to a clear pattern of\none-sided and unequal attention.\nIn Angola, UNITA\u2019s refusal to abide by the Lusaka\nProtocol and hardened positions threaten to rekindle in all\nits intensity the same civil war that over a quarter of a\ncentury has caused incalculable suffering to millions in\nthat country, particularly the defenceless and the deprived.\nIn Angola, which has special bonds with Brazil, the\ninternational community is squarely faced \u2014 despite the\nlimited international press coverage \u2014 with an immense\npolitical challenge and a humanitarian disaster of\nshocking proportions. Urgent and priority action is called\nfor. The Security Council can no longer allow its\nresolutions to be blatantly ignored, as has been the case.\nNo less urgent \u2014 and in this case the United\nNations is now actively engaged \u2014 is the task of helping\nguarantee the right of the East Timorese people to decide\ntheir own future as an independent nation, a decision\nunmistakably voiced in a free ballot. Brazilian society,\nwhich shares linguistic, cultural and historic ties with the\nTimorese, joined in their rejoicing when the vote returned\na resounding verdict for independence. There was\nconsternation in Brazil at the violence against our brothers\nin East Timor and at the loss of innocent lives that\nfollowed.\nBrazil cannot accept, nor can Brazilian citizens\nunderstand, that the self-determination of the Timorese\npeople is not fully assured. We therefore believe that the\nmultinational force authorized by the Security Council \u2014\na force in which Brazil was determined to participate\nfrom the very outset \u2014 will put a stop to the atrocities\ncommitted since the popular ballot and will be able to\nre-establish the necessary conditions for a peaceful\ntransition to independence.\nOver the past decade, Latin America, long viewed as\na land of backwardness and dictatorships, has fashioned\na new international image for itself through the\ntransformations it has undergone. The return to\ndemocracy in our countries has had a decisive role in this,\nas did our important achievements in fostering respect for\nhuman rights \u2014 although much remains to be done. The\nadoption of consistent economic policies, in turn, has\n5\n\n\nmade it possible to overcome the endless dilemmas that had\nensnared us, and to put an end to the inflationary spiral that\nhad brought so much uncertainty and injustice to our\ncitizens.\nLet there be no doubt that the difficulties that we\nexperienced, on and off, throughout 1999 will not cause us\nto lose faith and relinquish our achievements. For a few\ndays, or maybe weeks, at the beginning of the year, Brazil\nwas dubbed by some \u201cthe sick man of Latin America\u201d. It\nwas thought that we might slip back into the trap of high\ninflation, that we would experience deep recession, that we\nwould once again resort to the panacea of stoking short-\nterm growth and return to the old boom-and-bust cycles of\nthe past.\nYet we have arrived at the end of the century with an\ninflation rate under 8 per cent. We fully expect to embark\non a course of sustained annual growth of more than 4 per\ncent and are set to bring to completion a large-scale\nmodernization programme by means of important reforms\nin tax, fiscal and social security matters. President Fernando\nHenrique Cardoso will not flinch in his determination to lay\nthe groundwork for our country to become modern,\neconomically fit and dynamic, as well as socially more just\nand politically mature.\nWith the advent of democracy, Brazil and Argentina\nhave developed the solid friendship that binds our peoples,\nand have over a short space of time built a lasting\nmonument to integration. Our bilateral agreements in the\nfield of nuclear cooperation are exemplary and a stabilizing\nforce in the region and worldwide. The Southern Cone\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) \u2014 which our two\ncountries joined Paraguay and Uruguay in establishing and\nwith which the democracies of Bolivia and Chile have\nassociated themselves \u2014 has fundamentally altered the\neconomic face of the hemisphere and indeed of the world.\nOur integration process is not directed against anyone, but,\non the contrary, seeks to strengthen our historical ties both\nwithin and beyond the Americas. Both individually and\nwithin the framework of MERCOSUR our countries have\nbecome a powerful force in the drive to set the international\ntrade system on a more open, balanced course, one that no\nlonger aids and abets protectionist privileges at the expense,\nmore often than not, of developing countries.\nDemocracy has made it possible for the countries of\nLatin America to provide mutual assistance \u2014 without\nundue and unsolicited foreign interference and in a spirit of\ncollaboration \u2014 whenever there is a jointly perceived threat\nto the institutional stability of one of them. Thanks to\ndemocracy, the countries of our region have successfully\nsolved disputes that for long disturbed the harmony of the\nmore peaceful and stable of continents. At the end of last\nyear, Ecuador and Peru, with the diplomatic support of\nBrazil, Argentina, Chile and the United States, signed in\nBrasilia the agreements that put an end to their long-\nrunning boundary dispute. Thus, despite all manner of\ndifficulties, Latin America is transforming itself into a\ntightly knit entity that is politically, economically and\nsocially integrated.\nIt is in this spirit of integration, and in the abiding\nawareness that we belong to one family, that Brazil feels\nclosely attuned to the various efforts at renewal under\nway in the region. The elections scheduled for next\nOctober in Argentina will no doubt confirm the political\nvitality of this great neighbour of ours and guarantee the\nnecessary economic conditions for stability and\nreinvigorated growth. These same favourable expectations,\nwe are sure, will be fulfilled at the elections to be held in\nChile and in Uruguay this year, and in Mexico next year.\nTheir outcome will most certainly underline the\ndemocratic character of Latin America.\nThe political and economic achievements of Bolivia\nsince the 1980s in overcoming obstacles that 20 years ago\nseemed insurmountable are a further indication of how\nmuch our region has changed for the better. Peru as well\nhas gained international recognition through its\nresounding successes in reversing the adverse economic\ntrends of past decades and in the war against terrorism\nand drug trafficking. This capacity to overcome obstacles\nis equally noticeable in Ecuador, where, with the support\nof international financial institutions, political forces\nwill \u2014 through democratic and constitutional channels \u2014\nundertake the needed reforms to overcome the present\ncrisis. Paraguay, in turn, successfully dealt with a delicate\npolitical crisis at the beginning of this year and is moving\nsteadily along the road of democratic institution-building\nand economic development. Brazil, as always, will\ncontinue to decisively support Paraguay in that endeavour.\nGuyana provides a further demonstration, not only\nof our commitment to upholding and fostering democratic\nvalues, but equally of the integrationist spirit that inspires\nus. It is our hope that Suriname will join in the efforts\nand achievements of the region in bringing about these\npositive changes. The transformations that Venezuela is\nundergoing have drawn great international attention. This\nprocess of change must be respected, for it clearly and\nlegitimately reflects the Venezuelan people\u2019s desire for\nrenewal. The expression of this aspiration through\n6\n\n\ninstitutional channels is the best guarantee that the changes\nunder way will stay on the track of respect for the norms,\nrights and duties that define democracy.\nBrazil is also confident that the Government of\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Pastrana, in Colombia, will persevere in\nits endeavours to bring peace to this kindred nation. Undue\nforeign interference would only aggravate an already\ncomplex situation, which it is up to the Colombians\nthemselves to overcome.\nIt is on the success of our neighbours, in which we\ntrust, that hinges the success of the Brazilian people and its\nGovernment in solving their own problems and in\novercoming their own challenges, which are neither few nor\nsmall.\nOrganized crime and drug trafficking today pose a\nmajor challenge to democratic societies. They clearly\nrepresent a serious threat to the security of national\ninstitutions and to citizens directly, who pay with their own\nlives the intolerable price for this scourge of our times. The\nspiralling stockpile of and trade in small arms is closely\nlinked to organized crime and drug trafficking. As its\ncitizens find their lives daily at risk because of contraband\nfirearms, Brazil gives the utmost priority to tackling this\nquestion. At the regional level we approved the important\nInter-American Convention on Transparency in\nConventional Weapons Acquisitions. We would like this\nAssembly to endorse the proposal to hold an international\nconference on illicit arms trafficking in all its aspects.\nSimilarly, Brazil attaches considerable importance to the\nwork being done on a draft convention against transnational\norganized crime.\nIn turn, the continued existence of weapons of mass\ndestruction remains a threat to the security and even the\nsurvival of humankind.\nAll actions contrary to the aims of the\nnon-proliferation regime should be firmly condemned by\nthe international community. At the same time, it behooves\nthe nuclear-armed States, as well as the threshold States, to\nmove towards the complete and irreversible elimination of\nnuclear armaments. For this reason, Brazil, Egypt, Ireland,\nMexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden will once\nagain submit, at this session, a draft resolution on a new\nagenda for nuclear disarmament. The draft resolution,\nwhich seeks to pave the way for a constructive dialogue on\nthis issue, is grounded on a realistic and balanced appraisal\nof the nature of the nuclear disarmament process.\nOur countries\u2019 democratic institutions and the\ninternational organizations, particularly the United\nNations, face fundamental challenges today. Our countries\nare confronted daily with economic difficulties and acute\nsocial grievances, such as poverty and extremes of\ninequality, which heighten impatience: impatience with\neconomies unable to grow at a rate compatible with faster\nimprovement of the well-being of societies; impatience in\nthe face of vulnerability to crises and to turbulence in\ninternational markets; and impatience with political\nprocesses that sometimes appear slow to respond to the\nlegitimate and pressing demands of citizens. It is vital,\nhowever, that this collective impatience be voiced and\nguided through democratic channels.\nBrazil\u2019s commitment to democratic institutions and\nto the primacy of law also applies to international\nrelations. At the outset of his second term of office, to\nwhich he was elected last October by an absolute majority\nof Brazilian voters, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso\nmade it clear that:\n\u201cThe rule of law is the only admissible\nfoundation for the international order. Should\nunilateralism and the use of force come to be\naccepted as organizing principles of international\nrelations, in the long term it will be more rational to\nside with the instruments of power politics rather\nthan to strive for order and to abide by law. If we\nare to see a truly new world order emerge, one of its\ncornerstones must be the acceptance that multilateral\ninstitutions \u2014 not least the Security Council \u2014 are\nthe source of legality and legitimacy for those\nactions that guarantee peace and the peaceful\nresolution of disputes\u201d.\nOur societies await, again with increasing\nimpatience, seeing multilateral organizations, and in\nparticular the United Nations, show themselves to be up\nto the challenge of playing a meaningful \u2014 in fact,\ncrucial \u2014 role in establishing an international order\nattuned to the shared aspirations and values of humankind\nas a whole.\nThe road ahead calls for renewal and change. If the\nGovernments of the world desire a strong and effective\nUnited Nations, they must not only change how they\nthink and act with respect to this Organization, but they\nmust also think and act to bring about change in the\nOrganization. This is what is at stake. This is the\nchallenge before us."

        "file_text": "I would like at the outset, Sir, to express the warm\ncongratulations of my delegation and of my country on\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly.\nYou are one of sisterly Namibia's freedom fighters, and one\nof Africa's faithful sons. Your unanimous election to your\nimportant post and your country's simultaneous membership\nof the Security Council are strong evidence of the respect\nand appreciation that Namibia enjoys in the eyes of the\nentire international community. In the Security Council,\nNamibia's notable positions on important international\nissues also irrefutably demonstrate Namibia's unremitting\nstruggle for freedom, right, sovereignty and justice \u2014 a\nstruggle now waged by means different from those that\nNamibia used during its independence struggle.\nI also commend your predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Didier Opertti, for his successful guidance of the\nprevious session.\nI wish also to welcome the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as new\nMembers of the United Nations.\nThe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, deserves our deepest appreciation for his\ncontinued efforts to make this Organization freer and less\nsubmissive to the domination and control of the super-\nPowers of this critical historical era.\nOver the past several decades, the United Nations\nhas made considerable achievements, the most notable of\nwhich has perhaps been its role in the elimination of\ndirect colonialism and in the attainment of independence\nby many countries which today occupy their proper place\nas States Members of this Organization.\nThe world has witnessed fundamental changes,\nwhich imperatively call for serious reform of the United\nNations and its basic structures, so that the Organization\ncan truly perform its role as an umbrella, a haven and a\nreference-point for all. Colonialist soldiers have left the\nharbours and the airports, but with the collapse of\ninternational equilibrium, colonialists are reappearing in\nnew guises, with new means and with both new and old\napproaches. Colonialism is coming back in the guise of\nthe International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, other\nfinancial institutions, economic cartels, and, when\nnecessary, military alliances. It is coming back in the\nguise of international conventions imposed through so-\ncalled international legitimacy, which is really nothing\nmore than an expression of higher policies dictated\nthrough temptation or coercion. Colonialism is coming\nback in the guise of globalization, which is but a means\nof ensuring and consolidating dependence in terms of the\neconomy, politics, culture and even social values.\nColonialism is also returning through direct armed\ninvasion, when necessary, as we have recently witnessed.\nIt is also returning through bilateral sanctions policies\nenforced through so-called international legitimacy and\nthrough selective disarmament or rearmament.\nColonialism is returning through the elimination \u2014 not\nthe mere violation \u2014 of State sovereignty. The slogan\nthat is now much in vogue, \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d,\nwill help erode the little that remains of State sovereignty.\nThat pretext has been completely exposed. If the new\nColonialists understood the real meaning of humanity,\nthey would not be producing and stockpiling all kinds of\nweapons of mass destruction or committing aggression\nagainst others. Nor would they be imposing sanctions on\ncountries, as they continue to do, with the aim of\n16\n\n\nhumiliating, starving and killing their peoples. We declare\nour absolute rejection of intervention under any slogan.\nThis is the world following the collapse of\ninternational equilibrium: the strong and the rich are\nbecoming stronger and richer, and the weak and the poor\nare becoming weaker, poorer and more deprived.\nIn the face of these fundamental changes, it has\nbecome necessary, indeed urgently imperative, that the\nUnited Nations should undergo a transformation that would\nenable it to respond to its new tasks as an umbrella, a\nhaven and a reference-point for all. This change will not\nhappen by itself, nor will the powerful initiate it. The\nweaker nations can only resort to uniting their limitless\nefforts, strengths and potentials to bring about and impose\nsuch change. My country believes that this desired change\nmust achieve the following:\nFirst, the authority for decision-making in the United\nNations must rest with the General Assembly, where\nMember States enjoy equal sovereignty.\nSecondly, the Security Council must become an\nexecutive instrument or authority for the General Assembly.\nThirdly, there must be a radical revision of Security\nCouncil membership that will be equitable to all under-\nrepresented regions, particularly in the southern hemisphere:\nAfrica, Asia and South America.\nFourthly, the Security Council's rules of procedures\nmust be issued by the General Assembly, which represents\nthe international community. Otherwise, it will be\nmeaningless to say that the Security Council works on\nbehalf of the international community. Quite simply put, the\nmajority of the members of the international community did\nnot participate in the formulation of the Charter. A very\nsmall number of the United Nations Members formulated\nit over half a century ago.\nFifthly, all privileges resulting from the victories and\ndefeats of World War II must be abolished, particularly the\nprivilege of veto, and any other privileges that prevent this\nmost important international Organization from becoming\ntruly democratic.\nDespite the crises, conflicts and wars that ravage the\nAfrican continent, this year has witnessed solutions for\nsome of them, prospects for several others and initiatives\nfor the solution of the remaining conflicts. As we express\nour satisfaction with this trend, we wish to recall, as we\nhave always done, that African wars and conflicts are the\nproduct of the division of Africa by the colonial Powers,\nwhich must assume full responsibility for all the damages\ninflicted upon the continent, including an apology and full\ncompensation to its peoples. The solutions reached for\nmany African conflicts were a result of the enormous\nefforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nsubregional organizations, several African States and\nsome African leaders who truly care about Africa's\nsecurity, stability and development.\nLibya has effectively supported and participated in\nthese initiatives, and will continue to do so, in close\ncooperation with the OAU, all other concerned countries\nand the Secretary-General of the United Nations. As a\ncontribution to the efforts made to tackle the situation in\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes\nregion, Libya has succeeded in convening a number of\nmeetings, for heads of State of the region, in Sirte, Libya,\nwhere they reached the Sirte Agreement, later completed\nand signed in Lusaka, which is aimed at putting an end to\nthe conflict in the area.\nIn Somalia, Libya continues its efforts, in\ncoordination with all concerned countries and groups in\nconflict, for national reconciliation in that forgotten\ncountry. We hope that these efforts will result in the\nreunification and stability of Somalia. Libya has also\ncontributed to bringing peace to Sierra Leone and stability\nto Guinea-Bissau, as well as contributing to the efforts\nundertaken by the OAU to put an end to the dispute\nbetween brothers in Ethiopia and Eritrea, in the Horn of\nAfrica. A Libyan envoy was sent there to help end the\nwar and bring peace to those two brotherly countries.\nAfrica's plights are not confined to wars and\nconflicts, but also include several economic and social\nproblems: 44 per cent of Africans live in abject poverty;\nAIDS threatens the entire African population; malaria and\nother epidemic diseases still threaten the lives of millions\nin Africa. In respect of the latter, my country calls for the\nspeedy adoption and implementation of an international\nplan to eradicate these diseases in Africa before it\nbecomes impossible to contain and eliminate them.\nAttempts by African states to confront and solve these\nproblems are hampered by the heavy debts of the\ncontinent, which reached $350 billion in 1998, equalling\n300 per cent of the value of African exports and services.\nThe time has come to cancel African debts and to deal\nwith this question on the basis of new and equitable\nprinciples.\n17\n\n\nIn order to confront these challenges and to usher a\nstrong and united Africa into the new century, our brother\nColonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi extended an invitation to his\nbrothers, the leaders of Africa, to convene an extraordinary\nsummit in Sirte, Libya, from 8 to 9 September 1999. Their\npositive response had been unprecedented since the\nestablishment of the OAU. They all participated in the\nsummit, with the exception of Somalia, which has no\ncentral government. Thirty-nine heads of State and four\nPrime Ministers were at the forefront of the participants.\nSome of the founding fathers of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity were also at the summit, as well as former\nOAU Secretaries-General. The summit, which is a historic\nevent in its own right, concluded with the adoption of the\nSirte Declaration establishing an African Union and its\npolitical, economic and legislative institutions. Africa is\nnow determined, more than ever before, to surmount all the\nnegative aspects of its present realities and to move forward\ntowards its future, full of hopes and aspirations, counting\nbasically on its own resources, capabilities and the\nendeavours of its sons.\nThe Palestinian issue has not been settled yet, simply\nbecause the essence of the problem is being ignored:\nPalestine is still occupied. Its people are still scattered all\nover the globe as refugees, replaced by immigrants from all\nover the world. Unless an end is put to all this, and unless\nthe Palestinian people are given their right to return to their\nhomeland, neither peace nor security will be achieved in the\nArab East region. The occupation of the Syrian Golan\nHeights must also be totally ended, as well as the\noccupation of southern Lebanon, in implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978).\nWe demand the immediate lifting of sanctions imposed\non Iraq, and we emphasize the importance of preserving its\nunity and territorial integrity, respect for its sovereignty,\nnon-intervention in its internal affairs and ending the\nongoing military aggression against it.\nIn order for the world to live in peace and security, it\nmust be freed from the nuclear horror that threatens all\npeoples. Elimination of nuclear arsenals and all other\nweapons of mass destruction must have priority, and all\nefforts to achieve disarmament, at both regional and\ninternational levels, must be concentrated on realizing this\ngoal. Unless those who currently possess such weapons get\nrid of them, there will always be those who strive to\npossess them. Efforts aimed at the non-proliferation of\nnuclear weapons will be futile unless the nuclear Powers\ntake practical steps that would demonstrate their serious\ncommitment to the undertakings they have made. These two\ntracks must move together or stop together. We have no\nother choice.\nThe Arab region is subject to the threat of nuclear\nweapons possessed by Tel Aviv. These weapons\nconstitute a permanent threat to the people of the region\nand to neighbouring areas, and unless these weapons are\neliminated, all efforts to prevent their proliferation in the\nregion will be unsuccessful.\nLibya is the southern Mediterranean country with the\nlongest coast. Therefore, we have a vital interest in\nmaking the Mediterranean a Sea of peace and cooperation\nfor the benefit of all peoples of this basin. This goal can\nbe achieved only if foreign military bases and fleets are\nremoved from the area, as they are a source of constant\ndanger to all Mediterranean peoples.\nSeveral countries, including my own, are still trying\nto overcome the thorny problem of landmines that were\nplanted in by the belligerent Powers during the World\nWars. These landmines have caused damage, losses and\ntragedies of untold magnitude, both human and material.\nVast areas of Libya are covered by millions of land mines\ndeployed by the Allies and the Axis Powers during the\nSecond World War. We hold those Powers responsible\nfor what they have inflicted upon our people as a result\nof these landmines, and we reiterate our demand that the\nStates responsible implement the resolutions of the\nGeneral Assembly adopted in this regard, through the\npayment of compensation to the affected countries and\npeoples and the removal of these landmines.\nThe revolution of 1969 allowed Libya to achieve its\ntrue and complete independence. By driving the foreign\nmilitary forces and bases from its soil, my country\nliberated its policies and decision-making capabilities. For\nthese reasons, Libya has since then been the target of\nongoing hostile media campaigns aimed at distorting our\npolicies and tarnishing our international image. Our\nsupport for and solidarity with liberation movements have\nbeen portrayed as support for terrorism. Our standing by\nthe side of the oppressed and the downtrodden and our\nassistance to help them liberate their countries and their\nresources and defend their own interests have been\nconsidered interference in the internal affairs of others.\nThere have also been clandestine campaigns that\nhave sought to assassinate political leaders, in particular\nthe leader of our revolution, Colonel Muammar\nAl-Qadhafi, who has been targeted several times. Both air\nforce and naval campaigns have targeted Libya\u2019s\n18\n\n\nterritorial waters and the main cities of Tripoli and\nBenghazi. As a result, dozens of martyrs were killed and\nmany times as many were wounded \u2014 in addition to\nextensive loss of and damage to property. The main\nobjective of these raids was once again to murder our\nbrother Muammar Al-Qadhafi, whose home, office and tent\nwere destroyed during these raids.\nEconomic pressure has been used against Libya.\nUnilateral boycotts and embargoes were followed by\nbilateral and collective embargoes, then by the\ninternationalization of these embargoes after the Security\nCouncil had become hostage to the will of the powerful\nsince the collapse of the international balance of power.\nThis was particularly the case during the first years of the\n\u201cera of frenzy\u201d, as Mr. Kofi Annan called it in a report to\nthe General Assembly.\nWhy and how was the international \u201cboycott\u201d \u2014 as\nopposed to international \u201csanctions\u201d \u2014 imposed? I call it\na boycott and not sanctions because a sanction is a form of\npunishment for a definitively proven action, a punishment\ndecreed after a final sentence has been pronounced by a\ncompetent court that has the jurisdiction to condemn the\naction in question. But no proof or evidence was presented\nto the Security Council that Libya, or even the two Libyan\nsuspects, had actually committed any action that led to the\ncrash of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of\nLockerbie. Nevertheless, the sanctions resolutions were\nissued in the name of so-called international legitimacy, a\nlegitimacy that is both wrong and wronged. This is wrong\nbecause resolutions are adopted in the name of the Security\nCouncil; the Security Council is wronged because it is\nforced to issue resolutions under political and economic\npressures and threats. The relevant resolutions were adopted\non the basis of suspicions regarding just two Libyan\ncitizens \u2014 yet the sanctions targeted the entire population\nof Libya. This was a form of collective punishment against\nan entire people on the basis of a mere suspicion that had\nnot been fully investigated. This punishment was imposed\nwithout a trial and obviously without any conviction in a\ncourt of law. So much indeed for legitimacy. In fact, how\nlegitimate could this be during the years of frenzy?\nThe conclusions \u2014 or cinematic fantasies \u2014 regarding\nthe suspicions were refuted at the time. Malta conducted an\nofficial investigation, the findings of which demonstrated\nthat not one unaccompanied suitcase was loaded onto the\nflight from Malta to Frankfurt. For their part, the Frankfurt\nauthorities investigated the matter and reached the\nconclusion that not one unaccompanied suitcase had arrived\nat their airport from Malta, nor had left it for London.\nWhat then, is the origin or basis of this suspicion?\nI would like to briefly remind the Assembly that\nfrom the first moment that the accusation was broadcast\nby the media, and before the matter was even presented\nto the Security Council, Libya had done the following.\nFirst, we had requested the other party to provide the\njudiciary authorities in Libya with its findings so that\nthese authorities could commence their investigations\naccordingly. Alternatively, we proposed that that party\nsend investigators to Libya to participate in the\ninvestigation. We proposed sending Libyan judges to\nreview the case file. We also proposed that an\ninvestigation be conducted by a neutral party or parties,\nor by the United Nations. All these requests were refused.\nSecondly, we requested the application of article 14\nof the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of\nUnlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation or the\nassignment of this matter to the International Court of\nJustice. All these requests and proposals were also\nrefused.\nThen, on 27 February 1998, the International Court\nof Justice issued two rulings in favour of Libya,\nconfirming its jurisdiction over the case under the\nMontreal Convention. The Non-Aligned Movement \u2014 at\na meeting of its Foreign Ministers in Cartagena,\nColombia, from 18 to 20 May 1998 \u2014 made a\nrecommendation to the upcoming Non-Aligned Movement\nSummit in Durban, South Africa, that the sanctions\nimposed on Libya be lifted if the other party to the\ndispute did not agree to suspend the sanctions at the next\nreview of the Security Council, which had been set for\nJuly 1998. At the Organization of African Unity summit\nin Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, held on 10 June 1998,\nthat organization declared that its members would no\nlonger comply with the Security Council sanctions if the\nother party continued to reject any of the options\nproposed by international organizations to resolve the\nconflict. Faced with all these developments, the other\nparty had only two options left: either to accept a trial in\na third country, or for the international community to\nimmediately lift the sanctions without having recourse to\nthe Security Council. Such a situation would have\nthreatened the authority of the Security Council \u2014 or,\nmore accurately, it would have threatened the authority of\nthose who influence the Security Council \u2014 this latter\nbeing in the Council\u2019s view \u2014 a much more serious\nmatter.\n19\n\n\nA further legal complication was the possibility that\nthe General Assembly would be presented with a\nconstitutional dilemma, especially after the issuance of the\ntwo rulings of the International Court of Justice \u2014 the\nhighest judicial institution of the United Nations. It was the\nSecurity Council versus the International Court of Justice.\nWe could present the case to the General Assembly at any\ntime. The other party therefore had no option, and\nreluctantly, accepted, hoping to gain time. But then it\nreturned to its main objective vis-\u00e0-vis Libya. It declared its\nacceptance of a trial in a third country and presented, as\nalways, a badly written draft resolution to the Security\nCouncil, along with other draft resolutions imposed on the\nCouncil by means that are well known to all, especially to\nthe Council\u2019s members.\nOnce again, most Security Council members supported\nLibya, and once again the international community\nreiterated its strong support for Libya in letters that\nreflected the will of the overwhelming majority of the\ninternational community. These letters are all official\ndocuments of the Security Council.\nBut in all fairness, and to state the truth, from which\nwe have never deviated, I will say that the Government of\nthe United Kingdom has reacted seriously to the Libyan\nproposal, expressing its willingness to refer the whole\nquestion to none other than a Scottish court sitting in the\nNetherlands. We state the truth in our own interest and in\nthe interest of others.\nThe rest is well known to all delegations. On 5 April\n1999, the two suspects arrived of their own free will in the\nNetherlands, accompanied by Mr. Hans Corell, the\nUnder-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs.\nBut has the other party fulfilled its obligations? Has it\nshown respect for the resolutions of the Security Council?\nThe answer is no. In fact, the other party prevented the\nadoption of a resolution by the Security Council to suspend\nthe sanctions and agreed only to a press release. Once\nagain, under pressure from the Non-Aligned Movement\nmembers of the Security Council and from the other\nCouncil members, and after several letters were submitted\nby the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement, the\nOrganization of African Unity, the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference and the Arab League to the Security\nCouncil and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nthe other party accepted, unwillingly, the text of a\npresidential statement for the suspension of the embargo.\nThree months after the sanctions were suspended, on\n30 June 1999, the Secretary-General submitted a report to\nthe Security Council in document S/1999/726 pursuant to\nparagraph 16 of resolution 883 (1993) and paragraph 8 of\nresolution 1192 (1998), which requested him to report to\nthe Security Council within 90 days on compliance by the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya with the remaining provisions of\nresolutions 731 (1992) and 748 (1992). On 9 July 1999,\nthe Security Council considered the Secretary-General's\nreport, but was unable to adopt a resolution that would\nhave lifted the sanctions imposed on Libya, because of\nthe intransigence of one State, the United States, which is\na party to the dispute. That State even threatened to use\nthe veto. This, in fact, can only be seen as reneging on\nprevious commitments made by the Security Council in\nparagraph 16 of its resolution 883 (1993) and paragraph\n8 of its resolution 1192 (1998). Moreover, it ignores the\nSecretary-General's report, whose contents lead to only\none conclusion: that Libya has fulfilled all its obligations\nunder Security Council resolutions.\nWhat justification, if any, does the United States\nhave for using the veto to prevent the Security Council\nfrom adopting a resolution to lift the unjust sanctions on\nLibya? First, the United States has reiterated the\naccusation it has made before and since the fabrication of\nthe Lockerbie case: that Libya supports terrorism. The\nUnited States has been repeating that allegation ever since\nwe evicted it from Libya's military bases and harbours,\nended its monopoly on our oil, and liberated our country\nfrom colonialism. That is why the United States still\naccuses us of terrorism. The Secretary-General's report\ncategorically refutes this claim. Members may refer to\nparagraphs 29 to 34 of the report and to other pages in\norder to ascertain the baseless nature of this accusation.\nMoreover, one can also cite reports issued by the\nAmerican State Department and statements made by\npresent and former officials of American Administrations\nthat all point to the fact that such claims can no longer be\nmade.\nLibya is a victim of American terrorism, not vice\nversa. It is the United States of America that committed\nall the acts of aggression that we have previously referred\nto. It is the United States that sheltered, financed, trained\nand armed terrorists and transported them to Libya to\ncommit acts of terrorism in 1984 and afterwards. Those\nwho continue to shelter terrorists wanted by other\ncountries are not in a position to refer to others by\ndescriptions that apply only to themselves. Libya has\nstood by liberation movements, particularly in Africa.\nThis is a legitimate cause, not support for terrorism.\n20\n\n\nThe second justification is that Libya has to cooperate\nwith the Scottish court in the Netherlands. This is\nmeaningless, since Libya has undertaken to cooperate with\nthe court, as the Secretary-General's report has shown.\nFurthermore, this matter has been discussed by the judiciary\nauthorities of the three countries in the presence of Mr.\nCorell. The Security Council, in paragraph 4 of its\nresolution 1192 (1998), decided that all States, not Libya\nalone, shall cooperate with the court. The text is available;\nwe can look it up if there is any doubt. Since all parties are\ncalled upon to cooperate, how can this argument be used to\nprevent the Security Council from acting in accordance with\nits obligations by lifting the embargo on Libya? This matter\nfalls under the competence of the International Court of\nJustice and the Scottish court, with which our judiciary\nauthorities are cooperating. It is blatant interference when\na member of the Security Council tries to influence the\nwork of these courts, which are independent institutions that\ndeserve the respect not only of Libya, but of all others as\nwell.\nThe third justification is even harder to swallow. It is\nthe demand that Libya compensate the families of the\nvictims. How can this be done when the court has yet to\nsit? It will not hold its first session until 4 February 2000\nand the laws state that the suspect is innocent until proven\nguilty. When we raised this issue, it was suggested that we\nsettle out of court. Why out of court? Why then is the court\nin the Netherlands? We were told that these are American\nlaws. American laws apply to United States citizens, not to\nLibyan citizens. The Security Council and the General\nAssembly reiterated last year and the year before that\nnational laws cannot be applied beyond national borders.\nThis logic of power should be used only to uphold the law.\nAt the joint meeting, the Secretary-General himself was\nsurprised to hear this proposal before the court was in\nsession. They reiterated it. He asked them how it could be\ndone. They said that the court would hand down a sentence.\nHe pointed out that it had not yet done so and that, if it did,\nLibya would be committed to respecting it. How could they\npossibly make such a request when the suspects have not\nbeen found guilty? We are trying to prove their innocence\nand our country's. How can we be asked to pay\ncompensation when a ruling has not yet been issued? This\nis yet another way of interfering in the internal affairs of\nthe Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands.\nWho will compensate Libya for the damages it has\nsustained in excess of $70 billion after seven years of\nunjustified sanctions and embargoes? Who will compensate\nus? The United Nations? Will the Member States\ncompensate Libya for something they have not done? Let\nus be logical and work within the law on the basic\nprinciples of justice. Since we have agreed to the\nestablishment of the court, let us allow the court to carry\nout its responsibilities.\nLibya's fulfilment of its obligations has also been\nunderlined in the Secretary-General's report, in the\ndecisions of the thirty-fifth African Summit held in\nAlgeria last July, in the decisions of the Arab League this\nSeptember and in the decisions of the Ministerial Council\nof the Non-Aligned Movement a week ago. All these\ndecisions call for the immediate and complete lifting of\nthe sanctions. In this, they join the overwhelming majority\nof the international community.\nPreventing the Security Council from adopting an\noverdue resolution lifting sanctions that should not have\nbeen imposed in the first place will threaten the Council's\ncredibility and ability to honour its obligations. It will\nalso reinforce the Security Council's failure to act in\ncompliance with the will of the majority of the United\nNations Member States and in accordance with the\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter, as\nstated in Article 24. The will of one State cannot\nrepresent the will of the entire international community.\nMy country requests one thing: that the Security\nCouncil speedily adopt a decision lifting all the sanctions\nimposed on Libya. We demand that the case not be\nallowed to be politicized after the matter has taken its\nlegal course. The case should be left entirely to the\nScottish court in the Netherlands, without any interference\nfrom any political entity, including the Security Council.\nIf the Security Council continues to be prevented from\nadopting such a decision, my country will take all\nnecessary steps to guarantee fairness, including raising a\nconstitutional dilemma between the highest and most\nimportant judiciary organ, the International Court of\nJustice, and the Security Council. We will raise it before\nthe General Assembly in order to have a decision taken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. We likewise\nextend our appreciation to Mr. Didier Opertti, the\nPresident of the Assembly at its fifty-third session. We\nwish also to convey our appreciation and thanks to His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his leadership in\npromoting the objectives and the mission of the United\nNations.\nI wish to convey the warm greetings of President\nKuniwo Nakamura, the entire leadership and the people\nof the Republic of Palau to the Assembly on the occasion\nof the fifty-fourth session. On behalf of the Government\nand the people of Palau, I extend our sincere appreciation\nto the members of this body for their assistance.\nSince attaining membership of the United Nations in\n1994, the Republic of Palau has benefitted greatly from\na variety of United Nations-sponsored programmes and\nfrom international cooperation, which have helped us play\nour role in promoting peace and democracy in our region.\nThis year, on 1 October, we proudly celebrate the fifth\nanniversary of our independence, which came about as a\nresult of a unique and very successful political treaty with\nthe United States of America under the Compact of Free\nAssociation. Diplomatic relations and economic\ncooperation with a growing number of members of this\nbody assure stability and promise great economic\npotential for the future.\n\n\nBefore I proceed, let me take this rare opportunity to\nwelcome three of our regional neighbours \u2014 the Republic\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga \u2014 and to congratulate them on joining this\nimportant Organization.\nPalau also expresses its appreciation and support for\nthe efforts of the Security Council in promoting peace,\nsecurity and the protection of human rights and democracy\nthroughout the world, and especially in troubled areas in\nneed of United Nations intervention.\nToday we have less than 100 days left before entering\nthe new millennium \u2014 97 days to be exact. There are\nindeed many global issues and problems that certainly\ndeserve our attention. The existence of the Earth in the next\nmillennium may, however, be in great jeopardy if the\nenvironment and nature's forces can no longer support the\nhuman population. Global warming or climate change may\nmerit the upmost attention and our concerted effort. I call\nupon every Member State, large and small, developed and\ndeveloping, rich and poor, to work cooperatively to find\nmeaningful solutions and preventive actions for this\ngrowing international problem and challenge. I am\nconfident that through sharing information on climate\nchange we can learn from one another and take the\nnecessary steps to meet this very dangerous global problem.\nLet me share a Palauan proverb with the Assembly,\none that foreshadows climate change. In Palau the winds\nare mainly from the east or from the west. When there are\neasterly winds, the sky is not so telling before the rain. As\nthe rain commences, one may think it is just a light shower.\nHowever, it actually comes in a downpour. In the old days\nour raincoat was simply several leaves sewn together and\nput over our heads. So we would get soaked through and\nthrough during this downpour. The message is: do not\nunderestimate the easterly winds, or you will get deluged\nwith water.\nThat is our message from yesterday, and it is our\nmessage today: do not take climate change lightly, or there\nwill be dire consequences. Climate change for small island\nnations such as the Republic of Palau has great\nconsequences because of our fragile ecosystem. To expand\non just a few examples, the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which\nimpacted many communities throughout the globe, had far-\nreaching and devastating effects in Palau as well. At least\none third of all our hard coral communities died. Our reefs\nare home to over 500 species of corals and 1,500 species of\nfish, and are vibrant with marine life. The loss of our coral\ncommunities effects our entire ecosystem and eventually\nour people and their economic livelihoods. The El Ni\u00f1o\nphenomenon also caused extreme drought that dried up\nour main water reservoir and destroyed over 1,400\npatches of our most important root crop, taro, which of\ncourse added another burden to our daily lives.\nPalau and our Pacific region are also suffering from\nunusually high rises in tide tables, causing our farmlands\nto be infiltrated with salt water that eventually will have\ndire effects on our crops. This high sea level rise has\nliterally caused islands to disappear, and others are in\nimminent danger of disappearing. Abnormally warm\nocean temperatures have also caused extensive coral\nbleaching, and rising atmospheric temperatures devastate\nagriculture. According to the 1999-2000 World\nDevelopment Report, a 1 metre sea level rise due to\nclimate change would force about 70 million people to\nmove, and would have a dramatic effect on food security\nin central Asia and the Pacific. Many other examples\nexist, I am sure.\nThese few examples, and examples in other\ncountries, beg for global cooperation on climate change.\nThe Republic of Palau recognizes the link between\nclimate change and biodiversity, and is committed to\npreserving our biodiversity. Protecting our forests is one\nof the most effective mechanisms to slow climate change.\nForests, as we know, are carbon sinks, which absorb\ncarbon dioxide rather than releasing it as a harmful\ngreenhouse gas. Because of this, the destruction of forest\nhas a dramatic impact on climate change. The Republic\nof Palau has taken responsibility for its forests through\nthe National Forest Act and Mangrove Management Plan.\nProgress is being made on national regulations requiring\nprotective vegetative zones along our wetland and coastal\nareas. The Republic of Palau sponsors a summer tree\nplanting programme for our children in order to teach our\nyouth the importance of our natural resources. We are\ntaking steps necessary to ensure that our forests and reefs\nare available for future generations.\nThe Republic of Palau has incorporated the grave\nissues of climate change and rises in sea level into long-\nterm strategic planning. Instruments for accession to the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange and the Kyoto Protocol are in transmission, and\nwe humbly request international assistance to develop a\ncomprehensive vulnerability index that encompasses\neconomic and environmental factors like climate change.\nWe enthusiastically support efforts to adjust energy\nprices to accurately reflect the environmental\n2\n\n\nconsequences of fossil fuel use. Alongside climate change,\nenergy conservation is critical to Palau's economy and the\nenvironment. We have established a national policy, the\nNational Energy Goal, to subsidize renewable energy\nprogrammes, and have audited all Government facilities for\nenergy efficiency. At our national hospital we replaced\nstandard incandescent lights with energy efficient compact\nfluorescent lamps. Solar panels provide lights for our outer\nislands and isolated villages. Solar beacons light our reef\nchannels. Our national energy programme and public utility\ncorporation are in partnership with the Million Solar\nRooftops initiative to educate the public about renewable\nenergy applications. Let us start off the new century with\na dynamic move away from fossil fuels and towards a\ncommitment to environment friendly energy alternatives.\nEntering into relevant agreements and conventions\nwhich target international response to environmental issues\nis another responsibility that our Republic has to its people\nand this world community. It is one that we are fulfilling as\ntime goes on, being a signatory and party to eight\ninternational agreements, including the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\nThe Republic of Palau views climate change as being\nin the forefront of issues that need to be addressed, and that\ncan only be effectively addressed if all Member States\nmeaningfully contribute on the basis of common but\ndifferentiated responsibilities. The use of the Kyoto\nmechanisms is an integral component of a global solution\nto the issue of climate change. Therefore, it is critical that\nno artificial restrictions be placed on the use of these\nmechanisms. If we can all come to terms with the intent of\nthe Kyoto mechanisms and develop a fair and realistic\napproach to their use, there will be no sufficient reason why\nwe cannot enter the new millennium with positive remedies\nto the issue of climate change. Maybe we can even enter\nthe new millennium with a breath of fresh air.\nAs we travel towards the new millennium, let us move\nforward with the tools that we have developed as an\ninternational family, so that the benefits, although they may\ngo unseen in our generation, may be fully appreciated by\nour children and their children. These initiatives shall be\nour imprint, our assurance of a healthier environment for\ngenerations to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to take this\nopportunity to congratulate you, Mr. Gurirab, on your\nassumption of the office of President of this body. My\nGovernment hails the selection of a distinguished leader\nfrom a new developing nation to lead the General Assembly\ninto the new millennium. We are also confident that you\nwill live up to the high standards of your esteemed\npredecessor, Mr. Opertti.\nIt is with pride that I congratulate and extend a\nwelcome to our Pacific island neighbours \u2014 the Republic\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the great Kingdom\nof Tonga \u2014 on their admission into the United Nations\nfamily. This represents a large contribution from our region\nto the attainment of a key goal of the United Nations\nsystem, that of universality.\nI want to extend the sincere condolences of the people\nof the Federated States of Micronesia for the earthquakes\nin Turkey, Greece and, more recently, in Taiwan.\nWe are saddened by the violence in East Timor as its\npeople seek to exercise their right to self-determination.\nWe also feel deep sympathy for the innocent\nfamilies in Russia, exposed to merciless bomb attacks,\nand for those people in all regions of the world who are\nsuffering today from violence, terrorism and violations of\nhuman rights.\nCondolences are also in order on the recent death of\nHis Majesty Hassan II of Morocco. His strong personal\ncontributions to the process of achieving peace in the\nMiddle East will be remembered.\nAs Chairman of the South Pacific Forum, I am\nprivileged to deliver the following remarks on behalf of\nits 16 member countries.\nThe South Pacific Forum is a unique organization\ncentred on the Heads of Government of 16 Pacific nations\nwhich share a very special part of the world: the vast\nexpanses of ocean and islands in the central and western\nPacific, both north and south of the Equator. Forum\nmember countries vary greatly in land area, ocean area,\npopulation, resource endowment, economic development,\nsocial structures, language and culture. However, we all\nshare a common bond as Forum members and have\nestablished consensus positions, which transcend our\ndiversity, on a wide range of issues. We have also agreed\nto work together in pursuit of regional stability and\ntowards the well-being of our people. Fourteen of these\nForum members are small island developing States. Much\nwork has been done to assist these smaller members in\ntheir pursuit of sustainable development. Such initiatives\nare reflected in proposals by the Forum\u2019s Ministers of\neconomics, for extensive economic reforms. Recently,\nForum trade Ministers made ground-breaking\nrecommendations on trade initiatives which include the\nestablishment of a Pacific free trade area consistent with\nthe rules and standards of the World Trade Organization.\nThese recommendations will be considered by the Forum\nheads of Government at their annual meeting in Palau\nnext month.\nPast practice has been for the formal statement from\neach annual meeting, known as the Forum Communiqu\u00e9,\nto be offered for inclusion as a document of the General\nAssembly. As the meeting this year will take place after\nthe conclusion of the general debate, a request for\ninclusion of the Forum Communiqu\u00e9 from the Palau\nmeeting will be made at a later date.\nLast year, at their meeting in Pohnpei, Federated\nStates of Micronesia, all 16 Forum leaders reaffirmed\ntheir endorsement of the Barbados Programme of Action\n14\n\n\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States. The leaders saw the Programme of\nAction as a comprehensive framework with great potential\nfor the region, and commended implementation efforts\nalready under way at the national and regional levels.\nIn this regard, Forum leaders strongly supported the\nGeneral Assembly initiative to hold, next week, the special\nsession to review progress under the Barbados Programme\nof Action. Forum countries have maintained close\ninvolvement with the preparatory process for the special\nsession, and appreciate the strong focus on the concerns of\nsmall island developing States in the work of United\nNations bodies such as the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment. We look forward to outcomes from the\nspecial session that will bring a new and stronger focus on\nour needs in the pursuit of sustainable development, and\nstep up the pace of measures to implement the Barbados\nProgramme of Action.\nThe common need for accelerated and sustainable\neconomic development remains a major focus among the\nForum member countries; in fact, the Forum itself has for\nsome time been implementing what is known as the Forum\nEconomic Action Plan. The Plan attempts to address\nregional concerns, which are echoed in the Barbados\nProgramme of Action. Forum members feel that the\nadvancement of this collective, regional Plan is a\nconstructive response to the mandate for regional action\nexpressed in the Barbados Programme.\nIn the context of overall economic development\nplanning and assistance and of social and ecological\nconcerns, Forum members continue to maintain a keen\ninterest in having the United Nations adopt a vulnerability\nindex. The existing criteria for determining eligibility for\nconcessional aid and trade treatment and for critical\nclassifications such as least developed country status are\npurely macroeconomic, without any consideration of the\nenvironmental and natural risks we face, as a region, on\na daily basis. Regional work has already begun under the\nSouth Pacific Geoscience Commission on developing an\nenvironmental vulnerability index. Only by encompassing\nsocial and environmental factors within its assessments\nwill the international community be able to achieve equity\nwhen addressing the special circumstances and needs of\nsmall island developing countries. We appreciate the\ncontinuing discussion of this matter by the Commission\non Sustainable Development, including at its most recent\nsession, and call for tangible action by the year 2000.\nIn last year\u2019s general debate, the Forum expressed\nrenewed hopes for the United Nations process to combat\nanthropogenic global warming, sea-level rise and other\nadverse effects of global climate change. We took a\nmeasure of pride that our group, which includes both\nAnnex I and developing countries, found common ground\nat the political level to call for effective action, despite\nthe widely differing circumstances of member States. It\nseemed that with the successful negotiation of the Kyoto\nProtocol, the world\u2019s nations had finally recognized the\nneed to begin taking action, on the basis of legally\nbinding commitments, to achieve specified targets and\ntimetables. Forum members were also relieved by the\nrecognition that small island developing States have\nparticular needs for assistance with adapting to the effects\nof climate change. We welcomed the formulation of\nspecific tools, such as the Clean Development\nMechanism, which promise to be useful in enabling island\ncountries to do their part in combating combat climate\nchange, within the framework and parameters of our own\nnational circumstances.\nThere is of course no time to be lost. People\neverywhere are experiencing the sometimes disastrous\neffects of climate change. From record-setting droughts to\nkiller floods, hurricanes and typhoons, the effects of sea-\nlevel rise are already taking a toll on small island States.\nUnfortunately, even as scientific evidence of climate\nchange has become impossible to ignore, the parties to\nthe Convention have yet to go very far towards getting\nthe Kyoto process under way. The political will of the\nGovernments of the parties simply does not match the\ntechnical dedication of delegates to pursuing solutions at\nthe numerous meetings that are taking place on this\nsubject.\n15\n\n\nAfter attending the Conference of the Parties to the\nConvention last year in Buenos Aires, I came away with\nthe impression that without a real sense of urgency the\nConvention might choke on its own complexity, to the\ndelight of the minority that opposes it. Unless all countries\nalign themselves with the Convention\u2019s purposes and take\nurgent collective action, we could find ourselves here at the\nseventy-fifth session of the General Assembly, without\nbeing any closer to meaningful implementation of the\nConvention. By that time, leaders would be expressing\nregret over a steadily growing list of climate-related\ndisasters and watching the pile of sandbags along the FDR\nDrive outside as the tidal surges along the East River grow\nstronger. By that time, of course, most island nations in the\nForum would have disappeared and we would have failed\nutterly. Discussing emission reductions would be a hollow\ngesture by then.\nEven though our spirits are bolstered by the\nencouragement of our annex I Forum partners Australia and\nNew Zealand, the 14 Forum small island States grow weary\nof calling attention to our special vulnerability to climate\nchange and to our status on the front line of potential\nworldwide catastrophe. I would sincerely hope that by now\na great majority of people, not only in the United Nations\nsystem but from all across the globe, have a strong mental\npicture of the helpless situation of low-lying islands and\ncoastlines in the face of rising seas. We are very grateful\nfor the considerable extent to which our pleas have been\ntaken into account, but while we may flatter ourselves that\nwe have served, in a way, as a voice of conscience for the\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, we wish also\nto make positive contributions to its implementation.\nThus, the emphasis of all Forum members now is to\nassure that we do our part to participate in and to advance\nthe considerable amount of work that must be done. The\nSouth Pacific Regional Environmental Programme\ncontinues to serve our governments as a useful focal point\nand to provide valuable expertise. Forum countries have\nlong been active in working to understand the potential of\nthe Clean Development Mechanism for the region. The\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands recently hosted an\nimportant workshop on the Clean Development Mechanism\nthat was attended by more than 40 countries, and in June,\nAustralia and the Forum secretariat hosted a workshop in\nNadi.\nWe are severely hampered, however, by the shortage\nof personnel and financial resources to maintain continuous\nparticipation in the host of ongoing activities. The United\nNations and bilateral donors have been very generous in\nsupporting our attendance at conferences, but the time\ndemands on our short-staffed officials at home and abroad\ncan be overwhelming, considering other growing concerns\nsuch as biodiversity, the oceans and coral reefs.\nI know that this problem is by no means unique to\nForum island countries, nor even to small developing\ncountries as a group. But for us, as well as for many\nothers, we ask that these limitations should not be\ndisregarded by larger countries and organizations in the\nmanagement of the international agenda. Once again, we\nexpress sincere appreciation for the support of donors that\nhave made our participation possible. In addition, we\nwould emphasize the importance of applying a\ncoordinated approach to scheduling in order to facilitate\nthe participation of small delegations that would not wish\nto be marginalized by overlapping meetings on topics of\ncritical concern to us.\nFinally, another topic of concern for the Forum at\nthe next annual meeting will be the continuing shipment\nby industrialized Powers of plutonium and radioactive\nwastes through our region. Forum nations have\nconsistently expressed their concerns on this issue,\nespecially about liability and compensation arrangements\nin the event of an accident. From 16 to 17 September this\nyear, discussions took place in Suva between the legal\nexperts of the Forum countries and the representatives of\nFrance, Japan and the United Kingdom concerning trans-\nshipments of nuclear materials through the region. This\nmeeting was arranged by the Forum secretariat, in line\nwith the 1998 Forum Communiqu\u00e9. We are encouraged\nby this development and strongly urge the representatives\nof the three shipping States to demonstrate their readiness\nto explore innovative ways to address the concerns of\nForum members: there is more at stake than the well-\nbeing and comfort of the larger populations in the North.\nPutting this disregard for the sovereign interests of\nForum countries to one side for a moment, the Pacific\nOcean is a vital breadbasket for the entire planet: any\naccident will have serious and adverse implications far\nbeyond our shores for generations to come.\nForum countries have derived some encouragement\nfrom the decision by France, Japan and the United\nKingdom to consult with Forum members regarding\nsafety and compensation arrangements for the most recent\nshipment of mixed oxide fuel from Europe to Japan. We\nare further encouraged by the decision of the three\nshipping States to provide information on the shipping\nroutes of the two ships carrying the fuel, consistent with\n16\n\n\nthe rigorous safety and security obligations with which they\nmust comply under the international conventions governing\ntransport of nuclear materials, including the Convention on\nthe Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials.\nWe, the Forum countries, earnestly hope to make\nsome inroads, not only in the immediate situation but, more\nimportantly, in the long run, into the ethical consciences of\nthe developed nations. Since time immemorial they have\nregarded our region as a convenient area for any kind of\ndangerous or undesirable activity that serves their interests\nat home. With the welcome admission to this body of three\nmore of our number, we are now numerous enough in this\nforum to assert forcefully that we wish no further invasion\nto place our peoples at risk, irrespective of the reasons\nothers may have for choosing to disregard our concerns.\nI have by no means touched on every topic of concern\nthat is to be discussed at the next Forum meeting.\nFollowing that meeting, as I stated earlier, the complete\nCommuniqu\u00e9 will be submitted to this body, and I\ncommend it to all delegations.\nThe views I have expressed on behalf of the South\nPacific Forum are, of course, fully embraced by my\ncountry, the Federated States of Micronesia. I would like\nnow to address other issues, speaking only for my own\nsmall island developing State.\nSince 1991, when the Federated States of Micronesia\nwas admitted to membership in this body, we have\nexperienced \u2014 from the viewpoint of a developing country\nand particularly as a small island developing State \u2014 a\ntruly unique decade in multilateral relations. We emerged\non the international scene just in time to become a part of\nthe movement that radically changed previous notions about\ndevelopment, namely the Rio process. The timing could not\nhave been better for us. Just as we took up the task of\nformulating our own agenda for the future of our island\nnation, the world as a whole came to recognize that the\nissues of environment and development are not opposed\nbut, rather, are intertwined. We thus incorporated into our\ndevelopment planning from the outset a mandate not just\nfor development, but for sustainable development.\nWe feel fortunate in this regard and in how the\nprinciple of sustainability is fully integral to our activities,\nfor, while we are deeply appreciative of the concerns that\nother nations have shown for the difficulties faced by small\nisland States like ourselves, and while we remain anxious\nfor the further implementation of the Barbados Programme\nof Action, we realize that the action referred to must be,\nfirst and foremost, our own. We ourselves must be very\nserious not only in recognizing our special development\nobstacles but in instituting and carrying out programmes\nto overcome them in a sustainable way. And this must be\ndone, not as a temporary, short-term or even medium-\nterm proposition, but as a way of life for generations to\ncome.\nNo amount of outside assistance can provide\nsustainable development. As small-island countries, we\nmust individually and collectively commit ourselves to\nstaying the course once we have seen it and possess the\nmeans to navigate it. Without that commitment, our sails\nwill never fill and we will remain adrift on a journey that\ncan only come to a sad end.\nAs a new member of the international community,\nwe have been faced with the need to rapidly become\nfamiliar with the dynamics of multilateral interaction\nwithin the United Nations system while at the same time\ntrying to acquire a practical working knowledge of the\nvarious simultaneous processes. But there is no\napprenticeship here at the United Nations.\nFrom the outset, it has been our full responsibility to\nparticipate, on a basis of equality, in the ongoing work of\nnumerous bodies directly integral to the United Nations or\nrelated to it. It has been, and continues to be, a\ndemanding experience, but inasmuch as we have learned\nabout others, we are also learning more about ourselves\nand moving towards greater maturity as a nation.\nWe have also developed a deep appreciation for the\noften unheralded but vital work of translating global\nproblems into solutions that is pursued faithfully by the\nthousands of administrative and diplomatic members of\nthe United Nations family. It is difficult to conceive of a\nfuture in which the nations of our ever-shrinking planet\nwill not have a forum such as this \u2014 the United Nations.\nYet one cannot help but be uneasy on hearing\nwhispers of discouragement as the United Nations is\nchallenged by issues that seem to grow in number and\ncomplexity. We sometimes hear that perhaps the\nOrganization has outlived its usefulness and has\ninadequate capacity to deal with global crises in the areas\nof security, social justice and the environment. Some are\nsaid to feel that other, more sharply focused bodies would\nbe better suited to dealing with the anticipated crises of\nthe new millennium.\n17\n\n\nWithout question, the effective responsiveness of this\nOrganization is constantly being challenged. But this is not\na sign of failure, nor of a lack of capacity. Neither does it\nsuggest that we need another instrument. It is, rather, an\nindication of the growing interconnectedness of the global\ncommunity, and of the growing inclination among nations\nto find and recognize their common interests and to work\ntogether to advance global peace and harmony.\nIn order to maintain and improve the responsiveness\nof the United Nations in a world of increasing demands and\nchallenges, it is necessary that we continually evolve and\nadapt effectively in our pursuit of the ideals of the Charter\nof this Organization. Only in this way can we keep the\nOrganization on a positive course and faithfully translate\nthe mandates of the Charter into terms of continuing\nrelevance. This is the attitude with which we must approach\nreform. It is not a consequence of inadequacy, which the\nword \u201creform\u201d may suggest, but, rather, it is a positive and\nevolutionary process.\nThis is easily said, but, as we all know, it is very\ndifficult to put into practice. Even so, we must not allow\nthat high degree of difficulty to plunge us into frustration\nand defeat. The great achievements of those who have\ncome before us in the last 54 years must be honoured by\nour unshakable determination to take the United Nations\nseriously into the next millennium as the single most\neffective multilateral instrument for the betterment of\nhumankind.\nIf the United Nations is to maintain and even improve\nits capacity to deal with major issues and improve the lot\nof disadvantaged peoples, I respectfully suggest that there\nis a need for broader incorporation of developing countries\nin the decision-making process. More and more, it seems,\na relatively small group of developed countries are seen on\nthe front lines here and in other related international bodies.\nThere is a perception that, despite the formal application of\nthe rules, the substantive participation of developing\ncountries in dealing with world problems is in reality\nwaning rather than increasing. This does not bode well for\nthe future of international relations. As the trend towards\nglobalization continues to strengthen, this body as a whole\nwill need to be more involved in making important\ndecisions \u2014 not a permanent 5, not a G-7, but a \u201cG-188\u201d.\nProbably the single most urgently needed reform is the\nenlargement of the Security Council. Naturally, such an\nimportant step must not be taken in haste, but by this time\nwe should be closer to finding an acceptable formulation.\nThe plain fact is that the openness of the most powerful\nnations to accept rational and realistic change in the\nSecurity Council is a key indicator of the future of global\nmultilateral relations in general, and of this Organization\nin particular. The impact of success with this issue would\nbe felt in positive ways throughout the United Nations\nOrganization, and it would stimulate renewed confidence\nin the Charter. That result alone is badly needed and\nshould itself inspire greater effort to overcome the\ndifficulties ahead.\nIt would be unrealistic to ignore the inevitability of\nthe fact that larger, more powerful nations will most often\ntake the lead in the United Nations. In fact, they should\ndo so as a matter of responsibility; they possess the\nresources and the capacity. However, leadership should\nnot become domination, and it should not leave the\ndeveloping world marginalized. I therefore emphasize the\nneed for a restructured Security Council. I also visualize\na General Assembly that remains in the forefront of\nglobal decision-making, for real outcomes on real issues.\nBeing from a Pacific island nation, I naturally have\nparticular concerns about our region. Without demeaning\nin any way the considerable attention that we do receive,\nI must say that the Pacific islands region often takes a\nback seat in the councils of the greater Powers, which are\nprone to include only the Pacific rim countries among\ntheir primary concerns. This can be understood, given our\nsmall populations and land masses, which only underscore\nour remoteness in the vast Pacific Ocean.\nBut it should not be forgotten that we Pacific\nislanders are custodians of some of the world's greatest\nuntapped wealth. In the coming millennium, our region is\ncertain to play a greater role than ever before in meeting\nthe needs of the rest of the world for food and mineral\nresources. If these resources are to be conserved in the\nproper way and harvested in a sustainable manner, the\npeoples of the Pacific islands must be dealt with fairly,\nand on a basis of partnership with the developed world.\nAnd the time to start is now.\nThe growing global involvement with and reliance\nupon the tremendous resource base in our region must\nrest on a foundation of regional security. Nowhere is\nthere a better example of the need for comprehensive\nsecurity in the modern sense, extending beyond military\nconsiderations and also including economic, social and\nenvironmental security.\nThis leads me to the present need for proper\nstewardship of the oceans and seas throughout the world.\n18\n\n\nThis subject was recently discussed in depth by the\nCommission on Sustainable Development, and it is on our\nagenda at this session. I want to emphasize that the\nFederated States of Micronesia solidly supports the\npositions expressed by the Alliance of Small Island States\non this subject. We believe that oceans and seas present a\nspecial, even crucial, case for international cooperation and\ncoordination, and that the General Assembly is the\nappropriate body to provide this oversight. Indeed, it was\nmandated to do so by Agenda 21.\nFurthermore, the United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea provides the framework for action in this\narea. We thus have existing structures; there is no need to\ncreate new institutions. We believe that the size of the task\nwill require continuing effort on an annual basis, so that an\nongoing working-group format within the context of\npreparations for each annual General Assembly will be\nmore rewarding than a large, one-time conference. Above\nall, the process must seek the widest possible input,\ndrawing upon expertise at the regional level, and providing\nassistance to ensure the participation of developing\ncountries, especially small island States.\nIn these brief moments it is not possible to express all\nour views on all the matters we deem important. Of\nnecessity, therefore, I must leave much to the work of our\nrepresentatives in the Committees here and in other United\nNations organs throughout the year.\nI wish, however, to plead with this body for a\nuniversal awakening to the single most important reality of\nour lives today. This reality is that all our interests become\nmore closely linked with each passing generation. We are\nall responsible for turning back the consequences of our\npast selfish behaviour. The destruction of war, the improper\nstewardship of our natural resources and the pollution of\nour living space are looming global disasters. Combined,\nthey will overwhelm the Earth's population unless we find\ncommon ground and take action.\nThat common ground exists. It exists here. It does not\nask us to surrender our nationhood or our cultures. It is the\nCharter of the United Nations, a visionary document that\nhas guided our troubled world through the faltering steps of\nincreasing multilateral awareness, and today provides a\nformat for our very survival. God grant that we will have\nthe political will to sustain it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the session of the\nGeneral Assembly over which you are presiding marks the\nlast to be held this century. We are about to turn a new leaf\nin history. It is, therefore, a time for reflection, a time to\nreap our lessons and draw our conclusions. It is also a time\nto reorganize our goals, priorities and our agenda for the\nnext century.\nTherefore, there is a recurrent theme throughout this\nsession. We all try to assess what we have achieved and\nwhere we have failed in the twentieth century. As we look\nback on our performance, we observe that within every\nsuccess story, we also somehow had our failures.\nThe twentieth century has witnessed unprecedented\nscientific progress. These achievements, however, were not\nused solely to advance the human cause and to improve the\nquality of life. To a very large extent, these scientific and\ntechnological innovations were also used as instruments for\nthe destruction of life. Throughout the century, there was an\nenormous accumulation of wealth. But the vast majority of\nthe world's population is deprived of this wealth. Poverty,\nand sometimes even hunger, is still their fate.\nThis century has produced great intellectual\nachievements and depth. But it has also been the stage of\ndistorted ideologies which produced tyrannies and\nsometimes encouraged practices like ethnic cleansing. In\nother words, while the twentieth century created technology\nand generated material and intellectual wealth, it could not\norganize the means to put them totally to the service of\nhumanity as a whole. This is our failure. This is the\nchallenge we face. This is what we must overcome.\nThe global issues we face, whether political,\neconomic, social or environmental, will from now on\nrequire further intensification of our concerted efforts. As\nthe primary forum for international cooperation, the\nUnited Nations will continue to be the focal point of our\ncollective endeavours.\nThe wealth of experience accumulated by the United\nNations, together with the plans of action devised to\naddress the challenges we face, must now be put to more\neffective use. The millennium summit next year should\nprovide the guidance needed to place our assets to work\nmore efficiently in the twenty-first century.\nA little over a month ago, one of the deadliest\nearthquakes of the century struck the northwest of\nTurkey. This is the most populous region of my country.\nThe devastating quake claimed more than 15,000 lives,\nand thrice as many were wounded. It left about half a\nmillion people homeless. We have, undoubtedly, derived\ngreat fortitude from the exemplary display of solidarity\nand the swift response of the international community.\nThe best qualities of human nature were at work: sharing\nthe other's agony and lending a hand to help heal and to\nreconstruct.\nI would like to convey the gratitude of the\nGovernment and the people of Turkey to all Members,\nthe international community, the United Nations system,\nalong with the numerous volunteers and individuals who\nstood with us at our most trying hour.\nWe express our deep feelings of sympathy for and\nsolidarity with those affected by the earthquake near\nTaipei. In the face of the recent wave of earthquakes, we\nbelieve this Organization can take a further step with\nregard to natural disasters. This would be in keeping with\nthe greater role of the United Nations in our lives. That\nis why my country, together with our neighbour Greece,\nwhich also suffered a similar calamity recently, is\nintroducing a draft resolution to the General Assembly.\nThis was eloquently announced by my Greek counterpart,\nGeorge Papandreou, yesterday in the General Assembly.\nWe hope that it will receive Members' support.\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, Turkey looks\nforward to enhancing its contribution to international\npeace and stability. At the epicentre of Eurasia, it aspires\nto broaden the scope of cooperation and prosperity, while\nit continues in its traditional role of connecting continents\nand civilizations.\n37\n\n\nMore specifically, Turkey is actively involved in the\nefforts to secure peace and stability in the Balkans, the\nMiddle East, the southern Caucasus region and Central\nAsia. We also partake in their democratic and economic\ndevelopment efforts. Turkey enjoys the vast potential of\nhistorical and cultural affinities with many of the countries\nin the Caucasus region and Central Asia. We will work for\nthe resolution of the various conflicts in the region and\ncontinue to foster ever closer relations with all of them.\nCooperation can rapidly lead the peoples of this region\nto higher levels of wealth and prosperity. Central Asia will\ncertainly witness tremendous economic development, given\nits rich human and natural resources. Turkey, lying at the\nhub, will become an energy terminal, connecting in more\nways than one, the wealth and resources of Eurasia. We see\nthe mega-projects of the next century realized in our\ncountry and our region.\nWe are committed to the vision of a peaceful,\ndemocratic, and prosperous future in south-eastern Europe.\nWe will continue to bring forth our resources and\ncontributions to that end. The need for a large-scale and\nlong-term stabilization and reconstruction programme for\nthe entire region, and more urgently for Kosovo, is evident.\nWe therefore welcome the stability pact for South-Eastern\nEurope. In this context, it is important that the agreements\nand arrangements on Kosovo are fully implemented, along\nwith the continuation of support and assistance to Albania\nand Macedonia.\nAs the wounds of the Bosnian tragedy are yet to be\nhealed, the provisions of the Dayton Peace Agreement must\nbe strictly observed and implemented.\nThe tragedies in the Balkans have taught us to be\nabsolutely cautious and balanced in addressing conflict,\nwhether ethnic or otherwise. We do not have the luxury of\nacting upon selective memory or one-sided preferences. We\ncannot afford to impose solutions that do not correspond to\nthe realities and to the aspirations of the peoples concerned.\nA case in point is Cyprus. Until 1974 the Turkish\nCypriots suffered a great deal in protecting their legitimate\nrights and interests. There can be no return to those dark\ndays. A just and lasting compromise in Cyprus today can\nonly be based upon the existing realities. There are two\nseparate peoples, two separate States in Cyprus. These two\nStates should be able to solve their differences through their\nown free will. In the meantime, there could be steps to\nimprove the atmosphere between the two sides by lifting\nthe unjust embargo on the Turkish Cypriots and by also\nadopting deconfrontational measures, as proposed by the\nUnited Nations Secretary-General.\nOn our part, we believe that the confederation\nproposal provides the basis for a realistic and viable\nsettlement in Cyprus.\nWe are encouraged by the recent developments in\nthe Middle East peace process. Once mutual tolerance and\nunderstanding start to fully reign over this region, we\nbelieve all nations will display fully their historic\neconomic capabilities and their wisdom. My country will\ncontinue to actively support the aim of reaching lasting\npeace and security in the Middle East.\nFollowing an exchange of letters with my Greek\ncounterpart, George Papandreou, about three months ago,\nour two countries, Turkey and Greece, initiated joint\ncommittees to work on specific issues. Since then high-\nranking officials of the Foreign Ministries held two\nrounds of meetings and explored the possibilities of\npromoting cooperation. Committees were mandated in the\nfields of tourism, environment, trade, culture, regional\ncooperation and the fight against organized crime, illegal\nimmigration, drug trafficking and terrorism.\nBoth sides are agreed that there is scope for further\ncooperation in these fields and identified specific projects\nto this end. Turkey has the will to carry this process to\nother spheres of our relationship. Following the\nearthquakes that struck the two countries, the emotions\nand solidarity displayed by the Turkish and Greek peoples\ndemonstrate that the two peoples will not accept\nconfrontation and tension as a way of life, and that they\nprefer friendship. This powerful message of our peoples\nwill help our Governments to move forward with greater\nconfidence.\nTurkey will this year host the last summit of the\ncentury. The Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE) summit to be held in Istanbul in\nNovember will set the stage for important decisions. The\noutcome will play a significant role in shaping the future\nsecurity and cooperation architecture in the Eurasian\nlandscape.\nOur political resolve to promote peace and stability\nover such a wide horizon is on record. Given the\nopportunity, we are prepared to take upon ourselves even\ngreater responsibilities.\n38\n\n\nTurkey has presented its candidature for membership\non the United Nations Security Council for 2001-2002. We\nwant to contribute to the making of the next millennium as\na member of the Council. We ask for Members' support.\nThe compelling lesson to be drawn from the twentieth\ncentury is that our highest priority should be the protection\nof the dignity of humankind and the enhancement of the\nquality of life. Whether it is to halt aggression, to stop\ncrimes against humanity, to purge societies of racist and\nxenophobic tendencies, of cultural and religious intolerance,\nto combat international terrorism, to provide humanitarian\nassistance, to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor\nor to secure sustainable economic and social development,\nwe should act as an international coalition \u2014 that is, as the\nUnited Nations.\nLet us make the twenty-first century the new age of\nnations united for a more humane and prosperous era for\nall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to extend\nmy heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\n12\n\n\nForeign Minister of the Republic of Namibia, on his\nassumption of the office of President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. I would also like to pay\nmy respects to Mr. Didier Opertti Bad\u00e1n, Foreign Minister\nof Uruguay, for all his efforts during his tenure as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. It is also\nmy great pleasure to welcome the admission of the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga as new Members of the United Nations.\nPermit me on this occasion to extend my heartfelt\ncondolences and sympathy to the people of the Republic of\nTurkey and the people of Greece, who have suffered greatly\nas a result of the recent earthquakes in those countries. I\nalso express my deep concern regarding the grave damage\ncaused by the earthquake that occurred in Taiwan early in\nthe morning of 21 September, and extend my heartfelt\ncondolences and sympathy to those who have suffered from\nthe disaster.\nThis is the last session of the General Assembly\nbefore the Millennium Assembly is convened next year.\nDuring the one-year period to come, we must identify the\nissues, such as conflicts and poverty, which the\ninternational community will face in the twenty-first century\nand find an answer to what role the United Nations should\nplay in addressing these issues.\nSince its founding in 1945, the United Nations has\nbeen dealing with issues of world peace and security, as\nwell as economic and social issues, including development.\nIn the area of peace and security, during the cold-war era,\nthe ability of the Security Council to cope with conflicts\nwas severely restricted. Even under such circumstances,\nhowever, the United Nations made creative efforts, such as\npeacekeeping operations, and achieved certain results in the\nMiddle East and elsewhere. Since the end of the cold war,\nthe number of peacekeeping operations that has been\ndispatched has increased dramatically, and their mandates\nhave become diversified. Their activities bore fruit, for\nexample, in Cambodia and Mozambique.\nRegarding the issues of refugees and displaced persons\ncreated by conflicts, the humanitarian assistance activities\nof the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) and others are highly appreciated. In\nthe economic and social area, the United Nations, along\nwith its specialized agencies, has raised issues, set standards\nand implemented those standards in every field, including\ndevelopment, the environment, human rights, science and\nculture. In the area of development, in addition to efforts\nundertaken through its programmes and funds, including the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United\nNations has achieved certain results in coordinating the\nassistance activities of the international community. The\nUnited Nations has, furthermore, played a decisive role in\nassessing the public opinion of global society. We should\nhold in high regard such efforts of the United Nations.\nFully recognizing the significance of the\nOrganization, the people of Japan regarded their country\u2019s\nadmission to membership of the United Nations as their\ncountry\u2019s reinstatement in international society after the\nSecond World War. They have been supporting and\ncontributing to the activities of the United Nations ever\nsince.\nThere is, however, still much to be done by the\nUnited Nations in such areas as the prevention and\nresolution of conflicts and poverty alleviation. It is also\nimportant to have fresh viewpoints, including that of\nhuman security, in addressing such new issues as those\nrelating to globalization and other global matters. These\nare the issues we will be passing along to the twenty-first\ncentury.\nOne of the most important issues that the United\nNations must continue to address is conflict. In Africa,\nconflicts continue in many regions. Although peace has\nbeen restored in Kosovo, the conflict there left deep scars\non local communities in the region and on the hearts of\nthe people, demonstrating once again the importance of\nconflict prevention. Furthermore, numerous challenges\nexist on the path towards future reconstruction. There are\npersistent tensions in Asia. While various conflicts have\nbeen resolved in Latin America, there is still work to be\ndone to achieve stable post-conflict development,\nincluding the development of and the clearing of\nlandmines in the border region between Peru and\nEcuador, who reached a peace agreement on their border\ndispute last year.\nRegarding the efforts to deal with conflicts, I would\nlike to emphasize the following three points. First, it is\nimportant to take a comprehensive approach, which\nincludes conflict prevention and resolution, peacekeeping\nand peace-building, and the elimination of potential\ncauses of conflict, such as poverty. Secondly, it is\nnecessary to deal with conflicts in a manner that is\nsuitable to the situation in each region. These two points\nwere also made in the report of the Secretary-General\nentitled \u201cThe causes of conflict and the promotion of\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa\u201d\n(A/52/871), which was issued last year. Thirdly, as\n13\n\n\nregards peace-building, it is necessary that international\nassistance, from post-conflict emergency humanitarian\nassistance to long-term development aid, be implemented\nseamlessly. In addition to these efforts, it has become\nimportant to ensure the security of personnel who are\nengaged in humanitarian or development assistance\nactivities.\nIn Africa, the United Nations is cooperating in efforts\nto bring peace in situations of conflict, such as in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone, and\nin the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Japan\nwill consider extending assistance to the efforts of the\nUnited Nations as well as to the reconstruction efforts of\nthe countries concerned. We think that efforts to tackle\npoverty in Africa also contribute to the prevention of\nconflicts in the region.\nWith regard to Kosovo, Japan has provided the United\nNations Mission in Kosovo with personnel and is actively\nextending financial support in such areas as humanitarian\nand reconstruction assistance. It recently dispatched a study\nmission to explore possible concrete assistance projects.\nTurning our attention to Asia, we hope that security in\nEast Timor will be restored at the earliest possible date,\nthrough the activities of the multinational force working in\ncoordination with the Government of Indonesia and with\nthe Indonesian armed forces. This force is now starting to\nbe deployed on the basis of the Security Council resolution\nadopted on 15 September.\nJapan has already announced that it will extend a\nsubstantial financial contribution to the multinational force.\nIt is making this contribution with the intention of\nfacilitating the participation of developing countries in the\neffort. Japan will decide the amount of its contribution after\nthe whole picture of the multinational force becomes clear.\nThe situation of refugees and displaced persons in and\noutside East Timor causes serious concern. Japan has\nannounced the contribution of a total of $2 million to the\nactivities of UNHCR and the World Food Programme. In\naddition, it intends to positively consider further assistance\nafter taking into consideration a report from the\nGovernment mission now in the region, along with other\nfactors. Furthermore, Japan, in the medium and long term,\nalso intends to provide appropriate assistance for the\nreconstruction and development of East Timor.\nAs regards conflict prevention, I wish to commend the\nOrganization of African Unity for already launching efforts\nto establish an early warning system, and, as regards\nAsia, I would like to commend the ministerial meeting of\nthe Regional Forum of the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations for its decision last July to discuss\nconcretely how preventive diplomacy might be dealt with.\nNext, I would like to touch upon three issues that are\ncommonly observed in regions in conflict: small arms,\nanti-personnel landmines, and refugees and displaced\npersons.\nIn its efforts to cope with the small arms issue,\nJapan strongly hopes that the General Assembly will\nadopt a resolution at this session promoting the\nrecommendations of the report of the Secretary-General\ndrafted by the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small\nArms. Japan looks forward to working with other\ncountries for the implementation of those\nrecommendations. Japan will also actively contribute to\nthe successful convening of the international conference\non small arms to be held by the end of 2001.\nOn the issue of anti-personnel landmines, with the\nentry into force last March of the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction, it is now necessary to achieve a universal\nand effective ban on anti-personnel landmines and to clear\nthe mine areas, while extending assistance to mine\nvictims, among whom are many children. Japan has\ncontributed financial assistance of more than $40 million\nto international and non-governmental organizations and\nwill continue to strive to achieve the goal of \u201czero\nvictims\u201d at an early date.\nWith regard to the issue of refugees and displaced\npersons, Japan highly commends the activities of UNHCR\nand others and intends to continue to actively cooperate\nwith them.\nSince the end of the cold war, international efforts\nhave achieved certain results with respect to the\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nincluding nuclear weapons, and their delivery vehicles \u2014\nnamely, missiles \u2014 as well as arms reduction. Yet the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) regime has been challenged by the nuclear testing\nor secret development of weapons of mass destruction\nconducted by some States.\nJapan calls upon the nuclear-weapon and the non-\nnuclear-weapon States alike to take constructive actions\n14\n\n\nto ensure the successful convening of the Review\nConference of the Parties to the NPT next spring. Japan\nalso calls upon the States that have not yet done so to\npromptly sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty so that it can enter into force as soon as\npossible, and appeals to every country to respect the\nmoratorium on nuclear testing. Further, it is also important\nto reactivate the START process and promptly to\ncommence the negotiations on the fissile material cut-off\ntreaty.\nJapan has consistently called for realistic measures for\nnuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Every year since\n1994, it has submitted to the General Assembly a resolution\non nuclear disarmament with a view to the ultimate\nelimination of nuclear weapons. Late last July, the Tokyo\nForum on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament,\nwhich was established at Japan\u2019s initiative, issued its report,\nwhich we believe provides a realistic guideline for progress\nin nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Japan would\nlike to consult actively with other countries with a view to\nimplementing the meaningful recommendations contained\nin the report.\nThe importance of addressing the issue of weapons of\nmass destruction other than nuclear weapons, such as\nbiological and chemical weapons, as well as the issue of\ndelivery vehicles, including missiles, is beyond discussion.\nIn particular, Japan will work towards the early conclusion\nof negotiations on the protocol to the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling\nof Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\nTheir Destruction.\nWith regard to the North Korean missile issue, Japan\nappreciates and welcomes the important progress achieved\nin the recent United States-North Korea talks. Japan\nstrongly hopes that North Korea\u2019s moratorium on missile\nlaunching is further assured.\nPoverty continues to be a serious issue in many\nregions of the world. There is a vicious cycle in which the\nfrequent occurrence of regional conflicts exacerbates the\nproblem of poverty, while poverty in turn causes the\noccurrence and recurrence of regional conflicts. Indeed,\npoverty should be recognized as the primary issue of the\ntwenty-first century, and it is incumbent upon various\nplayers, such as the United Nations, other international\norganizations, States and civil society, to cooperate towards\nits eradication.\nAt the Second Tokyo International Conference on\nAfrican Development, which was co-organized by Japan,\nthe United Nations and others last October, the Tokyo\nAgenda for Action was adopted, which encourages\nAfrican countries to take initiatives on their own; calls for\nthe strengthening of cooperation between African\ncountries and developed countries as well as international\norganizations; and calls for the promotion of cooperation\nbetween Asia and Africa. Japan will remain actively\nengaged with the issue of poverty in Africa through\nfollow-up efforts for the implementation of the Agenda\nfor Action, such as the debt- management seminar which\nJapan co-organized with the United Nations and others\nlast month in Kenya.\nJapan has been the world\u2019s largest donor of official\ndevelopment assistance since 1991. Despite the severity\nof its domestic budgetary situation, it will continue to\nextend effective, efficient and high-quality official\ndevelopment assistance and will tackle poverty problems\nthrough the further promotion of cooperation with the\nrelevant organizations of the United Nations.\nDebt problems are making it extremely difficult for\ndebtor nations, especially the poorest countries, to achieve\ndevelopment. Japan has provided assistance through debt\nrescheduling and grant aid for debt relief, and will take\ncomprehensive measures to deal with the debt problem,\nincluding the steady implementation of the commitment\nmade at the G-8 summit meeting in Cologne.\nImportant conferences, such as special sessions of\nthe General Assembly, are being held successively in the\nareas of economic and social development and human\nrights. The General Assembly\u2019s special session on\npopulation and development was held this June, at which\nmeaningful proposals for future action were adopted. The\nsustainable development of small island developing States,\nwhich are susceptible to the effects of climate change and\nare also geographically vulnerable, is the very important\nsubject of the twenty-second special session to begin on\n27 September. The development of landlocked States,\nwhich are also geographically disadvantaged, is important\nas well.\nThe promotion of the implementation of the\nCopenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action\nadopted at the World Summit for Social Development in\n1995 will be discussed next year at a follow-up special\nsession. The General Assembly special session entitled\n\u201cWomen 2000\u201d will also be held next year in order to\nfurther promote the results of the 1995 Fourth World\n15\n\n\nConference on Women. Building upon the achievements of\nthese special sessions, Japan intends to contribute actively\nto international cooperative endeavours in these areas.\nThis is the final year of the International Decade for\nNatural Disaster Reduction. The international community\nmust take prompt and concerted action in responding to\nlarge-scale natural disasters, as clearly underscored by our\nexperience with the recent earthquakes in Turkey and\nGreece, last year\u2019s hurricanes in Latin America and the\ntsunami in Papua New Guinea. The United Nations is\nrequired to play a more active role in this endeavour.\nMoreover, efforts in the area of natural-disaster reduction\nneed to be strengthened. Recognizing the importance of\nnatural disaster reduction in the context of development\npolicy and environmental issues, Japan will promote efforts\nin this field.\nWith regard to the advancement of globalization, while\ntaking advantage of the new opportunities it provides for\nthe revitalization of the world economy, the improvement\nin living standards, the creation of jobs, and development,\nwe must also address its negative effects, such as the\ngrowing instability in international finance and the widening\ngap between the rich and the poor. Japan is steadily\ncarrying out financial assistance measures totaling\napproximately $80 billion, including the New Miyazawa\nInitiative \u2014 by far the largest package of assistance\nprovided by one country \u2014 for the East Asian countries\nwhich were hard hit by the economic crisis. We strongly\nexpect the economic recovery of the region to resume and\nthat a sound and sustainable development of the world\neconomy will be achieved.\nWe are also concerned that globalization may\naggravate such problems as environmental destruction,\ninternational organized crime, drug, terrorism and the\nspread of infectious diseases. These global issues, which\ntranscend national borders and pose direct threats to each\nand every person, need to be dealt with by the international\ncommunity as a whole. It is necessary that we adopt\npolicies that give consideration to women, children and\nothers, who are most susceptible to the effect of these\nglobal issues.\nAlthough globalization also engenders creativity by\nfacilitating interaction among various cultures and different\nvalue systems, due consideration also needs to be paid to\nthe cultural diversity of the world. From this standpoint, we\nconsider that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization will play an even more important role\nin the coming century.\nJapan has been stressing the importance of\naddressing the various issues I have just mentioned by\nfocusing efforts on human security, that is, the protection\nof the dignity and life of every person against the many\nthreats posed, for example, by poverty; the outflow of\nrefugees; environmental issues; infectious diseases, such\nas AIDS; human rights violations; international organized\ncrime, including human and drug trafficking; conflicts;\nanti-personnel landmines and small arms; and terrorism.\nLast June Japan hosted the International Symposium\non Development, at which the issue of how to encourage\nthe self-reliance of individuals to escape from poverty\nwas discussed. On the initiative of Prime Minister\nObuchi, Japan established the Human Security Fund\nwithin the United Nations to support the activities of\ninternational organizations and to promote human\nsecurity. Japan recently announced its contribution of\n$100 million for reconstruction and assistance for the\nreturn of refugees in Kosovo, and it will implement that\nassistance through the Human Security Fund and other\nsources.\nIt cannot be said that the efforts of the United\nNations to address the issues that will confront the\ninternational community in the twenty-first century are\nsufficient. Nevertheless, it is not right to claim that the\nUnited Nations is incapable of addressing those issues\nadequately, and therefore disregard it. Neither is it right\nto simply deplore any attempt to disregard the\nOrganization. In as much as many issues today require\nefforts of the international community as a whole, and as\nthere is no other universal and comprehensive institution\nthat can replace the United Nations, our only recourse is\nto reform and strengthen the United Nations, so that it\nwill be capable of dealing with the issues adequately.\nFrom this viewpoint, I would like in particular to make\nthe following three points.\nThe first is the need for Security Council reform.\nDuring the 50 or so years since the end of the Second\nWorld War, the international situation has undergone\ndramatic changes. Given those changes, the functions of\nthe Security Council, as the body primarily responsible\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\nneed to be strengthened. Towards that end, it is essential\nthat the Security Council be re-created to reflect the\npresent international situation, with reform of the\ncomposition of both its permanent and non-permanent\nmembership. Japan would like to assume greater\nresponsibilities as a permanent member of the Security\nCouncil.\n16\n\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need for reforms to place\nthe United Nations on a sound financial base. It is\nnecessary for Member States to fulfil their obligation to pay\ntheir assessed contributions, and for the United Nations to\nwork to further control its budget. Despite the severe\neconomic and financial situations, Japan has been faithfully\nfulfilling its obligation to pay its assessed contribution and\nhas been making substantial contributions to the United\nNations and related organizations. However, as the Security\nCouncil reform has not been realized, and as the necessary\nbudgetary reforms have yet to be carried out, one cannot\nbut question the fairness of a situation in which Japan is\nexpected to pay an assessed contribution that exceeds the\nsum of the contributions made by four of the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, not including the United\nStates.\nThird, it is necessary for the United Nations to\nstrengthen its efforts in the economic and social area,\nincluding development. The Organization is expected to\nobtain the active participation of various actors in\naddressing problems in the economic and social area, and\neffectively coordinate their efforts. Japan attaches\nimportance to the role that the United Nations, especially\nthe Economic and Social Council, plays in this area, and is\ndetermined, if it is elected this year, to work as a member\nof the Council towards strengthening the activities of the\nUnited Nations in such areas as the coordination between\nthe United Nations agencies, the promotion of dialogue\nwith Bretton Woods institutions and the broad participation\nby civil society in activities in this area, and coordination\nof these activities.\nWe have already devoted a significant amount of time\nto the discussion of United Nations reform. Today there is\na common recognition throughout the international\ncommunity that the reform of the United Nations is\nnecessary. Indeed, there is not a single country that is\nopposed to reform per se. Nevertheless, progress towards\nreform is far from satisfactory. The amount of time that has\nbeen expended in discussions so far tells of the difficulty\nthat lies in the way of reforming an organization. We must\nrecognize at the very core of our being that if we fail to\nstrengthen the United Nations through reforms, international\ntrust in the Organization will be undermined. This would\nnot only destroy the United Nations, but would be suicidal\nto all the Member States and the international community\nas a whole.\nThe Millennium Assembly and the Millennium\nSummit, scheduled for next year, will provide an occasion\non which the United Nations can demonstrate to the world\nthat it is capable of effectively tackling the issues that the\ninternational community will face in the twenty-first\ncentury. The efforts which Member States make during\nthe one-year period to come could very well determine\nthe viability of the United Nations in the coming century.\nI would like, therefore, to conclude my remarks by calling\nupon all Member States to cooperate with each other in\npursuing the common interests of the international\ncommunity as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I\nwish first of all, on behalf of my delegation, to join other\n\n\n\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-fourth session. The tact and insight you have displayed\nfrom the outset bode well for the success of our work.\nI also pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti,\nwho guided the work of the Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession, and to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his\ntimely report on the work of the Organization and for the\nimportant statement he delivered to the General Assembly.\nOn behalf of my country, I welcome the new\nMembers of the United Nations: the Republic of Kiribati,\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. We\ncongratulate them warmly on joining the great United\nNations family.\nDuring the twentieth century, which is now drawing to\na close, the world has been profoundly affected by many\nstriking events. In the sphere of technology, for example,\nwe have seen great progress leading to the expansion of\ncommunication to the point where the world has become a\nglobal village. The world rejoices at its liberation from\napartheid and from colonialism in nearly all countries.\nHere, my delegation welcomes the endeavours of the\nUnited Nations, including its focus on the solidarity that is\nthe foundation of our Organization, which led to that\nsuccess.\nBut those positive achievements do not mean that all\nhas been perfect in the twentieth century. In fact, a variety\nof disasters and tragedies inflicted on humans by humans\ncontinue to ravage mankind. Despite scientific progress,\nepidemics continue to take human lives by the thousand.\nTwo particularly dreadful world wars devastated the world.\nHateful acts of genocide have been committed.\nIn that connection, my country, Rwanda, had the\nmisfortune in 1994 to be the victim of a genocide that took\nmore than a million lives. Planned and organized by the\ngovernment machinery of the day, that genocide was\ncarried out in full view of the international community,\nwhich was unable to stop it. The people of Rwanda appeals\nto the conscience of the international community never\nagain to permit such a tragedy anywhere in the world. We\nhave every right to expect this.\nAs we express that wish, investigations have been\ncarried out by countries such as Belgium and France, and\nothers, by the Organization of African Unity and the United\nNations, are under way to identify those responsible for the\ngenocide in Rwanda. We want those responsible to be\nsubject to punishment throughout the world.\nFurther, we welcome the General Assembly address\nby President Clinton of the United States, in which he\nreferred to the creation of an international coalition\nagainst genocide, an idea that had been put forward at the\nfiftieth session by His Excellency Mr. Pasteur Bizimungu,\nPresident of the Rwandese Republic.\nIn the wake of the genocide, nearly the entire\npopulation of Rwanda was displaced. Most Rwandese\nwere widows, of whom 34 per cent had become heads of\nhousehold. There were thousands of orphans, most of\nwhom had also become heads of their households. Many\nchildren were involved in these acts of genocide; they\ndeserve to be reeducated in an appropriate setting. My\nGovernment has an ambitious programme to take up the\nchallenge of helping survivors of the genocide coexist\nwith the perpetrators.\nWe are fortunate today that thanks to the vigorous\nmeasures which have been taken and to the support of the\ninternational community, my Government has been able\nto ensure security throughout its territory, bring the\nrefugees home and house them, get the economy back on\ntrack and ensure food security.\nAfter the genocide of 1994, Rwanda found itself\nwith its judicial system completely destroyed and its\nprisons crammed with suspects. The Government\ntherefore began rebuilding the national judicial system\nand collaborated in establishing international judicial\nmachinery to deal with that heinous crime against\nhumanity, genocide.\nI must pay a tribute here to the international\ncommunity, which came to my country\u2019s assistance by\nestablishing the United Nations International Criminal\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). But we must highlight that\nalthough we welcome the establishment of the Tribunal,\nwe regret the slowness of its trial procedures and its\nsometimes secretive way of choosing suspects to try. The\nGovernment of Rwanda states that it is nevertheless\nwilling to collaborate with the Tribunal and to do\neverything possible to speed up its proceedings.\nOne of the difficulties involved in arresting the\ncriminals who committed genocide in Rwanda is that\nwhen the Government that organized the genocide fell, all\nits various acolytes scattered throughout the world.\nFortunately, some of them have been arrested with the\n27\n\n\nassistance of the countries that took them in. We wish to\npay a ringing tribute to the fraternal countries that have\narrested and extradited criminals sought by the Tribunal for\nRwanda. We urge them to continue their cooperation and\ncall on those that have not yet been able to do so to fulfil\nthis obligation to humankind.\nWe note with satisfaction also that in his report\n(S/1999/957) on the protection of civilians in armed\nconflict, the Secretary-General recommends to the Security\nCouncil that it should make full cooperation obligatory\nbetween Member States with the International Criminal\nTribunals for Rwanda and for Yugoslavia. We note also\nthat this recommendation by the Secretary-General is in line\nwith the wishes of the several speakers who have spoken\nup either in the Security Council or here in the Assembly,\nagainst the culture impunity. In this we find hope that there\nwill never again, anywhere in the world, be a genocide.\nI would mention another very important programme by\nmy Government: for national reconciliation and to establish\nthe constitutional rule of law. As part of the programme,\nmy Government has established two commissions: the\nNational Commission for Human Rights and the\nCommission for National Unity and Reconciliation. The\nmission of these two commissions is to promote the\npositive values of mutual respect and national reconciliation\nwhich, along with education in participatory democracy, are\nthe top priorities for the people of Rwanda.\nConcerning the democratization of our institutions, it\nis a pleasure for me to announce from this rostrum that the\ndemocratization process has started, with local elections,\nwhich should ensure, more than before, participation by the\npopulation in managing the business of the State. This\nprocess also has on its agenda the purpose of giving young\npeople and women a greater role in that management.\nThe United Nations has a Charter whose principles\nand purposes serve to guide us towards a world of\nsolidarity, of harmony and security. But there have been\nmany failures despite our common aspirations to peace.\nThis is sufficient proof that the way in which our\nOrganization is functioning betrays its very reason for\nexistence. That is why, during this session, many\ndelegations \u2014 and particularly the current President of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), Mr. Abdelaziz\nBouteflika \u2014 have shown that reform of the United\nNations and, more particularly, of the Security Council is\nboth necessary and urgent. We join those delegations that\nhave already spoken in favour of this long-awaited reform.\nA few moments ago I referred to the great\nachievements of science. Here, I could not fail to mention\nthe concept of globalization. Convinced of the benefits of\ntrade and between peoples, we in Rwanda believe that\nthis new system brings with it new hopes. Nevertheless,\nwe fear that the structural differences between our various\neconomies will require altering the expectations of our\npeoples, whom globalization is supposed to serve. We\ntherefore believe that the effectiveness of globalization\nwill be measured in terms of how it contributes to\nresolving such sensitive questions as the poverty\neradication, the debt burden, and peace and security.\nAnother factor for the success of globalization is the\nestablishment of viable regional economic arrangements\nthrough integration based on cooperation between\ndeveloping countries. We are happy that Africa has\nalready started to move in this direction, whether within\nOAU or the African Economic Community or in\nsubregional organizations. We are very pleased also to\nnote the contribution of the economic organizations in\nAfrica, not only to the development effort but also to\nconflict prevention and resolution.\nIn this connection we applaud the role the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) countries have\nplayed in preventing and resolving conflicts in the\nsubregion. We likewise applaud the regional and bilateral\ninitiatives that have given rise to such great hopes for\npeace, particularly in West Africa, in the Horn of Africa,\nin the Middle East between Israel and Palestine, in East\nTimor and in the Balkan region. We do earnestly request\nthe international community to support these efforts.\nI particularly applaud the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the resolve he has shown in increasing the\nefficiency of the United Nations in the area of peace and\ninternational security. The delegation of Rwanda, for its\npart, contributed to the discussions of the Security\nCouncil on 17 and 30 September this year (S/PV.4046\n(Resumption 1) and S/PV.4049 (Resumption 2)), on\nconflict in Africa. In this respect, my delegation truly\nappreciates the very important contribution of the\nPresident of Zambia, Frederick Chiluba, in Security\nCouncil discussions (S/PV.4047).\nThe Agreement on a ceasefire in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo signed in Lusaka on 10 July 1999\n(S/1999/815) is a commitment by the signatories to\nrespect and participate fully in the peace process. Two\nimportant clauses support this agreement: first, the clause\non inter-Congolese political negotiations towards a new\n28\n\n\npolitical order in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\nand secondly, the clause on pursuing and disarming the\narmed groups, including former Rwandan soldiers and the\nInterahamwe militias who perpetrated the genocide of 1994\nand later became integrated into the army of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The Agreement also\nprovides for various methods by which it is to be put into\neffect, and also contains clauses that will help preserve it in\nboth spirit and letter.\nIn this respect, I recall that subparagraph b of\nparagraph 2 of article 1 of the Agreement requires the\nsignatories parties to cease hostile propaganda; the goal is\nto ensure that the Ceasefire Agreement is respected.\nNevertheless, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Mr. Ndombasi, from\nthis rostrum, violently attacked my country, Rwanda. There\nis no need for me to revisit those outrageous accusations,\nbecause our representative has had the occasion to explain\nour intervention in the crisis in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo. I simply wish to respond to one of his concerns,\nmany times repeated in his statement.\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo several times over asked this\nAssembly to intercede with Rwanda so that Rwanda\nwithdraws from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nBy way of response, I declare before this Assembly\nthat Rwanda welcomes and supports the outcome of the\nAfrican initiative and urges the international community to\ngive its unconditional support to the implementation of the\nterms of this Agreement by all the parties, which must\nrefrain from any violation of the ceasefire. Unfortunately,\nwe are receiving news that the contrary is happening, for\nthose who call for implementation of the ceasefire are the\nfirst to violate it.\nNr. Jusys (Lithuania), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nFor two years already, the Kinshasa Government has\nbeen training, equipping and enrolling in its own army ex-\nofficers of the former Rwandan armed forces who\ncommitted acts of genocide and should be prosecuted.\nFurthermore, these officers, who directed the genocide, are\non the headquarters staff of the army of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. As the representative of Burundi\nhas just said, these armed elements are fomenting insecurity\nand propagating the idea of genocide throughout the region.\nNow that the Lusaka Agreement has been signed by\nall the parties to the conflict, we dare to hope that a United\nNations peacekeeping force will be deployed as soon as\npossible, and that soon peace will reign in our subregion.\nMay this Agreement enjoy the full support of the entire\ninternational community.\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased to have this\nopportunity, the first since my assumption of the presidency\nof Guyana, to share with the Assembly some issues of\ninterest and concern to the Group of 77, which Guyana now\nhas the honour to chair.\nA mere three months remain before mankind enters a\nnew millennium filled with great hopes. Whether those\nhopes are realized will depend largely on the decisions we\ntake, as an organization of united peoples, on how we\ncollectively face the future. This fifty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly therefore represents a crucial turning\npoint where we can follow either the high road to\nenlightened multilateralism or the low road leading to\nnarrow self-interest.\nI am confident that the Assembly will not fail to take\nthe right direction. As the Foreign Minister of Namibia, Mr.\nPresident, you have given long and distinguished service to\nyour country, which, after a bitter struggle against apartheid\nrule, stands as an independent and proud member of the\nfamily of nations. On behalf of the Group of 77, I salute\nNamibia and offer to you personally our warmest\ncongratulations and good wishes for a successful Assembly.\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay,\nwe offer our sincere appreciation for the guidance provided\nto the Assembly over the past year.\nA warm welcome is also extended to the three new\nmembers of the United Nations \u2014 the Republic of Kiribati,\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\nAnd to our Secretary-General I wish to convey our\ngratitude for his sustained stewardship of the Secretariat,\nand more particularly for his report on the Organization's\nwork.\nThe challenges we must address this year are\nformidable. Our world continues to be plagued by a\nmultiplicity of conflicts, both old and new, inter-State and\nintra-State, that have not only imperilled global peace and\nsecurity but also sap our economic and social vitality.\nWhether in Afghanistan, Kosovo, the Middle East or the\nGreat Lakes region of Africa \u2014 to name just a few conflict\nzones \u2014 a heavy toll is being exacted on human life and\ndevelopment. Equally disturbing is the apparent inability\nof the world community to contain this increase in\ntensions and conflicts.\nThe world Organization is continuously challenged\nby the outbreak of internecine strife in one country after\nanother. Without a clear strategy, the United Nations can\ndo no more than muddle through these crises in the hope\nthat the warring factions will eventually see the virtues of\npeace. In these distressing circumstances, it is not only\nthe parties to the conflict that are losers but also the\ninternational community. As a result of the increasing\nclaims for peacemaking and peacekeeping operations,\ndeveloping countries are deprived of much needed\ndevelopment resources and are politically weakened.\nGradually the United Nations must move forward into the\narea of peace-building to obviate recidivism and to\nreconstruct shattered societies. By helping to strengthen\ndemocracy, government institutions and the rule of law,\nas well as rebuilding the foundations for long-term\ndevelopment, the Organization can help post-conflict\nStates to rebuild themselves.\nThe time may have come to revisit the United\nNations Agenda for Peace, as well as its Agenda for\nDevelopment, to see where deficiencies lie and what\ncould be done to remedy them.\nThe time has also come to strengthen the Security\nCouncil, the organ primarily responsible for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, so that it\nmay become more democratic, representative and\ncredible. Of course, the United Nations cannot do what\nthe parties to conflict are not prepared to do. Without a\ntrue commitment to peace by all involved there can be\nscant prospect of any lasting settlement. As we have seen\nfrom recent developments in the Middle East, the parties\ninvolved must show a strong will to resolve the conflict\nthrough peaceful means. Only then can the United\nNations, using the instruments provided by its Charter,\nserve to facilitate negotiations for a satisfactory outcome.\nAccompanying these threats to international security\nand stability are strong economic and social forces which\nimpact negatively on our countries. While globalization\nand trade liberalization have benefited strong economies,\nthey have also exposed weaker States to marginalization\nfrom the world economy. By opening the floodgates of\ntrade and finance, globalization has invariably wrought\nhavoc on small and weak economies, which can do\nprecious little to withstand its impact. Economic and\nsocial misery have followed in its wake, exposing the\n12\n\n\nparticular vulnerabilities of small developing countries,\nmany of which are dependent on a single agricultural crop\n\u2014 like bananas or sugar \u2014 for the livelihood of their\npeoples.\nAt the regional meetings which have been held thus\nfar in preparation for the tenth session of the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD\nX) caution has been sounded against the worst excesses of\ntrade liberalization. Having benefited from the Tokyo and\nUruguay Rounds, the industrialized countries are anxious to\nhold further negotiations \u2014 the mother of all rounds \u2014 for\nfree trade in the next millennium. Theoretically, developing\ncountries can also gain from increased liberalization.\nHowever, since they are for the most part too weak to take\nadvantage of the new opportunities, they run the risk of\ngreater marginalization and, indeed, elimination from the\nmarket place.\nFear of this eventuality is based not on uninformed\nspeculation, but on the harsh reality of experience. Past\nnegotiating rounds have yielded significant concessions to\ndeveloped economies, while offering relatively little to\ndeveloping countries in terms of opening up markets for\ntheir own products. At bottom, the problem is one of an\nimbalance in negotiating strength of its contracting parties,\nresulting in more favourable outcomes for the strongest. Yet\nthe developing countries are being urged to enter into a new\nround of negotiations, the millennium round, the result of\nwhich is likely to be no different from that of the past\nunless its agenda is balanced by issues of concern to the\ndeveloping countries.\nTo be able to enter the global marketplace, developing\ncountries should be assisted in the strengthening of their\nproductive capacities and in widening their access to export\nmarkets. They need to be assured of stabilization in the\ninternational financial and monetary system in order to\navoid the hazards of currency fluctuations. Equally\nimportant, given the vast disparity which exists in the\neconomic capacities of countries, special and differential\ntreatment should be granted to developing countries in\naccordance with the principles outlined in part IV of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the\nGATT legislative clause of 1971.\nSpecial consideration will have to be given to Africa,\nthe least developed countries and structurally weak\neconomies, in particular the small island developing States,\nwhich are seriously disadvantaged in the area of trade. The\nspecial session to review the Programme of Action with\nregard to the sustainable development of small island\ndeveloping States, which will be held here in just a matter\nof days, and the summit of the least developed countries\nscheduled for the year 2001 should serve to generate new\ninitiatives to help these vulnerable States.\nHowever, to benefit from the international trading\nsystem developing countries must receive significant debt\nrelief and the necessary official development assistance to\nboost the overall productive capability. Consequently, in\nthe face of rampant globalization, it is imperative that the\ninternational community should come together to create\na modern development vision and strategy aimed at\nbridging the dangerous division which now separates the\nprosperous from the poor nations. This new approach\nshould be based on an international consensus on\ndevelopment and on the rights and obligations of the\npartners.\nAs the preparations undertaken this year for the\nreview of the summits held in Beijing, Cairo and\nCopenhagen have shown, there is an increasing number\nof people, the majority of them women and children,\nliving under adverse conditions caused by poverty.\nDespite great strides in the fields of health and education\nin the developed world, many developing countries\ncontinue to be plagued by unequal and inadequate access\nto education and health care, high infant and maternal\nmortality, as well as lack of access to safe drinking water\nand proper sanitation. Indeed, low levels of health have\ninhibited the achievement of socially and economically\nproductive lives, not to mention the devastating social and\neconomic impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as well as\nmalaria, on a number of developing countries, particularly\nin Africa.\nThe Cologne initiative to expand the scope and\nprovision of relief for the heavily indebted poor countries\nwas a welcome step forward. Unfortunately, however, it\ndoes not go far enough to alleviate the debt burden which\nthe developing countries still bear. Nothing short of the\ncancellation of some of these countries' debts will be\nsufficient to improve their circumstances to the point\nwhere they can be active participants in the world\neconomy. The situation of many low-income countries\nhas been made even more acute by the rapid decline of\nofficial development assistance in the wake of\nglobalization's spread and over reliance on the market to\npromote development.\nThe financing of development must therefore be\nplaced on a more sound and predictable basis. The Group\nof 77 therefore attaches the greatest importance to the\n13\n\n\nholding of a high-level conference by the year 2001 to\naddress this pressing issue. We believe that if Member\nStates can address all aspects of the problem \u2014 particularly\nthose identified in the Secretary-General's report on\nfinancing for development \u2014 we may yet find solutions\nthat are acceptable and effective. Crucial to the successful\noutcome of the conference, however, is a general\nacceptance of a more enlightened approach to international\ndevelopment cooperation based on a genuine concept of\ninterdependence and partnership.\nIndeed, there is an acute need for a new global agenda\nwith the objective of putting a human face on the\nmarketplace. Policies aimed merely at creating\nunsustainable social safety nets are hardly lasting solutions.\nThe root causes of the structural and endemic problems of\nthe developing countries, which ultimately lead to global\ninstability, must be addressed.\nFor their part, the developing countries which\nconstitute the Group of 77 are committed to the search for\nways and means by which we can accelerate the\ndevelopment process. Even before the conference on\nfinancing for development, we shall meet in Havana, Cuba,\nnext year for the first ever South summit. The Summit is a\nlong-cherished idea whose time has finally come. It will\nallow the South a special opportunity to examine the impact\nwhich globalization continues to have on developing\ncountries, as well as the policies and strategies needed to\nharness the process and make it more amenable to control.\nIn this context, North-South relations must be reviewed to\nsee how they may be enhanced and put on a new basis for\nmutual trust and advantage.\nUnderstandably, the central focus of the South Summit\nmust be the strengthening of the unity and solidarity of the\nGroup of 77 and the identification of concrete initiatives to\npromote practical cooperation between members. We have\nalso agreed to devote our attention to the promulgation of\nknowledge and technology in order, hopefully, to achieve\na quantum leap towards our development. This, after all, is\nan area in which the South can boast of remarkable\nadvances and of many centres of excellence that can be\nutilized for the dissemination of skills and technology\namong the countries of the Group of 77. The North can, of\ncourse, do much to facilitate these exchanges by providing\nrequisite financing and supplying appropriate technology\nand knowledge that would make the developing countries\nmore self-reliant and at the same time more competitive in\nthe world economy.\nComing, as it does, in the early months of the new\nmillennium, the South summit will certainly provide an\nindication of the direction for the future. In Havana we\nhope to have in attendance our developed partners, which\nsignificantly, are usually present at all of our important\ndeliberations as observers. Also expected to participate in\nthe event are other key players in the development\nprocess, such as our non-governmental organizations and\nrepresentatives of the private sector. Together, through an\ninteractive dialogue, we hope to forge a programme of\naction which will serve as a catalyst for the development\nof our countries and our peoples. Indeed, if given the\nchance, the South summit, I dare say, will prove to be an\ninspiration for the Millennium Assembly and for a new\ncompact on human development for the twenty-first\ncentury.\nSpeaking for Guyana, I wish to reaffirm our\nGovernment's intention to continue working for the\ncreation of a new global human order aimed at the\neradication of poverty and the establishment of a just and\nmore humane system of international relations. Conceived\nby our late President Cheddi Jagan, whose entire life was\ndedicated to empowering the poor and the weak \u2014 not\nonly in his native Guyana, but throughout the world \u2014\nthe outlines of this new order have been presented at\nmajor international forums, including the World Summit\nfor Social Development, which was held in 1995 in\nDenmark. All 14 heads of Government of the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM), along with other world leaders\nand eminent personalities, have declared their full support\nfor the proposal and their commitment to its widest\npromulgation. We will therefore seek at this session to\nadvance it for further consideration.\nAlthough much is being made of the dawning of the\nmillennium, it is obviously too much to expect that it will\nbring solutions to all of the world's problems. It can\nprovide, however, an auspicious opportunity for the\ninternational community to reflect upon the past\nachievements, its present challenges and future\naspirations.

        "file_text": "Please, Sir, accept my most\nsincere congratulations on your election as President of\nthe General Assembly at this session, as well as my\nwishes for every success in the discharge of this complex\nand responsible mission. We are thankful for the work of\nyour predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti. We also greatly\nappreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, to effectively and energetically lead our\nOrganization.\nBelarus welcomes the enlargement of the United\nNations family of nations, which recently accepted three\nnew members: the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is\nbeing held at the doorway between centuries and\nmillennia. This fact alone urges us to take an in-depth\nlook at both the past and the present of the United\nNations and to think about its future. The expanding\nglobal challenges, especially ethnic conflicts, deterioration\nof the environment, transnational crime and terrorism can\nbe met only by concerted efforts of the United Nations.\nBelarus will be actively contributing to the formation\nof a new image of the United Nations as an organization\ncapable of tackling the challenges of the day. Our country\nwas among the Organization's founding members, who\nbestowed upon the United Nations such high and noble\ngoals and principles. We are interested in their\nconsolidation and development.\nThis year the Organization experienced what was\nprobably one of the most serious tests in its entire history.\nThe United Nations was virtually marginalized during the\ncrisis around Yugoslavia. The decision to use military\nforce against a sovereign State was taken without the\nauthorization of the Security Council.\nAlthough the settlement of the Kosovo crisis has\nnow been brought back under the auspices of the United\n3\n\n\nNations, a recurrence of attempts to randomly use force\noutside the Security Council mechanism cannot be\nexcluded. Consequently, the question as to whether the\nSecurity Council should remain the only \u2014 I reiterate, the\nonly \u2014 international institution to authorize the use of force\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security as\nyet remains unanswered.\nThe answer that is today given to this question will\ndetermine developments in the twenty-first century. Will it\nbe the age of fairness and the rule of law, or will the world\nbe thrown back into the era when force was the only\nargument? From a historical perspective, such a\ndevelopment would return us to the beginning of this\ncentury. Let us recall that the dawn of the twentieth century\nsaw nations divided into two categories: subjects and\nobjects of international law, with their fate totally\ndependent upon their ability to defend themselves by\nmilitary force.\nI believe that a totally different world order would\nmost adequately meet the interests of all members of the\ninternational community. This is a world order in which all\ncountries are equal and are protected by international law\nand the United Nations. The prerogative of the Security\nCouncil to establish and maintain peace and security is a\nkey element of this system.\nNaturally this places a special burden of responsibility\non the Security Council and its members. We view the\nincrease in both permanent and non-permanent members of\nthe Council on the basis of equitable geographical\ndistribution to be an important measure that would improve\nthe Council's effectiveness.\nGuided by the intention to contribute further to\nstrengthening peace and security, Belarus has presented its\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security\nCouncil for the period 2002-2003. The elections will be\nheld in 2001, during the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly.\nAs regards the responsibility of the United Nations for\nthe maintenance of peace and security, I would also like to\nunderline the need to make fuller use of the entire set of\nmeasures envisaged in the Charter. Special emphasis should\nbe put on the prevention of conflicts by peaceful means,\nwhich, if applied in a consistent and efficient manner,\nwould produce substantial results. This can be explicitly\nillustrated by recent positive developments in the Middle\nEast peace process, which Belarus welcomes and supports.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to reaffirm the readiness\nof the Government of the Republic of Belarus to\ncontribute actively to the resolution of conflicts in post-\nSoviet countries and, in particular, to host in our capital,\nMinsk, the international conference on Nagorny\nKarabakh.\nMore than half a century ago, sovereign States,\nincluding Belarus, founded the United Nations to\n\u201creaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the\ndignity and worth of the human person\u201d. To uphold its\nlegal and moral commitments the international community\ncannot and must not remain inactive in the face of gross\nand systematic violations of human rights. Genocide in\nRwanda, events in East Timor \u2014 these and similar\noccurrences must lead to immediate and decisive action\non the part of the United Nations. But such action must\nbe taken in full compliance with the decisions of the\nSecurity Council.\nAt the same time it is obvious that the sacred\nprinciple of the protection of human rights, once\ninterpreted selectively, becomes meaningless.\nUnfortunately, double standards in the interpretation of\nthe notion of human rights are still applied all too often\nin international politics. It would be dangerously\nmisleading to assume that human rights can be protected\nby means that ignore the principle of the sovereign\nequality of States. Disregarding State interests in the\npursuit of individual values can cause unpredictable\nconsequences.\nGlobalization is creating a situation in which the\nprosperity and even more the underdevelopment of certain\nregions, or conflicts in them, directly affect the global\nstate of affairs. From this perspective, the developments\nof the twenty-first century will be largely influenced by\nprocesses taking shape in the enormous Eurasian region,\nof which my country is an integral part.\nMulti-ethnic and multi-confessional Belarus has,\nthank God, avoided the religious and ethnic conflicts that\nhave been so characteristic of many post-Soviet countries.\nDuly organized governmental management and law\nenforcement systems have allowed us to ensure an\nadequate level of security for our society and people.\nSituated on the crossroads between the east and the west,\nthe north and the south of the continent, Belarus will be\nfurther contributing to international cooperation in\ncombating transborder crime, terrorism and illicit drug\ntrafficking.\n4\n\n\nA few days ago Belarus became party to the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist\nBombings. We also support the idea of holding a United\nNations conference or a special session of the General\nAssembly on the suppression of terrorism.\nBelarus is ready to cooperate most actively with all\nmembers of the international community to address these\nand other global and regional challenges. Openness to\nmutually beneficial cooperation is probably one of the main\nfeatures of Belarus' foreign policy, which sincerely seeks to\nestablish a network of good neighbourly relations\nembracing our country.\nAlthough consistent in its principled position on the\nenlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), Belarus demonstrates good will and acts\nconstructively to prevent the re-emergence of new dividing\nlines in Europe. In this context, we support the idea of\nadopting, at the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE) summit in Istanbul, the charter for\nEuropean security, which is to become a code of behaviour\nfor all of Europe.\nHistorically and geographically belonging to European\ncivilization, Belarus is seeking to become a full fledged\nmember of integration processes on the continent. The\nrapprochement between Belarus and Russia is in line with\nprocesses of global development. The consolidation of\nefforts by Belarus and Russia, enjoying wide public support\nin both countries, allows us to more effectively solve\nproblems faced by the two States and two peoples.\nBelarus has become a full fledged member of the\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM). We share the values and\nphilosophy of the Movement and the provisions of the\nNAM Plan of Action that are consonant with the United\nNations principles and objectives, as well as with the global\nchallenges of establishing a multipolar world order.\nRegrettably, the world is entering the new century\nwith the burden of arms so powerful they can extinguish all\nlife on the planet. For this reason, disarmament, especially\nin the nuclear sphere, remains among the main priorities of\nthe United Nations. A few years ago, Belarus made an\nhistoric choice by relinquishing the possession of nuclear\narms inherited from the former Soviet Union. Now, we\nurge all countries which have not yet become parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\nto join those that have made the establishment of a nuclear-\nweapon-free world their utmost priority. We also stand for\nan early agreement on the prohibition of the production of\nfissile materials.\nIn conditions in which the nuclear Powers are still\nnot ready fully to relinquish the possession of such arms,\nthere is a pressing need to withdraw them from as much\nof the world as possible, especially from heavily\npopulated regions. Proceeding from this, we once again\ncall on countries of our region to review their attitudes\ntowards the initiative put forward by President\nLukashenka of Belarus on the establishment of a nuclear-\nweapon-free space in Central and Eastern Europe, as\nreflected in the relevant resolutions of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly. The assumption by countries of our\nregion of binding legal commitments not to deploy\nnuclear weapons on their territory would be of paramount\nimportance to the security of the European family of\nnations. I believe that, sooner or later, all our neighbours\nwill arrive at this obvious conclusion. Since time is of the\nessence, we propose to begin consultations immediately\nwith all interested parties to exchange ideas and bridge\npositions on this problem.\nOther types of weapons of mass destruction are by\nno means less dangerous. We welcome the appeal voiced\nfrom this high rostrum to protect our children from the\nscourge of nuclear, chemical and biological warfare. We\nbelieve that the international community would be taking\nthe right step if it were to establish a preventive\nmechanism to take timely and coordinated measures to\ncontrol the development and production of new types of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nProceeding from this, the Belarus delegation at this\nsession will initiate a draft resolution on the prohibition\nof the development and manufacture of new types of\nweapons of mass destruction and new systems of such\nweapons. Likewise, we support the proposal to adopt a\nresolution on the consolidation of and respect for the\nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\nAs was rightly observed in this Hall, the strength\nand effectiveness of the United Nations depend on the\nsustainable development of its Member States. Having\nachieved independence, Belarus has chosen its own model\nof economic development which adequately reflects its\nnational conditions and capacity. This is a model socially\noriented market economy. Our objective is not simply the\nimplementation of reforms for their own sake, but the\nachievement of a more effective economy. In recent\nyears, we have been maintaining a positive dynamic of\ngross domestic product growth that, in 1998, was up by\n5\n\n\n8 per cent. Belarus is a self-reliant country. Our outstanding\ndebt is only $133 per capita.\nAn open economy, Belarus exports more than half of\nits gross domestic product and is taking energetic measures\nto find an appropriate place in the international division of\nlabour. Our country has all the necessary prerequisites for\nthat, including extensive technical and scientific potential\nand human resources. Economic performance is essential\nfor safeguarding social stability. The development of\ndemocratic institutions is an integral part of sustainable\ndevelopment. Mindful of that, the Government of Belarus\nhas initiated a broad dialogue between all political forces in\nthe country in an effort to jointly analyze avenues for the\nfurther political development of Belarus at the beginning of\nthe twenty-first century. The parliamentary elections in\n2000 and the presidential elections in 2001 should play an\nimportant role in this process. The Government of Belarus\nwill make every effort to conduct these elections\ndemocratically and freely.\nAmong the important global challenges facing the\nUnited Nations is the protection of the environment and the\nalleviation of the negative consequences of natural disasters\nand technological catastrophes. For more than 13 years\nnow, this has been a matter of survival for the Belarusian\nnation. The elimination of the consequences of the\nChernobyl disaster accounts for almost 20 per cent of our\nannual budget spending. I take this opportunity to express\nmost sincere gratitude to all the States and international\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations\nwhich throughout these years have never been dispassionate\nabout the tragedy of the Belarusian people. Positively\nassessing the efforts of the United Nations, Belarus today\ncalls upon the international community to continue\ncooperation and strengthen the United Nations role in this\ndirection. Together with the Russian Federation and\nUkraine, Belarus will present a draft resolution on this issue\nat the current session. We are hopeful that the United\nNations Member States will render their valuable support.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is an\nimportant stage in preparing for the Millennium Assembly\nthat should take practical decisions worthy of this forum.\nThe Republic of Belarus has proposed as a subject for\ndiscussion at the 2000 Assembly the issue of the United\nNations role in the furtherance of peace and human\nsustainable development in conditions of globalization.\nAware of the historic importance of this event, Belarus will\nactively contribute to the success of the Millennium\nAssembly and Summit and reaffirms its commitment to the\ngoals and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am pleased to\njoin previous speakers in congratulating you and the other\nmembers of the Bureau on your election to guide the\nwork of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.\nGiven your vast diplomatic experience and personal\nattachment to the principles of the Charter, I have every\nhope that our deliberations under your guidance will be\nable to determine the necessary mechanisms for dealing\nwith the numerous challenges facing our Organization as\nwe move into the next century.\nI also wish to express the deep sense of gratitude of\nmy delegation to your predecessor, His Excellency Didier\nOpertti, who served with great distinction in the year\nwhich marked the implementation of reforms instituted by\nthe Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, to mould the\nOrganization into a tool that can better fulfil the needs of\nMember States.\nAs we enter a new century, our Organization must\nmake a realistic assessment of developments in the\n16\n\n\nout-going century, especially in this last decade. Such an\nassessment will indicate that while global peace and\nsecurity have been pursued relentlessly, they have not been\neasily nor fully achieved. The reasons are not hard to find.\nThe situation is aggravated by the multiplicity of\nconflicts that pervades the world, especially in Africa.\nIntrastate conflicts, rooted in ethnic, racial and religious\nintolerance, pose a threat to the security and stability of\nmany States and regions. While we welcome the\nagreements to end the conflict in Sierra Leone and the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, the prolonged hostilities in\nAngola, Somalia, and lately in Kosovo, demonstrate that the\ninternational community is still grappling with serious\nchallenges to peace and security.\nIn spite of such setbacks and disappointments, we\nmust continue to maintain trust and confidence in the\nUnited Nations ability to achieve sustainable\nsocio-economic development for Member States. But that\nconfidence will be sustained only when the Organization is\nseen to be truly seeking the interest of all Member States,\nwithout exception. In this regard, Member States must give\nimpetus to the reform process that we initiated a decade\nago and maintain its dynamism. We also must accept that\nthe core of the reform touches on the Security Council,\nwhose decisions bind all Members of the Organization.\nThe Security Council must therefore not be allowed to\nbecome irrelevant. It should be reformed to ensure that it\ncan undertake its responsibilities more effectively under the\nCharter. And this reform must be guided by the principles\nof democracy, sovereign equality of States and equitable\ngeographical representation. In this connection, we wholly\nsubscribe to the Non-Aligned Movement\u2019s statement on all\naspects of the question of increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council, complemented by the African position as\nexpressed in the Harare declaration of June 1997. Africa\u2019s\nclaim to at least two permanent seats should be adequately\naddressed, since Africa is the largest regional group in the\nOrganization.\nWe would also like to reiterate the proposal of the\nNon-Aligned Movement that a periodic review of the\nstructure and functioning of the Security Council is\nnecessary in order to ensure at all times that it responds\nmore effectively to new challenges in international\nrelations, especially in the maintenance of international\npeace and security.\nIt is only through a restructuring of the Council on\nthese lines that this body can avoid selectivity in dealing\nwith issues of international peace and security and\nsustainable development. The present unequal handling of\nthe causes and management of conflicts is unacceptable\nsince it indirectly allows some conflicts to drag on.\nMy delegation believes that we can succeed in our\ncollective effort to achieve peace and prosperity in the\nnext century if we begin to speak out boldly against some\nof the injustices on the international scene. We therefore\nreiterate our concern over the continued non-compliance\nwith key United Nations resolutions that call for an end\nto the commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. It\nis our sincere conviction that the economic blockade of\nmore than three decades\u2019 vintage against Cuba and the\nHelms-Burton and D\u2019Amato legislation are a breach of\ninternational law and a violation of the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nParticularly, Ghana considers the extraterritorial\neffect of the Helms-Burton and D\u2019Amato legislation an\ninfringement on the territorial integrity of States and an\nimpediment to international navigation and free trade. In\nthis regard, we are concerned that the economic blockade\ncontinues to severely aggravate the plight of Cubans,\nespecially the vulnerable groups such as women, children\nand the elderly.\nGiven the United States Government\u2019s recent\nsensitivity to the concerns of the international community,\nGhana would like to urge it to seriously consider the\nresumption of indirect relations with Cuba. We are\nconvinced that such contacts will yield desired results,\nespecially if they take place in the context of constructive\ndialogue with the Cuban Government.\nAnother area of concern to the international\ncommunity has been the lingering disagreements with the\ngreat Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. My delegation welcomes\nthe positive events of 5 April 1999, by which the two\nLibyan nationals arrived in the Netherlands for trial by a\nScottish court, in connection with the Lockerbie incident.\nWe therefore can do no less than to reiterate the position\nof the Group of African States at the United Nations, the\nNon-Aligned Movement, and the Council of the League\nof Arab States that, as a matter of urgency, the Security\nCouncil should move beyond a mere suspension to a\ncomplete lifting of the sanctions imposed against the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, since Libya has cooperated fully\nand fulfilled all the requirements of the relevant\nresolutions.\n17\n\n\nNo issue in recent memory has frustrated the\ninternational community more than the Middle East peace\nprocess. Last year, as the world marked the fiftieth\nanniversary of the forcible dispossession of the Palestinian\npeople of their lands, homes and property, the Wye River\nMemorandum was agreed, offering a fresh impetus and\nhope for progress. However, subsequent events \u2014\ncharacterized by prevarications, recriminations and bad\nfaith \u2014 inhibited full implementation of the Memorandum.\nEven more painful has been the seeming helplessness of the\ninternational community in the face of such obvious\ninjustice.\nGhana reiterates its unwavering support for the\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to the\nestablishment of an independent sovereign State with\nJerusalem as its capital. Happily, recent changes in the\npolitical landscape of Israel offer grounds for renewed\noptimism. We thus share the conviction of the Palestinian\nleader, Chairman Yasser Arafat, that Mr. Ehud Barak\u2019s\nvictory has raised hopes for peace throughout the region.\nWe commend the bold initiative taken by the Israeli leader,\nsoon after assuming office, to resume dialogue and reach a\nmeeting of minds with the Palestinians. The challenge\nahead is enormous but not insurmountable; it will require\npainful compromises on sensitive issues. We urge all parties\nto negotiate in good faith towards a comprehensive, just\nand lasting peace in the Middle East.\nGhana is proud of its participation and record in the\npeacekeeping efforts of the Organization in all regions of\nthe world. The sacrifices in material resources and the costs\nin human terms have not been in vain, since the\nmaintenance of peace and security and post-conflict peace-\nbuilding have been critical in assuring all of us of the\nglobal tranquillity necessary for sustained development.\nMy delegation believes therefore that the time has\ncome for the international community to do in Africa as\nmuch as it has done in other areas, particularly the Balkans,\nto guarantee peace. We have seen in the past few months\nthe kind of resources that the world has been willing and\nable to mobilize in the Balkans on short notice. We do not\nsee the same response to the tragedies of Africa. African\nMember States feel discriminated against when the response\nof the international community to conflicts on the continent\ncontinues to be muted or lukewarm.\nNuclear disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction are indispensable for the preservation\nof world peace. Yet the lack of commitment and political\nwill of the nuclear weapon countries continues to impede\nthe process of nuclear disarmament. This is demonstrated\nby the failure of the three Preparatory Committee sessions\nfor the 2000 Review Conference for the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\nAgainst this background, my delegation reiterates the\nwarning that the parties and non-parties to the NPT alike\nwill not continue indefinitely to abide by the Treaty while\nthe nuclear-weapon countries continue to ignore the calls\nof the international community to abide by their NPT\ncommitments and pursue negotiations in good faith on\neffective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear\narms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament\nunder strict and effective international control.\nThe proliferation of conventional weapons, notably\nsmall and light weapons, is equally of concern, since they\nare the tools of violence and conflict in Africa. My\ndelegation commends all the efforts aimed at securing\ninternational cooperation and coordination in the struggle\nagainst the accumulation, proliferation and widespread use\nof small arms. Naturally, we welcome the recent decision\ntaken on small arms and light weapons by the heads of\nState of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at their\nrecent summit in Algiers which, among others, called on\nOAU member States to adopt a coordinated approach to\nthe problems posed by the illicit trafficking, circulation\nand proliferation of these arms.\nWe also urge all friends of Africa to support the\nimplementation of the moratorium on the import, export\nand manufacture of small arms and light weapons in West\nAfrica, which aims at stemming the illicit traffic in these\nweapons in our subregion. My Government, in\nrecognition of the need to address this problem and the\nrelated issue of the forced participation of children in\narmed conflicts, intends to jointly host with the\nGovernment of Canada a workshop aimed at building on\nthe Mali moratorium and establishing a framework for\nkeeping children out of conflicts. It is our hope that the\nsupport of the international community will be\nforthcoming when the time comes.\nWe are at the dawn of the new millennium,\nconcluding a period in which the decolonization\nmovement has brought about one of the century\u2019s signal\ntransformations: that of more than 80 nations from\ncolonial status to self-rule and membership of this\nOrganization. This is a commendable achievement.\nNevertheless, the goal of the Plan of Action for the\nInternational Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism\nhas not been realized, since 17 Non-Self-Governing\n18\n\n\nTerritories remain on the agenda of this Assembly. We\nreiterate our continued belief in the right of all peoples to\nself-determination in accordance with General Assembly\nresolution 1514 (XV) and call on the administering,\noccupying or colonial Powers to cooperate with the relevant\ninstitutions of the United Nations for the speedy\ndetermination of self-rule.\nWhile we congratulate the United Nations and\nourselves for the commendable record in bringing colonies\nto self-rule, we cannot hide our deep disappointment at the\nrecent turn of events in East Timor. Since a significant\nnumber of States Members of the United Nations are the\nproduct of self-determination, our Organization has a moral\nand political obligation to bring East Timor to self-rule.\nWe call on both the United Nations and the administering\nPower, therefore, to take all measures necessary to restore\npeace and tranquility so that the true wishes of the people,\nas clearly expressed in the recent referendum, can be\nrespected without further delay.\nIf we are concerned about subjugated territories, then\nwe cannot remain silent over the continued plight of\nWestern Sahara. The people of that territory must exercise\ntrue self-determination and we believe that, since the\nPolisario Front and Morocco have accepted the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s programme on implementation of the Settlement\nPlan for the referendum in the territory, then the promised\nreferendum should be held without further delay. We call\non all stakeholders to demonstrate good will and fairness by\nensuring a free and fair referendum.\nThe phenomenon of extreme and widespread poverty\nin the midst of plenty in the world is a serious indictment\nof the conscience and political will of the international\ncommunity. Compared to the social situation at the onset of\nthis century, the next century begins with an even bleaker\noutlook. More and more people are living at or below the\npoverty line, while individual security and well-being\ncontinue to face disruptions from civil conflict and disease.\nMalnutrition, malaria, AIDS, diarrheal and communicable\ndiseases continue to kill millions of people, stifling the\neconomic potential of large segments of populations.\nHIV/AIDS alone has killed in the last decade more\nAfricans than have all the conflicts and other diseases. It is\na frightening thought that millions of Africa\u2019s young and\nproductive populations will be killed by this pandemic in\nthe next few years. What development and progress are we\ntalking about, then, if we will have no human resource to\nimplement them?\nThe continued deterioration of economic conditions\nin Africa poses a challenge to all of us, especially as all\nstatistics show that the world\u2019s poor continue to wallow\nin abject poverty with only a dim hope of improvement\nin their living standards. One of the main requirements of\nour current session of the General Assembly is therefore\nto select for implementation those measures that will\nenable developing countries to grow out of poverty in a\nsustainable environment.\nMy delegation continues to be concerned about the\ndeterioration of official development assistance, even\nthough we note with gratitude the decision by three\nindustrialized countries to increase their gross national\nproduct allocation to aid, and the steadfastness of\nDenmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, which\nare providing more than 0.7 per cent of their gross\nnational product. Official development assistance\nresources need to be increased to levels which, combined\nwith the commitment of developing countries to\ndeepening economic reforms, lead to early achievement\nof sustainability in growth, poverty reduction and\nmacroeconomic stability.\nIf we must break the cycle of crises, poverty and\ninstability, particularly in Africa, and if we must create\nthe conditions for sustainable debt management on the\ncontinent, the creditor countries and institutions must be\nprepared to wipe out the debts of the countries involved\nin the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC)\nInitiative and begin the new millennium on a clean slate.\nIn this connection, we note with appreciation the\nrecently announced decision and support of the G-7\ncountries in broadening, deepening and accelerating the\nHIPC Initiative. While we express our satisfaction, let me\nhasten to urge that care be taken to avoid the imposition\nof additional difficulties on HIPC countries in the process,\nsuch as are likely to befall HIPC gold-producing countries\nif the proposal to sell off some of the gold reserves of the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) to meet part of the\ncost of the expanded HIPC Initiative is followed through.\nSimilarly, we pray all creditor countries not to present\ndebt relief in conditionalities that would compel debtor\ncountries to give up the relief option.\nIn these days of globalization and trade\nliberalization, the developed countries must also open\ntheir markets to goods from developing countries,\nincluding providing greater access for the latter\u2019s\nagricultural produce and services. The developed countries\nmust, in addition, implement their trade obligations in the\n19\n\n\nspirit that all must benefit from the trade rules. In this\nregard, the twin concepts of liberalization and globalization\nmust afford developing countries economic justice in terms\nof markets and activities. They should not turn developing\ncountries into perpetual consumers because of limited\nvolume of goods and market access.\nAs we approach the next century, we know we cannot\nbuild the kind of future we desire without the full\nparticipation of women. Although much has been achieved\nin advancing the status of women through the\nimplementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, a lot\nstill remains to be done. Discrimination, denial and violence\nagainst women and girls persist, embedded in cultural,\ntraditional and religious practices around the world, despite\nthe increasing public debate on gender issues.\nGender mainstreaming into national, regional and\ninternational policies and programmes, as well as the\nprovision of adequate resources for implementation as spelt\nout in the Beijing Platform for Action, represents one of the\ncrucial strategies for attaining gender equity and equality.\nBut in the final analysis, the critical step in protecting\nwomen\u2019s rights is to empower women through education\nand increased awareness of their rights. In this connection,\nlet me express my delegation\u2019s appreciation for the\nadoption of an optional protocol to the Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against\nWomen (CEDAW) which, among others, recognizes the\ncompetence of CEDAW to receive and consider\ncommunications submitted by or on behalf of individuals or\ngroups of individuals, under the jurisdiction of a State\nParty, claiming to be victims of a violation of any of the\nrights set forth in the Convention by the State Party. We\nare happy that after so many years, women now have an\neffective instrument in their hands to fight discrimination,\nand we urge the adoption of the draft optional protocol to\nthe Convention.\nThis year, we also commemorate the tenth anniversary\nof the adoption by this Assembly of the Convention on the\nRights of the Child, by which all Member States pledged to\npromote and protect the rights of children. Despite the\nConvention, however, the rights of children continue to be\nviolated through child labour, commercial sex, exploitation,\nearly marriage and the use of children in armed conflicts.\nThis situation indicates that mere ratification of the\nConvention is not enough. Children would be protected and\ntheir rights promoted only by a conscious effort on the part\nof Governments to effectively implement the provisions of\nthe Convention.\nThe United Nations and other international\norganizations are justifiably preoccupied with governance\nbecause it is the basis of all progress. The United Nations\nmust therefore play a fundamental and central role in the\nre-design of global governance and in global governance\nitself. It cannot do so, however, when it is constantly\nrequested to do more for all people while it is being given\nless and less resources. It will certainly lack the\ninstitutional framework for global leadership when\nnational leaders fail to stand up for it or its enduring\nvalues. Given the onerous responsibilities of the\nOrganization and the expectations of the Member States,\nthe timely, full and unconditional payment of assessed\ncontributions would be an expression of our commitment\nand support as the Organization prepares to meet the\nemerging challenges of the twenty-first century.\nIn this connection, it is our firm conviction that the\nregular and peacekeeping budgets of the Organization\nshould be determined solely by the General Assembly in\naccordance with each country\u2019s ability to pay, among\nother factors, as objectively evaluated within the\nOrganization. Unilateral decisions that worsen the\nfinancial situation of the United Nations must be avoided.\nWe have an opportunity to draw lessons from our\nimmediate past history and to shape a new millennium in\nour best image, just as the great statesmen of this century\ndid in the aftermath of the Second World War. We would\nnot be true to ourselves if we sought refuge in half\nmeasures. We must use our best endeavours to build a\nnew world for a new millennium we can be proud of. Our\ncollective wisdom demands this. Our civilized values\ninsist on this. We can do no less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Most warmly do we congratulate you.\nSamoa welcomes your leadership and pledges to you and to\nNamibia our fullest support.\nThis Assembly is an especially happy one for the\nPacific: we now have in our midst three more South Pacific\nForum States, the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Ancient in tradition and\nlong in the business of political independence, each\nrepresents the variety and uniqueness of our region. They\nmake more real the goal of universality, as I know their\ncontribution will enrich the work of the Organization. In\nthe name of my country, I extend to the Governments of\nKiribati, Nauru and Tonga the warmest of greetings.\nLet me, at the outset, pay a tribute to the\nstewardship of our Secretary-General and acknowledge\nthe remarkable work of the United Nations \u2014 remarkable\nin terms of what is being done and achieved, at times\nagainst extreme and appalling odds.\nThe twentieth century has been marked by violence\nand tragedy throughout. Millions have died in countless\nconflicts worldwide. Millions more continue to perish\nfrom poverty and disease.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s report on the work of the\nOrganization (A/54/1) is thoughtful and challenging. Our\nworld is one of trouble and insecurity. The range and\ncomplexity of the issues are worrying, in some respects\nseemingly overwhelming. Ordinary aspirations are not\nbeing matched by effective action. Far too many are\nembroiled in the brutalities of war. Fundamental human\nneeds and rights are being denied.\nI believe we should all pay much more attention to\nthe reports of the Secretary-General. There is much there\nto confirm, and much to test our own perception of events\nand trends: directly, and in my view rightly, the\nSecretary-General has drawn attention to the place of\n\n\nsovereignty in the context of our contemporary common\ninterest and asks how and by what means we are to defend\nthat common interest. These questions go to the heart of the\nmatter; the answers to them will define the role of the\nUnited Nations in the next millennium. There will, of\ncourse, be variance in perspectives. The experience of the\nUnited Nations itself in recent times does not yield\nsatisfactory answers.\nYet there are challenges that need to be met, seriously\nand urgently. I would agree with the Secretary-General that\nit is critical to set clear criteria for international action and\nintervention. It is the United Nations, with its multilateral\nsetting, that is best placed to determine such criteria; it is\nthe United Nations that has been invested with the global\nideals to deal with interventions, but, alas, there have been\nfailures and there has been inability.\nWe should now look more deeply into the causes of\nthose failures and lack of ability and in so doing we must\nbalance competing rights and values. The very essence of\nthe Organization is thus brought into focus: we need to\nensure that the United Nations is able to function\neffectively in the new century, that we have a United\nNations strengthened by commitment and reform. Above\nall, we need to bear in mind the essential connection\nbetween peace, development and human rights. We ignore\nany one to the fundamental detriment of all, although peace\nis the ultimate measure of our common interest, indeed, of\nour common future.\nWe think it is time to move to a more definitive phase\nin the current efforts to reform the Security Council. The\nissues are clear, and have been clear for some time: points\nof argument are now being repeated, or repackaged.\nSubstantive changes are required: the current structure does\nnot reflect the facts and realities of today; suffers from\nimbalance and inequities. Membership of the Security\nCouncil should be enlarged: we have said before that Japan\ndeserves to be a permanent member. Provision for this\nshould be made.\nWe appreciate the procedural changes made to the\nworking of the Council, and we would encourage more of\nthem: it would not be desirable to seek to resolve the\nunfairness of representation in one category without proper\nattention to the other. We share the view that Security\nCouncil reforms must necessarily be comprehensive and\nmust address all aspects as a whole, including the power of\nveto. The veto is a central issue which must be resolved in\nthe context of the current reforms. We think there is a\nproven case for the power of veto to be curtailed, and\nrestricted to Chapter VII matters.\nSamoa fully supports the ongoing efforts to\nmodernize and strengthen the Organization. Reform\nmeasures must provide for the serious and early review of\nthe regional groupings. The current arrangements are\nmore representative of the past than the present. There is\na need for reconfiguration to reflect natural geographies\nand to ensure equitable representation of subregions.\nThe anomaly of Australia and New Zealand being\ncounted outside their geographical area should be\ncorrected. They form a natural part of the South Pacific\nsubregion of the Asian Group. Samoa adds its voice to\nthe call made by Fiji and Papua New Guinea during this\nsession for such regional reconfiguration. The matter\nshould figure in the reform of the Organization and\nshould be taken into account in reforming the structure\nand membership of the Security Council.\nIn the coming year, as we move towards an agreed\napproach to the Millennium Assembly, my Government\nbelieves that the world community should focus on major\nglobal challenges likely to confront humankind in the next\ncentury. We agree with the Secretary-General that,\nalongside war and conflicts, natural disasters are a major\nand priority global challenge. Natural disasters remain a\nmost serious threat to human lives and national\neconomies. As we have seen in recent times, natural\ndisasters occur widely and indiscriminately, not stopping\nat any border. At this moment, we think especially of\ncommunities whose lives and property have been affected\nin Greece, Turkey, Taiwan, the United States and the\nBahamas.\nThe world has experienced three times as many great\nnatural disasters in the 1990s as in the 1960s, the year\n1998 being the hottest year on record and the worst for\nweather-related natural disasters. Yet we learn with\ndismay from the Secretary-General\u2019s report that\nemergency aid funds have declined by 40 per cent in the\npast five years alone. For small island States such as the\nBahamas, these \u201conce-in-a-century\u201d events are occurring\nwith alarming frequency and severity. They are truly\ncalamitous in effect. Hurricane Floyd was the fourth-\nstrongest hurricane measured this century.\nMy own country has not been spared. We can only\nbe thankful that our neighbours and traditional friends\ncome so readily to our assistance at moments of disaster.\nOur Pacific neighbours, Australia, Japan and New\nZealand, continue to be at the forefront of emergency and\nrehabilitation efforts in disasters affecting our Pacific\nregion. Countries far from the Pacific, such as those of\nthe European Union, have also been generous. Even\n2\n\n\ndeveloping nations have not been hesitant in coming to our\nhelp. In the major disasters that have devastated our\ncountry, the People\u2019s Republic of China in particular,\ndespite the severe and regular natural disasters it itself\nsuffers, has been unstinting in helping our country in those\ndifficult times.\nChina last week commemorated the fiftieth anniversary\nof the establishment of the Republic. Samoa joins other\nnations in congratulating the People\u2019s Republic of China in\nreaching this important milestone in its history.\nThe immediate practical needs are to determine what\npreventive action might be available, especially to the small\nand vulnerable. Advanced early-warning systems using\nsatellite-derived data and Internet dissemination would be\nessential, as would be the need to train and improve\ncapacities. Greater efforts to establish contingency planning\nand other preparedness measures for disaster-prone\ncountries are required. In all these, active cooperation at all\nlevels \u2014 national, regional and international \u2014 would be\nvital. Above all, we agree that we should maximize the\nlessons learned from the experience of the International\nDecade for Natural Disaster Reduction. It is critical for all\ncountries, especially the most vulnerable, that this work be\ncontinued.\nSamoa adds its voice to the expression of outrage at\nthe violations in East Timor. These are violations of\nprinciples and of Government responsibilities, violations\nagainst the innocent and defenceless. The real lesson of\nEast Timor is that a people\u2019s aspirations for freedom will\ntriumph in the end. They cannot be suppressed for ever.\nIndeed, their balloted choice is abundantly clear. It is also\nthe lesson of East Timor that the United Nations is best\nplaced to safeguard rights and freedoms while ensuring\norder and security.\nWe are relieved that the multinational force is now in\nposition and we appreciate the ready and effective response\nof key States, including our South Pacific neighbours,\nAustralia and New Zealand. Samoa is especially grateful for\nthe clear and committed leadership taken by Australia.\nThe violations to which I have referred reinforce the\nneed for the world community to move as expeditiously as\npossible to complete the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court. Those responsible for these unacceptable\nacts of violence and crime must be brought to account.\nSamoa was able to contribute to the making of the Rome\nStatute. We are firmly committed to the early establishment\nof the Court, and we will continue to play a role in the\nwork of the Preparatory Commission. We believe very\nfirmly that the Court will provide an essential step in the\nname of human rights and the rule of law. To this end we\nshould ensure prompt and widespread ratification of the\nCourt\u2019s Statute.\nSpeaking now in Samoa's role as Chairman of the\nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and on behalf of\nthe forty-three members of our Alliance, allow me, Mr\nPresident, to thank you most sincerely for the time and\neffort you have devoted to the special session to ensure\nits success.\nI also wish to express to all Member States, to the\nUnited Nations agencies and intergovernmental and non-\ngovernmental organizations, our very deep appreciation\nfor their participation in the twenty-second special session\nin the past two days. The AOSIS countries are especially\ngrateful for the expressions of commitment, understanding\nand support.\nWhat we have heard provides additional motivation\nfor us to make the Barbados Programme of Action one of\nreal and sustained implementation. There are critical\nchallenges that require attention. We are determined to\nturn those challenges into opportunities. With your\nsupport, we believe there is every prospect for\nachievement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "May I begin by\ncongratulating the President on his election. I am confident\nthat the skills and vast experience he has acquired\nthroughout his distinguished diplomatic career will provide\nthe guidance we need to guarantee the successful outcome\nof the session. I must also recall the valuable contribution\nof his predecessor, Mr. Opertti, to the work of the last\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI would like to take this opportunity to extend my\nwarm welcome and congratulations to the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga on their admission to the United Nations.\nAs the twentieth century comes to an end, it is\nevident that all countries in the world \u2014 advanced,\ndeveloping or transitional \u2014 will be substantially affected\nby globalization. Further specialization and the widening\nof markets through trade, the larger division of labour and\na more efficient and diversified allocation of financial\nresources should increase overall productivity and raise\nliving standards. However, no country will benefit from\nthis trend spontaneously and automatically. The major\ntasks which Governments face today are development and\nthe pursuit of sound policies and appropriate structural\nadjustments to meet the challenges and take advantage of\nthe opportunities that globalization offers. While sound\ndomestic economic planning and reforms are critical to\nmeeting the challenges of globalization, regional\ncooperation and integration processes are essential to\nmaximizing the emerging benefits and opportunities.\nWe, as a country and the region as a whole, are\ntrying to adjust to the multiple stresses of post-Soviet\neconomic, cultural and political transformations. Clearly\nthese problems can stress relations as much within States\nas between them. Armenia does not see either itself or the\nregion as being permanently condemned to\nmarginalization; rather, it believes that close cooperation\nin the region, whether political, economic or security\nbased, will help bring lasting stability and prosperity\nbased on a sense of solid and shared emergent values.\nCooperation within the framework of regional economic\ninitiatives, such as the Interstate Oil and Gas Transport to\nEurope (INOGATE) programme and the Transport\nCorridor: Europe-Caucusus-Asia (TRACECA) project, is\nessential. Armenia is sincerely open to such cooperation,\nalthough we have to state with regret that the blockades\nimposed on Armenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan are a\nserious obstacle to such cooperation. It is obvious that the\nregion's high potential cannot be fully utilized if attempts\nare made to isolate one of its constituents. Such attempts\nare doomed to failure and will adversely affect all\nconcerned in the region.\nThe Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) is\nanother mechanism that could contribute to the region's\neconomic development. The activities of the recently\n19\n\n\nestablished Black Sea Trade and Development Bank will\nconsiderably contribute to carrying out the projects\nelaborated by the member States of the Black Sea\nEconomic Cooperation. In this regard, Armenia fully\nsupports the granting of observer status in the General\nAssembly to the BSEC.\nA young republic in transition from a long nightmare\nof totalitarian, single-party State to the emergence of a\ndemocratic, free-market, open society, Armenia must\nsimultaneously consolidate its State structures, move its\neconomy forward and resolve the Nagorny Karabakh\nconflict. It must do all three at the same time, for they are\nin fact interdependent. First and foremost, Armenia must\nensure that the Armenian population of Nagorny Karabakh\ncontinues to enjoy its security within its own lands. Our\nrecent memories of vulnerability and insecurity make it\nimpossible for any Armenian anywhere to accept anything\nless than the inalienable right of the people of Nagorny\nKarabakh not to be subjugated, not to be dominated and not\nto be subordinate. Armenia understands this and is actively\nengaged in pursuing in every possible forum a resolution of\nthe conflict with Azerbaijan that would achieve peace\nwithout endangering the hard-won and legitimate rights of\nour own people to live in secure dignity and freedom.\nSince 1992 the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) has played a key role in the\nprocess of finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in\nNagorny Karabakh. It has been actively involved, through\nthe various permutations of the Minsk process, to define the\nelements for a durable peace and stability in the region of\nthe Transcaucasus. Armenia is committed to pursuing every\npossible and credible attempt to resolve the conflicts that\nlinger in the region. It is committed to exploring every\navenue for peaceful relations with all its neighbours,\nrelations based on mutual respect and recognition.\nThe OSCE, through the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk\nGroup, is trying to reconcile seemingly incompatible\nprinciples. We have always remained opposed to one-sided\northodoxy and have always advocated a more flexible\napproach. It is therefore with interest that Armenia and\nNagorny Karabakh received the Minsk Group\nCo-Chairmen's draft proposal during their latest visit to the\nregion. My Government, as well as the authorities of\nNagorny Karabakh, considered this formulation by the\nCo-Chairmen a more realistic effort in trying to address the\nthorny issue of the status of Nagorny Karabakh with\nminimal prejudice to either of the competing claims.\nIndeed, we must distinguish between stability and\nthe forced maintenance of the status quo. Conflating the\ntwo is neither wise nor practicable in the long run. A\nstatus quo in political life is never inherently permanent,\nand a viable policy of stability requires a mechanism to\npursue an evolutionary, dynamic process of managing\nchange. We have new and dynamic challenges to the\nstatus quo; we should not be shy in addressing these\nchallenges creatively and objectively to conceive more\nadaptive answers rather than falling back into a\ncomfortable, yet dangerously elusive, status quo.\nAs Armenia actively defends and pursues the\nNagorny Karabakh people's right to self-determination\nthrough peaceful means, we also sympathize with and\nsupport all other just self-determination claims in other\nparts of the globe. Armenia applauded the Indonesian\nGovernment's courage when it announced the conduct of\nthe referendum on East Timor's independence. Today we\nare concerned with the latest developments, but we hope\nthat the results of the popular consultation will be fully\nrespected. We also commend the role that the United\nNations has played in organizing and supervising the\npopular consultation.\nArmenia also welcomes the most recent positive\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process. We hope\nthat the Palestinian people's right to self-determination\nwill be fully realized, thus bringing lasting peace and\nstability to the Middle East.\nThe last decade of the twentieth century has been\nmarked by serious achievements in the sphere of\ndisarmament and global and regional arms control, and\nmore remains to be done. At the global level, that would\nmean reviewing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) in the year 2000; completing the\nwork of the Biological Weapons Convention Ad Hoc\nGroup on a compliance and verification protocol;\ncompletely eliminating existing stocks of chemical\nweapons and ensuring the universality of the Chemical\nWeapons Convention regime. Similarly, at the regional\nlevel, we attach great importance to the successful\nconclusion of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces\nin Europe (CFE) adaptation process, which will be signed\nby heads of States at the OSCE summit this November.\nWe are convinced that the adapted Treaty will\nsignificantly contribute to the strengthening of European\nsecurity.\nIn pursuing its national policies, Armenia has made\nit a priority to support the international efforts in securing\n20\n\n\npeace and stability throughout the world. We believe that\nour full participation in the work of the Conference on\nDisarmament will allow us to make further contributions to\nthe issues of arms control and disarmament. We hope\nmembers will support Armenia in its willingness to become\na full member of the Conference on Disarmament.\nArmenia welcomes the millennium summit initiative.\nAt the threshold of the new millennium, it is important for\nheads of State and Government to discuss the tasks that the\nUnited Nations is going to undertake in providing global\npeace and security. Believing that the United Nations\nshould play the leading role in the formation of an\ninternational anti-criminal strategy, Armenia supports the\nidea of holding, in Vienna in the year 2000, the Tenth\nUnited Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and the\nTreatment of Offenders.\nWe call for the accession of the maximum number of\ncountries to universal conventions against terrorism and\nsupport the Russian proposal on a United Nations\nconvention for combating acts of nuclear terrorism.\nArmenia, likewise, supports the initiative of holding a\nconference or a special session of the General Assembly\nagainst terrorism in 2000.\nOn 1 October, Armenia will sign the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, thus becoming the eighty-\nseventh State to do so.\nMaintenance of international peace is one of the most\nimportant functions of the United Nations. The challenges\nthat the international community faces today are diverse and\ncomplicated. This holds true especially for the reform of the\nSecurity Council, since ensuring peace and security\nthroughout the world depends on a Security Council which\nfunctions effectively. Security Council resolutions, including\nthose on peacekeeping operations, should be unbiased and\nuniversal and reflect a common approach to conflicts, based\non internationally accepted principles and criteria. One way\nto strengthen the role and function of the Security Council\nis to ensure a more equitable representation of the\nmembership of the United Nations in that organ, in\naccordance with the sovereign equality of States and other\nrelevant provisions of the Charter, and to make its work\nmore transparent. Representation in the Security Council\nthat is more equitable can be achieved by increasing the\nnumber of its members, taking into account the growth in\nthe membership of the United Nations.\nAfter this brief comment on matters that concern\nArmenia's current affairs, its membership in the United\nNations and the outstanding issues of the Nagorny\nKarabakh conflict, allow me a moment of reflection. We\nare often so preoccupied by immediate crises that\nlingering, chronic and fundamental phenomena do not\nalways get our full attention.\nAt this end of the century and millennium and on\nthe threshold of a new era, we would not be candid if we\ndid not admit to a certain disappointment, a certain sad\nrecognition that we, as a collectivity, a community of\nnations, have not come as far as people everywhere\nwould have wished us to come. I am sure we are not\nalone in our disappointment as we look around us and see\nthat the hopes of 1989 have not been fully realized in the\nlast 10 years: Rwanda, Kosovo and East Timor are all,\nhistorically speaking, very much in the present.\nIt is not for lack of charters, conventions and\nuniversal declarations that tragic events and murderous\nactions are committed, often by States, and even in the\nname of those same charters, conventions and\ndeclarations. After the Second World War, after the end\nof the cold war, we might have been justified in expecting\nsome respite from the organized display of man's\ninhumanity to man, of fratricidal war between citizens\nand State attempts to exterminate some part of its own\npeople. But of course very recent experience tells us that\nthe persecution of innocent civilians on no other grounds\nthan their ethnicity, religion or national origin continues\nunabated.\nArmenia and Armenians have a unique history\nthrough which to interpret these events. We notice the\never more frequent use of the term \u201cgenocide\u201d in\ncontinent after continent and we are reminded of our own\ntragic experience as genocide victims at the beginning of\nthis century. It is sad but true that the genocide of\nArmenians, which began in 1915, opened this century of\nhorrors. We at least are convinced that nothing contributes\nas much to the repetition of horrors as the reluctance and\nunwillingness with which those complicit in them tell the\ntruth, or even their avoiding doing so at all. Denying the\nreality of evil, portraying it as merely relative and\nrendering it banal have done much to have evil seen as a\npolitical event to manipulate and equivocate and\nprevaricate about in the name of realpolitik.\nIn Armenia, our democracy and future prosperity\ndepend on there coming a time when, through peace, the\nCaucasus will fulfil its promise as a region of neighbourly\ncooperation and economic growth. Without regional\npolitical stability, the regional economic prospects for all\n21\n\n\ncountries of the Caucasus will remain precarious. And\nunless the security needs and the aspirations of the people\nof the region are satisfied, there can be no political\nstability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should\nlike first of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly and to thank you for\nhaving accepted the weighty task that you will be carrying\nout during this session. We also wish to express our best\nwishes to your country, Namibia, which you so ably\nrepresent. We also pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr.\nOpertti, for the manner in which he guided our work\nduring the previous session.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend\nmy sincere congratulations to the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on their\nadmission to our Organization.\nMy statement is in line with the statement made here\nby the Presidency of the European Union. I wish merely\nto highlight some of the issues that are particularly\nimportant for us.\nEarly in the month of August, two young African\nchildren, Yaguine and Fod\u00e9, were found dead, stowed\naway in the landing gear of a Sabena aeroplane, victims\nof an idealism and an innocence that led them to embark\non a reckless voyage in search of the mirages of western\nsociety.\nYaguine and Fod\u00e9 left us a moving message, of\nwhich I would like to quote some passages here:\n\u201cTo the people in charge in Europe: it is to\nyour solidarity and to your kindness that we make\nan appeal for help for Africa ... We are suffering\nenormously ... We have war, disease ... We have\nschools, but in order to get a good education and\ngood teaching, one needs large amounts of money;\nand our parents are poor.\n\u201cSo, we Africans, especially African children\nand young people, ask you to create a great and\neffective organization for Africa ... We need you to\nfight poverty\u201d.\nThe great organization of which Yaguine and Fod\u00e9\ndreamed is here before me in its most universal form. It\nwas conceived from the outset for the maintenance of\npeace and for economic and social development. The\nauthors of the Charter regarded those two aspects as\ninseparable. Over the last decade, this great Organization\nhas succeeded in laying a worldwide foundation for\neconomic and social values aimed at creating a more\ncivilized world, a world in which globalization has\ngradually come to the fore.\nHere I am thinking of the discrete but tenacious\nwork at the great United Nations conferences and\nsummits to find new directions for development. That\nsignificant work must be continued and consolidated. The\n15\n\n\nuniversal commitments made at Jomtien for education, at\nRio de Janeiro for the environment, at Vienna for human\nrights, at Copenhagen for social development, at Cairo for\npopulation and development, at Beijing for women, at\nRome for hunger and at Istanbul for human settlements\nconstitute irreversible gains for mankind. It is gratifying\nthat the concerns debated and the conclusions adopted at\nthose conferences have increasingly become the inspiration\nfor our national policies and are helping to bring about the\nindispensable convergence among those policies.\nBut the tragedy of Yaguine and Fod\u00e9 brings us face to\nface with the harsh reality of unbalanced development. As\nI speak, 1.3 billion women and men are surviving \u2014 or\ntrying to survive \u2014 on less than one dollar per day; 840\nmillion of them, including 160 million children, suffer daily\nfrom hunger or malnutrition. Even more serious, as those\ntwo teenagers remind us, 260 million children have no\naccess to primary or secondary school because of a lack of\nmeans. Every day, 250 million children go to work instead\nof to school. At the dawn of the third millennium, it is\nincreasingly difficult for our civilization to tolerate such\nsocial and human marginalization and such a lack of\nsolidarity, in particular for our children.\nWe must forge stronger solidarity within the United\nNations. We must restore humanism to its rightful place in\ninternational relations. For this fight against poverty and\nthis campaign for emancipation to succeed, we must agree\nto a decisive review of the mechanism that underlies the\neconomic fluctuation, that causes financial tension and its\nattendant social consequences, and that tolerates massive\nexploitation of the weakest by forces that are often\nimpersonal and unidentifiable.\nHence, we are deeply convinced that we must restore\nthe primacy of political leadership in our globalized society.\nWe must endeavour without hidden agendas to organize a\nnew world political order. We need stronger and more\ncoherent United Nations action for economic and social\ndevelopment, which requires the use of all available global\ntools for economic, financial and commercial governance.\nThis means we must be more determined to restoring the\nprimacy of policy and no longer to permit democratic\nlegitimacy to be circumvented or even flouted by selfish or\nspeculative interests. The rights of peoples must always\nprevail over the power of money.\nBelgium will support United Nations efforts to restore\nthe Organization's mission to protect against the\nunacceptable side-effects of globalization. In that spirit, my\ncountry attaches great importance to the success of the\ncoming Millennium Assembly. In that context, Belgium\nis pleased that it will serve as host to the Third United\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in\nthe spring of 2001, which will bring together in Brussels\nall development partners. We hope that this major event\nwill lead to a renewed commitment to the integration of\nthese countries in the world economy on the basis of\nconcrete and quantifiable objectives. The Belgian\nGovernment, which recently came into office, has clearly\nexpressed its political will gradually to increase our\nfunding of bilateral partnerships and cooperation. We\nshall pay particular attention to the quality and the\ncoherent implementation of the projects we sponsor.\nI express the wish that this Assembly session be\nconducted under the banner of Africa. Your stimulating\nopening statement, Mr. President, and the addresses by\nPresident Mbeki of South Africa and by President\nBouteflika of Algeria, sent a strong message in that\nregard. We Belgians have a traditional interest in the\npolitical, economic and development prospects of Central\nAfrica. Belgium must reestablish the bonds with that\nregion which history and experience have bestowed upon\nit. This also implies responsibilities which my\nGovernment will endeavour to shoulder in a responsible\nand coherent manner. I am thinking in particular of the\ntwofold task of the United Nations as an organization\nboth for the maintenance of peace and for the promotion\nof development. I also have in mind human rights issues,\nof which my Government is particularly aware.\nAgainst this backdrop, the new Belgian Government\nhas placed cooperation with Central Africa at the top of\nits agenda. To us, it is important that peace and stability\nshould return to Central Africa. The Lusaka Ceasefire\nAgreement offers hope. It requires the political will of the\nvarious parties concerned to address the root causes of the\npresent conflict and to seek solutions at a regional level.\nA significant effort by the international community will\nbe necessary to encourage and support them. My country\nwill do its share, and will intensify its direct contacts and\nits financial support. Belgium has responded to the appeal\nof the Security Council by placing liaison officers at the\ndisposal of the Secretary-General. They will be deployed\nin accordance with Security Council resolution 1258\n(1999) of 6 August 1999.\nIt goes without saying that we fully respect the wish\nof African leaders that they should find their own political\nsolutions to the conflicts that undermine the continent.\nBut this can imply no ambiguity about the roles of the\nSecurity Council and of the General Assembly. Nor does\n16\n\n\nit mean that the rest of the world should refrain from\naction: achieving peace in the Great Lakes region will\nrequire tremendous efforts and resources.\nHere we must think about concluding a true\npartnership pact with the countries of Central Africa.\nInspired by the Stability Pact for the Balkans, this would\nform part of a genuine strategy for cooperation among\ncountries. With the support of the major financial\ninstitutions, such a pact could revitalize the economic\nmechanisms of partner countries and reinvigorate their\nsocial and democratic development. We believe such s\npartnership pact should be based on the voluntary and\nmutually respectful cooperation of each African and non-\nAfrican signatory country and should in no way be\nconstrued as an attempt at neo-colonial domineering of that\npart of the world.\nOther regions of Africa deserve more attention and\neffort on the part of the international community. I think in\nparticular of the bloody conflict which has plunged Angola\ninto unspeakable humanitarian tragedy. I also think of the\nwar between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which must be prevented\nfrom extending into Somalia. In Sierra Leone, the efforts of\nneighbouring countries, which Belgium and other partners\nhave supported, give reason for optimism. We also hope\nthat Guinea-Bissau will regain civil peace. But much\nremains to be done to improve the situation of the peoples\nof southern Sudan and of Somalia.\nWhatever the media's focus, now turned towards other\nparts of the world, it is important that we do not forget the\nsuffering of men, women and especially children of those\ncountries of Africa, who aspire to education, health and\ndevelopment. The new international policies, based more on\nbalance and on the sharing of prosperity, should be directed\ntowards them, too.\nI turn briefly to North Africa. The presidency of the\nEuropean Union recalled that the Maghreb countries are\nexperiencing significant growth. They remain an essential\npartner for Europe and for world peace, prosperity and\ndevelopment. Economic, social, cultural and political ties\nwith the southern Mediterranean basin will have to be\nstrengthened in the coming months and years.\nI also hope that the international Community will fulfil\nits commitment to support the Middle East peace process.\nThere, too, it will be a matter of releasing the financial and\nhuman resources to ensure the economic, social and\ndemocratic development of the various regions and peoples\nwho are committed to peace. My country is ready to\nrespond to calls for cooperation in this regard.\nThere is another region where the United Nations\nhas been called upon to play a crucial and difficult role.\nThe Kosovo crisis has implications for the security of my\ncountry and Europe as a whole. It also obliges us to ask\na sensitive question about the limits to the right of the\ninternational community to intervene in the internal affairs\nof a State.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\nintervention has appreciably reinforced the idea that moral\nand ethical considerations are in the process of\novershadowing the traditional concept of national\nsovereignty in international relations. If there is one\nlesson for our Organization to learn from the twentieth\ncentury, it is that for no State can the massacre of its own\npeople be considered an \u201cinternal affair\u201d, under any\npretext. This legal formalism would ultimately amount to\nadmitting that, as the head of the United Nations Interim\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), Bernard\nKouchner has said, it would be \u201clegitimate, although not\nelegant, to massacre one's own people\u201d.\nYet the Security Council is well-equipped to deal\nwith massive violations of human rights. Article 42 of the\nUnited Nations Charter allows the Council to qualify such\nviolations as a threat to international peace and security\nand to authorize armed intervention, as it has on several\noccasions \u2014 for example, in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1991; in\nSomalia in 1992; in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1994; and\nin Liberia and Sierra Leone in 1997.\nIf the Security Council could not fully play its role\nat the beginning of the Kosovo crisis, this was due less to\na divergence of views between States over the essence of\nthe problem than because there was a rift between the\nadvocates of the right of humanitarian intervention and\nthe defenders of the traditional legal system, which\nregards national sovereignty as the absolute foundation of\ninternational relations. My country deeply regrets that a\npotential double veto constituted an insurmountable\nobstacle that was inappropriate given the extreme urgency\nof the situation. We hope that resorting to force without\nthe Council's approval will not constitute a precedent. The\nworld needs an international legal order that prevails over\nthe law of the jungle. In this respect, we all hope that\nresolution 1244 (1999) signals a return to international\nlegality.\n17\n\n\nBelgium welcomes the decisive attitude of the Security\nCouncil regarding East Timor. We hope for a speedy\nrestoration of normality there, with the return of its\ninhabitants, reconstruction of the country and the\nestablishment of a state of law resulting from the expressed\nwill of its people.\nHere it is opportune to recall the urgent need for the\ninternational community to provide itself with the tools\nneeded to prevent and punish barbaric acts. We need a\ntribunal charged with prosecuting those responsible for the\ngravest crimes affecting the whole international community.\nThe adoption in Rome of the Statute of the International\nCriminal Court is an important landmark. I appeal to all\nStates to sign and ratify it so that the Court can start to\noperate as soon as possible. Belgium's ratification of the\nStatute is imminent. This new tribunal must be endowed\nwith the human and material means necessary for the\naccomplishment of its mission.\nThis leads me to the issue of United Nations reform,\nand primarily the reform of the Security Council.\nFor six years a Working Group under the guidance of\nthe President of the General Assembly has attempted, with\nmore or less success, to ascertain which reforms would\nmake it possible to re-gild the coat of arms of the Security\nCouncil. In spite of the efforts of successive Presidents,\nlittle progress has been made. Nevertheless, the scope of\nthe issue and possible improvements have been identified.\nI believe that new momentum can come only from a new\ndetermination on the part of our Governments.\nIn the view of my country, the Security Council is an\nanachronistic reflection of the world of 1946. In 53 years\nthe number of independent countries has grown fourfold,\nand new great Powers can, whether on economic,\ndemographic or geopolitical grounds, legitimately claim a\nlarger share of international responsibility.\nThe reasons for reform are evident. Lack of it,\ncontinuance of the status quo and opposition to change\ninvolve the following dangers.\nCountries which are legitimate candidates for a\npermanent seat on the Security Council, frustrated in their\nambitions, will be less inclined to contribute to the\ncollective effort to maintain peace, prevent conflict and give\nmultilateral development aid. Equally, other countries,\nunable to justifiably claim a permanent seat, will be\ndeprived of participation in shouldering global\nresponsibilities, because of their number and the lack of\nobjective rotation criteria. That will bring about a loss of\nrepresentativeness and legitimacy, and ultimately of the\nCouncil's authority.\nMy country chairs a group of 10 Member States\nseeking a solution that can command the broadest\npossible support. In spite of the obstacles, we intend to\npersevere.\nThe reforms that we are considering are not limited\nto the Security Council; they also aim at rendering the\nmachinery of the United Nations more effective and\nefficient. I pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\nwho has thrown himself into the task with great\ndetermination.\nThe United Nations continues to be an indispensable\nOrganization. It must be strengthened so that it can carry\nout the tasks and responsibilities given it by the Charter.\nReform is therefore essential to strengthen the\nmechanisms for the solidarity and harmonious\ndevelopment to which we all aspire.\nThis reform must be accompanied by a sound\nfinancial outlook. There has been no improvement over\nthe last 12 months; this situation must be redressed.\nBelgium, like the many other States which pay their\ncontributions on time and unconditionally, calls for all\nMember States to do the same. It will be understood, of\ncourse, that here I am looking particularly towards\nWashington. Belgium, a friend and ally of the United\nStates, reaffirms that it is essential that that country play\nits role in the United Nations. We all need the United\nStates, but it must shoulder its responsibilities, including\nits financial responsibilities, within our Organization.\nSo far I have mostly spoken of what is not working.\nBut there are many areas where progress, even\nconsiderable progress, is being made. The Organization\nhas played a considerable role in giving an ethical\ndimension to the criteria governing international relations.\nMy country welcomes this. As the first victim of\nchemical weapons \u2014 gas used on the battlefields of the\nYser \u2014 Belgium was a passionate advocate of the\nprocess that led to the conclusion and the implementation\nof the Chemical Weapons Convention. Similarly, we are\nsupporting the efforts to combat biological and\nbacteriological weapons and the fight to abolish anti-\npersonnel mines. We are also presently engaged in efforts\nto reduce the spread of small arms.\n18\n\n\nThe anarchistic accumulation of small arms and the\nscourge of anti-personnel mines remain among the most\nacute problems at this close of the century. These weapons\nexacerbate conflicts and are instruments of death and terror,\nin Africa as well as in Asia, Latin America and the\nBalkans. Nor do the societies of Western Europe and North\nAmerica escape this cancer, the full extent of which has yet\nto be felt.\nSeveral initiatives have been taken to tackle these\nproblems, and my country was fully involved in them. By\nway of example I would like to mention the Brussels\nconference of October 1998 and the Code of Conduct and\nthe common action of the European Union, as well as our\nparticipation in and financial support for the expert groups\nset up by the Secretary-General.\nWe will continue our policy of prevention and\nreduction with regard to accumulations of small arms, as\nwell as our fight for the abolition of anti-personnel mines.\nIn general, in the appropriate forums we will continue\nto take initiatives to promote arms control and disarmament.\nI am thinking, for example, of the reinforcement of the\nBiological Weapons Convention, limitations on arms-\ntrafficking, the intensification of the fight against the\nviolation of embargoes on weapons transfers and the fight\nagainst the increase of nuclear arsenals.\nFrom economic and social development to\ndisarmament or humanitarian intervention, there is a central\ntheme that underlies all our actions: human rights. It has\nbecome clearer and clearer in the past few years that human\nrights are intertwined with the promotion of international\npeace and security, economic prosperity, sustainable\ndevelopment and social justice.\nIn all the reforms of the activities and the structures of\nthe United Nations that have been carried out with the\nimpetus of the Secretary-General, the promotion of human\nrights is a cross-cutting theme involving all the\norganizations and agencies that operate on a global scale.\nBelgium supports this global and integrated approach\nwithout reservations; but the task is immense. Thus, it is in\nthe interest of the United Nations to ensure the\ncollaboration of regional organizations, whose competencies\nand potential in this field can help in the achievement of\nthese common objectives.\nThe inaugural address of the new Belgian Government\nunequivocally put human rights at the top of its agenda and\nannounced its intention of pursuing an active policy\nwithin all the relevant international organizations.\nI would like to pay particular homage to our\nSecretary-General, whose patience and tact have often\nmade the difference in extremely difficult circumstances.\nMy Government remains a steadfast supporter of all his\ninitiatives to prepare our Organization for the challenges,\nknown and unknown, that lie ahead in the next century.\nThrough the Secretary-General I would like to pay\nspecial tribute to the United Nations personnel, and\nparticularly to all those who died on the field of honour\nin humanitarian or peacekeeping missions. Every year the\nlist of victims gets longer. My country appeals to the\nglobal conscience to respect United Nations personnel and\nto ensure that crimes against them do not go unpunished.\nIn conclusion, I sincerely hope that the actions of the\nSecretary-General will make our Organization more\ncredible and more effective, for the United Nations\nremains the indispensable universal instrument to achieve\nour common goals. It is a beacon in an increasingly\ninterdependent world, a source of hope for the Yaguines\nand Fod\u00e9s of all the continents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On the occasion\nof this historic final session of the General Assembly of the\ncurrent millennium, which is my first, as I took office in\nMay this year, I extend, on behalf of the people of Djibouti,\nour sincere best wishes to all the members of the Assembly.\nI should also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at this fifty-\nfourth session. Your long and extensive experience with the\nUnited Nations, beginning as the representative of the\nSouth-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) before\nyour country's independence and continuing as its\nPermanent Observer, has afforded you a deep insight into\nthe internal workings of the Assembly, and the challenges\nit now faces. We are convinced that, thanks to your ample\nskills and commitment, this session of the Assembly will\nbring a remarkable period to a close on a very positive\nnote.\nWe also wish to express our gratitude to your\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for the\nexemplary manner in which he conducted the work of the\nGeneral Assembly. The fact that the Assembly was able\nto accomplish so much at its fifty-third session was in\ngreat measure due to his dedication, skill and intelligent\nmanagement.\nWe must also acknowledge our great admiration for\nthe tireless efforts of the Secretary-General in continuing\nhis exemplary work under difficult and trying\ncircumstances. On too many fronts the Organization has\nbeen facing challenges which jeopardize its proper\nfunctioning, whether dealing with issues of peace and\nconflict, development, or addressing the severe poverty\nfaced by many in the world community. Despite a sharp\nreduction in the inflow of funds at a time of escalating\ndemands on the Organization, the Secretary-General has\nsucceeded in maintaining a high degree of effectiveness\nthrough intelligent rationalization and restructuring. The\nOrganization is therefore continuing to play an important\nrole in world affairs, which is in no small measure\nattributable to the enlightened leadership of the Secretary-\nGeneral.\nAs this millennium draws to a close, we find\nourselves in a post-cold-war era of globalism. The\ndoctrine that the general pursuit of economic and financial\nprosperity will necessarily lead to open markets, greater\n\n\ninternational movement of resources, capital and labour is\ndeeply entrenched. As we progress, it is claimed, this global\nsystem will produce freer societies and expanding middle\nclasses, which, in turn, will exert pressure for political\nfreedoms. In the end, it is also claimed, we can all expect\nthe spread of peace as countries become more\ninterdependent and economically integrated, for free\nsocieties do not go to war, at least with each other.\nThis model calls for the ascendancy of a more\nefficient private sector and a reduced role for government.\nFor developing countries, the pursuit of maximum\neconomic flexibility has been accompanied by a massive\nreorganization of legal, social, financial, economic, political\nand institutional structures \u2014 or, as it is known, structural\nadjustment. The cost of these changes has been\nconsiderable, not only in financial terms, but also in human\nand social terms as well. As the social safety net in many\ncountries consists of government jobs and services,\ndownsizing government has meant considerable suffering,\nand often with a political price to be paid.\nThanks to the spread of technology, particularly in the\ncommunications sector, it is now possible for companies\nand organizations to operate on a global scale and to enter\nvirtually any local market of their choosing. Consequently,\neconomic domination has shifted to the large, transnational\ncorporations and financial conglomerates, which are\nincreasingly the prime movers in most economic systems.\nPredictably, the poor and unprepared are increasingly\nisolated and marginalized. It is therefore not surprising that\nthere is a mounting and widespread backlash against the\ndestructive effects of this global juggernaut.\nThe old market economy system following the Second\nWorld War \u2014 the Marshall Plan era \u2014 survived because\nthere were few persistent losers. Everyone got something\nfrom the system and could claim ownership. We cannot say\nthat today, for the roster of losers is mounting ominously.\nThis is a distressing omen for the new millennium, made all\nthe more tragic and infuriating because of the abundance of\npossible remedies. We can make the system work\neffectively and beneficially if the will is there. But at\npresent the international community lacks determination and\na sense of compassion. That does not bode well for\nmankind.\nGlobalization and the rapid expansion and integration\nof the international economy have undoubtedly brought\nimmense benefits to many countries and positive changes\nin the living conditions of many individuals. However,\nmany countries and their populations, particularly in the\ndeveloping world, are increasingly facing marginalization\nand hopelessness because they are not able to cope with\nthe rapid pace of integration. The least developed\ncountries in particular require special attention so that\nthey do not slip further into the abyss of poverty and\ndisintegration.\nClearly, the Horn of Africa has had far more than its\nshare of wars, natural disasters, collapsing States,\neconomic decline and wasted national and human\npotential. For Djibouti, survival alone has consistently\npresented an enormous challenge. However, our nation\ntoday is stronger and more unified than ever before. We\nowe this to the wisdom, perseverance and foresight of our\nfirst President and father of the nation, my mentor, The\nHonourable Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who voluntarily\nretired a few months ago \u2014 a praiseworthy decision. He\nforged a nation and gave it purpose and strength. His\nenlightened leadership enabled us to remain at peace,\nwhile sensitive to our region's difficulties and needs. I am\nproud to follow in the footsteps of this great soul, and I\nam determined to safeguard his legacy and our democratic\ntraditions and institutions.\nDjibouti will continue to work for good governance,\ndemocracy and independence, with respect for human\nrights. We will continue, true to our cultural heritage, to\ngive sanctuary to people displaced by conflicts in our\nregion, despite the severe strain this puts on our meagre\nresources.\nAfrica has many hopeful spots, but there remain a\nnumber of disturbing conflicts involving nations, countless\nrebel and separatist movements and factions. Democratic\nelections took place a few months ago in two major\nStates of sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 Nigeria and South\nAfrica \u2014 and in smaller ones, such as Djibouti, while in\nmost of the major conflicts ravaging the continent\nceasefires or peace processes are under way.\nIn looking over these developments, what can we\nreasonably expect? What must we strive to bring about?\nOur first priority must be to bring conflict and destruction\nto an end. That is why ceasefires, the withdrawal of\ncombatants, disarmament, the settlement of conflicts, and\nthe resettlement of displaced persons are important\npriorities for Africa.\nAs conflicts rage in the heart of the continent, a\ndangerous new tendency has begun to appear. Conflicts\nare no longer localized or fought between two clear\nadversaries, but attract a growing legion of participants\n2\n\n\nwith divergent agendas. It is depressing to witness the\nmassive loss of life, the wanton destruction and the virtual\ncollapse of societies.\nWe are therefore relieved that the brutal conflict in\nSierra Leone is at last resolved. Besides Somalia, perhaps\nthe most worrying conflict now is Angola, where again\noutside actors appear to be playing significant roles.\nWe therefore naturally support the call of the\nSecretary-General, who in his report on conflict in Africa\ncalled for a reversal of the international community's great\nreluctance in recent years to assume the political and\nfinancial responsibilities associated with deploying\npeacekeeping operations.\nWe must also do everything we can to augment the\nUnited Nations capacity in humanitarian assistance, as well\nas in post-conflict peace-building.\nNone of this, though, should absolve Africa of the\nneed to come together to strengthen its own crisis response\nand peacekeeping capability, through the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and subregional organizations.\nLast year, in his address to this Assembly, my\npredecessor noted the sudden and surprising outbreak of\nmassive hostilities between our neighbours, Ethiopia and\nEritrea. This has been the cause of much anguish,\napprehension and instability in the Horn of Africa. The loss\nof life on both sides is among the greatest ever witnessed\nbetween African States. Persistent efforts by the OAU and\nvarious countries, including Djibouti, have proved to be in\nvain. Ethiopia is presently seeking further clarification on\nthe \u201ctechnical arrangements\u201d proposed by the OAU, and we\nhope that the ongoing efforts will produce the desired\nbreakthrough. If a ceasefire does not take effect and\nagreement is not reached, the destruction and further loss of\nlife will once again be deplorable. Years will be needed to\nrepair the damage done to ethnic tolerance and trust in the\nHorn of Africa. We therefore support the OAU, which is\ndemonstrating its tenacity and foresight in trying to bring\nabout a lasting resolution of this crisis.\nClearly, Eritrea needs to be a good neighbour to all its\nneighbours. Djibouti is now facing a relentless threat of\ndestabilization through incursions and landmines, as well as\nthe training and arming of disaffected elements. Rather than\nbeing confined to Ethiopia, hostilities have spread to\npractically every country in the Horn. We sincerely believe\nthat Eritrea would gain more as an equal partner in the\ncollective regional efforts to fashion a comprehensive\npeace, augment development and address the challenges\nof environmental degradation, rather than pursuing a\npolicy of confrontation and senseless and reckless\ndestabilization.\nThe renewed dialogue between the Palestinians and\nthe new Israeli leader appears to offer a promising\nopportunity for charting a new course in the Middle East.\nThe most urgent need is to restore confidence \u2014 a task\nthat will involve winning over the hearts and minds of\nPalestinians jaded by the cynicism of successive Israeli\nGovernments. The timely implementation of the\nprovisions of the recent agreement should help build the\nnecessary confidence by making the parties see reason.\nAdvantage must be taken of the current momentum,\ndespite the efforts of hostile factions.\nNow that a time-table has been set for the\nconsideration of final-status issues such as borders,\nsettlements, the status of Jerusalem, refugees, water and\nstatehood for Palestine, the outcome will depend on the\nwill and commitment of both sides. The road should also\nbe cleared for a settlement of the Golan Heights question\nand for the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, in\naccordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\nThe crippling sanctions imposed on Iraq almost a\ndecade ago have taken a heavy toll on the population,\nparticularly on the elderly, women and children. We urge\nthe international community to undertake a realistic\nreview of these sanctions with a view to lifting them\naltogether.\nThe Arab world and the world as a whole have\nrecently lost several remarkable and pragmatic leaders.\nKing Hussein of Jordan, the Amir of Bahrain and King\nHassan II of Morocco are no longer with us. Although we\nall feel a sense of loss at their premature demise, we have\nevery confidence their legacies will live on.\nMr. President, I beg your indulgence, as I would\nnow like to speak at length about the tragedy in Somalia.\nFor nearly a decade now we have been witnessing the\ninexorable disintegration of Somalia. With their country\nracked by violence and lacking a government, the Somali\npeople are being denied their basic human rights. It is\nimperative that every effort be made to alleviate the\nsuffering of the millions of Somalis who have been living\na precarious existence for a decade now. Housing and\nwater are alarmingly scarce. Rampant lawlessness\nprevails, the country is at a political impasse, and its\nfuture is bleak. If no concrete steps are taken, the result\n3\n\n\nwill be continued misery and despair, as well as the\ncontinued destabilization of Somalia's neighbours.\nThis unique situation, I would even say this tragedy,\nought to be given priority \u2014 the kind of serious\nconsideration that is given to other tragedies. We strongly\nbelieve that international and regional stability depend to a\nlarge extent on the domestic stability of all of the States\nMembers of this Organization.\nIt is tragic indeed that the international community is\nunwilling to acknowledge this reality, simply because, it\nseems, it has no vital national interests at stake there. So\nthe warlords are left to fight it out until a victor emerges\nand a degree of order is restored. Political will on the part\nof the international community can bring peace to Somalia,\ntoo.\nBecause of pervasive indifference and a lack of\nresolve, vision and action on our part, Somalia is\ncrumbling. It is no longer a politically viable entity. Indeed,\nthe continued anarchy in that country is indicative of the\nfailure of global governance to serve poor countries in the\ndeveloping world. The Somali people know that only too\nwell. A decade of violence, hunger, disease and uncertainty\nhas given rise to unparalleled levels of despair. All Somalis,\nit is safe to say, are living below the poverty line, and the\ndevastating civil war shows no signs of abating in most\nparts of the country. Somalia could easily become a magnet\nfor criminal elements, drug traffickers and terrorists as well\nas a dumping ground of dangerous toxic wastes.\nOverfishing by foreigners of Somalia's unprotected waters\nis also a cause of great concern to us.\nThe latest comprehensive report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on Somalia accurately notes that the country has\ndegenerated into a black hole of anarchy, with no national\ngovernment or attributes of statehood. The principal victims\nof this senseless conflict are an entire generation of Somali\nchildren, who are being denied access to education.\nThe United Nations intervened in Somalia in 1992\nwith all the right intentions: to restore peace, stability, and\nlaw and order. In this respect, it was entrusted with\nassisting the Somali people in rebuilding their economy and\ntheir social and political life; restoring their institutional\nstructures; achieving national political reconciliation; and\nrecreating a Somali state based on democratic governance.\nRegrettably, those laudable intentions came to naught\nfollowing the termination of the United Nations Operation\nin Somalia, due to the lack of cooperation from the Somali\nfactions over security issues, and despite the exceptional\ncircumstances, in particular the absence of a government\nin Somalia.\nSince the end of the United Nations operation, two\nconferences have given rise to a certain optimism \u2014 the\nEthiopian-sponsored Sodere conference and the Cairo\nconference, sponsored by the Egyptian Government.\nHowever, both conferences succeeded only in highlighting\nthe divisions among the warlords on the one hand and the\ninterested countries on the other.\nSeveral countries and organizations have worked\ntirelessly to restore some measure of governance in\nSomalia. The focus, though, has always remained on\nbringing together the feuding warlords in order to assist\nthem in reaching an agreement that would end the\nstalemate. But seeking a lasting settlement through the\nwarlords, as has repeatedly and unambiguously been\ndemonstrated throughout the conflict, has proved to be\nwishful thinking; uncertainty reigns, and the culture of\nimpunity persists. Lately, we have seen the formation of\nall sorts of political and military alliances across factional\nlines in a bid to pacify the country, but such initiatives\nare often greeted with scepticism or even criticism by\nother factions and even by certain countries. Clearly, not\na single factional leader can claim national support or\nacceptance, because Somali civil society has grown\ncynical about a political game devoid of sincerity, vision\nand substance.\nEverybody agrees in recognizing that the warlords\ncan offer nothing that would lead us to believe that they\nwill ever agree on a lasting settlement, much less the\nimplementation of conclusions agreed between them. The\npeople are tired of false rhetoric and deception, as they\nbecome poorer and their future becomes bleaker every\nday. Even beyond Somalia, the warlords pose a potential\nthreat. They need to be resisted, for there is the very real\nproblem of a \u201ccontagion\u201d effect, whereby chronic\ninstability in one country in the Horn might prove to be\na real threat to its neighbours, if it is not contained or\neliminated within a reasonable period of time.\nLiberia\u2019s seven-year war, with its child soldiers and\nunspeakable atrocities against civilians, helped set a tragic\npattern that was repeated in Sierra Leone. Obviously,\nalready inundated with weapons, Somalia hardly needs\nexternal involvement by way of arms supplies or proxy\nconfrontations, but that is precisely what is now taking\nplace in that country. For all of us, this situation only\nincreases our worry about Somalia\u2019s future.\n4\n\n\nThe challenge that we now face is therefore of\nestablishing an authority to fill the void that is continuously\nbeing exploited by the warlords. Convening more\nconferences that always yield the same results, as has been\nthe case over the last 10 years is not the remedy. If we\ncontinue to entertain the notion of holding yet more of the\nso-called national reconciliation conferences indefinitely, or\ninto the next decade, in search of peace in Somalia, then\nwe are, in effect, saying that Somali civil society is\ncondemned to an uncertain future, because the international\ncommunity is not prepared to protect it from criminal\nelements that usurped power. Despite the \u201clegitimacy\u201d\nwrongly accorded them by the international community,\nthey have never agreed, and will never agree, on anything.\nTrying to appease the warlords has never succeeded and\nnever will.\nThe Somalis, too, have human rights; they have the\nsame right as others to be protected from oppressive,\nmalicious and power-hungry individuals who continually\nand freely move from one capital to another, raising funds\nand securing armaments. Although these individuals are\nresponsible for the destruction of their country, for the\ndeaths of tens of thousands of innocent civilians, countless\nnumbers of casualties and for the paralysis that immobilizes\nthe country to this day, the international community did not\nintervene in Somalia, \u201cto defend humanitarian principles\nand to stand up for the values of civilization and justice\u201d,\nas one Western leader stated in justifying the Kosovo\noperation. The United Nations Operation in Somalia was\nalso saddled with ambiguities in its mandate and there was\nnever an intention to rid the country of the warlords.\nFurthermore, Kosovo represents a clear case of\ndetermined and vigorous action to achieve a specific\nobjective \u2014 to drive the marauding Serb army from\nKosovo. Furthermore, the United Nations operation in\nKosovo is vested with unprecedented power, because the\ncircumstances warrant the exercise of nearly sovereign\npowers. It has authority over the territory, the people of\nKosovo, the legislative and the executive powers of\nKosovo, including the administration of the judiciary\nsystem. That mandate is a far cry from that in Somalia; but\nthen Somalia is not Kosovo.\nWe all agree that the current level of fragmentation\ncannot be allowed to continue. Many ideas have been\nfloated in the past, but none of these will succeed or even\nsurvive as long as the warlords have the luxury of\ndetermining the fate of Somalia. Indeed, they continue to\nexercise a veto over the restoration of peace and national\nauthority. The question remains, for how many more years\nwill Somali society have to wait until the warlords accept\na power-sharing coalition? Until a final victor emerges?\nFor ever?\nLiberia was reconstituted through strong international\nefforts. Warlords of varying levels of power and support\neventually submitted to international pressures and\naccepted independent, internationally supervised\ndemocratic elections, followed by the implementation of\nagreements during a year of transition carried out under\nthe leadership of an individual \u2014 in fact, a woman \u2014 not\naffiliated with any of the warlords. The elections were\ndescribed as \u201cfree and fair\u201d, and Liberians were thus able\nto bid farewell at last to a destructive and intractable\nconflict. This was indeed an exemplary process in which\nthe Economic Community of West African States,\nsupported by the United Nations, played a leading role.\nSince the outbreak of the Somali crisis some 10\nyears ago, the United Nations, the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, the League of Arab States, the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development and our\nsubregional organization, as well as many countries, both\nwithin and outside the region, have tried to salvage that\nnation from mayhem, anarchy and political paralysis\nthrough all kinds of conferences, meetings and contacts\nwith and among the warlords. Sadly, however, the\nwarlords have repeatedly demonstrated their unwillingness\nto heed the international community\u2019s call to put the good\nof the country above their individual lust for power and\ncontrol.\nWe have to ask ourselves, as leaders of the world\nassembled here, what should be done about Somalia. The\ntime has come, in our view, for the international\ncommunity to take a decision to break the long silence on\nthis forgotten conflict by supporting bold, decisive\nmeasures against the warlords.\nThat is why, after deep reflection and after taking\ninto account all relevant factors, I felt compelled to set\nout before the Assembly today a series of proposals and\nphased measures that would be the expression of our\noutrage, frustration and impatience with the status quo\nperpetuated by the warlords.\nThe first phase has to do with the fact that the\nwarlords, as I have described with great sorrow, have\nfailed on every count during this long, intractable civil\nwar. Thus, I am loath to support yet another conference\nheld for these men who have completely lost the\n5\n\n\nconfidence of their people. It is time Somali civil society \u2014\nincluding intellectuals, artists and mothers \u2014 assumed\nresponsibility.\nThe Somali people has matured politically during these\nyears of suffering and knows what it needs: economic\nprosperity and social progress in a context of democracy,\nliberty and peace.\nIn line with the wishes of the Somali people, Djibouti\nis embarking upon measures intended; to enhance and\nstrengthen Somali\u2019s confidence in themselves, in each other\nand in their common destiny; to make a real contract of\ntrust and progress between the actors of economic, social,\ncultural and intellectual life; and to implement with\ndetermination, serenity and equity the work of\nrehabilitation, political, economic and administrative\nnormalization and the promotion of the culture of dialogue\nbetween the Somali people in order to create a lasting\nenvironment of dialogue for the emergence of a new\ngeneration of decision makers.\nIn order for Djibouti to have confidence in the Somali\npeople\u2019s responsibility for its future, Somali citizens must\nfinally be given the right to speak out so that they can\nrestore the essential values of liberty, truth, justice,\nresponsibility and transparency. By working for and basing\nthemselves on Somali civil society through the holding of\na genuine reconciliation conference, the representatives of\nthe Somali people, including the warlords, will be\ncommitting themselves to the path of peace and national\nreconciliation.\nWe seek a Somalia led and governed by the best\npeople drawn from all generations, in particular people who\ninspire confidence because of their commitment to law,\njustice, freedom and peace; those who will govern with a\nview to fulfilling a mandate that can be withdrawn at any\ntime in accordance with the requirements of the common\ngood; those who do not think only of profiting by the\nmisfortune of their brethren to gain a scrap of power no\nmatter what the cost to the Somali nation. Somalia needs\nthose men and women who in spite of everything have\nretained their ethical values, the force of their personalities\nand their intellectual and spiritual dynamism: free men and\nwomen who are ready to offer their fellow Somalis a\ncredible way out of their tragedy that will be consistent\nwith the cultural heritage and collective memory of the\nSomali people.\nThe reconciliation conference must give rise to\nagreement and commitment by all Somalis to the following\nprinciples. First, there must be acceptance of the basic\nprinciple that the Somali people is free to exercise its\ndemocratic right to select its own regional and national\nleaders in accordance with a time-frame of its own\nchoosing. Secondly, the warlords must agree to convert\ntheir factions into political parties that can compete in\nelections if they choose to do so. Thirdly, the warlords\nmust agree to the complete and verifiable disarmament of\ntheir fighters. Fourthly, the warlords must submit to the\nprimacy of law. Fifthly, the warlords must accede to the\ninternational community\u2019s request to participate in the\nrestoration of normalcy, law and order, and a framework\nfor governance. And finally, a national police force must\nbe established, one that will represent the entire Somali\ncommunity and that can incorporate the various militias,\nwhich will have the opportunity to participate in it.\nHere I should say that some countries in or outside\nof the Horn of Africa, which in one way or another are\nfueling the conflict in Somalia, must reconsider their\npositions. These countries are pursuing narrow national\ninterests by supporting the profusion of warlords in\nvarious ways, and they are only prolonging the agony and\nprivation of Somali civil society. I call on all actors in the\ncivil war to review their priorities with a view to\nachieving peace in Somalia. It is time that they controlled\nthemselves: high time.\nWhen they can agree that the warlords fully support\nor accept the parameters of phase one, the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU), the United Nations and the\ncountries of the region must work together to help\nSomalia in its transition to democracy. As in Guinea-\nBissau, the United Nations should establish a post-conflict\npeace-building office in Somalia to initiate projects in\nsupport of this process, including by coordinating and\nmonitoring the holding of legislative and presidential\nelections.\nI turn now to phase two. If the warlords place\ninsurmountable obstacles on the road to peace, the\ninternational community will have to shoulder its\nresponsibility and demonstrate robustly that it cannot let\nthe persecution of Somali civilians continue indefinitely\nwithout taking action. The warlords must in that case be\nprosecuted for crimes against humanity: for abuse of\npower, especially through the unjustified persecution of\ncivilians; for flagrant violations of human rights; and for\nhaving caused the collapse of the State and the\ndestruction of their country. With their unabated violence\nand their erratic behaviour, the warlords have stolen the\nchildhood from Somalia\u2019s young people; they have\n6\n\n\ndeprived their nation of hope and of a future; they have\ncondemned their people to a precarious existence.\nMoreover, harsh and targeted punishment must be\nmeted out to warlords who do not agree to the international\ncommunity\u2019s demand that peace and a framework for\ngovernance be restored in Somalia: they must be confined\nto their bleak and battered areas; they must be banned from\nfreely traveling abroad to further their sinister designs; all\nforeign support and all assistance, whether monetary or\nmaterial, must be banned; and all their assets, in all forms\nand wherever they are located, must be frozen.\nTurning to phase three, if the measures set out in the\nfirst two phases cannot achieve the objectives because of\nobstruction by the warlords, we would be faced with two\ndifficult choices: We could continue to remain indifferent\nand to do nothing about the decade-old siege of Somalia; or\norganizations to which Somalia belongs, first and foremost\nthe Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab\nStates, with support from the United Nations and from\nother countries, could decide that they were obliged to\nresolve the situation by using all necessary means on the\nprinciple that no State \u2014 or criminal warlord in this\ncase \u2014 may continue indefinitely to commit flagrant\nviolations of human rights and to hold a country hostage\nforever.\nThose are the critical scenarios we need to discuss,\nbecause, however much one might wish to forget Somalia,\nit will not just go away. We must do something to remedy\nthe situation, and we must do it as quickly as possible.\nLet me reiterate that we must put an end to the\ncomplacency we have displayed towards the warlords, and\nthat Somali civil society must be more closely involved in\nany future process.\nIt is important to note that the situation is not the same\nin all regions of the country; anarchy does not prevail\neverywhere. Somalia has many contrasting faces depending\non the region. While disorder reigns in areas of the centre\nand the South, northern regions such as the self-proclaimed\nstates of Somaliland and Puntland are enjoying relative\npeace and stability. Those two areas fortunately escaped\nmost of the conflict that ravaged the country in the 1990s.\nThey have made a great effort to strengthen security and,\nwith very little outside assistance, have carried out\nadmittedly limited economic reconstruction programmes.\nThe international community has thus far been wary of\nproviding meaningful assistance, on the pretext that the\npolitical and security situation makes it impossible.\nAs we meet here today, communities in many towns\nand regions are organizing to determine their own future.\nThis trend towards decentralization or self-administration\nis based on the strong determination of the Somalis not to\nsuccumb, but rather to survive. The international\ncommunity is duty-bound to provide economic support for\nthese regions and communities that have achieved relative\npeace, security and the beginnings of development: near-\nnormalcy. The international community should reward\nthose who are trying to provide their people with basic\nservices, including an institutional framework and mine-\nclearance efforts.\nI am grateful to the Secretary-General, who has\nplaced the question of Somalia high on the international\nagenda, and to United Nations agencies such as the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund, the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food\nProgramme and their partners, who have provided food\nand care to the Somali people despite the risks for the\nsafety of their personnel. But these praiseworthy efforts\nseem to be showing some fatigue, even frustration,\nbecause of inadequate support from donors, as reflected\nin the lukewarm response to the 1999 United Nations\nappeal. We urge the international community to continue\nto help the Somali people during these times, which are\nparticularly difficult due in part to the long drought,\nfurther exacerbated by the ongoing civil war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "There is no doubt that the twentieth century, which is now\ncoming to a close, will leave a deep imprint on the history\nof the world. This has been an epoch of global\ntransformation and social change, scientific discoveries and\nachievements. The realization of the idea of a universal\nworld Organization, which has become the foundation\nuniting the entire international community, has indeed been\none of the positive things about this century.\nHowever, the twentieth century has witnessed the most\nsevere upheavals. Millions of people have perished in the\nflames of world wars, revolutions and civil and ethnic\nconflicts. On a few occasions, humanity teetered on the\nbrink of self-destruction, and the burden of outstanding\nproblems it has left for the new era is a heavy one. We\ncannot resolve all these problems before the advent of the\nthird millennium, but we are indeed duty bound to lay\ndown the foundations for resolving them in the long-term\nand to start moving in that direction.\nThe most important thing we should do is to define\nthe parameters of the world in which we are going to live.\nThis lies at the core of the initiative put forward by the\nPresident of the Russian Federation, President Yeltsin, to\ndevelop a world concept for the twenty-first century. As a\nworld Power and permanent member of the Security\nCouncil, Russia is fully conscious of its special role in and\nresponsibility for world developments and stands for the\nestablishment of a multipolar world built on a solid\nfoundation of international law. Our country is pursuing in\npractice a multifaceted foreign policy with a view to\nestablishing equitable and mutually beneficial bilateral and\nmultilateral relations with all the countries of the world and\nto strengthening international security and stability.\nThe world concept for the twenty-first century\ninvolves establishing a new culture which would aim to\nform a common system of values and models of\nbehaviour. A world without wars and conflict, a world of\ndemocracy and prosperity must be the highest priority for\nall peoples and States. Every nation is entitled to its\nrightful place among other nations and to security on an\nequal footing in all its aspects, including in the political,\nmilitary, economic and social areas.\nHow and through what mechanisms can this be\nachieved? Is there a body which can reflect the interests\nof all States in a balanced manner? The answer is\nobvious: it is the United Nations. From the outset, the\nUnited Nations Charter put the Organization at the service\nof all humankind. There is simply no other universal\nmechanism to regulate international relations.\nWe are fully aware of the danger posed by the\nthreats and challenges facing our world today: the various\nmanifestations of militant nationalism, separatism,\nterrorism and extremism, which know no borders. This is\na common challenge which is claiming countless victims\nand wreaking destruction in various parts of the globe.\nAggressive separatism, which has become a growth\nmedium for various extremist forces, has become one of\nthe main sources of domestic conflict and regional\ninstability. No one is immune to it. The international\ncommunity and, above all, the United Nations, must\ndecisively clamp down on any manifestations of\nseparatism and strictly and consistently defend the\nprinciples of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\nStates and the inviolability of their borders. Outside\nencouragement and support for separatist forces must be\ntotally eradicated.\nRecently, separatism has been increasingly merging\nwith the monster of terrorism. We could even now, during\nthis session, take a number of specific steps to stimulate\npractical international cooperation in combating terrorism.\nWe must finalize the draft international convention on the\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. I therefore\nsuggest that we should develop and adopt a declaration of\nprinciples for cooperation between States on combating\nterrorism more vigorously. It is the States\u2019 bounden duty\nto protect their citizens against terrorist attacks and to\nprevent activities from taking place in their territory that\nare aimed at organizing such acts against the citizens of\nother countries. Russia therefore supports the initiative to\nconvene, under United Nations auspices, a conference or\na special session of the General Assembly next year on\n13\n\n\ncombating terrorism. Such an event would give a powerful\npolitical impetus to the struggle against terrorism at a global\nlevel.\nThe capabilities of the United Nations should also be\nused more efficiently in the fight against drug-related\nthreats and organized crime. Only through joint efforts that\nare also in strict compliance with the rules of international\nlaw can we defeat this evil.\nThe founding fathers of the United Nations made\nprovision for a law-based response to violations of peace\nand security. The international community can take also\ncoercive measures, but this should be done in accordance\nwith the Charter and following a decision by the Security\nCouncil. Unlawful means can only undermine rightful ends.\nIt is from this very perspective that we assess such\ndoctrines as that of humanitarian intervention. In general,\nwe should take an extremely careful approach to coercive\nmeasures; what is more, we must not allow them to turn\ninto a repressive mechanism for influencing States and\npeoples that are not to the liking of some.\nOf course, evolution of the international situation\nmeans that it is appropriate for existing rules of\ninternational law to be developed and adapted to prevailing\nconditions, but this should be done through collective\ndiscussion and the adoption of appropriate decisions, not as\na fait accompli and not working from scratch: it should be\nbased on valid rules of international law. This is precisely\nwhat Russia had in mind with its initiative to consider at\nthe Millennium Summit legal aspects of the use of force in\ninternational relations in the era of globalization. We invite\nall countries to a broad and open dialogue on this issue.\nMuch has been said in recent years about the reform\nof the United Nations, which is only natural. Life is an\nevolving process and, as times change, any system will\nneed to be updated. What objectives future reform should\npursue is another matter. In our view, reform means, first\nand foremost, the adoption of a package of measures to\nenhance the role of the United Nations in the world arena.\nThe Organization should be ready to respond in a timely\nand appropriate way to the challenges that globalization\npresents to mankind. We must give serious thought to how\nto enhance the efficiency of the Security Council and how\nto make that principal organ of the United Nations more\nrepresentative through the inclusion of influential new\nmembers, including \u2014 and this is absolutely\nindispensable \u2014 developing countries. This would help\nmaintain the overall balance in the system of international\nrelations, especially when the use of force, bypassing the\nSecurity Council, continues. It is also beyond doubt that\npreservation of the right of veto of permanent members\nis indispensable for meaningful and efficient work in the\nCouncil.\nGenerally speaking, the entire system of international\norganizations needs sensible and responsible reform. At\nthe same time, the United Nations must remain a focal\npoint of the international community\u2019s efforts to settle the\nmost burning problems of the day. The issue of\nstrengthening the authority of the United Nations after it\nhas been seriously and painfully tested by the Balkan and\nIraq crises is at the very top of the agenda at the current\nsession of the General Assembly. First of all, we must\ncontinue strenuous efforts to restore the role of the\nSecurity Council in world affairs.\nWe have managed through joint efforts to bring the\nsettlement of the Kosovo problem back within the legal\nand political framework of the United Nations. Now we\nneed jointly to strive for strict and consistent\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244\n(1999). We cannot afford to let the re-emerging political\nprocess be undermined again, since that could become a\ntragedy for all of Europe and could once again bring the\nworld to the brink of catastrophe. Equally urgent is the\nissue of post-conflict rehabilitation in the Balkans. The\nUnited Nations has an important role to play in meeting\nthese challenges as well.\nWe all should draw serious lessons from recent\ncrises. Non-legitimate methods of exerting power only\nexacerbate problems and result in even greater deadlock.\nDevelopments in the Middle East, where the peace\nprocess has of late acquired a new positive impetus,\nclearly exemplify the optimal alternative, that of\nnegotiated settlement.\nAlso on the agenda is the issue of improving\nsanctions regimes, to which the international community\nhas frequently resorted over the past decade. Sanctions\nare an extreme measure. They must be applied only when\nother means of political influence have been exhausted\nand when the Security Council has established the\nexistence of a threat to peace. The Council, for its part,\nshould be guided by clear criteria for the imposition and\nthe lifting of sanctions, and should not permit any free\ninterpretation of the decisions it has adopted, much less\npermit the use of its decisions by anyone for selfish\npolitical or economic ends. It is necessary to take very\nserious account of the humanitarian implications of\nsanctions both for the population of the States subject to\n14\n\n\nsuch sanctions and for third countries. The punishment of\nentire nations, especially for an indefinite time and\nindiscriminately, is inadmissible.\nPeacemaking is one of the key areas of United Nations\nactivities. During the past 50 years the Organization has\nacquired vast practical experience in this field. Having\nsuccessfully survived intense disputes and ideological\nbattles, peacemaking has proved its vital power and\nimportance for securing world and regional stability. The\nevolution of the theory and practice of present-day\npeacemaking confirms that there is no alternative to\nmaintaining the central role of the United Nations in this\nsphere. The encouragement of peacemaking and the\nstrengthening of its legal basis in strict conformity with the\nfundamental principles of the Charter should become an\nimportant component of the concept of the world in the\ntwenty-first century. Building up and modernizing the anti-\ncrisis capability of the United Nations is a key prerequisite\nfor tackling these tasks successfully. The top priority here\nis to begin truly using the system of stand-by agreements\nwith the United Nations.\nTaking into account the limited resources of the world\nOrganization, and given the high demand for peacekeeping\noperations, cooperation and division of labour between the\nUnited Nations and regional structures has become a\npriority. It is of fundamental importance that such\ncooperation should be in strict accordance with Chapter\nVIII of the Charter and should be fully consistent with the\nprerogatives of the Security Council.\nFor Russia, the question of peacemaking cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations is\nfar from theoretical. For many years, Russian peacemakers\nwithin the peacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS) have contributed to stabilizing the\nsituations in Abkhazia, Georgia, in Tajikistan, and in Trans-\nDniestria, Moldova. This testifies to the fact that the\nsettlement of conflicts within the framework of the CIS is\na priority for Russia. As before, we do not see any\nreasonable alternative to political settlement of these crisis\nsituations, for which political will, patience and\ncommitment to one\u2019s obligations are needed. We consider\nit important for the United Nations to continue to play a\nprominent role in finding solutions in Tajikistan and in\nAbkhazia, Georgia.\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE), which is called upon to play a central role\nin ensuring European security and stability, can and should\nbe the main United Nations peacemaking partner in Europe.\nWhen this arrangement fails to work, not only do specific\nEuropean countries suffer, but providing for global and\ncontinental security becomes complicated. In a broad\nsense, OSCE peacemaking parameters, ranging from\nconflict prevention to peacekeeping operations and post-\nconflict rehabilitation, should be defined in a charter on\nEuropean security. Russia proposes too that the charter\nshould also reflect such principles important for the future\nof Europeans as ensuring the security and the foundations\nof the relations between European and Euro-Atlantic\norganizations in this area. Then the charter will indeed\nbecome a kind of political constitution for the Europe of\nthe twenty-first century. As the Istanbul summit of the\nOSCE, which is expected to adopt the charter, is\napproaching fast, we should press ahead with the\nformulation of a substantive document.\nThe Conference on Interaction and Confidence-\nbuilding Measures in Asia may become an important\nfactor for stability on the Asian continent after the new\npositive impetus it received at the recent Almaty Foreign\nAffairs Ministers\u2019 Meeting of the founding States. The\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nRegional Forum, a venue for active dialogue on a broad\nspectrum of urgent international issues, is yet another\nexample of the focus of the Asian countries on the\nformation of solid structures for security and cooperation\non the continent.\nIt is necessary to enhance the potential of African\nregional and subregional organizations, which are acting\nin close cooperation with the United Nations to curb and\ncope with conflicts and humanitarian catastrophes\nemerging in Africa. It is the duty of the international\ncommunity to render every possible support to the\nAfrican peoples.\nWhile strengthening the legal and practical basis of\npeacemaking activities, special attention should be paid to\nwhat is commonly called the human rights dimension.\nThis relates not only to measures to minimize human\nsufferings caused by armed conflicts, but also to efforts\naimed at preventing humanitarian crises.\nIn this connection, I cannot fail to mention the\nunacceptable situation of countless thousands of people in\nthe centre of Europe who, due to arbitrary actions by\nauthorities, have found themselves deprived of their\ncitizenship and of the right to use their native language\nand enjoy full rights in their State of residence. Civilized\nintegration, rather than latent assimilation \u2014 this is the\nway out of the prevailing humanitarian situation in these\n15\n\n\ncountries. We welcome the efforts of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council\nof Europe and the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS)\naimed at eliminating violations of human rights and\nfreedoms of the non-indigenous population of Latvia and\nEstonia. We hope that the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights will make her contribution\nto these efforts.\nThe risk of losing positive dynamics in the sphere of\ndisarmament as a result of attempts to rely on unilateral\npower methods cannot but cause concern. If the political\nand legal fabric regulating international relations continues\nto disintegrate further, then trends to ensure national\nsecurity through an arms race will become even stronger.\nRussia has consistently advocated the reduction and\nlimitation of nuclear arsenals and strict compliance with the\nnon-proliferation regime. For without this, ensuring\nstrategic stability would prove impossible.\nWe realize the importance of early ratification of the\nSTART II Treaty and of the initiation of START III\nnegotiations, under which Russia would be prepared, on a\nreciprocal basis, to agree to considerable further reduction\nof strategic offensive armaments. Naturally, this process\nwill be feasible only if the existing agreements in this field,\nfirst of all the ABM Treaty, are strictly observed. We\nbelieve that the General Assembly should come out clearly\nin support of the preservation and observance of the ABM\nTreaty, which is a cornerstone of strategic stability, because\nunilateral actions aimed at undermining the time-tested\nregime established by this Treaty are fraught with\nextremely dangerous consequences. A collective search for\npolitical and diplomatic solutions is the alternative to\nmilitary responses to the problems of proliferation. This is\nprecisely the target of Russia\u2019s initiative concerning the\nglobal system of control over proliferation of missiles and\nmissile technologies.\nSubstantive discussions on threats to international\ninformation security must also be continued within the\nframework and under the auspices of the United Nations.\nThe time has come to reach, through joint efforts, a\ncommon understanding of such threats and of measures to\nreduce them.\nThe twentieth century has brought about economic\nglobalization. All economies have become open and closely\nlinked as a result of advances in science and technology.\nAll these factors have provided a powerful impetus to\nsocial and economic development while creating their own\nspecific problems. The gap between the industrial and the\nformerly colonial worlds has not only persisted but has\nbegun to widen. Development assistance should remain a\nprincipal focus of future United Nations activities. Crises,\nprimarily financial ones, have assumed an international\ncharacter. We must draw the appropriate lessons and\nmodernize the architecture of the world financial system.\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies should\nplay a role here.\nThe expansion of human economic activities has\nbrought about a globalization of both natural and\nman-made disasters, and this has become a major\ndestabilizing global factor. The challenges related to the\nprevention of such disasters and the elimination of their\nconsequences require that the most advanced technologies\nbe used for the benefit of the world community as a\nwhole. Why not consider, therefore, the establishment,\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, of a specialized\ninternational emergency agency which would assume\nrelevant functions?\nA widely known saying reads: \\\"It is much easier to\nwin a war than a peace.\\\" The United Nations founders\nwon the war and laid the foundations for peace. It is our\nduty to win this peace and to make it comprehensive and\nirreversible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The men of the Andes scrutinized the skies to\ndecipher and predict the future. If they were looking at\nthe skies today, they might not manage to understand the\nmessage written there. On the one hand, there is the\npromise of unlimited prosperity, with man in apparent\ncontrol of nature and his environment, thanks to the\noutstanding strides made in knowledge, the tireless flow\nof data and financial resources, the almost genetic\ntransformation of the means of transportation and\ncommunication, the growing empire of freedom and the\nreaffirmation of democratic values on a global scale.\nOn the other hand, however, the new millennium is\narriving with disquieting signs. Financial crises are\nincreasingly frequent and ever more acute. The gaps\nbetween the haves and the have-nots are widening.\nConfusions, fear and uncertainty prevail over a large part\nof the planet. Thus must one see both sides of\nglobalization: one of promise, the other of threat.\nThe effects of the two aspects of the process are felt\nin Latin America with singular intensity. The crisis of the\nfinancial markets and the constant decline in commodity\nprices have struck at the heart of the economies of our\nsocieties and subjected them to pressure, in some cases\nintolerable. Nothing seems to be in its place and few dare\nto anticipate the future.\n8\n\n\nNevertheless, the men and women of Latin America\nhave a right to keep hoping. My own country maintains a\nvery cautious optimism. Not many years ago, Bolivia felt\nwith particular intensity the tragedy that is affecting other\nnations of Latin America. Drug trafficking, the external\ndebt, the collapse of mining and the crisis in the political\nsystem all conspired to create a picture of confusion and\nanguish that seemed to be insurmountable.\nWhat we have done since then belongs to history. I\nshall summarize it here for no other reason than to share\nour experience, because our task, far from over, seems to\nhave only just begun.\nTired of sterile and debilitating political confrontation,\nBolivians decided to take the road of cooperation and\ndialogue. The coalition Governments on which the political\nsystem has been based and nurtured since the early 1980s\nproved the intelligence of an old constitutional norm, but\nthey also showed that the letter of the law is worthless if it\nis not steeped in the spirit in which it was written. It was\nin the spirit of questing for consensus that the political\nConstitution was reaffirmed, the true independence of the\nNational Electoral Tribunal was guaranteed and the\nConstitutional Tribunal, the Judicial Council and the Office\nof Ombudsman were established. Lastly, institutions and\nsocial organizations were incorporated into the discussions\nof the major problems affecting the nation in a dialogue\nthat President Hugo Banzer, at the start of his mandate,\ncalled on to support the Government\u2019s work with a broad\ncivic consensus.\nThe first conclusion that can be drawn from this rapid\nsummary is that the economy cannot be modernized without\na solid base of political reform. Indeed, it was on that\npolitical foundation, on the basis of the will of the people\nrepresented by the parties, that we were able to make\nstrides in modernizing and opening up the Bolivian\neconomy. We controlled inflation. We renegotiated and\nreduced the external debt burden. We transferred control of\npublic companies to the private sector, and we created the\nconditions for the sustained development of Bolivia.\nHowever, when we seemed to be achieving the\nimpetus required to launch that development, the Asian\ncrisis and its effects on our region abruptly slowed down\nthe rate of our growth, after almost a decade of a modest\nincrease in per capita income. The storm will pass,\nundoubtedly, but I cannot deny that the legitimate\nexpectations for development have been affected by this\nsudden and unexpected return of old fears.\nWe know how Bolivia managed to control its\neconomy, and you have already heard the figures that\nshow how the reserves grew, the way the fiscal deficit\nwas reduced and the mechanism that enabled us to go\nfrom an inflation rate of more than 20,000 per cent per\nyear in 1984 to 4 per cent in 1998, just to mention the\nmost significant data.\nBut there are other things that are sometimes\noverlooked. One is that the process of structural\ntransformation requires perseverance and time. Bolivia\npersevered, perhaps because it had had difficult\nexperiences. Nevertheless, more than a decade was\nnecessary to come out of that emergency situation. The\nother element is that what was built in years of sacrifice\ncan be lost in a moment of inattention or rashness.\nWith all the limits and difficulties that were involved\nin the transition process that began in the early 1980s, the\nliving conditions of Bolivians improved significantly, as\nwe see in the data that was published in the last United\nNations Human Development Report. Public spending on\neducation increased from 2.1 per cent of the gross\ndomestic product in 1985 to 5.6 per cent in 1997.\nIlliteracy in young people under 15 years of age was\npractically eradicated. Between 1976 and 1997 the\nmortality rate of breast-fed infants dropped from 144 of\nevery 1,000 live births to 69, and life expectancy grew\nfrom 45 to 61 years of age in the same period. However,\nwe have to say that the growth rate is still insufficient and\nunfair.\nAs in other countries, development was focused on\na particular segment of Bolivian society. Therefore the\nfight against poverty is the main task of the Government\nof President B\u00e1nzer. Thus the cornerstone of that strategy\nis the active participation of the very sectors that had\nbeen ignored in choosing ways and means through an\nintelligent and active decentralization mechanism. There\nis full awareness that access to the means of production\nshould be added to the effort that has already been made\nin allocating resources to social, educational and health\npolicies.\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, when we began the\ndemocratic stage I have just described, illicit drug\ntrafficking cast a long shadow over development in\nBolivia. At the critical moment of the collapse of tin\nmining, the cultivation of coca leaves employed thousands\n9\n\n\nof families of unemployed workers and became a major\nsource of income for the Bolivian economy. Even worse,\nhowever, was that the risk that drug trafficking would\ninfiltrate the economic and political system became a real\npossibility.\nThe situation today is radically different. Bolivia will\nemerge from this coca-cocaine cycle in the next three years,\nwithin the timetable President B\u00e1nzer set for himself when\nhis mandate began in the face of the scepticism of all,\nfriends and critics.\nIn August 1997, the land occupied by coca plantations\nexceeded 40,000 hectares. In the 25 months of the\nimplementation of the Dignity Plan, 25,000 hectares have\nbeen removed and the remaining 15,000 will be eliminated\nin the time-frame planned, or earlier. The undeniable\nsuccess of that plan can be explained by the conviction of\nthe Bolivian people that the drug-trafficking cancer had to\nbe eradicated from the body of national society.\nPresident B\u00e1nzer had the merit of interpreting that\ndecision and of making it concrete, making it an irrevocable\nState policy. He applied it without altering even a\nmillimetre of the structure of democratic institutions and\nwithout breaking the spirit of civil peace and security which\nmy country fortunately enjoys. The occasional moments of\nfriction that arose in the beginning were brought under\ncontrol, and the police forces were required to carry out\ntheir tasks with the utmost respect for human rights.\nThe international community has pointed to the\nBolivian strategy as one of the most successful and\npragmatic ones of the continent. I must say, nevertheless,\nthat the task has not been completed, and its support is\nessential to create sources of work and productive and legal\ndevelopment opportunities for the farmers who are no\nlonger involved in the cultivation of coca leaves. Only in\nthat way can we claim victory.\nThe century ends in Latin America with the good\nnews of the peace agreement between Ecuador and Peru\nand the announcement that very soon Chile and Peru will\nend years of patient work in order to resolve the matters\npending from the 1929 treaty. These are very important\nevents, to which we must add the treaties through which\nArgentina and Chile resolved their disputes along their\nextensive border. In that way, the countries of this part of\nSouth America altered the legacy of confrontation and\nconflict that men of other times and circumstances left\nbehind.\nHowever, there is still an open wound in the\nconscience of America, the injustice of the landlocked\nsituation of Bolivia, which has existed for more than a\ncentury. Members know very well how Bolivia lost the\nextensive coastal strip that it enjoyed when it achieved\nindependence and the enormous cost that loss represents\nfor the development of my country. It is, undoubtedly,\none of the main reasons for Bolivia\u2019s backwardness, as I\npointed out in my message last year with more detail and\nprecision.\nI can affirm that my country has made all possible\nefforts to find a friendly and peaceful solution to its\nlandlocked situation. We have left no stone unturned in\nevery forum in which Bolivia participates. We uphold our\nrequest for sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean in\nirrefutable legal, historical, political and economic\narguments.\nWith ever greater dedication and perseverance, my\ncountry sought contact and direct negotiations with Chile\nin order to find within dialogue a friendly solution that\nwould meet the needs of both countries. In the twentieth\ncentury alone, we began at least five bilateral\nnegotiations. Unfortunately, none were successful, for\nreasons which I do not have to point out now. I mention\nthem only to show that this path has been explored with\nthe support of countries friendly to Chile and Bolivia, and\nthat Chile formally agreed to grant Bolivia a sovereign\noutlet to the Pacific Ocean and that route is known.\nNow, at the threshold of a new century, Bolivia has\ndecided to insist on calling for direct dialogue, a dialogue\nwhich would encompass all the themes in our relations\nwith Chile. I trust that very soon we will define, with\nChancellor Vald\u00e9s, the terms of that dialogue, which, in\nmy opinion, should encompass the complete range of our\nrelations and identify ways for the economic, cultural and\npolitical cooperation which will unite our nations when\nBolivia recovers its maritime attribute. The experience of\nthe past does not discourage us. New times, new men,\nnew realities must bring along with them new solutions.\nThat is our hope.\nThe United Nations system, one of the most\nimportant creations of the century, is at the threshold of\na new millennium and is subjected to many tensions. Its\nfunction as a channel for official development assistance\nhas remained constrained by the privatization of financing\nand technology groups which go from advanced countries\nto emerging markets.\n10\n\n\nIts role as a forum for negotiation and dialogue\nbetween the North and the South and between developed\ncountries and developing countries is being disregarded for\na new and different structure which revolves around\nessentially technical mechanisms, such as the International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade\nOrganization, in which negotiations are different from what\nthey were in the past. Its very role as a collective security\nsystem sometimes seems at times eclipsed by the unilateral\naction of countries or groups of countries intent on making\ntheir agenda prevail over the world mechanism.\nI mention these changes here simply as an argument\nin support of the need to think about the reform of the\nsystem, as a process of creating it anew, and not simply an\nattempt to stop the clock because of a nostalgic vision. I am\nconvinced that this is the view of the statesmen who\nrepresent the United Nations and whose patient yet\npersevering work will bear fruit sooner rather than later.\nBolivia, of course, as always, is ready to make its firm\ncontribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, we would like to congratulate you,\nMr. President, on your outstanding election to guide our\nwork during the fifty-fourth session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly and, through you, to pay a well-deserved\ntribute to your country, the Republic of Namibia. My\ncountry subscribes to the generally held view that your\nwell-known diplomatic skills and broad experience will\ncontribute to the success of our work.\nWe also warmly congratulate the new Member States,\nKiribati, Nauru and Tonga, on their admission to the great\nfamily of the United Nations. This is a great victory for the\nprinciples of free expression and self-determination of\npeoples and nations. That is the only way to enrich the\ndemocratic nature of the United Nations with the diversity\nand universality of mankind.\nIt is with optimism and hope that we participate in\nthis session of the General Assembly. We reaffirm our\nfull commitment to the purposes and principles that were\nthe basis for the establishment of the world Organization.\nWe believe that its more than 50 years of existence,\nwhich have made their mark on the twentieth century and\nhave helped bring about great social, political, economic\nand technological changes, constitute a positive legacy for\nthe future of mankind.\nWe have high hopes for this session because those\nlong years of experience and the fact that we are about to\nenter the third millennium mean that we can talk of a\nUnited Nations jubilee for the new era, in which mankind\nshould fully benefit from our achievement of the goals\nand ideals of a world of peace, free from war and\nconflict. We want all men and women to be able to enjoy\ntheir most inalienable rights \u2014 to freedom, dignity and\nequality \u2014 and we want all the world's nations and\npeoples to live in justice and equity. Ultimately, we want\nall human beings, without distinction and without\ndiscrimination, to enjoy the benefits of economic, social\nand cultural progress.\nBut in spite of these long years of history, the end\nof the cold war, our long experience and the many events\nthat have taken place in this half-century process \u2014\n\n\nadvances in the new technologies of space exploration,\natomic science, remote sensing and other progress that is of\nincalculable value for the future of mankind \u2014 we note\nwith concern that we have yet to guarantee peace and\nsecurity for all nations.\nThat is why we must adopt strategies and measures\nthat will enable developing countries to take advantage of\ntheir opportunities for progress and that will make it\npossible for all people to enjoy the best possible living\nconditions on this, our home planet. We must make sure\nthat, as our common heritage, education, science and\ntechnology reach all people so that human development can\nenable them to enjoy their rights to dignity and\nresponsibility. We must examine our consciences and\nunderstand that it is we ourselves who are slowing the\nadvance of human progress.\nThe desire for power and world hegemony,\nexacerbated by extremism, ethnic and racial discrimination\nand intolerance and fanaticism born of political beliefs and\ntheories, has created a climate of war, terror and insecurity\nin many parts of the world and could unleash a new world\nconfrontation. The most striking examples of this may be\nseen in the situations in the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, the\nMiddle East, Africa and Latin America, as well as in the\nrecent escalation of violence in South-East Asia.\nMoreover, despite the demands of third-world\ncountries and the attempts to establish a new world\neconomic order that would be more just and equitable for\nall, the present unjust economic system continues to prevail,\nimpeding trade between the North and the South. We must\nrealize that the economic situation is an irreplaceable\nelement of the balance of domestic and international peace\nand security: peace does not mean the mere absence of\nhostilities; it is a state of perfect harmony in human life in\nthe economic, social, cultural and moral spheres. For Africa\nand for the Africans, political idealism can flourish only if\nit is attended by concrete action that will guarantee human\nsurvival and justify the aims of that idealism. Let us not\nforget that political idealism of any kind is based on a\nculture appropriate to the population in question. Here,\nhuman beings are the raw material, and the proper\nconditions must be present for the success of that kind of\nideal political system. Hence, so long as the peoples of\nAfrica suffer from hunger, poverty, war and pandemic\ndisease, and so long as they are overwhelmed by cultural\ndeficiencies, ignorance and illiteracy, efforts to democratize\ntheir States and ensure peace will always fail.\nIt is said that an empty sack cannot stand by itself.\nAfrica needs economic inputs, technology transfer for\ndevelopment, and recognition of its cultural and moral\nvalues, so that internecine struggle will cease and so that\ndemocracy and political theories will be employed in the\nmost objective way.\nThat is why Central African heads of States\nmembers of the Economic Commission of Central African\nStates and of the Central African Economic and Monetary\nCommission, meeting at Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, from\n23 to 26 June 1999, carefully studied all these factors and\nadopted, inter alia, strategies to prevent conflict in the\nregion. They decided to establish a subregional\nparliament, a peacekeeping force and an institute for the\npromotion and defence of human rights. We hope that the\nUnited Nations will support these decisions.\nThe reality is that in Africa there is strong pressure\nfrom underdevelopment, poverty, unemployment and\nilliteracy which justifies the flight of intellectuals and the\ncurrent exodus of Africans to developed countries in\nsearch of a livelihood. Accordingly, we call for United\nNations support for the decision adopted in Algeria by the\nheads of State of Africa to increase humanitarian support\nfor the millions of African refugees, to amounts\ncomparable to those given other regions.\nThis is also for me a favourable opportunity to\nreaffirm our solidarity with the political will and the\ndetermination of the African States to speed up the\nmechanisms for integration and unity, to meet the\nchallenges of globalization in order to ensure global\ndevelopment for mankind. In order for political and\ndemocratic systems to succeed in Africa, the economy\nand economic culture should have a key role among the\nelements that go along with them, for otherwise they\nwould develop without any objective basis.\nUnfortunately, we find that currently there is no firm\npolitical will for cooperation between the North and\nSouth, as there was in the past. In fact, now there is just\na clash of various selfish interests in which the strongest\nor the richest always win.\nAt this time we recall the great projects of economic\ncooperation in post-war Europe which enlivened Europe,\nSouth-East Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.\nAttempts of the same kind have been sought for Africa\nwith the construction of considerable infrastructure to help\nthe peoples of this continent: for example, the Aswan\ndam in Egypt, hydroelectric power stations on the Volta\n2\n\n\nRiver in Ghana, in Inga in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and in Mombasa in Tanzania. Unfortunately, this\npolitical will to aid the development of the continent has\nnot continued.\nThis, then, is the high price for the independence of\nAfrican nations. The political development of the continent\nis now confronted with a number of difficulties and\nchallenges.\nFirst is the need to establish sincere industrial\ncooperation with developed countries, instead of the present\nmerciless extraction of natural resources and their\nexportation as raw materials, with no compensatory\nexchange for technologies to process them.\nSecondly, there is need to achieve fair prices in the\nexchange of natural resources for manufactured goods, as\nprices have not gone up more than 25 per cent since\nindependence.\nA third challenge is that credit is given under\nconditions that do not allow the population to satisfy its\nneeds nor to profit from corresponding investments, the\ndebt for which is mortgaging the economy.\nFourth, conditions are imposed on cooperation using\npolitical criteria that do not take into account the reality of\nAfrican societies, as well as another series of conditions\nthat funnel the benefits of the current international\neconomic system to a powerful few.\nNonetheless, we recognize and are grateful for the\ndecision by the seven major industrialized countries to retire\nthe debt of developing countries. We cherish the hope this\npolitical will may spread to all donor countries and that its\napplication will not be according to selective and\nexclusionary criteria.\nPraiseworthy in the same way is the initiative by the\nAdministration of the President of the United States of\nAmerica to increase American investment in Africa, an\ninitiative which we hope will be a second Marshall Plan for\nthe African continent.\nCertainly, the consequences of selfishness and of\nunfair distribution of available resources have created, in\nthe developed as much as in the developing countries,\nfrustrated groups of people who today are a cause of\npolitical and social instability in many parts of the world.\nWith respect to human resources, we must analyze\nin depth the causes of the current juvenile delinquency,\norganized crime, rape, kidnappings and indiscriminate\nkillings, drug addiction and drug trafficking, alcoholism,\nprostitution, money laundering, counterfeiting, terrorism\nand corruption which exist at all social levels everywhere.\nAll these practices challenge us and compromise the\nfuture of humanity.\nOur concern is that these behaviours make up our\nlegacy for the generations of the third millennium. Does\nthe new epoch to which we aspire beginning in the year\n2000 presuppose the rise of some and the regression to\npoverty and misery of others? Can international peace and\nsecurity guarantee protection only for some, denying it to\nothers?\nEquatorial Guinea does not aspire to hegemony or\npower, yet we speak here with the conviction of the\nobligation that falls to us as a member of this democratic\ninternational community to ask for what is best for\nmankind.\nSocio-political development and technological\nadvances tell us that we are in a different galaxy from\nthat of earlier times. The United Nations is the only\nOrganization that has exercised leadership in the process\nof the world's development. Yet after 54 years, we must\nrealize that the terms of reference of the world's current\nsocio-political reality are not those in effect in 1945. It is\nclear that the United Nations is similarly undergoing\nchanges which correspond to this moment in history, in\nsocial philosophy, mechanisms, structure and action.\nToday we talk of democracy as the only way to\npromote the development of peoples, ensure peace and\nguarantee respect for human dignity. Today we talk of\nglobalizing world politics and policies and of the\ngovernance of States because the concept of social\ndevelopment finds its justification only in the values of\nthe individual. The United Nations should therefore take\nno action that is not in keeping with those values and is\nnot a faithful expression of this interdependent, unipolar\nworld that calls for unified criteria. We must make a\nspecial effort to help young people so that they can carry\non the positive values of humankind for the sake of a\nmore integrated, more developed, more just and more\nequitable world.\nThe ideal of any governments must be to seek peace,\nprogress and prosperity for its peoples. In this connection,\nthe efforts of the countries that are fighting to\n3\n\n\ndemocratize their societies be properly appreciated and\nsupported by countries with longer democratic experience.\nIt has been proved that penalizing governments and peoples\nis counterproductive and makes them unable to promote\nnational development however much they want to. The\nUnited Nations ought to assist these countries closely in\ntheir economic, social, technical and cultural advancement,\nin keeping with the spirit of globalization and the actual\nsituation in each country.\nWe believe that the current United Nations system is\nobsolete in terms both of decision-making and of the\neffectiveness of its actions when it comes to dealing\nproperly with the difficulties and challenges facing its\nmembers. Indeed, the proliferation of peacekeeping\noperations in various parts of the world is proof that the\ncurrent conflict-prevention system is obsolete.\nAs an organization founded on democracy, the United\nNations must establish the principle across the board that all\nparties must be given a hearing in all bodies, including the\nSecurity Council, that take decisions affecting its Members.\nMoreover, the most sophisticated nuclear technology should\nbe employed exclusively as a common shared possession to\nbe used for the benefit of all humankind rather than as\nprivate property that benefits some to the detriment of\nothers.\nWe believe that in globalizing world politics and\npolicies, which is positive in theory in that it unifies socio-\npolitical criteria, States should nevertheless implement the\nphilosophy by adopting specific measures that are in\nkeeping with the specific characteristics of each country. In\nthis connection, Equatorial Guinea has particular experience\nin implementing its programme of transition to a multi-\nparty system by applying the theory of the democratic test,\na way to involve the people in taking all the political\ndecisions that affect them. As a result, our transition has\nbeen peaceful, orderly and calm because our people\nthemselves, no one else, are responsible for the measures\nadopted, which all political actors must respect.\nA progressive and continuous process of adaptation by\nthe authorities and by the people themselves is needed so\nthat they acquire the right sort of culture in which human\nrights and democracy can be respected. In that connection,\nwe welcome the efforts by the Commission on Human\nRights to adopt a special assistance programme for\nEquatorial Guinea to promote and ensure respect for human\nrights there.\nWe are party to all the human rights treaties and\nconventions and have adopted a wide-ranging framework\nof laws and regulations to protect human rights. However,\nthe lack of infrastructure makes it difficult for the people\nto enjoy in full the various services to which they are\nentitled.\nI would conclude by making clear our political\nresolve to contribute to the maintenance of international\npeace and security, promote close friendship and mutually\nbeneficial cooperation between all States and promote\neconomic, scientific and technological development\nthroughout the world. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea\nstands open to the world as a peaceful State that puts\ndialogue and negotiation first, rejecting force of any kind\nas a means of resolving conflicts.\nWe hope that the year 2000, which is almost on us,\nwill become a milestone in establishing a world truly\ncommitted to peace, progress and prosperity for\nhumankind.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr.\nGurirab on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. I am confident that\nthe struggle for freedom of his friendly country, Namibia,\nand his wide-ranging knowledge of international issues\nwill facilitate his lofty task and will lead the deliberations\nof the Assembly at this important session to a successful\nconclusion.\nI should like to express my thanks to the Foreign\nMinister of Uruguay for his efforts and wise leadership of\nour deliberations in the General Assembly during the\nprevious session. I should also like to express our\ngratitude to the Secretary-General of our Organization,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his attempts to uphold the principles\nand purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe Syrian Arab Republic welcomes the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga to the United Nations. We are confident that the\npresence of these States in the international community\nwill buttress the role of the United Nations and uphold its\nprinciples.\n15\n\n\nLeaving the last century of the second millennium and\nentering the first century of the third millennium does not\nin itself mean the end of an era and the beginning of a new\none in the life of humankind. States and peoples will take\nwith them into the next century their concerns, aspirations,\nsuccesses, failures, challenges and hopes. They will\ncontinue as usual to follow their economic, educational,\npolitical and social development plans and programmes,\nknowing that the end of the twentieth century will not\nautomatically mean an end to current regional conflicts.\nNeither will it automatically raise levels of development or\nrid developing countries of the debt burdens under which\nthey are languishing.\nIf the advocates of market theories and globalization,\nand their political leaders, were to recognize that at present\nthe poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer\nand that the gap between developing and developed\ncountries is becoming wider in every area \u2014 whether in the\neconomic, commercial, technical, health or environmental\nspheres \u2014 an element of pessimism would, unfortunately,\nmar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to\nwelcome the dawn of the twenty-first century.\nOptimism about the future is desirable because it\nprevents humanity, both at individual and society levels,\nfrom falling into the trap of despair and frustration.\nOptimism is also justified because progress in research,\nscience and knowledge shrinks distances, eliminates\nobstacles and opens doors and minds in the South as well\nas in the North. Given that fact, it is natural that people's\nunderstanding of each other's problems and concerns should\nincrease and that ultimately a common awareness will\ndevelop to enable everyone to face the threats and\nchallenges that await humankind everywhere on this planet.\nLike poisonous waste from industrial development, the\nepidemics resulting from underdevelopment and poverty\nknow no borders or obstacles. Drugs would not have spread\nin some States in the South had it not been for the many\ntraffickers and users in the countries of the North. Neither\nshould we forget that the pollution of the environment in\nthe countries of the North is primarily the result of\nindustrial production of all kinds, both sophisticated and\nbasic, at a time when environmental pollution in the\ncountries of the South is primarily the result of the lack of\na minimum of small, basic industries capable of making\nproducts to deal with environmental pollution or of\nemploying the means to do so.\nIn this context, we should like to reaffirm our belief\nthat weakening the economies of the developing countries\ndoes not necessarily serve the interests of the economies\nof developed countries, because it weakens the purchasing\npower of the former, which, in turn, negatively affects the\nrates of economic development of the latter. The financial\ncrisis that affected the economies of the countries of\nSouth-East Asia two years ago reflected that mutual effect\nwhen its repercussions reached Brazil and even some\nother countries in South America. There must, therefore,\nbe a constructive dialogue between developing and\ndeveloped countries, a dialogue based on common\ninterests, genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilities\naimed at ensuring sustainable development and social\njustice.\nWe hope that there will be an end to the contrariety\nby which the industrial countries demand that developing\ncountries open their markets and borders to their products\nwhile the developing countries are finding it difficult to\nexport their goods because of protectionist measures and\nobstacles, including the prevention of the transfer of\ntechnology and the refusal to allow developing countries\nto integrate such technology into their industrial\nprocesses.\nIf we were to look back at the ethnic and religious\nwars and conflicts that spread with the end of the cold\nwar and that reached the heart of Africa, Asia and even\nEurope, we would find it difficult to imagine their\nrepercussions being confined within closed borders.\nThrough succeeding waves of migration, various religions\nand ethnic groups have become part of the social fabric\nof most societies in the world, especially in Western\ncountries. The tragedy of such wars and conflicts is\ntherefore a source of concern for most countries of the\nworld, particularly the United States of America, which\nhas the largest number of ethnic and religious groups of\nany country in recent history. That fact explains the\ninterest the United States takes in regional conflicts,\nparticularly those in the Middle East, which have\nrepercussions at the domestic level in the United States.\nSuch American interest is commensurate with the varied\nimpact of these conflicts, although one should not\ndisregard the other economic and strategic interests.\nThe impact of impressive scientific and technological\nadvances in communications and in the flow of\ninformation on such events will not be limited to a\nmomentary pinprick of conscience when we see them on\nour television screens. It could well go beyond this in the\nfuture, resulting in concrete action by large groups and\n16\n\n\ncould in turn threaten the stability and sovereignty of\nStates, especially those whose populations encompass many\nethnic groups and religions.\nIt is regrettable that these grave challenges and\nphenomena will be carried over into the next century,\nperhaps for years or even decades, without a remedy. We\nare convinced that the best framework for facing up to\nthese challenges and phenomena in a serious and effective\nmanner is a United Nations truly respected by all its\nMember States, one based on collective action by the States\nof the North and of the South, all according to their own\npotential and capacities.\nMarginalizing the role of the United Nations, using it\nonly on selected occasions and as a cover for initiatives and\ndecisions adopted outside the Security Council, will serve\nthe interests of no one. The problems and challenges facing\nmankind are truly grave and dangerous both quantitatively\nand qualitatively. We believe that no one State, however\npowerful and wise it is, can meet these universal problems\nand challenges alone, much less find lasting, solid solutions\nto them.\nClearly, many are dissatisfied with the use of\nhumanitarian pretexts to launch military intervention outside\nthe framework of the Security Council. It began with the\nintervention in Somalia in 1992, whose repercussions\nincluded the collapse of all State institutions and the\ncarving up of the capital, Mogadishu, among fighting\nwarlords. This trend continued with the intervention in\nKosovo, where the fate of the people remains in the\nbalance, although the intervention succeeded in supplying\nthe people with medicine and food.\nBut here it must be said that illegitimate intervention\noutside the framework of the Security Council is not as bad\nas completely ignoring dangerous and bloody crises such as\nthose beyond what might be called the line of death and\nhunger: a line stretching from the Horn of Africa, in the\neast, to Angola, in the west, and then to Rwanda, Burundi\nand the Congo. Many suffering Africans who live along\nthis bleeding line and who lack the most basic necessities\nmay well envy the inhabitants of Kosovo, who at least had\nfood and medicine during their ordeal.\nSince the end of the cold war hopes have been pinned\non the reform of the United Nations and on an increase in\nthe membership of the Security Council with a view to\nachieving a more democratic and fairer representation in\nthis international organization. The Non-Aligned Movement\nhas been enthusiastic about this issue and has given it\nserious consideration at all its conferences. Its member\nStates know full well that they lack influence in the\nSecurity Council commensurate with their numbers and\nreflecting their legitimate concerns. At the same time,\nGermany and Japan, following major international\ntransformations, have become aware of how important it\nis for them to become permanent members of the Security\nCouncil. Here Italy has played an important role in\nseeking a third way between the North and the South. No\nsolution has yet emerged that could attract consensus on\nthe subject among members of the United Nations.\nThe unavoidable question for us all is what has so\nfar been achieved in the process of reforming the Security\nCouncil and promoting its role and status. The answer is\nnothing, except for the marginalization of the role and\nstatus of the Security Council and the extension of its\nactivities beyond the primary responsibility for\nmaintaining international peace and security, both when\nevents have required it and, at times, when they have not.\nIt seems that the premeditated marginalization of the role\nof the Security Council and the fact that the reform\nprocess has been almost dormant are being used by some\nas a pretext for ignoring the Charter and violating the\nsovereignty of States through the use of regional military\norganizations as a substitute for the Security Council.\nThe world today cannot endure a nuclear arms race\nthat threatens the security and the very survival of\nmankind, particularly in the absence of a just and stable\ninternational order. There will be no successful non-\nproliferation regime without achieving universality for the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT). Syria, the other Arab States and most countries of\nthe world have appealed to the five nuclear States, in the\nlight of the 1995 extension of the NPT, not to exclude\nany State from acceding to the Treaty, so that the world\nmay be spared another nuclear arms race. A new nuclear\narms race has actually taken place in South Asia since the\nextension of the Treaty. In the Middle East, Israel remains\nthe only State in the region that refuses to accede to the\nTreaty and to submit all its nuclear installations to the\nsafeguards system of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA). As the time for the next review of the\nNPT approaches, Syria renews its call for transforming\nthe Middle East into a nuclear-weapon-free zone under\nUnited Nations auspices, as a serious contribution to the\ncreation of a propitious climate for the regional peace,\nsecurity and stability to which we all aspire.\nThe international community looked to the peace\nprocess that began at Madrid in 1991 as the most\n17\n\n\nimportant, most serious initiative for ending a conflict that\nhas been raging for decades, one that has bled the huge\neconomic and human energies of the peoples of the region.\nThe Madrid framework, the guarantees offered by the\nUnited States, the results reached based on relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, the principle of land for peace, all\nconstituted obligations and commitments accepted by all\nparties concerned. None of these can now be called into\nquestion or circumvented. They all have been duly\ndeposited with the United States Administration, with the\nagreement of the parties concerned. Hence Syria's call to\nreaffirm that trust, including complete Israeli withdrawal to\nthe lines of 4 June 1967, and resumption of peace talks\nwith Israel from the point at which they were suspended in\norder to address pending matters until both sides agree on\nfull peace.\nWhat Syria is calling for cannot be considered a\n\u201cprecondition\u201d, as the Israeli government claims: if we were\nto accept that it was, as the Netanyahu Government also\nclaimed, we would have to conclude that any agreement\nbetween negotiators on any single component of any a\npeace accord would always be considered a \u201cprecondition\u201d\nif any move were made to conclude any other component\nof a peace accord. And that would invariably take\nnegotiations, back to square one after each step forward,\nendlessly back and forth.\nAlso, we draw the Assembly's attention to the falsity\nof the Israeli claim that Syria wants to get a particular\nresult in the negotiations before they have even started.\nNeedless to say, trust in the United States of America does\nnot, by itself, constitute a peace agreement; rather, it is a\nfundamental part of an agreement whose remaining\nelements \u2014 normal, peaceful relations and security\narrangements based on the purposes and principles laid\ndown under United States auspices and with its\nparticipation \u2014 still need to be fleshed out.\nSo we were not surprised, yesterday, by the address of\nthe Foreign Minister of Israel before this Assembly, when\n\u2014 under the flag of peace education \u2014 he requested\nleaders and teachers to stress to their peoples and students\nthe importance of peace, totally ignoring the fact that the\nIsraeli occupation is a major reason for the absence of\npeace in the region.\nPeace education requires first and foremost an end to\nIsrael's occupation of Arab territories. Specifically, it must\nwithdraw from the Golan Heights to the 4 June 1967 line;\nfrom south Lebanon; from the western Bekaa, and also\nfrom Jerusalem, the city of peace. Settlement activities in\nthe occupied territories and the destruction of Arab houses\nmust stop. Last but not least, Israeli words about peace\nmust be translated into deeds, so that students in Israel do\nnot think that peace education means continued\noccupation by force of other peoples' lands.\nDuring the past few weeks, major efforts have been\nmade by the United States of America, and by the\nEuropean Union, the Russian Federation and other\ncountries. We hope that these efforts will continue until\nIsrael realizes how fair Syria's position is and how ready\nSyria is to resume negotiations at the point where they\nleft off. Let us not waste long and arduous years of\nnegotiations: Syria is eager not to miss this opportunity to\nachieve peace; if it is missed, then Israel alone should\ntake the blame.\nSyria reaffirms once more its great concern for the\nunity and territorial integrity of Iraq and calls for an end\nto the suffering of the fraternal Iraqi people. It calls for\neconomic sanctions to be lifted, in accordance with the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. It also calls for no\naction or measure to be taken outside the United Nations\ncontext. At the same time, we ask Iraq to implement the\nremaining Security Council resolutions in a manner that\nguarantees a just solution to the problem of Kuwaiti\nprisoners of war and other detainees.\nSyria also calls on the Security Council to put an\nimmediate and final end to the sanctions against Libya, as\nLibya has honoured all its obligations under Security\nCouncil resolutions. We would emphasize that we fully\nsupport the Libyan requests for the sanctions to be ended.\nIn the light of the fraternal relations which Syria\nmaintains with the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, we call on these two neighbouring\ncountries to hold talks to find a peaceful solution to the\ndispute over three islands in the Gulf.\nThe continuing tragic situation in Afghanistan is a\nsource of great concern to us. We are convinced that the\nAfghan problem can be solved only if the fighting ceases\nand negotiations are begun on achieving national\nreconciliation and finding an acceptable and lasting\npolitical settlement that results in security and stability for\nour friends the Afghan people.\nSyria expresses its full support for all measures to\nensure peace, security and stability on the Korean\npeninsula. It expresses its support also for the aspirations\nof the Korean people for national unity achieved by\npeaceful means and free of foreign intervention.\n18\n\n\nSyria once again highlights the need to take all\nnecessary steps, at the earliest possible moment, to end the\neconomic, trade and financial embargo on Cuba imposed by\nthe United States of America for almost four decades. We\nsupport Cuba's call for differences between the two\ncountries to be resolved through dialogue and on a basis of\nequality, mutual respect and good- neighbourly relations.\nAs we bid farewell to the twentieth century, the\nhuman race is still yearning for a world free of war,\ninjustice, ignorance and poverty, a world governed by\ninternational relations based on cooperation, mutual respect,\ngreater justice and true equity. Those are the yearnings\nwhich the peoples of the world hope to see realized next\ncentury, so that coming generations are guaranteed a better\nlife and a more prosperous and humane future.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Indonesian\ndelegation, I should first like to congratulate my colleague\nand good friend Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Foreign Minister of\nNamibia, on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We are confident that\nunder his leadership we will achieve substantial progress in\nour work.\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, I convey our\nsincere appreciation for his able guidance of our work\nduring the last session.\nI join other members in paying a tribute to our\nSecretary-General for his untiring pursuit of the objectives\nof the United Nations Charter.\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Indonesia,\nI extend a warm welcome to Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga on\ntheir accession to membership of the United Nations. My\ndelegation looks forward to working closely with them.\nEvery year at this time, for more than a decade now,\nI have tried from this rostrum to present Indonesia's views\non the state of world affairs and international relations.\nToday, I could deliver last year's statement, or even that of\nthree years ago, and it would not make much difference\nbecause there really has been no significant change.\nIt is true that there are always a number of positive\ndevelopments. This year they include the Sharm el-Sheikh\nMemorandum signed by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat\nand Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, which raises our\nhopes for the resumption of the derailed Middle East peace\nprocess. They include also the Lom\u00e9 Peace Agreement on\nSierra Leone; the Framework Agreement on the conflict\nbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Ceasefire Agreement on\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, some progress in\nthe rehabilitation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the\nresolution of the stalemate over the Lockerbie incident.\nCloser to home, there have been the signing of the 5 May\n1999 Agreements reached in New York and the\nimplementation of the historic popular consultation in\nEast Timor which \u2014 although, most unfortunately, its\naftermath was marred by violence \u2014 remains an\nimportant, positive development. These are all\nencouraging steps in a long journey towards just and\ndurable solutions.\nIn the economic field, investor confidence is\nbeginning to trickle back into the Asian economies\nseverely hit by the financial and economic crisis. This\nreturn of confidence and the positive signs in the affected\neconomies \u2014 such as stability of currencies and lower\ninterest rates \u2014 could be the first firm indications of a\nrecovery. Recently the G-8 decided to ease the debt\nburden of the poorest countries by expanding the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. This will help the\npoorest countries get back on the road of development.\nBut ours is still an essentially brutal world. In many\nplaces, wanton violence and armed conflicts persist, often\nbringing about humanitarian disaster. In spite of the\npresence of a United Nations peacekeeping force, Serbs\nand Albanian Kosovars are still shooting each other in\nKosovo. In Afghanistan, dialogue has been abandoned\nand once more the warring factions have taken to the\nbattlefield. In South Asia, an uneasy ceasefire reigns over\nthe line of control between two neighbouring States with\nnuclear-weapon capability. Meanwhile, in the backwaters\nand slums of the developing world, in the ghettos of the\nindustrialized countries, hundreds of millions fight a\ndesperate war against poverty, ignorance and disease.\nThere has as yet been no fulfilment of a hope we all\nshare, a hope to which we have clung for nigh on a\ncentury.\nA hundred years ago, electricity was just beginning\nto light up the cities of the world, the commercial\nmanufacture of horseless carriages had just begun and the\npioneers of air travel were taking off in crude flying\nmachines. But it was beyond question even then that\nenormous power called science and technology had been\nplaced in the hands of humankind. It was clear even then\nthat the prudent use of such power could solve the\nproblem of poverty that for millenniums people accepted\nand suffered as an inevitable part of the human condition.\nSince then, unfortunately, that power has been used\ninstead to enlarge humankind's capacity to kill and\ndestroy. That terrible capacity was amply demonstrated in\ntwo world wars that levelled cities and decimated\npopulations in Europe and Asia. In time of peace, science\n34\n\n\nand technology have made it possible for one part of\nhumanity to adopt an irresponsible lifestyle and patterns of\nproduction and consumption that ravage the fragile ecology\nof this planet while teeming millions, in the squalor of\npoverty, driven by the pangs of hunger, are tearing their\nenvironment apart in a desperate bid to survive.\nFive decades ago, the human race teetered on the\nbrink of a nuclear holocaust, but we were able to postpone\nthe effective end of history because between us and the\nprecipice stood the one shining achievement of humanity in\na violent century, the United Nations. Founded in the wake\nof the Second World War as a forum for maintaining\nsecurity, resolving conflicts and serving development, the\nUnited Nations is, whatever its flaws, a masterpiece of\nhuman reason.\nIt has not achieved its finest promise of global peace,\nnor has it significantly curbed poverty. Still, it has managed\nto save us from the horrors of yet another world war, one\nfought with nuclear weapons. And together with its\nspecialized agencies and related institutions, it is carrying\nout an immense array of activities in support of economic\ndevelopment and social progress; these are touching every\naspect of people's lives all over the world, and thus at least\nkeep hopes alive.\nBut even the very instrument of our salvation is not\nspared our recklessness: the United Nations has been\nallowed to go bankrupt at a time when so much more is\ndemanded of it as the central mechanism and catalyst for\nmultilateral cooperation. Its organs should be working in\nharmony and complementing one another: instead, we have\nthe spectacle of a Security Council \u2014 when not paralysed\nby the veto of a permanent member \u2014 venturing to take\nover the work of other United Nations organs in such fields\nas human rights, democracy and humanitarian aid. The\nunhappy truth is that the inequities, imbalances and\ndiscrimination in international relations that the United\nNations was supposed to cure have infected its own vital\norgans and processes.\nThis is true not only of the United Nations itself but\nalso of related multilateral institutions. This is why it has\nbeen so difficult to reform, democratize and empower the\nUnited Nations, and so difficult to make the membership of\nthe Security Council truly reflect the political, economic\nand demographic realities of the world today.\nAlthough the work of the Council is focused on\nconflict situations that are mostly in the developing world,\ndeveloping countries are woefully under-represented on\nthe Council.\nFor the same reason, nuclear disarmament has\nachieved no substantial progress in recent years. In fact,\nthe nuclear arms race has surged along as countries seek\nto join and enjoy the dubious privileges of being nuclear-\nweapon States. The world thus remains in danger of\nnuclear self-destruction.\nThe same situation obtains in multilateral economic\nforums. They, too, have become afflicted with the\ninequities and imbalances they are meant to rectify. The\nintroduction of irrelevant social issues and undue\nemphasis on unfettered markets in these forums have\nbrought about the neglect of core development issues,\nsuch as international cooperation for development, the\nneed for non-commercial financial flows and the necessity\nof differential treatment for developing countries.\nThus, the international agenda has been steered by\nthe desire of developed countries to open doors for their\nforeign investments, private capital flows and exports.\nThis has led to the eclipse of development as a common\ngoal and a common responsibility of developed and\ndeveloping nations. It has engendered a tendency to forget\ncommitments reached at global conferences on\nenvironment and development, social development,\npopulation and development, women and development,\nhabitat and food.\nJust over a decade ago, with the barriers of the cold\nwar broken down, science and technology unlocked the\nawesome force of globalization. This blind force could\nhave served as the chief instrument of a united\nhumankind in a decisive assault against the global\nproblems of poverty and underdevelopment. We could\nhave enlisted it to empower people everywhere and thus\nbroaden participation in governance and productive\ninitiatives. We could have built a more equitable\npartnership between the developed and the developing\nworld. But at best, the weaker economies were left to the\ntender mercies of the market. At worst, globalization has\nbeen used by the strong to press their advantage over the\nweak, widening the chasm between rich and poor.\nAfter all this, what can we say to sum up the\npassing of 100 years? If progress means going to the\nmoon and exploring outer space; if it means the rapid\nmovement of money, goods and people from one\ncontinent to another and the delegation of personal\ninitiative to clever machines, then we have made some\n35\n\n\nprogress. But if it means the conquest of poverty, the\ntaming of the human penchant for conflict and violence,\nand ensuring the long-term sustainability of human life, I\nam afraid that we may be entering the new millennium not\nreally much better off than we were a century ago.\nOur tragedy is not in our ignorance, but in the waste\nof our wisdom. The truth is that we know the solutions to\nour problems. We know what kind of global partnership it\nwould take to tackle the problems of poverty and\nunderdevelopment. We have spelled out the global\nmeasures to initiate in order to prevent the irreversible\ndecay of our environment. And we are aware of what it\nwould take to move the disarmament agenda forward; what\nkind of representation on the Security Council would make\nit a true instrument of the whole international community.\nBut we do not make the necessary decisive moves\nbecause these require change \u2014 profound and radical\nchange. There must be change not only in our methods, but\nin the way we look at the world, the way we regard one\nanother and ourselves. That kind of change brings no\ncomfort and poses the deepest challenge to our faith and\nour courage. Hence, we hesitate. The protracted debates in\nthis Assembly, in the Economic and Social Council, in the\nConference on Disarmament and in many other forums are\nin reality just one long hesitation.\nWe in Indonesia know how difficult that kind of\nchange can be. In response to the Asian financial and\neconomic crisis, as well as to its social and political impact,\nwe have begun to reform our social, economic and political\ninstitutions. New laws are being passed, new ways are\nbeing tried to give our people the widest opportunity to\nparticipate in the making of decisions that affect their lives,\nto level the economic playing fields and to earn the\nconfidence of our foreign partners.\nThe Government has taken a long, hard look at itself\nand its responsibilities today. In the case of East Timor, our\nresponsibility has changed. Twenty-four years ago, it was\nour responsibility to accept the Territory as a province of\nour Republic in order to stop ongoing fratricidal carnage\nafter a disastrously bungled decolonization process; to\naccommodate the desire of the majority of East Timorese\nat that time to seek freedom and sanctuary through\nintegration with our Republic; and to contribute to the\nsecurity and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. We\naccepted that responsibility and additional burden, although\nwe had never laid claim to that half-island, as it was not a\npart of the Dutch East Indies out of which the Indonesian\nnation evolved. Today our responsibility and our\ncommitment are to help make possible the fulfilment of\nthe newly expressed will of the majority of East Timorese\nto seek a new destiny outside the Indonesian Republic.\nWe will abide by that responsibility and commitment and\nat the same time ensure that the parting of ways will\nproceed honourably, peacefully and amicably.\nIn this process of change, not only in East Timor but\nalso throughout our national life and in our relations with\nour friends, we have not had an easy time. We have had\nmore than our share of setbacks, frustrations and\nmistakes. In the depths of every disappointment, we have\nhad to summon the courage to persevere, to start all over\nagain whenever necessary, because there is no alternative\nacceptable to our people. We do pray for the courage to\nchange, but not for ourselves alone.\nFor the solutions to the global problems of our time\ndemand a fortitude on the part of nations that is strong\nenough to break the doubts, the prejudices, the sophistry\nand the apathy that have hardened with the passing of\ndecades. That means the courage to take action where we\nhave only paid lip-service. It also means the courage to\nrecognize that many of our problems are complex and\ndemand more creativity from us than we have so far\ndemonstrated.\nFor instance, we fully agree that massive and\nsystematic violations of human rights, wherever they take\nplace, should not be tolerated or condoned. But we cannot\nagree that this problem can be solved only by sacrificing\nthe principle of national sovereignty and sovereign\nequality among nations. There must be a solution that\ndoes not threaten to demolish a principle on which the\nUnited Nations itself was founded. Let us have the\nintellectual courage to look for that solution and be\nwilling to make any sacrifice to attain it, except the\nsacrifice of our principles.\nIf many of us have grown cynical, I believe that it\nis not out of arrogance, but out of fear of the\nconsequences of change, the loss of some privilege or\nadvantage over another, or out of fear of futility and\nfailure. We can overcome these fears because they are but\nshadows on the wall; they have no substance. There will\nbe failures and there will be setbacks, but if what we set\nout to do is worthwhile, and nothing is more worthwhile\nthan the perpetuation of humankind, we will succeed.\nLet us now all act in consonance with our\ncommitments to the United Nations Charter; to the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); to\n36\n\n\nAgenda 21; to the Uruguay Round and the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO); to all agreements on international\nfinancial flows for development; on cooperation on human\nrights; on the eradication of all forms of discrimination. We\ncannot bring all of these to fruition in a single day, and\nsome of them not even in a full decade, but if we all do\nthat today, it will be enough to start with.\nIf we keep building on that to achieve something\nsignificant, we engender encouragement. We add to the\nfund of courage that the world needs to become a better\none. And that fund of courage is all it will take for\nhumanity to make an auspicious entry into the next\nmillennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first associate\nmyself with the statement of my colleague, the Finnish\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the European\nUnion.\nLet me also, Mr. President, congratulate you on your\nelection. Denmark's relations with Namibia and with you\npersonally go back to long before your country's\nindependence. I am therefore particularly gratified to see\nyou in this position.\nIn my statement today, I should like to dwell upon the\nresponsibility of the international community, including, of\ncourse, the United Nations, for human security and\ndevelopment. We live in an ever more globalized world.\nAlmost every day we are confronted with new challenges\nthat must be met. Distance or ignorance of events no longer\nprovides a sense of security.\nClose international cooperation is needed to meet the\nchallenges. But paradoxically, although the challenges are\nglobal, policy-making and institutions still remain\npredominantly national in focus and scope.\nIncreasingly we see internal conflicts and blatant\nviolations of human rights and humanitarian law pose a\nspecial and serious kind of threat. Terrorism, drug-\ntrafficking and international crime also thrive in a\nglobalized world.\nThe international community must possess the means\nand display the resolve to confront such challenges. Our\nfundamental concerns about human security and human\ndevelopment cannot be met only in a domestic context.\nI should like to illustrate these concerns, first, in\nrelation to the Kosovo and East Timor crises and, secondly,\nwith regard to international development cooperation.\nKosovo and East Timor raised serious questions with\nregard to the classic concepts of State sovereignty, the\nrespect for human rights and the non-use of force in\ninternational relations. How do these concepts interrelate?\nHow do they relate to our concern for human security?\nAnd what does the interrelationship mean for the role and\nresponsibility of the United Nations and for the Security\nCouncil?\nThe first point to be made is that the international\ncommunity cannot be idle in the face of gross and\nsystematic violations of human rights. Nor can we stand\nidly by if the United Nations and its representatives, who\nhave assisted a people in exercising its right to self-\ndetermination, are trampled on.\nInternational law finds itself at a crossroads. We\nhave spent the last 50 years developing an impressive\nbody of human rights law, applicable in time of peace as\nwell as during armed conflict, starting with the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Indeed, there is no shortage\nof rules. What is lacking is effective implementation of\nexisting rules, in the very last resort through the use of\nforce.\nWe must now aim at enforcement in order to\nprovide assistance, regardless of frontiers, to the victims\nof human rights violations. We must show resolve in\npromoting respect for the rule of law and for the\ninstitutions called upon to uphold the rule of law. A broad\nspectrum of actions is available; the choice of action must\ndepend on the problem we face. The thorny question is\nwhether and when to use military force in the face of an\nemerging humanitarian catastrophe, such as a planned\nethnic cleansing or downright genocide.\nIt cannot be emphasized too often that a negotiated\nsettlement must remain the primary and ultimate goal of\nany conflict solution. If, however, all attempts at securing\na peaceful solution fail or are brushed aside, the question\nof whether to use force in one form or another arises.\nThis brings the United Nations Security Council to the\nforefront. The Council has the primary responsibility for\nmaintaining international peace and security. It has carried\nout its functions as foreseen in the United Nations Charter\nin a much more effective and innovative way since the\nend of the cold war. I am referring, in particular, to the\nconflicts in relation to Iraq, Bosnia, Haiti, and Albania. A\nmain challenge for the Security Council remains that of\nreacting effectively against gross and systematic violations\nof human rights conducted against an entire population.\n36\n\n\nThe Council has interpreted its competence under\nChapter VII of the Charter to cover humanitarian situations\nthat shock the conscience of mankind. This augurs well for\nthe victims of brutal oppression and ill for the dictators of\ntoday. Oppressors of whole peoples, mass murderers and\nethnic cleansers can no longer invoke the shield of national\nsovereignty. Nor can they expect impunity. The\ninternational community has a responsibility to act in the\nface of a humanitarian tragedy such as the one we\nwitnessed in Kosovo and the one we are witnessing in East\nTimor.\nUnfortunately, the Council was not able to live up to\nits responsibilities concerning the ethnic cleansing in\nKosovo. Should the paralysis of the Council lead to blind\nacceptance? No; the international community could not\nstand idly by and watch, while the principle of State\nsovereignty was misused in Kosovo to violate international\nhumanitarian law.\nIn this serious situation the decision to launch the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization campaign was legitimate\nand justified. It opened the way to a political solution,\nbringing the United Nations back into a central role.\nIn East Timor we were faced with widespread,\norganized atrocities against a civilian population exercising\nits right to self-determination. In addition, the risk of total\ndisregard for the United Nations was looming. Fortunately,\nthe Security Council was not paralysed. Pressure from the\ninternational community brought about action. An\nagreement was reached to deploy a multinational force.\nWe welcome this development.\nWe urge the Indonesian Government to cooperate fully\nwith the multinational force. In the meantime, the\nIndonesian Government remains responsible for the security\nof the population. It must make it possible for the\nhumanitarian organizations to provide assistance for the\nlarge number of displaced persons in East Timor.\nWe all share the responsibility for enabling the\ninternational community to address these issues and for\nenabling the United Nations to act. Where force has to be\nresorted to, we have to look to countries possessing that\ncapability. In practical terms, this means that we often have\nto rely upon countries and organizations in the region.\nThe Security Council must do its utmost to live up to\nits primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace,\nsecurity and humanitarian decency \u2014 a primary\nresponsibility that all the Member States have vested in\nthe Security Council in accordance with Article 24 of the\nCharter.\nThe Council's permanent members should apply the\nveto only in matters of vital importance, taking into\naccount their unique responsibility for the interests of the\nUnited Nations as a whole. And they should state on what\ngrounds they consider such a situation to be present.\nThe Secretary-General has said,\n\u201cany armed intervention is itself a result of the\nfailure of prevention\u201d. (A/54/PV.4)\nI agree with the Secretary-General that conflict prevention\nand resolution must be given the highest possible priority\nin international relations. It should be carried out on the\nbasis of a common resolve to secure human rights for all.\nThe United Nations constitutes a needed and valuable tool\nto this end.\nConflict resolution must, of course, not become only\na question of the use of force. Let me point to two\nimportant aspects of the post-conflict situation. First,\nthose who are responsible for war crimes and crimes\nagainst humanity must be brought to justice. The creation\nof the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and\nRwanda were important first steps towards establishing an\neffective international legal order based upon democratic\nvalues and the rule of law. The work of the tribunals has\nunderlined the need for a permanent international criminal\ncourt designed to bring to justice those who have\ncommitted crimes of the most heinous kind. The\nprospects for lasting peace and reconciliation are severely\nundermined if war criminals and the like remain at large.\nThe historic adoption last year in Rome of a statute\nfor a permanent international criminal court is a landmark\ncontribution to restoring the rule of law and ending\nimpunity. Although not perfect, the Rome Statute\nprovides a satisfactory basis for an effective and credible\ncourt. We urge all States to ratify the Statute as early as\npossible in order to put this historic building block in\nplace. Denmark intends to ratify in the spring of the year\n2000.\nSecondly, post-conflict assistance must be provided\nto the societies split by civil strife or war. Denmark is\nready to do its part. With respect to the western Balkans,\nwe initially provided assistance to refugees and for their\nsafe return. Now we are gradually turning to assistance in\n37\n\n\nreconstruction and rebuilding of both physical and social\ninfrastructure. A plan of action for Denmark's support in\nthis respect has been drawn up. The plan expects Danish\nfunds in the order of $100 million dollars to be used in the\nregion in 1999 and around $120 million dollars in the year\n2000.\nThe reconstruction of Kosovo is important. It includes\nthe establishment of a well-functioning civil administration.\nThe United Nations family and many non-governmental\norganizations are undertaking important tasks which deserve\nour full support. All parties must strive to heal the wounds\nof conflict.\nInternational relations and international cooperation are\nnot based on a one-issue agenda. Certain issues may grab\nand almost monopolize the headlines for a while. In Europe\nwe have to deal with the Balkans. But we must not neglect\nthe other important issues on the international agenda, in\nparticular international development cooperation and the\nstruggle for the eradication of poverty.\nIn a world where a third of the population of\ndeveloping countries earns less than $1 per day, where 30\nper cent of all children under five in those countries are\nunderweight, where 14 per cent of the population will not\nattain the age of 40, where financial crisis has led to a\nmajor setback in poverty reduction \u2014 in such a world\ndevelopment cooperation must remain an integral part of\nthe effort of the international community to promote and\nprotect human security and human development.\nThe international community must acknowledge its\nshare of the responsibility for making the opportunities of\nglobalization available to all. Globalization must not\nbecome identical with protected and selective prosperity.\nEradication of poverty is an essential goal in its own\nright. Furthermore, poverty is an important cause of\nconflict. And again, violent conflict may undo the results of\ndecades of development. Development cooperation,\ntherefore, constitutes an effective crisis-prevention effort for\nthe long term.\nInternational development cooperation must be based\non the fulfilment as soon as possible of the agreed target of\n0.7 per cent of gross domestic product for official\ndevelopment assistance and on implementing the decisions\nof the big United Nations conferences of recent years with\nregard to human and social development, eradication of\npoverty, sustainable development and gender equality. The\nfollow-up conferences to the Beijing conference and, in the\nyear 2000, to the Copenhagen summit are important\nevents requiring our full attention.\nDenmark stands by these commitments. We will\ncontinue our policy of contributing 1 per cent of our gross\nnational product to official development assistance.\nPoverty reduction is the prime goal of our development\ncooperation programmes. In addition, we are providing\nfunding to help address global problems in the field of the\nenvironment as well as peacekeeping and conflict\nprevention. These grants will grow in the coming years,\nreaching half of 1 per cent of gross domestic product by\nthe year 2005, thus bringing Denmark's total contribution\nto international assistance to 1.5 per cent of gross\ndomestic product.\nCreating an enabling environment for development\nis a challenge, first of all for developing countries\nthemselves. Reforms cannot be imposed from the outside.\nIf they are to succeed, local ownership and local roots are\nessential. Official development assistance has an essential\nrole to play in helping the poorest countries, particularly\nin Africa. Official development assistance also assists in\nbuilding up the sectors that do not attract private\ninvestment: health, education, the social sectors and\ncapacity-building in general. In this way, countries may\nalso, eventually, become able to attract private investment\nand to avail themselves of the opportunities of\ninternational trade.\nIn this context, it is deplorable to see official\ndevelopment assistance reaching its lowest point ever.\nHonouring the commitments of official development\nassistance entered into internationally by industrialized\ncountries has become a question of credibility. It is also\na question of the effectiveness of the multilateral system.\nThe United Nations system cannot perform the tasks we\nask of it if we deny it the necessary means. The\ndownward trend of official development assistance must\nbe reversed and a higher share should be multilateral.\nMany poor countries are crippled with debt\nhampering their development. We therefore welcome the\nproposals to improve the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\nDebt (HIPC) Initiative. We are, however, disappointed by\nthe lack of progress in financing the Initiative. We appeal\nto the major donor countries to live up to their\nresponsibilities following the debt declaration of the\nCologne summit.\nBesides aid, not instead of aid, developing countries\nneed trade. In the forthcoming new global trade round,\n38\n\n\nevery effort must be made to ensure better market access\nfor developing countries and to enhance their real capacity\nto take part in international trade.\nThe pursuit of human security and human development\nare not two independent paths. They are interrelated.\nWithout economic and social development, it makes no\nsense to talk about human security. Where security does not\nexist, there will be no sustainable development. When\nviolent conflict erupts, the results of decades of\ndevelopment may be undone in a very short time. We must\nuphold the importance of both concerns and we must\nemphasize that they are a national as well as an\ninternational responsibility.\nWe thus face a major challenge at the threshold of the\nnext millennium \u2014 a challenge we should give proper\nattention to at the Millennium Assembly next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Its effectiveness will depend on\nits ability to re-adapt itself to today's realities.\nThe reform of the United Nations, the maintenance\nof international peace and security, disarmament, the fight\nagainst poverty and the strengthening of international\ncooperation \u2014 all of these matters will require our\nattention and energy in the third millennium.\nI am certain, therefore, that the Assembly will agree\nthat the events taking place today clearly show the need\nto reform the United Nations.\nAll the arguments favour such a change as a means\nof strengthening the United Nations system and\ndemocratizing its main bodies, particular the Security\nCouncil, to make it into an authentic tool in the service\npeace and development for all. Our position on these\nissues is in accordance with that of the African Group as\n\n\nset forth at the thirty-fifth summit of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) in Algiers. The new make-up of the\nSecurity Council must fully reflect present-day realities\nthrough the equitable geographic representation of every\nregion of the world.\nThe increasing number of conflicts is undermining the\nfoundations of international peace and security and\ndangerously compromising the development efforts of our\nStates. In this respect, I am sure the Assembly agrees that\nthere can be no development without a consistent political\ncommitment on the part of our States to peace and\ndisarmament. That is why my delegation believes that any\nsign of indifference or silence on the part of the\ninternational community when confronted with the spectre\nof violence and the use of weapons of mass destruction can\nprove fatal for international peace and security.\nAs in the past, the Republic of Guinea can neither\nremain silent nor conceal its concern with regard to the\nincreasing number of areas of tension and conflict\nthroughout the world, particularly in Africa. Indeed, more\nthan two thirds of the items currently on the agenda of the\nSecurity Council relate to critical situations in Africa.\nHowever, despite these difficult circumstances, our\ncontinent has courageously taken its destiny into its own\nhands by creating, under the auspices of the OAU, a\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution. With the assistance of the United Nations, this\nmechanism should be able to play a major role in\nmaintaining peace on the continent.\nAfrica needs international cooperation if it is to make\nthis instrument fully effective, given the breadth and\ncomplexity of the task that it must undertake. For some 10\nyears, West Africa has been particularly tested by the\nfratricidal wars in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau.\nThey have had very serious consequences for those\ncountries, which have become fields of desolation and\nwhose reconstruction will require the assistance of the\ninternational community for a long time to come.\nIn this context, particular attention should be paid to\nthe unfortunate young people in those countries. Tens of\nthousands of adolescents have been dragged into those\nwars, and now they are skilled only at fighting. It is\nessential to provide for and ensure their economic and\nsocial integration so as to prevent them from becoming\neasy prey to the warlords who are laying waste to the\nregion.\nThe consequences of the conflicts and tensions in the\nneighbouring countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and\nGuinea-Bissau have affected Guinea in many ways and\nsignificantly impeded the achievement of its development\ntargets. My country has provided asylum to several\nhundred thousands of refugees, whose presence in our\nland has had a very serious impact on its economy,\nenvironment and security. The impact of the refugees and\nthe burden they represent for the country in general, and\nfor the host populations in particular, have been\nenormous, making Guinea one of the leading countries of\nasylum in the world, since the high proportion of refugees\nmakes up more than one tenth of its population.\nThis situation has affected the ability of the\nGovernment to achieve its priority development objectives\nbecause of the tremendous unforeseen expenses that\nGuinea has had to bear and will continue to have to bear\nin order to restore peace, security and stability in the\nsubregion, together with the other States members of the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS).\nDespite the support of the international community\nin the face of these crises and conflicts that are\nconvulsing our continent, it is regrettable to note the\ndiscriminatory way in which Africa is treated in dealing\nwith the refugee problem. We should like here to\nwelcome the gratifying initiative of the United Nations to\nmake the Republic of Guinea the focal point of stability\nin the subregion.\nIn this connection, a solidarity conference to\nstrengthen Guinea's stability and efforts for sustainable\ndevelopment will soon be held in Brussels. My country,\nwhich has high expectations of that meeting, would like\nto appeal to all donors to increase their support for the\nefforts of the Government of Guinea to deal with the\nsocio-economic consequences of the massive presence of\nrefugees in our territory.\nI should like to reiterate to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, the sincere gratitude of the people of\nGuinea for his recent visit to our country, and I am\npleased to be able solemnly to pay tribute to his personal\naction to mobilize the international community for the\nbenefit of Guinea.\nThe subregion of West Africa is not the only one\nthat has suffered from war. We remain deeply concerned\nby the fratricidal struggles that are convulsing Central\nAfrica, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the\n\n\n\nCongo and Angola; those conflicts continue to be at the\nforefront of the international political scene. While\ndeploring the situation, which is a threat to the stability of\nour continent, I should like here to call on all the parties\nconcerned to give a chance to the negotiation and mediation\nefforts under way in various places so that those crises can\nbe overcome. I congratulate the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity and encourage them to\npursue their initiatives and concrete actions aimed at\nrestoring peace in those countries.\nToday more than ever, the Middle East needs peace\nand security. Such a peace can be built only with mutual\nconfidence and the desire to live together, with respect for\nthe rights and the dignity of all the peoples of the region.\nThat is why we welcome the recent developments in the\nMiddle East, particularly in Israel. The hopes that have\nbeen raised should not be dashed.\nIn Yugoslavia, the advent of peace requires tolerance\nand respect for the territorial integrity and the right to\ncoexistence of all the various parts of that nation. The\nestablishment of a true State based on the rule of law is the\nonly way of guaranteeing the reconstruction of the country,\nwith the assistance of the international community.\nAnother subject of major concern to Africa is that of\neconomic matters and international cooperation. Here we\nmust acknowledge that efforts to date have not yielded the\nresults we had hoped for in meeting the needs and\naspirations of our peoples. An in-depth, comprehensive,\nproactive approach to development problems, as defined at\nthe Second Tokyo International Conference on African\nDevelopment, deserves the support and assistance of the\ninternational community. Unfortunately, one of the essential\nelements of such cooperation \u2014 the North-South dialogue\nso eagerly sought by our countries \u2014 remains at an\nimpasse. All the while, disparities between the rich\ncountries of the North and the underdeveloped countries of\nthe South have grown. The arbitrary fixing of prices for\ncommodities and manufactured goods by the North reduces\nto the point of futility the measures that have been proposed\nto alleviate the burden of external-debt servicing.\nThe system of trade too is based on discrimination.\nUnder the banner of liberalization and free competition,\nglobalization has had the effect of eroding or even\neliminating preferences providing our commodities with\naccess to the markets of the North. It is vital to establish\ntimetables for adaptation and for the provision of alternative\ncompensation so that our countries can maximize their\npotential as participants in world trade. Further, because of\nthe importance of the fight against poverty in developing\ncountries, we call upon donor countries to redouble their\nefforts to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national\nproduct for official development assistance.\nTurning to the crucial question of debt, it is now our\nfirm conviction that no economic-recovery programme\ncan have the hoped-for results without a favourable\napproach to the backlog of debt burdening African\ncountries, particularly the most heavily indebted among\nthem. While my delegation welcomes the recent decisions\ntaken by the Group of Eight at Cologne, we are\nnonetheless concerned that efforts need to be made to\nproduce a lasting resolution of the debt question. Debt\ncontinues to swallow up the bulk of the resources of poor\ncountries, particularly those in Africa, whose earnings are\ndiminishing daily in spite of the great sacrifices made by\nour peoples with the adoption of structural adjustment\nmeasures.\nWe therefore call for the convening of an\ninternational conference on the external debt of Africa\nwith a view to finding a final solution to this problem;\nthis would revitalize our ever more fragile economies. I\nwish in that connection to say that my country is now\nengaged in ongoing dialogue with the Paris Club of\nIndustrial Country Creditors, the relevant Consultative\nGroup, and the donor community with a view to\nsignificant rescheduling of our external debt.\nTurning to the question of human rights and\ndemocracy, my Government believes that the eradication\nof poverty, social inequality and ignorance is a\nprerequisite for the promotion of human rights. Even\nthough we are living through a difficult situation, my\ncountry remains deeply committed to democratic values\nand fundamental freedoms and has created all the\nnecessary institutions for a State based on law; the proper\nfunctioning of these will contribute to our political\nstability.\nWe have been witness to the gradual emergence of\na sense of hope, common destiny and a new partnership\namong nations. Such a world vision, however, should not\nto cloak our profound concern at a time when humanity\nis preparing to cross the threshold of the third\nmillennium. The international community must do\neverything in its power to bring about the triumph of\nhope, even if threats to the very existence of the world\npersist. If it is to shoulder these responsibilities to the full,\nthe international community has no choice but to help the\nUnited Nations adapt to the major changes under way in\n3\n\n\nthe world and must play its proper role in that world. More\nthan ever before, mankind must understand that it bears\nresponsibility for its own future.\nIn the name of human solidarity, the very fabric of\ninternational cooperation, I call upon all members of this\ngreat world family to make the United Nations a centre for\nharmonizing the efforts of the nations of the world, united\nin defence of our common destiny: a house in which all our\nwills converge resolutely, looking towards the future, and\nin which humanity can flourish and be united on the basis\nof freedom, justice, peace and prosperity. Long live the\nUnited Nations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The Bahamas shares the\nconfidence that the international community has placed in\nyou, Sir, as the envoy of Namibia and of the continent of\nAfrica to preside over this fifty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, the last in this twentieth century. My\ndelegation congratulates you and pledges its full support as\nyou guide our deliberations at this critical juncture.\nMy delegation\u2019s congratulations are also extended to\nMr. Didier Opertti, who represented our Latin American\nand Caribbean region as President of the fifty-third session.\nMy delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations for his leadership of this\nhighly complex Organization on which rest the hopes and\naspirations of the world\u2019s peoples and which is our best\nprospect for a stable world.\nI am pleased on this occasion to warmly welcome the\nKingdom of Tonga, the Republic of Kiribati and the\nRepublic of Nauru, the United Nations newest Member\nStates, to this community of nations. These countries add to\nthe growing number of small island developing States in the\nUnited Nations and underscore the need for the\nOrganization to increase its efforts in support of this\nimportant constituency.\nThe United Nations was created with a mandate to\nwork collectively for a better world, and since its\ninception it has contributed to positive developments in\nthe global arena. However, significant challenges persist.\nThe agenda of the fifty-fourth session shows that even as\nsome progress has been made, we will continue at this\nsession to grapple with many of the thorny issues that\nhave preoccupied the international community over the\ndecades. At the same time, new challenges will have to\nbe addressed.\nRecent events in Europe and elsewhere in the world,\nspawned by internal conflict, have raised questions as to\nwhether States fractured by ethnic, religious and other\nstrife could build national identities to span these divides.\nAt the same time, they remind us that the greatest care\nmust be taken in making exceptions to the general\nprinciple of non-intervention in the internal affairs of\nother States. The Bahamas believes that this principle\nremains an important safeguard for international peace\nand security.\nThe Bahamas accepts that internal conflicts create\nsituations in which the Security Council should act, in\naccordance with the Charter. However, we believe that\nwhenever the United Nations responds to internal\nconflicts and threats to regional stability, it must do so\nwith one and the same degree of urgency, with adequate\nresources and with consistency. It is with these\nconsiderations in mind that the Bahamas supports United\nNations efforts to bring peace and stability to areas of\nconflict in all regions of the world.\nRecent United Nations peace initiatives give us hope\nthat long-standing and seemingly intractable problems\nmay have solutions. Indeed, the Bahamas is encouraged\nby developments in the Middle East, particularly the\nsigning this month of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.\nWe see these developments as having the potential to end\ndecades of conflict in that troubled region. If enlightened\nself-interest were to prevail in long-standing conflicts\nelsewhere in Africa, Asia and Latin America, they too\ncould be resolved. Global attention could then be turned\ntowards development and human betterment, as envisaged\nin the Charter.\nGlobalization and trade liberalization are gaining\ncurrency as means of promoting accelerated development\nand opening opportunities to bridge the gap between rich\n15\n\n\nand poor. However, concerns are being expressed that the\nrules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its\ndispute settlement mechanisms put the interests of the\nstrong ahead of the interests of the weak. Indeed, the\nanticipated benefits of free trade give little comfort to\nCaribbean States and farmers dependent as they are on\nbananas for their foreign exchange earnings and their very\nlivelihood. Where preferential treatment is removed before\nCaribbean countries can restructure their economies, severe\nhardship results. We therefore believe that all concerned\nmust make an effort to find a solution to the banana\nproblem.\nWe see the new round of WTO negotiations scheduled\nto begin in Seattle in November as an invaluable\nopportunity for developing countries to have their concerns\nincorporated into the discussions. The Bahamas is currently\ngiving consideration to acquiring observer status in the\nWTO. It fully intends to follow the multilateral negotiating\nprocess and to bring its concerns to the table, particularly\nin the areas of trade in services and differential treatment\nfor small economies.\nGrowth in the economy of the Bahamas is in part\nattributable to the services it offers as an offshore financial\ncentre. The Bahamas is concerned about the action taken\nwithin the international community to inhibit or prevent the\nuse of offshore centres and to label them, impertinently, as\n\u201charmful\u201d tax jurisdictions. Furthermore, there is a tendency\nto treat all offshore jurisdictions as a homogenous group,\nwhich they are most definitely not.\nThe Bahamas had the opportunity to address the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\non harmful tax practices in August this year in Paris. We\nemphasized there that strict regulations and appropriate\nlegislation, specifically formulated to counter money\nlaundering and other illegal activities, govern financial\ninstitutions in the Bahamas. The Bahamas is committed to\nworking with all concerned to address these and related\nissues.\nIn May this year, it was reported to our Parliament\nthat the economy of the Bahamas was experiencing a\nperiod of dynamism. In 1998, our economy grew some 3\nper cent, the unemployment rate was 7.8 per cent and net\nforeign investment inflows amounted to $491 million. But\non 14 September 1999, hurricane Floyd struck the\nBahamas, and the entire archipelago felt its impact.\nSignificant damage was done to the environment,\ninfrastructure and property. The full implications for the\neconomy of our country of the relief, recovery and\nreconstruction efforts have yet to be calculated.\nWhat happened in the Bahamas underscores the\ncontinuing validity of the Barbados Programme of Action\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States, adopted in 1994. We cannot help but\nemphasize \u2014 as so many States did at the recently\nconcluded twenty-second special session \u2014 how\nimperative it therefore remains for the Barbados\nProgramme of Action to be implemented. It is in this\ncontext that we urge renewed commitment on the part of\nall to the search for consensus on the draft resolution on\nthe recognition of the Caribbean Sea as a special area in\nthe context of sustainable development.\nTogether with our Caribbean Community sister\nStates, the Bahamas has made known our concern\nregarding the transhipment of nuclear and hazardous\nwaste through the Caribbean Sea. Yet these shipments\ncontinue. We reiterate our wish to see these shipments\nstopped: they constitute the gravest risk to the fragility of\nour marine environment and our economies.\nThe significant number of reviews issued recently or\nexpected in the coming months, of the outcomes of\nUnited Nations Conferences on small island developing\nStates, population and development, social development\nand women, attest to the efforts of the United Nations to\nmeet its economic and social obligations under the\nCharter. The Bahamas confidently expects that these\nreviews will all confirm that renewed political will and\naction are required to meet the goals we set, at a high\nlevel, in Barbados, Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing.\nLet me comment briefly on our continuing efforts to\nmaintain the momentum for gender equality, a subject\nwhich will be taken up in the five-year Beijing review.\nWomen worldwide continue to break through glass\nceilings. In the Bahamas, for example, women have made\nsignificant strides in Parliament, the judiciary, public\nservice and business and service organizations. However,\nthe Bahamas is cognizant that there are still serious\nchallenges to women\u2019s equality. We are particularly\nconcerned about the traffic in human beings,\npredominantly women and children. The Bahamas intends\nto continue its active support, both nationally and\ninternationally, for efforts to help women realize their\nlegal rights, attain economic empowerment and rise above\npoverty. It is our hope, therefore, that the Beijing review\nwill result in strategies to further engage the international\ncommunity in support of the world\u2019s women.\n16\n\n\nThe Bahamas supports the growing consensus on\nhuman rights, which focuses on principles and values\nincluding democracy, good governance and the rule of law.\nWe also believe that United Nations Member States should\nhonour the human rights commitments they have made.\nThe Republic of Haiti is a fledgling democracy\ncourageously facing significant political, economic and\nsocial challenges. These myriad challenges have resulted in\na sustained influx of illegal immigration from Haiti into the\nBahamas. Together with other illegal immigration,\nparticularly from other countries in the Caribbean region,\nillegal Haitian immigration continues to be a burden to the\nsocio-economic structures of the Bahamas. We therefore\nhave a vested interest in the stabilization of Haiti\u2019s\ndemocratic institutions and economy. The Bahamas\nparticipated in a Caribbean Community mission to Haiti in\nJuly of this year; that mission reviewed with the Haitian\nGovernment its preparedness for elections. In so doing, we\nsignalled our support for the process of free and fair\nelections in Haiti. We also fully support the efforts of the\nEconomic and Social Council and of the General Assembly\nfor Haiti\u2019s reconstruction and for the strengthening and\nfurtherance of its democracy.\nLast year, at the twentieth special session of the\nGeneral Assembly, on the world drug problem, the\ninternational community adopted a new and detailed\nprogramme of measures to enhance the effectiveness of\nnational, regional and international drug control activities.\nMember States must now implement the programme,\nparticularly by meeting the targets set in the special\nsession\u2019s concluding documents. For the United Nations\nInternational Drug Control Programme to carry out its\nmandate, adequate resources must be allocated to it.\nDrug trafficking into and through the Bahamas is a\nmajor threat to our socio-economic development. A\nsignificant proportion of the national budget continues to be\nspent on drug law enforcement. I wish to emphasize that\neven though we do so at the expense of vital national\nprogrammes, the Bahamas will not relent in its efforts to\novercome the serious challenges posed by drug trafficking\nand related criminality. We are particularly concerned about\nthe traffic in illicit firearms, which appears to be working\nin tandem with the drug trade. Further, with the increase in\nfirearms comes an increase in violent crime committed with\nthose firearms. We continue to urge greater efforts to\ncontrol the illicit manufacture of and trafficking in firearms,\nincluding the ratification and implementation of relevant\ninternational conventions.\nThe failure to achieve general and complete\ndisarmament means that serious threats to international\npeace and security persist. The production and stockpiling\nof chemical, biological and other weapons of mass\ndestruction exacerbate this situation. The Convention on\nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction, to which the Bahamas is a party, has been a\nkey success in recent disarmament initiatives. The\nConvention demonstrates what can be achieved when\nthere is unity of purpose in the field of disarmament.\nIn a constantly changing global environment, United\nNations reform must continue to be a priority to ensure\nthat the Organization remains relevant to the role\nenvisaged for it under the Charter. Negotiations on the\nmultifaceted objective of Security Council reform have\nmoved at a frustratingly slow pace. It is clear that the\nCouncil must be reformed, and that one of the main\nobjectives must be its enlargement. This has the support\nof the Bahamas. However, in determining criteria for\nexpanded membership of the Council, consideration must\nbe given to a mechanism for all Members to enjoy the\nprivilege of serving thereon.\nThe Bahamas welcomes the General Assembly\u2019s\ndecision to convene a millennium summit at the\nbeginning of the Millennium Assembly. We share the\nview that the summit should not be just a\ncommemoration, but should also be substantive. The\nBahamas wishes to reflect briefly on what the summit\u2019s\napproach might include. We see the summit not as a\nforum for a restatement of lofty ideals or of the practical\ninitiatives that were the outcomes of past international\nconferences. The millennium summit must be used as a\ncatalyst that would build, especially, on the outcomes of\nthose conferences to produce a revitalized international\nagenda for the twenty-first century. That agenda should\ntake into account the accomplishments of the United\nNations system as a whole in the areas of economic and\nsocial development as well as peace and security, and it\nshould be realistic. From this last perspective, it is the\ncontinued position of the Bahamas that the question of\nrefugees, for example, should not continue to be divorced\nfrom the broader question of illegal migration.\nUnder the revitalized agenda, the United Nations\nwould have improved partnerships with other regional and\ninternational organizations. Such partnerships with\norganizations including the Commonwealth, the\nOrganization of American States and the Caribbean\n17\n\n\nCommunity would further the coordination of solutions to\nproblems of a global nature.\nThe United Nations cannot do what we ask of it unless\nit is provided with the necessary resources. The common\nvalues we share, and our determination to find solutions to\nthe world\u2019s problems, should give us the political will to\nbuild on what the United Nations has accomplished to date.\nThus, the Organization must be assured of funding on a\nreliable, predictable and timely basis to carry out the\nmandates entrusted to it by its Member States.\nThe broad range of problems and issues on the United\nNations agenda cannot be solved without investment in\nmultilateralism and partnerships. It is our responsibility to\nmake the United Nations a highly effective organization\nfully capable of responding to the security, political,\neconomic and social challenges of the twenty-first century.\nThe Bahamas pledges its full commitment to play its part\nin United Nations efforts to secure a better future for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am fully confident that your experience\nand skills will bring the work of this session to a\nsuccessful conclusion. Please permit me also to express\nmy deep appreciation and gratitude to your predecessor,\nMr. Didier Opertti, for his magnificent and distinguished\nstewardship, which made a success of the last session.\nI take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his wise\nleadership and outstanding work towards realizing and\nemphasizing the goals and principles of the United\nNations and his tireless efforts to achieve peace, security\nand stability in the world.\nIn the last few months of the second millennium,\nand as we bid farewell to it and await the dawning of the\nthird millennium, this session of the General Assembly\ntakes place at an important historic and symbolic moment,\na moment of mixed emotions. We look back and see that\nmankind has achieved great things despite the serious\nsuffering and pain that have marked the twentieth century.\nWe look forward with great hope to entering a new era in\nwhich we shall build a more humanitarian world, in\nwhich nations will be able to live in true partnership, with\na sense of belonging to this planet, in a more just and\nharmonious way. We shall have an enhanced ability to\ncope collectively with the major challenges that confront\nus and to respond to changes that require a long-range\nglobal vision. This will increase our ability to provide\nanswers and solutions to the difficult questions and issues\nthat face us.\nThis historic moment is of particular importance in\nthe life of Jordan, which was engulfed by grief a few\nmonths ago, when it was deprived of its great leader, the\nlate King Hussein Ibn Talal \u2014 may God bless his soul.\nHe had succeeded in turning Jordan from a small country\nwith limited resources into an oasis of peace and stability\nin a region beset by disturbances and wars. This country\nhas just begun a new era under the leadership of King\nAbdullah II Bin Al Hussein. His Majesty has assumed the\nresponsibility for continuing, with renewed vigour, to lead\nJordan to progress and prosperity, as we look forward to\nushering in the new century. He is committed also to\nJordan\u2019s continuing to make its important and essential\ncontribution to the building of peace in the Middle East\nand to continuing to contribute generously at the\ninternational level. He strongly believes, as Jordan\u2019s\nleaders have always believed, that our country belongs to\n30\n\n\nthis international family. Jordan is committed to the Charter\nof the United Nations and to the principles of international\nlaw.\nOur late leader was a unique international leader, with\nan unflinching belief in the role of the United Nations and\nin the peaceful settlement of disputes. He expressed his\nbelief in these principles by working all his life to bring\nabout a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle\nEast based on international legitimacy. He did this out of\nhis strong belief in human dignity, in people\u2019s right to live\nfree from all forms of injustice and despotism, and out of\nan awareness that human life is too precious to be wasted\nin confrontations and wars. Human beings have the right to\nlead free and dignified lives, channelling all their resources\nand energies towards achieving economic and social\ndevelopment and participating in building a prosperous and\nsecure future for the generations to come.\nThe life of our great leader who is, alas, no more, is\nthe story of the building of modern Jordan. His exceptional\ncontributions in the international arena were also a rare\nexample of what can be achieved by a historic leader who\nbelieves in high moral principles and supreme virtues.\nJordanians felt a deep sense of pride and appreciation when\nthey saw the whole world \u2014 leaders and common people\nalike \u2014 standing side by side with them, sharing their grief\nat the loss of the creator of their renaissance and their\nmodern State. They also felt a deep sense of trust and\nconfidence in the strength and durability of their\nconstitutional and institutional structures, which were built\nby the late leader of their country and have ensured a stable\nand successful beginning to the era of King Abdullah II Bin\nAl Hussein, in a way that has won the appreciation and\nrespect of the world.\nJordanians are rallying today behind their King and\nmarching behind him on the road to realizing their hopes\nand aspirations. Jordan is beginning, under the leadership of\nKing Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, a new era with a firm\ncommitment to following the same course that has\ndistinguished and will continue to distinguish Jordanian\npolicy at both the domestic and international levels.\nOver the past few months, Jordan has continued its\nefforts to advance the peace process in the Middle East.\nThis process had suffered over the past three years from\nfoot-dragging leading to effective deadlock, all of which\nseverely tested the confidence of the peoples of the region\nin the peace process as a whole. The result of last May\u2019s\nparliamentary elections in Israel gave rise to new hopes of\nreviving this process and putting it back on track. The\npositive developments of the past few weeks show that\nthe region stands now before a second historic\nopportunity to achieve peace on all tracks. We sincerely\nhope that the leaders of the region will seize this\nopportunity, live up to the expectations and aspirations of\ntheir peoples and not hesitate to take the bold decisions\nneeded to bring the negotiations to fruition.\nThe question of Palestine has been and will continue\nto be at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the\nMiddle East crisis. The establishment of peace in the\nregion therefore requires, first and foremost, that a just\nsolution should be reached to this question \u2014 a solution\nwith which the peoples of the region will be satisfied and\nwhich they will if need be defend. Jordan has been calling\nthroughout the past year for the Wye River Memorandum,\nwhich was arrived at with the unprecedented involvement\nand assistance of the late King Hussein, to be\nimplemented. We have been consistently aware of the\nimpact that implementation of the Memorandum would\nhave on reactivating the peace process on all tracks, on\nestablishing confidence and a spirit of partnership\nbetween the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships, and on re-\nestablishing confidence in the peace process amongst the\npeoples of the region. The signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh\nMemorandum has enhanced the prospects for\nimplementing the Wye River Memorandum in a way that\nwe hope will advance the final status negotiations\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis so that a\nsettlement may be reached that would ensure that the\nPalestinian people realize their right to self-determination,\nincluding their right to establish an independent State on\ntheir national territory, with Al-Quds al-Sharif \u2014 Holy\nJerusalem \u2014 as its capital.\nAs King Abdullah II has emphasized, Jordan will\ncontinue to provide support for a successful conclusion of\nthe negotiations. We are directly interested in their\nsuccess because the issues on the agenda relate to our\nnational interest, particularly the issues of the refugees,\nthe borders and Jerusalem. Over the past 50 years, Jordan,\nmore than any other party, has shouldered the burden of\nthe refugee problem. This has put immense pressures on\nJordan\u2019s resources and economy, particularly given that\nevery reduction in the services provided by the United\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\nin the Near East (UNRWA) has placed additional burdens\non Jordan. Direct expenditures by the Government of\nJordan on services provided to the refugees in 1998\nreached 4.75 times the amount spent by UNRWA on such\nservices. Total expenditures incurred by the Government\nof Jordan equal the entire budget that UNRWA spends on\n31\n\n\nrefugees in all its areas of operations throughout the Middle\nEast. Jordan calls on the international community not to\nallow any reductions in the role of UNRWA or in its\nprogrammes until the refugee question has been resolved in\naccordance with international legitimacy \u2014 which would\nlead to the closing of this file in its entirety once and for\nall. Jordan also calls on the donor countries to continue\ntheir support for UNRWA to enable it to continue to\ndischarge its responsibilities.\nWith regard to the peace process on other tracks,\nJordan believes that a comprehensive solution is a\nprerequisite for the establishment of peace in the region.\nWithout such a solution, no settlement can be assured of\ndurability. Jordan therefore strongly supports the efforts to\nreactivate negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.\nIt supports the demand by Syria and Lebanon that\nnegotiations should be resumed from the point at which\nthey stopped. The Jordanian leadership will spare no effort\nto help bring about a breakthrough in negotiations on both\ntracks.\nHopes have been rising over the past few weeks that\nthis can be achieved, particularly in view of Syria\u2019s\nreaffirmation of its full commitment to work for the\nestablishment of peace and of its concern for reviving the\npeace process and bringing it to its desired goal: the\nachievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive\nsettlement. There have also been a number of positive\nindicators from the Syrian Government and the Israeli\nGovernment has said that it is convinced of the crucial\nimportance of reaching a peace agreement with Syria.\nWhile looking forward to these positive developments with\ngreat hopes, the peoples of the region earnestly desire that\nthis historic opportunity should not be missed and that the\nefforts made will succeed in reaching a settlement whereby\nSyria and Lebanon will have their legitimate rights restored\nthrough Israel\u2019s withdrawal from the Syrian Arab Golan\nHeights and from southern Lebanon in implementation of\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\n425 (1978).\nThe peoples of the Middle East region have suffered\nunprecedented hardships because of the failure to reach a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peaceful settlement. Vast\nresources have been squandered on a useless arms race that\nfailed to provide security for any of the parties. Today the\npeoples of the region look forward to real progress in the\npeace process \u2014 progress that will help create a climate\nconducive to an end to the arms race and to convincing the\nvarious parties that peace is the only option capable of\nproviding security for all. It will also convince them to\nmake the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass\ndestruction. This requires a commitment from all parties\nto accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and to ratify the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nThe issues of refugees, economic disparities and\nwater, as well as the elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction, require effective regional cooperation and\nconcrete international support. Without resolving the\nfundamental political aspects of the conflict, the region\nwill continue to suffer from the consequences of non-\ncooperation in resolving these issues. Unless they are\nresolved, they themselves will escalate and create new\nhotbeds of conflict in the region.\nOn the eastern flank of our region, the Iraqi people\ncontinue to suffer unprecedented hardships as a result of\nthe continued economic sanctions. The price of these\nsanctions is paid by the Iraqi people in terms of their\nhealth, nutrition, education and prospects for progress.\nThis poses serious future dangers for the region as a\nwhole.\nJordan therefore calls for ending this suffering by\nlifting the sanctions. It also calls for the implementation\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions, including\nthose concerning the Kuwaiti prisoners of war and\nmissing persons. It further calls upon the Security Council\nto conduct a comprehensive review that would lead to\nextricating Iraq from this situation and to affirm its\nposition of upholding the territorial integrity of Iraq as\none of the main pillars of regional security.\nJordan\u2019s geographical location between two\nextremely complex situations resulting from the\nconsequences of the Middle East crisis in general and the\nlack of progress in the peace process during the past three\nyears in particular, as well as the continued economic\nsanctions against Iraq for nine years, has subjected the\nJordanian economy to tremendous pressures. Countries\nwith capabilities and resources much greater than Jordan\u2019s\nwould have difficulty coping with them. Although Jordan\nis committed to implementing an integrated programme of\nreform and restructuring of its economy and to taking\ndifficult and painful economic measures, the impact of\nthese two situations makes it virtually impossible for\nJordan to achieve acceptable levels of economic growth,\nand it continues to suffer a huge external debt.\nViewing the real economic situation of Jordan and\nthe challenges facing it without linking it to the regional\n32\n\n\nenvironment that affects it does not give a true picture of\nthis situation. While Jordan is grateful for and appreciative\nof the international community\u2019s support for Jordan\u2019s\nefforts to cope with its enormous economic challenges, and\nits assistance to Jordan in playing its central role in\nmaintaining stability in the region, Jordan would like the\ninternational community to have a better understanding of\nits economic problems. From this perspective, we view with\nspecial appreciation the final communiqu\u00e9 issued at the\nSummit meeting of the leaders of the industrialized nations\nin Cologne last June, which reflected political will to help\nJordan and called for the consideration of reducing Jordan\u2019s\nforeign debt-burden. We hope that the friendly creditor\ncountries will take all possible measures to translate that\npolitical will into action, enabling Jordan to reduce its debt\nburden to a point that allows its economy to be revitalized\nand to achieve higher growth rates.\nThe tragic situation the people of Kosovo were made\nto experience severely tested the ability of the international\ncommunity, at the close of this century, to prevent the\ncrimes of ethnic cleansing and the violation of basic human\nrights from being committed in a most despicable, racist\nmanner. This matter raises extremely serious and complex\nquestions about the role of the United Nations and the\nlimits that separate the right of States to assert their\nsovereignty without committing mass crimes against\nhelpless unarmed civilians.\nThere are lessons to be drawn from this bitter human\nexperience. On the one hand, the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization\u2019s ability to put an end to the criminal acts has\ngiven clear evidence to all those who harbour thoughts of\nrebelling against international law and of committing\nsimilar acts that they should not presume that their\ndomestic military strength ensures absolute dominance,\nincluding violation of human rights. Upholding the principle\nof sovereignty should not overturn the obligation to observe\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law.\nOn the other hand, as Members of this international\nOrganization, we must look into finding mechanisms that\nensure the enhancement of the United Nations and its\nability to be the framework that expresses the determination\nof the international community to prevent such crimes, and\nto be the umbrella for the coordination and organization of\ncollective international action to achieve that goal.\nThat situation has demonstrated the need for\nformulating a new international order for the twenty-first\ncentury, in which all peoples can enjoy respect for their\ndiversity and can participate in the formation of a world\nconscience that ensures their coexistence. Continued\nprogress by peoples in adopting democracy as a way of\nlife makes it urgent to strengthen democracy within the\ninternational system. Since the United Nations is the\nbackbone of the world system, it must evolve in such a\nway that reflects the new realities in the international\narena.\nOur international community has an urgent need to\npause for a real review of the international situation in all\nits dimensions: political, security, economic,\nenvironmental and human rights. We hope that the world\nsummit to be held next year will provide an opportunity\nfor such a review.\nWhile we see that many issues and crises considered\nby the United Nations remain to be resolved, this does not\nnecessarily mean failure on the part of the United Nations\nas much as it demonstrates the importance of an existing\npolitical will to resolve them.\nFurthermore, the challenges of globalization pose\nnew kinds of global problems, which require harmonious\nglobal solutions to the challenges facing developed\nsocieties, such as terrorism, drug-trafficking and pollution\nof the environment, and to the challenges that threaten the\ndeveloping countries, such as debt, unemployment and\neconomic recession. Such solutions must also strengthen\nthe ability of the developing countries to benefit from the\nopportunities provided by globalization and to avoid its\nnegative effects by preventing a broadening of the\ninequalities that lie between them and the developed\ncountries. The persistence of these inequalities will cause\nthe developing countries to remain on the periphery of\nglobalization.\nDespite the magnitude of the challenges that\ncontinue to confront us as we begin the proceedings of\nthis last session of the General Assembly in this century,\nwe should not overlook the many positive steps that have\nbeen made recently. The adoption of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court was a particularly important\nmeasure taken towards confronting and preventing the\nperpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity\nfrom escaping punishment. I must also mention the\nsuccessful conclusion of the first Conference of States\nParties on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and On\nTheir Destruction.\nSuch accomplishments contribute to strengthening\nhuman security and consolidating the commitment to\n33\n\n\nhuman rights. They also provide examples of the potential\nfor activating international cooperation in many areas,\nincluding the promotion of international commitment to\ncondemning and prohibiting terrorism.\nIn a different context, Jordan welcomes the agreement\nreached by Libya and the United Nations on the Lockerbie\nissue. It also commends the strenuous efforts made by the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, which contributed\nto the reaching of an agreement. It calls for the complete\nlifting of sanctions against Libya, after the removal of the\nreasons for such sanctions and following the extradition of\nthe two suspects for trial.\nOn the matter of regional crises, we appeal to our\nfriends in Pakistan and India to resort to peaceful means to\nresolve their conflict and to refrain from any escalation that\nwould seriously endanger the peace of the Indian\nsubcontinent and the whole world.\nAs for the dispute between the United Arab Emirates\nand the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan calls for, as it\nalways has, the resolution of this dispute through dialogue\nbased upon mutual respect. It also hopes that Iran will heed\nthe United Arab Emirates\u2019 request to enter into dialogue\nwith a specific timetable and agenda, in order to reach a\nsolution that conforms to international legitimacy, which\ndenies the admissibility of occupation of territory by force.\nJordan attaches special importance to maintaining a\ndialogue between religions and civilizations, in order to\nbring closer together the views of the various beliefs,\nreligions and civilizations. This will also create a common\nbase for developing humanitarian thought, which calls for\npeace and cooperation rather than confrontation. These\nefforts have resulted in creating a greater awareness at the\ndomestic and international levels of the goals of this\ndialogue. We hope that the United Nations will promote,\nthrough its specialized agencies, programmes of dialogue in\nthe various fields of human activity and at all national,\nregional and international levels.\nThe international community is called upon to use\ndialogue to combat dangerous discriminatory practices,\nwhich we see today, such as Islamophobia. Islam is being\nsubjected to a severe and unjustified attack, which attempts,\nintentionally or unintentionally, to establish a linkage\nbetween Islam and those extremist and terrorist movements\nthat hurt Islam and Muslims by using religion as a tool.\nDiscrimination and arbitrary practices against Muslim\npopulations in various countries are only a result of\nextremist thinking, far removed from the principles of\ncivilized behaviour and humanity. The international\ncommunity must consider how to confront this\nphenomenon of Islamophobia in order to prevent its\nproliferation.\nNatural disasters, which have afflicted many\ncountries recently, remind us of a basic fact, which is that\nwe all face phenomena and challenges that do not\ndiscriminate between us on the basis of race, religion,\nwealth or geographical location. While expressing\nsympathy to our friends in Turkey and Greece, which\nhave been hit by earthquakes recently, and our admiration\nfor the positive sentiments they have expressed to each\nother in their suffering, we realize that confronting natural\ndangers and disasters, like confronting other challenges,\nrequires a sincere political will to take collective action in\norder to preserve the planet, to which we all belong\nequally.\n"

        "file_text": "The past year has been a\ndifficult one for the United Nations. Its principles have\nbeen challenged. Its relevance has been questioned. Still, at\nthe end of the millennium, we have proved ourselves\nunable to prevent war between Ethiopia and Eritrea and\nunable to prevent genocide in Rwanda or ethnic cleansing\nin Kosovo. Still, we see flagrant disrespect for international\nlaw, humanitarian law and human rights. Children are used\nas soldiers in Sierra Leone, women are denied all rights in\nAfghanistan, fundamentalist forces have demonstrating\nstudents arrested and possibly sentenced to death in Iran.\nOther tragic examples can be found in almost all parts of\nthe world.\nWe can change all that, if only there is political will.\nIt is up to us, the Member States, to ensure that the United\nNations and the Security Council are able to uphold\ninternational law and their responsibility for international\npeace and security.\nI would like to highlight four key areas that we, the\nUnited Nations and its Member States, need to address to\nmake the United Nations truly relevant: the questions of\nintervention; early action and prevention; nuclear\ndisarmament; and human rights. To succeed, the United\nNations system also needs to be reformed, and I will come\nback to that.\nWhen it comes to intervention to secure peace,\nregional organizations and arrangements, as well as so-\ncalled coalitions of the willing, can have important roles,\ntogether with the United Nations, as we have just seen in\nEast Timor. But it is for the Security Council to provide the\nlegal foundation \u2014 the mandate \u2014 for such action, in\nparticular when force has to be used. Without such a legal\nfoundation, we run the risk of anarchy in international\nrelations, and in fact we undermine the prospects for peace\nand security; and that long-term perspective must never be\nlost.\nOur responsibility for international peace and\nsecurity implies that necessary action by the Security\nCouncil should not be hindered by a veto. If the Security\nCouncil in an urgent situation is paralysed by a veto or a\nthreat of veto, this may undermine the authority and the\nrelevance of the United Nations itself. It also presents the\ninternational community with a difficult dilemma.\nWhen human life is threatened on a massive scale,\nit is not possible to remain passive. Humanitarian\nintervention has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in\nview of the values at stake and whether all other means\nhave been exhausted. The effects on international law and\ninternational security at large have to be considered as\nwell.\nAs the Secretary-General said yesterday, we must\nensure that the Security Council is able to rise to the\nchallenge. It must negotiate in earnest, with creativity and\nwithout the threat of veto, to define threats to peace and\nsecurity at an early stage, and to deal with a crisis before\nan emergency situation arises. Council action does not\nnecessarily mean the use of force. The use of force\nalmost inevitably causes suffering for the innocent. It\nshould, therefore, only be the last resort. There are many\nother tools available. The United Nations Charter offers\nseveral options.\nThe most obvious alternative to the use of force is\nconflict prevention and early action. Member States, in\nparticular the permanent members of the Security\nCouncil, must share information on conflict situations and\nearly warning signals with the Secretariat. The Secretary-\nGeneral should be invited to react to such reports and to\npropose appropriate and timely action to the Security\nCouncil. The United Nations offices in the field and early\nfact-finding missions dispatched to areas of potential\nconflict could help the Secretary-General formulate such\nproposals. Academic institutions and non-governmental\norganizations could also be helpful in this regard.\nThe Swedish Government has adopted a programme\nof action to facilitate and contribute to the prevention of\narmed conflict. It is our hope that this action plan will\nstimulate a debate on how to change the focus from crisis\nmanagement to early preventive action in order to\npromote a culture of prevention.\nWhen considering peacekeeping operations, the\nSecurity Council should not be hampered by short-term\nbudgetary considerations. This sends a very negative\nmessage and runs counter to the need for early and\n32\n\n\npreventive action. All countries must pay their assessed\ncontributions in full, on time and without conditions.\nNaturally, that also goes for the host country. The United\nNations must be given the necessary resources to be able to\nact swiftly upon decisions by the Security Council.\nThe danger of nuclear devastation has not faded. On\nthe contrary, we are faced with new threats. Last year the\npositive trend set by Argentina, Brazil and South Africa\nhaving joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) was reversed by India and\nPakistan, which both tested nuclear weapons. Their actions\nhave endangered international peace and security, as well\nas stability in the region, and are a serious setback to our\nhopes for a world without nuclear weapons.\nSweden will follow up its call of last year for a new\nagenda for complete nuclear disarmament. India and\nPakistan have taken us further away from that goal. We call\nupon them, and all other States which have not yet done so,\nto give up their nuclear ambitions. All countries should\nbecome parties to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT) and the NPT.\nThe five nuclear-weapon States also have a\nresponsibility to complete nuclear disarmament.\nDeployment of national missile defence systems in the\nfuture would create uncertainties and have a negative\nimpact on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We\nencourage the United States and Russia to re-establish a\nnew momentum in the stalled START negotiations, and\nespecially we call upon Russia to ratify the Start II\nagreement without further delay. Reductions should be\nextended to non-strategic nuclear weapons. Furthermore, we\nurge the three nuclear-weapon States which have not yet\ndone so to ratify the CTBT. All this should be done in an\neffort aimed at the elimination of all kinds of weapons of\nmass destruction, which still pose a threat to human beings\nall over the world.\nAny regime violating human rights paves the way for\ncrisis and armed conflict. The defence of human rights is a\nlegitimate concern for the Security Council and the\ninternational community. It is our duty to react when the\nrights of individuals are violated, wherever it happens.\nStill, disrespect for democracy and human rights is\nobvious in many parts of the world. The events in East\nTimor show how the will of the people can be totally\nignored by armed thugs. In Kosovo, innocent civilians are\nattacked for belonging to a certain ethnic group.\nStill, poverty and social injustice deprive people of\nhealth and education.\nStill, women and girls are facing discrimination. The\nbrutalizing and killing of women is carried out with\nimpunity in many countries. In wars, rape is used as a\nmeans of terror. Often women are deprived of their right\nto earn their own living or participate in the economic\nand political life of their countries. I urge all countries to\nadhere to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\nof Discrimination against Women, without reservation.\nStill, 10 years after the adoption of the Convention\non the Rights of the Child, the hopes of children for the\nfuture are overshadowed by daily hardship and fear. Too\noften their talents and skills are buried in poverty or\ndiseases which are curable but not attended to. Too often\nthey are denied proper education, or suffer from\ndiscriminatory school systems. The recruitment of child\nsoldiers is a shameful practice that causes individual\nsuffering and will harm the security and development of\nsocieties for many years to come. I appeal to all\nGovernments to assist in the conclusion of the two\noptional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild in order to prohibit sexual abuse of children and the\nuse of children below the age of 18 in armed conflict.\nThe use of the death penalty has no place in a\ncivilized society. Sweden welcomes moves taken in a\nnumber of countries to put an end to this repugnant\npractice. The abolition of the death penalty would\nenhance human dignity worldwide.\nStill, the ugly face of racism appears in all parts of\nthe world. Manifestations of racism are an affront to the\nfundamental principle of non-discrimination and a threat\nto the fragile fabric of peaceful relations between people\nin an increasingly global community. The preparations for\nthe World Conference against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\nprovide an important opportunity to identify concrete and\naction-oriented ways to combat racism. Another important\nmanifestation will be the Stockholm International Forum\non the Holocaust, to be held in January 2000.\nThe early entry into force of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court would send a clear signal\nthat the international community is determined to end the\nculture of impunity for the most heinous crimes under\ninternational law. Sweden is committed to early\nratification, and we urge all countries to be similarly\ncommitted.\n33\n\n\nAs I said at the outset, in order to have an efficient\nand relevant United Nations, not paralysed by the veto and\nable to cope with the challenges of conflict prevention,\nnuclear disarmament and the protection of human rights, we\nalso need reforms. In particular, we need to strengthen the\nUnited Nations capacity for conflict prevention and to\naddress root causes of conflict. This is a moral imperative\nas well as a humanitarian, political and economic necessity.\nThe Security Council should be enlarged to better\nreflect the realities of today\u2019s international relations. A\ngeographical balance is important in this regard so that the\nCouncil can become truly representative of the international\ncommunity.\nThe use of the veto, or even the threat of its use,\nhampers the work of the Council. We support the proposal\nthat as a first step the right of veto should be limited to\ndecisions on enforcement action under Chapter VII of the\nCharter. We would also like to see the five permanent\nmembers agreeing on a moratorium on the use of the veto.\nThe Security Council should be more transparent and\nopen. This would contribute to the acceptance and\nlegitimacy of its decisions. The Council should be able to\nhear the views of all relevant parties to a conflict without\nthe implication of political recognition.\nThe involvement of humanitarian organizations in the\nCouncil\u2019s deliberations would enhance the quality of its\ndecisions. The humanitarian consequences of Security\nCouncil action should always be taken into consideration.\nThis is particularly important when sanctions are imposed.\nSweden welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to\nreform the Secretariat and modernize its management\nculture, and we appreciate the improved efficiency that has\nfollowed. Reform is not only about cost-cutting. The aim\nmust be to revitalize the Organization and the multilateral\nsystem to cope with the many challenges before us.\nLong-term security is closely linked to sustainable\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty. We need to\nstrengthen not only the United Nations capacity to provide\nhumanitarian assistance but also its long-term social and\neconomic development efforts.\nA basic problem is the lack of funds. The donor\ncommunity needs to ensure sufficient and predictable\nfinancial resources to allow the reforms to produce long-\nterm results. Sweden is one of only four countries that meet\nthe United Nations aid target of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product. Development requires a true partnership\nbetween countries, ensuring sufficient external resources,\nsound use of internal resources and good governance.\nThe reform process has to continue, and we look\nforward to the Millennium Assembly and the summit next\nyear as an opportunity to accelerate the work.\nWe all have a tendency to blame the United Nations\nfor our own failures and shortcomings. In fact, when the\nUnited Nations fails, it is because we fail. If the United\nNations loses its relevance, we lose. There is no real\nalternative to global cooperation to cope with increasingly\nglobal problems, and for this, we need the United\nNations \u2014 but a strengthened and reformed United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is a particular pleasure to see\nMr. Gurirab presiding over the last session of the General\nAssembly of the twentieth century. I consider myself\nsingularly fortunate and greatly honoured to be representing\nmy country, India, on this occasion. I do believe that, in the\nmany years that he spent here pursuing the dream of\nindependence for his people \u2014 which, happily, is now a\nreality \u2014 he, more perhaps than others, has seen the United\nNations at its best. That is why the perspective that he\nbrings to the office of the President, enriched as it is by\nliving through the very articles of faith of the United\nNations, is near unique. I am sure we will all profit from it.\nI take this opportunity also to warmly welcome three\nnew Members to the United Nations: Kiribati, Nauru and\nTonga. I have no doubt their presence shall enrich our\ndeliberations.\nEven as I address this Assembly, the century draws to\na close and the world prepares to meet the year 2000. It is\nonly appropriate and instructive, therefore, to look back and\nto reflect upon the journey that humanity set out upon 100\nyears ago. Where did we think we were then headed and\nwhere have we actually reached? Could any then foresee\nwhat 1999 would bring? Thus, are there, in the passage of\nthe years that have gone by, any landmarks that could\nindicate a path for our future? For that, we need to assess\nthe twentieth century, and there is but one yardstick by\nwhich we can judge: the criteria of the stated objectives\nof the United Nations.\nIndisputably, the twentieth has been the bloodiest of\nall centuries. But, in contradistinction, it has also been a\ncentury of the most profound transformations and of the\nmost significant social, political and technological\nadvancements. This, above all, has been the century of\nthe ascendancy of the individual and of democracy. It is\nthat period in which dynasties vanished and revolutions\nswept empires off the face of ancient lands. Centuries-old\ncolonialism became history against the irresistible heave\nof the colonized to reclaim their lands, their souls, so that\noppressed humanity could regain a voice, a say in its own\npolitical and economic destiny. It is the century in which\nwe plumbed the depths of the oceans and soared into the\ninfinities of space; when man first set foot on the moon,\nreached Mars and even deeper into the recesses of the\nunknown. In a wired-up world, the computer has today\nbecome what the fountain pen was in the early years of\nthe twentieth century. The revolution of the digital has\narrived.\nHumanity today is healthier, better fed and more\nsheltered than our forefathers were. But want and hunger,\ndisease and deprivation are still widespread, including in\ndeveloped societies. We have at our command more\ninformation than ever before, but are we that much wiser?\nLiteracy has spread, but is mankind better educated? We\nare more connected globally, but are we as humankind?\nHave this linkage and interconnection reduced conflict\nand animosity? And thus, the tabulation of our assets and\nliabilities of this century flows.\nAs we have improved upon and added to almost\neverything that we inherited in 1900, so most sadly have\nwe to violence, too. This century has been the most\nbloodthirsty, perhaps because it is in these last 100 years\nthat humanity has employed science to perfect means of\nkilling as never before. Our passage has seen us move\nfrom the Gatling gun to a world menaced today by\nMIRVs. That early machine gun, the then-great mower\ndown of the early 1900s, seems today almost a toy by\ncomparison. We have split the atom, but employ the\nreleased energy less for peace and more for weapons of\nunimaginable destruction. Chemical defoliants and\nsophisticated biological weapons are also this century's\ncontribution.\nThe century that passes experienced not two, but\nthree great wars. Each was a cataclysm, fought globally\nand at enormous cost. When the first ended, the survivors\n39\n\n\nemerged from the trenches, searching for a better world so\nthat war would not recur. In response, we created the\nLeague of Nations. But war, regrettably, was not avoided.\nThe League failed because we failed the League. And thus\nfollowed the second great war, at the end of which the\nworld emerged armed with weapons that could destroy all\nthat human genius and ingenuity had created and every\nvestige of life. But, from the ruins and devastation of the\nsecond also emerged the United Nations, with mandates of\nbroader powers and responsibilities. The third great conflict\nwas the cold war. This deeply affected, shaped and\ninfluenced the development of the United Nations. This\nwar, too, extracted a heavy price, directly and through\nproxy conflicts, as well as political and social upheavals,\nbut then these became its epilogue. What significance lies\nin the observation that no global peace conference has taken\nplace to mark the end of this last war?\nThe United Nations could have been cast anew, made\ncontemporary and democratized, drawing upon our\ncollective experience to tackle new challenges with greater\nresponsiveness. Can we, even now, do something at this\nlast session of the General Assembly of this millennium to\ncorrect this? Can we pledge afresh to invest this institution\nwith faith, commitment, political will and the resources that\nit needs to make it the vehicle capable of realizing the\naspirations of all humanity, an instrument that will steer\nplanet Earth into the next century?\nWe do not enjoy an abundance of options. The\nsapping of the vitality or the diminishing of the centrality\nof the United Nations must not be permitted. We have but\none Earth, and there is but one United Nations.\nAnother development of this century, of crucial\nsignificance, is the transformation that we have experienced\nin the role of the State. From an agency that controlled and\nregulated all spheres of human activity, we move into a\nphase wherein the State must become more supportive,\ncaring and encouraging of the citizen's individual and\ncollective endeavours; it must release, not contain, the\nenergies and genius of its people.\nIt would be an error, however, to assume that the days\nof the State are over. The State continues to have a crucial\nrole and relevance; also, therefore, do national\nsovereignties. The United Nations was not conceived as a\nsuper-State. It will not ever become so, principally because\nthere is no viable substitute for the sovereign State. Even\nglobalization can work only through State intermediaries.\nTo diminish, marginalize or ignore the State would also be\nbad practice, because the weaker the State is rendered, the\nless it shall be able to promote the interests of its citizens.\nThe State needs to be strengthened functionally, not\nweakened. Besides, it is axiomatic that a United Nations\nof weak nations can only be a weak United Nations.\nGlobalization is an idea that has re-emerged, but also\nits reverse: fragmentation. The first is politico-economic,\nthe second entirely political. Let us dwell a bit on this.\nObviously, the technology that is driving this process can\nnow scarcely be unlearned; the speed of travel and of\ncommunications will only increase; the age of the digital,\nas I said, has dawned. However, though globalization may\napparently be driven by impersonal market forces, it is in\nreality impelled by power seeking political and financial\nadvantage. It is, in essence, a political process, and if\nhistory teaches us anything, it is that such processes are\nnot linear. Simply in terms of economic indicators, the\nworld was as globalized at the turn of the century as it is\nnow. A backlash followed: barriers went up, confrontation\nreplaced cooperation and the world jostled into the\ntensions that led to the first great war. Are we, for the\nsake of temporary gain, perhaps even unwittingly,\nrepeating yesterday's mistakes? Political hindsight tells us\nthat globalization has to be politically directed for\ncreating equal economic opportunity, both within States\nand among States.\nIn India, we cherish the creative genius of the\npeople. We believe that Indian excellence lies in the\nfreedom of the individual. We do not subscribe to\nconstricting choice through State impositions. But can free\nmarkets offer true freedom of choice to those that are not\neven a part of the market? That is why the State\ncontinues to have the responsibility to protect the needy,\nto strengthen the weak. That is a part of our democratic\ncreed, too.\nWe note that human rights have been made a cross-\ncutting theme of the work of the United Nations. That is\nimportant. The flowering, however, of human rights\nrequires economic development and growth because many\nof the deprivations faced by individuals, whether in the\ndeveloped or in the developing world, are rooted in\nmarginalization created by poverty. We believe, therefore,\nthat development should be the cross-cutting theme of the\nUnited Nations and that the multilateral development\nsystem, which has been one of its successes, must be\nstrengthened, its focus narrowed to the core challenges of\neconomic growth with social justice, and it must be given\nthe resources it requires to respond to the needs of the\ndeveloping countries. The international community will\nfind that no investment yields better returns.\n40\n\n\nI have the honour to address the Assembly as a\nrepresentative of the largest democracy in the world. Even\nnow, as I share these thoughts, an electorate of about 600\nmillion, matching the combined populations of the United\nStates, Canada and Western Europe, is going through the\nexciting process of democratically electing its next\nGovernment in my country. It is an awe-inspiring spectacle,\nthis unstoppable flow of the great Ganga of Indian\ndemocracy. It is a democracy whose economy grew by\nmore than 6 per cent last year, even in the aftermath of the\nmajor shocks to the international economy brought about by\nwhat was described as the East Asian meltdown of the mid-\n1990s.\nWe move with the challenges posed by globalization,\nwithout either retreating into a \u201cfortress India\u201d or\nabandoning our social objectives. We have worked out our\nown answers and devised our own policies to meet these\nnew challenges because we hold that the sheer diversity of\nmankind dictates differences in approach, in human beings'\nrespective search for relevant alternatives. This is a truth\nborne out by the fact that the twentieth century has been\nwitness to the detritus of many false certainties.\nToday, when capital moves without almost any\nconstraint, it is virtually impossible for developing countries\nto resist either its demands or manage the consequences of\nits sudden departure. Let us reflect upon the absence of\norder, system or any global oversight of currency flows,\nparticularly short-term flows, even as we attempt to bring\norder and equity to trade in goods, services and\ncommodities. But how are we to address the problem when\ncurrency, instead of being a vehicle of trade, has in itself\nbecome a commodity of trade, when the volume of trade in\ncurrency daily has outstripped global trade in goods and\nservices or even global gross national product manifold?\nIf globalization is to benefit all, and as we simply\ncannot accept that wheels of progress should grind down\nthe common man, then surely some new international\nregulation, some order, is needed here. Let the United\nNations take the initiative to hold an urgent international\nconference on financing for development.\nIn the political domain, too, managing change\ndemands openness and reasoned discourse, an essential\ningredient of which is abjuring violence. That is why\nterrorism is the very antithesis of all that the United\nNations represents and stands for. Terrorism is the great\nglobal menace of our age. In this age of democracy, it is a\nviolation of the very basic precepts of it. Because its\nprincipal targets become the innocent, it is a crime against\nhumanity, a violation of basic human rights. It is also\nnow a grave threat to international peace and security.\nThat is why I urge that we strengthen the international\nconsensus against terrorism. India has called for a\ncomprehensive international convention against terrorism.\nWe hope to make progress on the issue in this session of\nthe General Assembly.\nWe also know how terrorism uses the international\nfinancial system, how it exploits the breakdown of\ncountries and societies, and how it has preyed on the\nnexus between drugs and the proliferation of small arms.\nThus, today, we witness a scimitar of narco-terrorism\ncutting across the Caucasus to the South Asian\nsubcontinent. Two of the world\u2019s largest sources of illicit\ndrugs flank us. Terrorism financed by drugs has for years\nbeen the deadly export of our neighbours.\nHere the crippling intermixing of cause and effect is\ncruelly exemplified in Afghanistan. The world has been\nwitness to the decades-old distress of the innocent men,\nwomen and children of that country. The disorders of\nAfghanistan, and the near anarchy into which that country\nhas been pushed, are a consequence, chiefly, of the play\nof external forces and of a reversion to medieval\nfundamentalism of the most obscurantist variety. This\ndisorder now overspills; it is also exported. It is not that\nhuman rights, particularly of women and children, are\nroutinely violated there; they simply do not exist.\nOur relationships with this neighbour are ancient and\nrooted in a past that we share. That is why we urge this\nAssembly to be seized of the enormous human suffering\nof the Afghans, and to encourage and support the early\nformation of a Government truly representative of all\nsections of that society and country.\nTerrorism is a menace to which open societies are\nvulnerable; it becomes particularly difficult for\ndemocracies to counter when terrorists are armed,\nfinanced and backed by Governments or their agencies,\nand benefit from the protection of State power. Cross-\nborder terrorism, sponsored from across our borders, has\ntaken the lives of thousands of our citizens and ruined\nthose of countless others. We will counter it, as we have\ndone over the past decades, using the methods available\nto a democracy. India will defeat such forces. That is both\nour duty and our obligation to our citizens.\nEarlier this year India was subjected, yet again, to an\nact of premeditated aggression. In February this year,\nhoping yet again to set aside the sterility of relations of\n41\n\n\nthe past half century to set the South Asian subcontinent on\nthe path of development, with a view to addressing the real\nadversaries of our region \u2014 poverty, want and hunger \u2014\nPrime Minister Vajpayee extended a hand of peace, amity\nand cooperation to neighbouring Pakistan. The pathbreaking\nbus journey from Delhi to Lahore followed. In Lahore we\nconcluded a triad of agreements, among which was the\nLahore Declaration. It was the route chart of moving\ntowards lasting amity and peace.\nThis act of faith was betrayed. Premeditated\naggression by regular forces was committed against India.\nNot simply was the Lahore Declaration violated, but so was\nthe Simla Agreement, which had prevented conflict for\nmore than a quarter of a century. In self-defence, yet with\nthe utmost restraint, India took all necessary and\nappropriate steps to evict the aggressor forces from its\nterritory. Most regrettably, this aggression has set back the\nLahore process of peace that we had initiated. For whereas\naggression over territory can more easily be vacated, that\nterritory of trust which has been transgressed is infinitely\nmore difficult to restore.\nPermit me, Sir, to draw attention to the fact that this\naggression upon India in Kargil was a demonstration of\nwanting to hold to ransom the world, through an act of\naggression. It was also a manifestation of the larger\ndisorders that the world has been witnessing in Afghanistan.\nThere is an aspect that I stress. It was a gross violation\nof the Geneva Conventions when Indian soldiers taken\nprisoner were tortured, subjected to inhuman treatment and\nkilled in captivity. These violations took place at a time\nwhen the international community has repeatedly been\ntrying to establish the rule of law, stripping away the layers\nof impunity that have protected those who give the orders\nthat lead to violations of international humanitarian law.\nAnd it is thus that I find it necessary to reiterate some\nessential verities of Indian nationhood. From the earliest\ndays of our struggle against imperialism and colonial rule\nit has been an unquestionable article of faith with us that\nIndia is one nation: a nation of many faiths, a diversity of\nbeliefs, a cultural harmony arranged through the interplay\nof myriad forms and manifestations, but a unity,\nstrengthened by its pluralism, that is beyond question. And\nof this is born India\u2019s democratic vitality, too. Also of this\noneness and unity, the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir\nis an integral part, and shall remain so. Because this is not\nany territorial dispute; it is the assertion of two antipodal\napproaches to national identity. India has never represented\ndenominational nationhood; it is civic nationalism to which\nwe subscribe. That is why Jammu and Kashmir is not a\nso-called core issue. It is at the very core of Indian\nnationhood.\nYet the path of the India-Pakistan composite\ndialogue process is open. No preconditions attend it. The\nonly essential ingredient that remains is an abjuring of\nviolence and cross-border terrorism, principles that are\nintegral to both the Simla Agreement and the Lahore\nDeclaration \u2014 indeed, the very process of peace itself.\nThis process needs to be resumed.\nWe have been greatly disappointed by this\ncompulsive hostility of Pakistan, because it is an\naberration in our region today, where all the other South\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\ncountries are at peace with each other, and are trying,\nbilaterally and through the SAARC mechanisms, to tackle\ntogether the great challenge of development. But we\nremain unshaken in our vision of cooperation and shared\nprosperity of the South Asian region, as embedded in the\nCharter of SAARC, as well as in our faith in the ability,\ntalent and will of the people of the region to take their\nrightful place in the world community. The destiny of all\nour peoples is linked. It is a region with a collective\nhistory reaching back to the beginnings of human history\nand of the highest civilizational accomplishments. In\nstriving to attain the promise of the future in our region,\nwe also see the recovery of a great past.\nThis is perhaps the right juncture at which to say a\nfew words about pluralism in an age of globalization.\nThough we find sterile the debate over universal and\nregional values, extreme positions are still taken on both\nsides. In a spirit of engagement, we would urge our\npartners in the West to be a bit more tolerant, and a bit\nmore introspective. While all democratic Governments try\nto promote good governance, human rights and social\nresponsibility, the perspective they approach them from,\nand their ability to implement them, vary. Rigidly\napplying, as a universal paradigm, value systems that\nreflect the state of western economies and societies in the\nlate twentieth century, produces an inevitable reaction,\nwhich does not make either for dialogue or constructive\ndecisions.\nGlobalization has also influenced our thinking on\nsecurity issues by generating a greater awareness about\nnew security concerns. Equally important, with the end of\nthe cold war there is a growing realization that peace\ncannot be maintained through balance of power or\nhegemonic order. To maintain global peace and security,\n42\n\n\nto deal with threats of a global nature, the international\ncommunity has to accept the concept of collective security.\nThe United Nations provides a framework for such a\ncontract among nations. With the cold war behind us, the\nGeneral Assembly should reactivate this framework.\nGlobal nuclear disarmament was the objective set out\nby the 1946 General Assembly in the first resolution that it\nadopted. That objective still beckons us.\nI say this as the representative of a country that has\nbeen obliged to acquire nuclear weapons because of the\nfailure of the existing non-proliferation regime to address\nour primary security concerns. Yet let me also state with\nfull conviction that India\u2019s commitment to global nuclear\ndisarmament stands undiluted. India is the only nuclear-\nweapon State ready to negotiate a nuclear weapons\nconvention that will prohibit for ever the development,\nproduction, stockpiling, use and threat of use of nuclear\nweapons and provide for the elimination of all existing\nweapons under international verification.\nIf this can only be a step-by-step process, the first step\nat a technical level is for all countries possessing nuclear\nweapons to take measures that will reduce the dangers of,\nand provide added safeguards against, any unintended or\naccidental use. Coupled with this is the political step of\nreorienting nuclear doctrines, towards no-first-use, and then\nnon-use, thus delegitimizing nuclear weapons globally.\nIndependent expert opinion across the globe has spoken\nstrongly in favour of such measures. In fact, every single\nstudy that has been published since the end of the cold war\non the measures to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world\nhas highlighted the need for shifting to doctrines based on\nno-first-use and non-use, and technical measures towards\nde-alerting, as the inevitable first steps in the process. We\nhave taken initiatives to urge the international community\nforward on both counts, and hope that in this General\nAssembly session the Indian initiatives will receive the\nunanimous support that they merit.\nLast year my Prime Minister declared in this\nAssembly that India was engaged in discussions on a range\nof issues, including the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT). These discussions are in process and will\nbe resumed by the newly- elected Government of my\ncountry. Our position remains consistent. We remain ready\nto bring these discussions to a successful conclusion.\nNaturally, this requires the creation of a positive\nenvironment as we work towards creating the widest\npossible consensus domestically. We also expect that other\ncountries will adhere to this Treaty without any conditions.\nNotwithstanding India\u2019s readiness to engage in\nconstructive negotiations on a treaty to prohibit the future\nproduction of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and\nnuclear explosive devices, the Conference on\nDisarmament in Geneva has so far, sadly, been unable to\nregister any forward movement. This, too, is something to\nponder over, for we all know that a fissile material cut-off\ntreaty (FMCT) can only contribute to our shared objective\nas part of a step-by-step process. Let us then overcome\nthis reluctance and agree to look beyond the FMCT.\nSo, at the end of this centennial audit, what is it that\nwe would want the United Nations to do in the first few\nyears? It is clear that there are two major problems facing\nthe United Nations as an institution: Security Council\nreform and the United Nations financial crisis. These need\nto be addressed. The Security Council must be made\nmore representative, with developing countries inducted\nas permanent members, to reflect the changes in the\nUnited Nations membership and today\u2019s political realities.\nAs we said earlier, on any objective criteria, India\u2019s\ncredentials for permanent membership are persuasive.\nSustainable and environmentally sound development\nis a goal to which India continues to attach the utmost\nimportance. In 2002 we will complete a decade of\nAgenda 21, adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. I\ntrust that the current session of the General Assembly will\nput in place a preparatory process for the \u201cRio + 10\u201d\nreview. This will enable the Member States to take stock\nof the implementation of the commitments undertaken by\nthe Member States in Agenda 21 over the past decade.\nSuch a process is vital for attaining our common goal of\nsustainable and environmentally sound development.\nThis century has shown us that our challenges are\ncommon; they are intertwined. Problems flow across\nboundaries, they batten on each other. Political, security,\neconomic and social challenges are braided around each\nother; when they form a knot, that has to be cut by all of\nus together. Here, and nowhere else, can we do this. It is\nconvenient to look at security issues in the First\nCommittee, at economic issues in the Second, at human\nrights and social issues in the Third, and so on, but we\noften do not see them together, and so fail to use the\nUnited Nations as we should.\nMay I, in conclusion, therefore, propose that in the\nnext decade the United Nations endeavour to address the\nmost urgent problems that face us today. We have to do\nthis as a unity of nations, as also of issues, for it is\nevident that solutions in one field will depend on, or be\n43\n\n\nfacilitated by, progress in another. Without tackling them\ntogether we will fail to address them at all. Therefore, may\nI urge the Assembly to consider the following areas for\naction in the opening years of the next decade: an\ninternational conference on financing for development;\nbinding, irreversible steps to reduce the dangers of use of\nnuclear weapons; reform and expansion of the Security\nCouncil; a comprehensive convention against terrorism; and\nstrengthening of the United Nations development system in\nthis era of globalization.\nI leave you with a sloka from the Rigveda. Though\nwritten 5,000 years ago, it reaches across time to us as at\nthis session of the General Assembly, in the last year of the\ntwentieth century. In translation, it reads,\n\u201cBe of one heart, one mind and free of hate.\nLet your aim be common, your assembly common,\nUnited your mind and thoughts;\nMay you make your resolutions with one mind,\nPerform your duties righteously.\nLet our hearts be together\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "We\nare pleased that an important figure in Namibia's attainment\nof independence has the responsibility of conducting this\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI also wish to express my appreciation to the Foreign\nMinister of Uruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his skill in\npresiding over the previous session of the General\nAssembly.\nAfter 10 years as President of Argentina, and with my\nconstitutional mandate about to end, I should like to share\nwith the Assembly the transformations that Argentina has\nexperienced during this time, in a world which has also\nbeen transformed.\nIn the past 10 years we have experienced a change\nof Copernican dimensions. It started with the recovery of\ndemocracy. Since that time we have built a stable political\nsystem based on the popular will and respect for the rule\nof law. We have made respect for human rights a sacred\nvalue. We are at peace with all our neighbours, with\nwhich we have now undertaken a robust integration\nprocess. We have put an end to proliferation policies and\nhave actively committed ourselves to peacekeeping\noperations. We have developed an open and free\neconomy, worked to combat poverty and inequality of\nopportunity and fought discrimination in all its forms. In\nshort, we have recovered and embraced the high values of\nour culture, which are the essence of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and which we hope to bring with us into\nthe twenty-first century.\nAt the regional level, which is our natural sphere of\ninterest, we have solved all outstanding border and\ndemarcation issues with the Republic of Chile and thus\nopened the way for fruitful integration. We have\nestablished consultation and coordination mechanisms\nwith Brazil and Chile on security and defence issues. We\nare convinced that security depends much more on\nfriendship and cooperation with our neighbours than on\nwhat we spend on weapons. As one of the guarantors of\nthe Rio de Janeiro Protocol, we contributed to the peace\nagreement between Peru and Ecuador. We are working\ntirelessly for the consolidation of democracy and\ndevelopment in our region.\nIn the field of disarmament and the non-proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction, we have taken the\nfollowing steps. On 28 November 1990 we signed the Foz\ndo Igua\u00e7\u00fa Joint Declaration, which consolidated the\npolicy of nuclear transparency with Brazil, and since then\nwe have developed a common peaceful and non-\nproliferation nuclear policy. Argentina acceded to the\nTreaty of Tlatelolco, in 1994; the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in 1995; and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, in 1998. We are\nalso members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and in\n1993 Argentina joined the Missile Technology Control\nRegime.\nIn the field of space activities, the National\nCommission for Space Activities has worked with the\nUnited States National Aeronautics and Space\n\nAdministration (NASA) on the SAC-B satellite mission, the\nplacement in orbit and operation of the SAC-A satellite\ntechnology mission and the forthcoming launch of the SAC-\nC satellite mission, Argentina's first Earth observation\nsatellite. We have also started some ambitious projects in\nthis field with Brazil, as well as with Canada, France,\nGermany and the United Kingdom.\nWe have ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention,\nand we are working on a monitoring mechanism for the\nBiological Weapons Convention. In this context, Argentina\njoined the Australian Group on 11 December 1992.\nArgentina's self-restraint in the development of nuclear\nweapons is recognized as an example by the international\ncommunity.\nOn 14 September this year Argentina ratified the\nOttawa Convention on the prohibition of anti-personnel\nlandmines.\nAt the Southern Cone Common Market\n(MERCOSUR) summit in Ushuaia, Argentina, on 24 July\n1998, MERCOSUR, Bolivia and Chile were declared a\nzone of peace and a zone free of weapons of mass\ndestruction. A commitment was also made to declare the\narea a zone free of anti-personnel landmines.\nWe believe that all States must renounce nuclear\nweapons and give unequivocal guarantees that their nuclear\ncapability and most advanced technology are exclusively for\npeaceful purposes.\nAllow me once more to refer to the pending\nsovereignty dispute concerning the Malvinas Islands. One\nof the first measures we adopted upon taking office was to\nre-establish diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom,\nin February 1990. A new stage was thereby begun in which\nthe ties between the two countries were taken to their\nhighest level in history. This was reaffirmed by my recent\nvisit, as President, to the United Kingdom and that of His\nRoyal Highness Prince Charles to Argentina. Since then,\nwhile reaffirming our sovereignty rights and motivated by\na spirit of reconciliation, we have worked harmoniously\nwith the United Kingdom on various matters relating to the\nSouth Atlantic, such as the rebuilding of a climate of\nmutual trust in the area, the preservation of live marine\nresources, the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons,\nthe resumption of flights between the continent and the\nMalvinas Islands, and the access of persons carrying\nArgentine identity documents to the Malvinas Islands.\nArgentina is a country that is proud of its cultural\ndiversity. Our Constitution establishes as a national goal\nthe recovery of the Malvinas Islands while guaranteeing\nthe strictest respect for the way of life of their inhabitants.\nI am convinced that the conditions exist for Argentina and\nthe United Kingdom to begin without further delay a\ndialogue towards a definitive solution of the sovereignty\ndispute, thus fulfilling the numerous resolutions adopted\nby the General Assembly and the Special Political and\nDecolonization Committee.\nArgentina is the sixth-largest troop contributor to the\nOrganization. At this time, we are involved in 10 of the\n17 current operations, including those in Kosovo and East\nTimor. We have also incorporated personnel from other\nLatin American countries into our troops.\nIn Argentina, the defence and promotion of human\nrights is a State policy. That is why we have actively\nparticipated in the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court, as a way to put an end to the culture of\nimpunity.\nThe numerous humanitarian missions in which\n\u201cWhite Helmets\u201d have been deployed in South America,\nCentral America, the Middle East, Africa and the\nCaucasus are a reflection of the success of this initiative,\nwhich I put forward in 1993. Argentina agrees with the\nSecretary-General that the \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d can provide\nassistance, in close partnership with the Blue Helmets, in\nconflict situations.\nArgentina supports a world economy of open\nmarkets. However, we see the re-emergence of hidden\nforms of protectionism. This is why we call on all States,\nin particular to the most developed ones, to take part in\nthe \u201cmillennium round\u201d, with the goal of attaining an\nopen, multilateral system that excludes no sector of\neconomic activity.\nAs evidence of our concern regarding environmental\nissues, in November 1998 Argentina hosted the fourth\nmeeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\nwhich adopted the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. During\nthe fifth ministerial meeting of the Zone of Peace and\nCooperation of the South Atlantic, which was held in\nBuenos Aires in October 1998, a Plan of Action was\nadopted for the first time in order to carry out the\nobjectives of the Zone, which include the protection of\nthe environment and of living resources.\n5\n\n\nThe international community must urgently prepare\ncontingency plans to face the year 2000 problem in such a\nway that essential community services are not affected.\nSince 1 January 1999, Argentina has been an elected\nmember of the Security Council. I would like briefly to\nshare some thoughts with the Assembly.\nThe responsibility of the Security Council in the\nmaintenance of peace cannot be irreplaceable, and its\nauthority must be strengthened.\nThe Council must work in cooperation with other\nbodies of the United Nations system and with regional\norganizations in order to carry out its tasks effectively.\nWe have a responsibility towards the men and women\nwho make up the Blue Helmets, as well as towards those\nwho perform humanitarian work in conflict situations. It is\nour obligation to protect them. We call upon countries to\nratify the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and\nAssociated Personnel.\nConcerning the reform of the Security Council,\nArgentina supports the creation of a system of non-\ndiscriminatory, open rotation. It would be unfair and\nunrealistic, at the beginning of a new millennium, to\nmultiply the privileges and discriminatory practices that\ncame about only as a result of war in 1945. Therefore, no\nnew categories of membership should be introduced in\nregions where those categories do not exist, especially if\ntradition and history do not warrant it.\nFinally, I am convinced that the United Nations is\ncalled upon to play an even more relevant role in the\ntwenty-first century. Argentina, which is now to be among\nthe 15 main countries of the Organization, will participate\nwith the same conviction as always in the realization of the\nnoble objectives of the Charter.\nOnce again, I thank you, Sir, and all the Members of\nthe United Nations. After 10 years and six months, I bid\nyou farewell for the last time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to\ncongratulate the President on his election to the\npresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly. The Barbados delegation shares the confidence\nexpressed in his leadership and offers its full cooperation\nas he presides over our deliberations.\nLet me also warmly commend his predecessor, my\nfriend and colleague, Mr. Didier Opertti, Foreign Minister\nof Uruguay, for his outstanding stewardship of the\nAssembly during the last year and for the vision and\ndirection he gave to the ongoing work of the United\nNations.\nWe are delighted to welcome to our family of\nnations Tonga, Kiribati and Nauru, which are, like\n25\n\n\nBarbados, small island developing States and members of\nthe Commonwealth and also of the African, Caribbean and\nPacific Group of States. We have long enjoyed good\nrelations with our sister Pacific islands and wish to assure\nthe new Member States of our continued friendship and\nsolidarity.\nAs we reflect on the twentieth century, we see a\nperiod remarkable for its contradictions. We see, on the one\nhand, astounding developments in many fields of human\nendeavour and, on the other, national and international\nconflicts, resulting in mass destruction of human life and\ninfrastructure as well as the almost irreversible\ncompromising of the ecological system. It is evident that if\nas nations we refuse to use our accumulated knowledge and\nexperience, these contradictions will be carried well into the\ntwenty-first century, making it even more difficult for us to\nface and overcome the challenges that lie ahead.\nOne of the most serious of these challenges is that of\nthe concept of globalization. The proponents of this\nideology, which embraces trade liberalization and global\ngovernance, wish us to believe that it is a natural and\nlogical development in international relations. It is not. In\nmany of its important aspects it is an imposition. One has\nonly to examine the bases of the clamour for trade\nliberalization to become aware of this.\nTrade liberalization assumes that small States compete\nwith larger, stronger, more experienced countries on the\nsame terms, or become mere satellites in a neo-colonial\nsphere. No nation, large or small, would willingly accept a\nsatellite role. The international community must therefore\ncome to recognize that within the context of trade\nliberalization free trade must import fair trade: trade in\ngoods and services that have been produced and supplied\nunder conditions respectful of the rights and dignity of the\nlabour force; respectful of the preservation of the\nenvironment, and guaranteeing fair prices that provide\nreturns to the supplier.\nBarbados and the Caribbean are confronting serious\nchallenges in the effort to remain viable economies as\ntraditional systems of cooperation between individual States\nand groups of nations are supplanted by the modern\nconcepts of supranational interests and of globalization. To\nfully grasp the enormity of the adjustment process now\nfacing Caribbean economies one must first appreciate that\nthe Caribbean is perhaps the region which under the\noriginal post-colonial regime enjoyed the highest level of\ntrade preferences with Europe.\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) has evolved\nas the dominant forum for the reform of the world trading\nsystem, but it is now evident that more democratic,\nparticipatory and transparent systems are needed to\nprotect the interests of the smaller and more vulnerable\nmembers of that Organization. For surely the WTO\ncannot be meant to operate as a weapon of oppression in\na new millennium. Surely it cannot be acceptable in a just\nworld that the new trade ethic should derive solely from\nthe rigid application of technical rules.\nOur new system is clearly seriously flawed when a\ndispute between two powerful transatlantic partners can\nbe settled in a political vacuum which totally ignores the\nvery real and disastrous consequences it will inevitably\nunleash on the economies of a fragile group of small\nStates. This is certainly not globalization with a human\nface.\nAnd so it must be appreciated that the\ninterdependence associated with globalization is a\ntwo-sided coin. Just as it is claimed that the benefits of\nfree trade will be enjoyed by all, so too will we all suffer\nfrom the repercussions of failed economies, unable to\ncope with the impact of global trade liberalization.\nIn the Caribbean region, we are haunted by the\nprospect of failed societies. Prime Minister Arthur of\nBarbados is particularly concerned, and has repeatedly\nwarned of this possibility. Recently he made the following\nobservation:\n\u201cThe economic decay in some economies has\nbeen so severe and corrosive as to set in train social\nand political disorder which, unchecked, will create\na new Caribbean species of failed society'.\u201d\nIndeed, we have already seen how the dislocation of some\nStates, whether large, or small and marginalized, can\nimpact negatively on the world's most developed\neconomies. When the global system economically\ndisenfranchises large numbers of the world's population,\nwe should not be surprised that their hopeless\ncircumstances might propel them towards the underworld\nof transnational crime.\nThe unique nature and scope of vulnerabilities of\nsmall economies cannot be disputed. Barbados strongly\nreiterates the call for the recognition and adoption of\nvulnerability indices to assist in determining access to\ndevelopment financing.\n26\n\n\nThe United Nations has a critical role to play as the\ndefender of the right of all States, regardless of size or\ninfluence, to voice their concerns. As a forum for\nconstructive consensus-building in an atmosphere of free\nand open dialogue the United Nations is even more relevant\nin an era characterized by complex negotiations and\nsupranational interests dominated by a powerful few.\nAs a community of nations we have one common\nfactor that unquestionably unites us all. We share one\nEarth. The need to sustain the Earth's oceans, seas and the\nenvironment in general is undeniable. Indeed, this\nrepresents one of the greatest challenges to globalization.\nAs a small island developing State, Barbados has nurtured\na strong commitment to the implementation of practices\nthat seek to ensure sustainable development in all aspects\nof our lives.\nThe dedication of Barbados to the promotion of global\nsustainable development has been affirmed by our active\nparticipation in numerous international negotiations devoted\nto these issues. It is also demonstrated by our vigorous\nefforts to foster a shared vision to reverse the conventional\nwisdom of the past, which sacrificed environmental\nconcerns in blind pursuit of that other ideology of economic\ngrowth. That shared vision will be as relevant in the new\ncentury as it was when the international community\nassembled in Barbados in 1994 for the first United Nations\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States.\nBarbados is proud, as is the entire region, of the\nprogress made by the small island developing States in\nfulfilling their commitments under the Barbados Programme\nof Action. At the national level, our Government has\nsuccessfully forged greater links with civil society,\nincluding the private sector and labour, in the preparation\nof our environmental policies and action plans.\nThe just-concluded special session to review and\nappraise the Barbados Programme of Action drew attention\nonce more to the serious way in which the small island\ndeveloping States have accepted their responsibility to\nintegrate sustainable development practices into all aspects\nof their economic and social activity. We trust that the\noutcomes of this review will be fully implemented by the\ninternational community.\nThe Caribbean Basin States will shortly be addressing\nin this forum their interest in working towards the\ninternational designation of the Caribbean Sea as a special\narea in the context of sustainable development. While we\nacknowledge that there is work still to be done to fully\ndevelop and implement this concept, we are also firmly\nconvinced of the validity of our efforts, which we believe\nwill ultimately lead to an integrated approach to the\nsustainable management of the Caribbean Sea and to the\nprotection of its resources.\nSignificant progress has been achieved over the last\ndecade to bring peace and stability to the hemisphere of\nthe Americas. Barbados subscribes to the philosophy of\ninclusion and constructive engagement and strongly\nbelieves that these must be our guiding principles as we\nstrive to banish the last vestiges of the cold war from our\nregion. Like other countries of the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM), we have developed a productive and\ncooperative relationship with our neighbour Cuba. We are\nconvinced that Cuba has a significant role to play in our\nregion, and we view its reintegration into hemispheric\naffairs as an urgent necessity. The continuation of the\nunilateral economic embargo against Cuba runs contrary\nto that spirit and is out of tune with the significant efforts\nof engagement being practiced by the remaining\nGovernments of this hemisphere. We urge the suspension\nof this anachronistic measure.\nThe world still awaits the peace that was promised\nwhen the Charter of the United Nations was adopted, and\nthat was confidently reproclaimed at the end of the cold\nwar. As a small democratic State, Barbados is ever-\nconscious of the peaceful climate which it has enjoyed\nsince independence, in 1966. The political stability of\nBarbados and the Caribbean region, which has facilitated\nand fostered economic and political development, must\nnever be taken for granted. It is a therefore a source of\ngreat distress to all peace-loving people that despite all\nthe wonderful technological and scientific advances we\nhave made over the centuries of this millennium, we are\nentering into the third millennium still carrying the\nbaggage of ancient ethnic and tribal conflicts and of\nnationalistic rivalries. Today, crises that threaten the very\nexistence of some States remain of deep concern to the\ninternational community.\nBarbados shares the profound anguish and suffering\nof the people of Kosovo and was appalled by the barbaric\nslaughter and the massive displacement of innocent\npeople and the destabilizing effect this has had on\nneighbouring States. We support the role that the\npeacekeeping forces are playing in restoring order to\nKosovo and providing the conditions for the return of the\ndisplaced population to their homes.\n27\n\n\nWe wish to reiterate, together with the members of the\nCaribbean Community, that military intervention should be\nauthorized by the United Nations Security Council. As a\nsmall, defenceless State, we are uncomfortable with the\nnotion that intervention can take place without the prior\nauthorization of the United Nations Security Council.\nWe welcome the restoration of democracy and the\nreturn of civilian government to Nigeria and look forward\nto its renewed participation in the forthcoming\nCommonwealth Heads of Government conference.\nWe hope that concerted action will continue among\nthe parties involved to implement the Lom\u00e9 Agreement and\nto bring a final peace to the suffering people of Sierra\nLeone.\nWe are also heartened by the decision to mobilize a\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force into East Timor to end\nthe abominable infringement of the basic human and civil\nrights of the people of that country. It is intolerable that in\nthis so-called civilized age people can still find themselves\npersecuted and terrorized because they vote according to\ntheir conscience and in keeping with their vision of their\nown future.\nWe are following what is taking place in the Middle\nEast and hope that the conditions now exist to resolve all\noutstanding issues and so bring about a lasting peace\nthroughout that region.\nThe multifaceted areas of the sustainable development\nprocess demand a holistic approach. No longer can we\nservice only the economy, the agricultural sector or any one\nsector at the expense of others. The value of building strong\nsocial institutions becomes more relevant when placed\nagainst the backdrop of globalization and its effects.\nMechanisms must be put in place to ensure that social\nrights are safeguarded.\nBarbados places strong emphasis on social\ndevelopment. We are convinced that more needs to be done\nat the international level to ensure that this emphasis is\nmaintained. It must be understood that economic\ndevelopment cannot be sustained unless a framework for\noverall development is in place. The alleviation of poverty\nand the promotion of gender equality, democracy and the\nrights of the child are issues that must be simultaneously\naddressed.\nThe first World Summit for Social Development,\nwhich was held in 1995, gave an international focus to\nissues such as poverty eradication, full employment,\nsocial integration, gender equality and universal access to\neducation. Barbados remains committed to the\nmaintenance of a sustainable economic, political and\nsocial environment that will enable its citizens to achieve\nadvanced social development. In furtherance of this\nobjective, the Government of Barbados has created a\nMinistry of Social Transformation that will be the main\nfocal point for all social and welfare services, with\nemphasis on poverty alleviation \u2014 indeed, eradication \u2014\nand support for the disadvantaged and the disabled.\nAt the international level, Barbados welcomes and\nsupports the special session that will take place during the\nnext year. This will provide an opportunity to review the\nactions that have been taken to give effect to the\ndecisions adopted at the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment. It is anticipated that this special session\nwill lead to a renewal of international commitment to\nfulfil the objectives of the 1995 Copenhagen Summit. The\nmatter takes on greater urgency when it is realized that,\nfour years after the United Nations Summit, international\nand economic crises have led to a reversal of the gains\nmade in social development.\nOne of the main deterrents to sustainable\ndevelopment remains the illicit traffic in narcotics, which\nis a major concern to the Governments of the Americas.\nThis transnational phenomenon is one of the more adverse\nconsequences of globalization, which has brought in its\nwake the associated evils of money laundering, arms\ntrafficking and violent crime. Geography places the\nCaribbean in the direct path of this phenomenon as a\ntransit point of illegal drugs. It must be borne in mind\nthat the illegal drug trade undermines democracy and can\neventually lead to the destruction of the nation-State. This\ncircumstance has compelled the Caribbean countries to\ngive the highest priority to the development of\ncooperative efforts at drug interdiction, demand-reduction\nand the containment of transnational crime.\nBarbados currently serves as a focal point in these\nregional efforts, which enjoy the support of the European\nUnion, the United States of America, Canada and the\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme.\nWe will continue to play an active role in support of all\ncoordinated efforts at the regional and international levels\nto combat the narco-trafficking threat and the dangers\nposed to the security of the small States of the Caribbean.\n28\n\n\nBarbados is firmly committed to the United Nations\nOrganization. We have supported all constructive efforts at\nreform, but we insist that the Organization can remain\nviable only if all Members scrupulously honour their\nfinancial commitments. We also believe that a healthy\nbalance must be maintained between the United Nations\npeacekeeping focus and its developmental mandate. In this\nregard, we continue to be concerned at the declining\nfunding available to the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) and other United Nations agencies,\nresulting in a diminished capacity on their part to carry out\ntheir important mandate. We reiterate the importance of the\nwork of these agencies in support of the national efforts of\ndeveloping countries to achieve economic and social\nprogress.\nWe very much value the work of UNDP and of the\nUnited Nations system as a whole. As a net contributing\ncountry, Barbados is eager to enter into a new partnership\nwith UNDP that can make a significant contribution to our\nefforts to achieve the next critical phase of our\ndevelopment, the transition to a globalized economy.\nIn appreciation of the United Nations contribution\nover the years, the Government of Barbados has agreed\nto construct a permanent home for all United Nations\noffices located in Bridgetown and servicing the Eastern\nCaribbean. To this end, we expect to commence shortly\nthe construction of the United Nations common premises\nin Bridgetown.\nThe new millennium brings with it a sense of giddy\nexpectation, a passion for renewal and the tendency to\nbelieve that things will miraculously change for the better\novernight. We must not delude ourselves into thinking\nthat the fifty-fifth, the fifty-sixth or even the sixtieth\nsession of the General Assembly will take place in an\nenvironment any less complex and challenging than our\ngathering here today. What we do know is that we may\nnot be expected to complete the task, but then, neither are\nwe at liberty to abstain from it."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to address the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session as a\nrepresentative of His Majesty the King of Swaziland. I\nbring with me from the Kingdom of Swaziland warmest\ngreetings and best wishes to all our fellow members from\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi,\nthe Government and the whole Swazi nation.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland congratulates you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nthis session. We are especially proud that a fellow southern\nAfrican has been elected to this demanding position, and\nwe are confident that your diplomatic skills and experience\nwill help you guide and lead this Assembly towards the\nsuccessful conclusion of its deliberations.\nWe should also like to commend the skilful leadership\nof the fifty-third session by your predecessor Mr. Didier\nOpertti.\nWe are meeting at a time of great challenges for the\nUnited Nations. The membership is faced with a number of\nissues concerning the very shape of our Organization and\nthe scope of operations that we choose to undertake. The\nKingdom of Swaziland believes that we are fortunate\nindeed to have at this time a Secretary-General who\ncommands such universal respect and who possesses the\nqualities of determination, enthusiasm and leadership that\nare so necessary as we chart our course for the future. We\ncall on him and on the staff of the United Nations to keep\nup their good work in the service of all Member States.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the\nSecretary-General and his staff can best be supported by\nour continuing commitment to meeting our financial\nobligations in full and on time. We call on all our fellow\nMembers to comply by honouring their obligations so that\nour Organization can have sufficient resources with which\nto cope with the widening scope of its operations and to\nmeet the expectations of us all.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is delighted to extend a\nwarm welcome to our Organization\u2019s three new Members:\nthe nation States of Tonga, Nauru and Kiribati. Their\nadmission is further confirmation of our respect for the\nprinciples of universality and representation, as contained\nin the founding Charter of the United Nations.\nBut even as we welcome these new Members, the\nKingdom of Swaziland is conscious that the principle of\nuniversality is not applied equally to others who feel\nexcluded from the activities of our Organization. I refer\nto the 22 million people of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan, who believe that they are being denied their right\n\n\nto representation in the United Nations. The Government\nand the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan have\nshown their willingness and capacity to contribute actively\nto global development and peace, through disaster relief and\ndevelopment support to many countries and regions. The\nRepublic of China on Taiwan is clearly a peace-loving\nnation, and is highly developed in all economic, social and\npolitical spheres.\nIt is the view of the Kingdom of Swaziland that\ninternational peace and security and equitable development\nfor all mankind, can be achieved only through the inclusion\nof all the people of the world in the one truly global\ndevelopment Organization. We therefore support the call\nfrom an increasing number of Member States for the\nestablishment of a working group by the General Assembly\nto examine the exceptional international situation relating to\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan and to ensure that the\nfundamental right of its 22 million people to participate in\nthe work and activities of the United Nations is fully\nrespected. We recognize that, as has been the case in some\nother nations, the matter of reunification is for the Chinese\npeople themselves.\nThe history of the twentieth century will have further\nevidence to support the belief that man apparently and\nsurprisingly cannot live peacefully side by side with his\nneighbour, nor in harmony with nature and his environment.\nDespite the many remarkable achievements of the last 99\nyears, notably in the collapse of ideological and political\ncolonialism and in the fields of technology, science and\nmedicine, it will be, in the end, by world wars,\nenvironmental degradation and the emergence of global\nepidemics that this century will be remembered.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the\npromotion of sustainable international peace and security\nmust be the main priority for the United Nations, because\nit is clear that our collective aim of raising the living\nstandards of our peoples is possible only in conditions of\nglobal stability and with nations living in harmony\nalongside one another.\nIt has long been recognized that the greatest threat to\nglobal peace lies in the continuing spread of weapons of\nmass destruction. Our failure so far as an Organization to\nhave true commitment from all Members to arms control\nand nuclear disarmament has meant that we enter the next\nmillennium with this threat still overshadowing all matters\nof international relations.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty are designed as essential first steps towards a\nworld free from the danger that such weapons pose. We\nclearly need to find a way to strengthen the\nnon-proliferation regime, and also to prevent the flow of\nconventional weapons and anti-personnel landmines into\nzones of conflict.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland therefore calls upon the\nConference on Disarmament to implement the proposal of\nthe Non-Aligned Movement by establishing as its highest\npriority an ad hoc committee to begin negotiations on a\nprogramme for the complete elimination of nuclear\nweapons, within a time-bound framework. We also urge\nthose States with nuclear weapons to implement faithfully\nboth the letter and spirit of all agreements relating to the\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear\ndisarmament.\nWhilst the possibilities of global conflict have\ndiminished since the end of the cold-war era, it is a fact\nthat there has been a corresponding increase in the\nincidence of internal conflicts and cross-border\ndisturbances arising from a variety of causes, including\nethnic and religious confrontation. The Kingdom of\nSwaziland believes that the emphasis of the United\nNations in dealing with this increase of internal and\ncross-border crises should be on the introduction of an\neffective mechanism of preventive diplomacy to stop\nincidents from escalating out of control. This has been the\nfocus of regional organizations of which the Kingdom of\nSwaziland is a member, such as the Common Market for\nEastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). We believe that,\nwhile recognizing the overall responsibility of the United\nNations towards global peace, the regional organizations\nmust take the lead as the building blocks towards stability\nand closer cooperation.\nThe past year in international affairs has been a mix\nof progress in some areas of past conflict and the\ncontinuation or emergence of crises in many others. The\nUnited Nations has quite correctly become involved in\ntrying to help resolve each of these situations, to a greater\nor lesser degree, and the Kingdom of Swaziland\ncommends its efforts and those of all who have played a\nsimilar role.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland recognizes the recent\nprogress made by Israelis and Palestinians towards the\n2\n\n\nimplementation of the Wye River peace accord. This has\nbeen a most encouraging step towards lasting peace in the\nMiddle East region and we applaud the courage and\ncommitment of the leadership of both sides towards\nachieving this aim.\nThe crisis in the former Yugoslavia earlier this year\ngave us cause for great concern, especially in the light of\nthe threat of the conflict\u2019s spreading to other Balkan States.\nWe pray that the recent return to relative stability will lead\nto lasting peace in that troubled region and that the wishes\nof the people for their future will be the guiding principle\nin any long-term dispensation.\nWe have viewed with concern the events in East\nTimor following the referendum on independence and we\nfully support the decision of the United Nations to accede\nto the request of the Indonesian Government for the urgent\ndeployment of a peacekeeping force. We appeal to all\ninvolved to restore calm to the situation and to respect the\nwishes of the people of East Timor for their future.\nWe have watched with equal concern the apparent\nsetback in the peace process in Northern Ireland. We\nsupport the efforts of the British and Irish Governments to\ncreate the right conditions of trust and confidence, in which\nthe people of Northern Ireland can decide their future for\nthemselves. We urge all parties involved to exercise\nrestraint and to rediscover the spirit of compromise and\nreconciliation that characterized the original Good Friday\nAgreement.\nCloser to home, on our own continent of Africa, the\npast year has given cause for some optimism in a number\nof areas; but in others, the tale is all too depressingly\nfamiliar.\nWe welcome with great relief the signing of the Peace\nAgreement between the warring factions in Sierra Leone\nand we appeal to both sides to abide by the terms of the\nsettlement so that their people may benefit from the\ndividend of peace after so many years of suffering and lack\nof development.\nThe continuing border dispute between Ethiopia and\nEritrea has unsettled all in the Horn of Africa and we\napplaud the decision of both countries to agree to mediation\nefforts between them by the United Nations and the OAU.\nWe pray that this sensible move may lead to a peaceful\nsettlement of the crisis.\nThe recent signing of an Agreement by all parties to\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has\nencouraged all of us in the region. We hope that there\nwill be commitment by all signatories to the terms of the\nceasefire and that a lasting solution may be found that\nwill allow the Congolese people to develop their great\npotential in peace. This last success is all the more\nencouraging for those of us in the SADC region, since it\ncame about through the combined efforts of a number of\nSADC member States. In a similar vein, heightened\ntension between two of our members, Angola and\nZambia, was able to be defused before the situation could\nescalate into a crisis.\nBoth of these situations point to the acceptance of\nresponsibility by our member States for resolving regional\ndifficulties ourselves. Of course, this does not preclude\nour welcome to the willingness of others, such as the\nOAU, the United Nations and individual countries that\nwish to be involved, especially in the provision of training\nand material and financial support. But we firmly believe\nin the principle that African problems require african\nsolutions and we are determined to come up with the\nmeans and mechanisms to abide by it.\nOn the negative side, the continent has seen the\ncontinuation of two crises that are having an especially\ndamaging effect on the lives of the people involved and\nthat we believe require the urgent attention of the United\nNations.\nThe first concerns the deteriorating situation in\nAngola, where peace remains as elusive as ever. We call\non the leadership of UNITA to respect the terms of the\nLusaka Protocol and to recognize the need to use it as the\nstarting point in the search for lasting peace and national\nhealing. We appeal to the international community to\ncontinue to support the efforts of SADC and all of us\nwho are involved in the quest for an end to the suffering\nof the Angolan people.\nThe situation is Somalia, while possessing different\ncharacteristics, has the same distressing effect on the\npeople of that unfortunate country. The fact is that the\ndivision and lack of any legitimate central authority in\ntheir country has deprived Somalis not only of peace and\nthe chance for development, but also of a voice of appeal\nin regional and international forums.\nThe time has surely come for the United Nations to\nshow real commitment to finding a solution to the\nSomalia crisis, in the same way that we are expending a\n3\n\n\ngreat deal of effort and resources in crisis situations in\nother parts of the world. The Somali people deserve the\nsame concern and respect for their future from the rest of\nthe world as those in countries with perhaps greater global\nrecognition and resources.\nThe complex challenges facing the world today lend\ngreater significance and urgency to the initiatives for reform\nof our Organization. The Kingdom of Swaziland believes\nthat these reforms are essential if the United Nations is to\nretain the global credibility and authority that are so\nnecessary in its operations.\nRecent history has shown clearly that the traditional\nmechanisms for harmonizing global relations and conflict\nresolution, in particular, are no longer effective, and the\nUnited Nations is in real danger of losing the confidence of\nits Members in these areas.\nOur aim must be to transform our Organization into a\nstructure that is truly representative of all our Members and\nthat is transparent and efficient in its operations, while\nremaining consistent to the purposes and principles of our\nfounding Charter.\nWe believe that the priority should be to achieve\nbalanced representation in the principal organs of the\nUnited Nations. The Security Council, as a particular\nexample, requires reform in order to strengthen its\nlegitimacy. Its composition must reflect the plurality and\ndiversity of the membership of the United Nations, with\ndue regard for the profound geopolitical changes in recent\nhistory.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland reaffirms its full support\nfor the African position on reform of the Security Council,\nnamely, two permanent seats for Africa to be shared on a\nrotational basis, as well as three non-permanent seats, and\na re-examination of the exercise of veto power.\nIt is a fact that the majority of Member States concur\nwith this need for reform of the Security Council and that\nall agree on the urgency attached to the matter. Yet there\nhas been very little progress made so far by the\nOpen-ended Working Group established to address this vital\nissue. We are concerned at this lack of progress and would\nurge the Working Group to overcome whatever obstacles\nremain to a resolution that meets Members\u2019 demands for\nfairness and urgency.\nTurning now to the question of the Millennium\nAssembly, to be convened next year, the Kingdom of\nSwaziland is encouraged by the emerging consensus\namong Member States on the need to articulate a vision\nfor the international community in the year 2000.\nWe support the Secretary-General\u2019s theme of the\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century and the\nproposed sub-topics for the Millennium Assembly. Of\nthese, we believe the closely related sub-topics of peace\nand security, on the one hand, and development and\npoverty eradication, on the other, to be of the highest\npriority in the context of the overall theme.\nFuture global stability depends on the ability of\nnational Governments to increase the momentum for\neconomic development and their capacity to improve the\ndelivery of job creation and essential social services, such\nas health and education.\nWe believe that poverty eradication can be achieved\nonly through the promotion of an accelerated pace of\ngrowth and development in the developing countries.\nThere can be no doubt that, to achieve this aim, we need\nthe support of the rest of the international community,\nand this support can best be coordinated by the United\nNations.\nOne key factor in the achievement of our aim of\npoverty eradication is the concept of the globalization and\nliberalization of the global economy. The conclusion of\nthe Uruguay Round, on the one hand, promised to open\nup enormous trade opportunities in the sale and\nmovement of goods and services, but on the other it\nthreatened the fragile economies of those countries that\nhad not achieved the state of preparation to take full\nadvantage.\nThe continent of Africa, in particular, continues to\nface a multitude of problems as we struggle to settle into\nthe new world order. Many of us are undertaking painful\nreforms of existing structures in order to respond to the\ndemands of globalization and liberalization. The\nimplementation of structural adjustment programmes,\noften on the instructions of the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, is having a severely adverse impact on the\nsocial welfare of many African countries, with devastating\neffects on the quality of life of our people. We can see\nthe result of these effects in many countries, where a\ndecrease in expenditure on social programmes has led to\nheightened internal tension and instability.\nClearly, globalization and liberalization as concepts\nhave much to recommend them. Undoubtedly, they hold\n4\n\n\nthe key to an economic future of equal opportunity for all\ncountries. But we are saying that they need to take into\naccount the unequal starting points of each country: that\nsome are better prepared than others to take full advantage\nof the opportunities they offer and that many of us may\nwell lose any hope of catching up. We are seeing the very\nsovereignty of countries being eroded by the power of\nmultinational companies. True economic power is being\nheld in fewer and fewer hands, and the developing\ncountries are becoming further marginalized. Social\nproblems increase as people lose jobs and capital and\ncurrency values are controlled elsewhere.\nThe developing countries cannot wish away\nglobalization, but we would wish it to adopt a more human\nface, one that recognizes and makes allowances for the\nfundamental inequalities between the richer and the poorer\nnations of the world and makes concessions to allow us the\nopportunity to take full advantage of its opportunities in due\ncourse.\nFor our part in the Kingdom of Swaziland, we are\naggressively pursuing political, economic, social and\ninstitutional reforms that will have a major impact on all\naspects of national life, in accordance with the wishes and\nexpectations of the Swazi people themselves.\nThis year, we launched the national development\nstrategy, a people-driven vision for the long term, providing\na planning framework for government action priorities for\nthe next 25 years. The core aim of the strategy is to achieve\na sustainable increase in the standard of living of all\nSwazis, with particular emphasis on eliminating poverty\nfrom our society. Our priority is to create the conditions for\na vibrant economy and to increase our capacity to provide\nour people with a high level of human development.\nThis long-term blueprint has been used as the basis for\ntwo short- and medium-term programmes of action by the\nGovernment that are linked to timetables and are fully\naccountable for results.\nThe economic and social reform agenda is a\nperformance management tool that identifies priority actions\nand keeps government performance under close, public\nscrutiny and the public sector management programme\ndesigned to improve service delivery and cost-effectiveness\nin the public sector. We believe that these initiatives, with\nthe wishes of the people at their heart, will provide us with\nthe right conditions in which to prosper and to achieve our\nhuman development objectives.\nWe have very much appreciated the support of the\nUnited Nations in formulating the strategy. The national\ndevelopment strategy should, from now on, form the\npriority target for all development support from United\nNations agencies. We would wish the same from the\ninternational development finance institutions. We share\nthe concern of many fellow Member States in the\ndeveloping world that too often these institutions\u2019 target\nfor support is not in tune with the wishes of the country\ninvolved and that the process of project design and\napproval is painfully slow. We look forward to working\nwith the United Nations Development Programme and the\ninternational finance institutions to design projects that\ncoincide with the wishes of our own people, and within\na time-frame that meets our expectations of speedy\nimplementation.\nIn 1996, the Kingdom of Swaziland embarked on a\nreview of its Constitution with the establishment of a\ncommission that was tasked with collecting the views of\nall Swazis on all aspects of the present Constitution. We\nhave kept the General Assembly fully informed on the\nprogress of this commission each year, and I am delighted\nto report that the people\u2019s recommendations on the\nConstitution will be presented to the nation at the end of\nthis year. The process will then move forward to the\ndrafting of these recommendations into a formal\ndocument that will be confirmed by the people\nthemselves, before final ratification.\nThroughout the process of constitutional review, we\nhave been guided by the principle of involving all Swazis\nin the drafting of what will be the Kingdom\u2019s defining\ndocument. Consultation with our people on all important\nmatters is a principle that we have followed throughout\nour history, and is one that has helped us to maintain the\npeace and stability with which we have always been\nblessed.\nI have spoken at length about the efforts we in the\nKingdom of Swaziland are making to improve the lives\nof our people. And yet, all our plans and all our good\nintentions are meaningless in the face of the danger that\nthreatens to overwhelm our nation. I am referring, of\ncourse, to the HIV/AIDS crisis, which is already having\na severe impact on the lives of many Swazi families and\nwhich undermines all our hopes for a future of prosperity\nand security for all our people. We are facing up to the\nfact that the Kingdom of Swaziland has one of the highest\nrates of HIV infection in the world, and our hospitals and\nclinics are stretched to the limit of capacity as a result.\nWe are making every effort to halt the spread of the\n5\n\n\ndeadly disease. But it is an uphill struggle and involves us\nin bringing about a wholesale change in attitude and moral\nbehaviour.\nOur chief concern is to promote awareness of the\ndanger and of the preventive measures available. Our\nresources are limited, and we need the continuing support\nof the international community in our efforts to reverse the\ndownward trend. This appeal was repeatedly made at the\nrecent Eleventh International Conference on AIDS and\nSTDs in Africa held in Lusaka. We therefore join other\nMember States in a similar predicament in appealing to the\nUnited Nations to coordinate an international response to\nthe crisis. The very future of our nation, and that of many\nothers, depends on those with the technical and financial\nresources joining forces with us to stem the deadly tide.\nIn conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to\nexpress the deep gratitude of Their Majesties, the\nGovernment and the whole Swazi nation, to the United\nNations Development Programme and all its sister agencies,\nfor the many programmes of assistance undertaken in the\nKingdom of Swaziland since our independence.\nWe believe that the United Nations, as the one truly\nglobal development Organization, remains the only hope for\novercoming the many complex challenges facing the world\ntoday. Despite the setbacks and obstacles to achieving our\ncollective aims, there can be no doubt that the world would\nbe a more troubled place without the combined efforts of\nall of us here.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland therefore takes great pride\nin reaffirming its commitment to the principles and ideals\ncontained in the United Nations Charter, and we ask\nAlmighty God to watch over and guide us in the\nchallenging times ahead for our Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I wish also to\nexpress my great appreciation of the way in which your\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, guided the work of the\nfifty-third session.\nI take this opportunity also to welcome the Republic\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga to the great United Nations family, and to convey to\nthem our best wishes for the future.\nI am pleased to say that this year has been marked\nby genuinely positive developments for Albania in the\npolitical, social and economic spheres. Albania has made\nprogress in strengthening its democratic institutions and\nits civil society, in achieving respect for human rights and\nfreedoms, and in enhancing public order and the rule of\nlaw.\nAs a new democracy, Albania is tireless in its efforts\nto strengthen and consolidate its institutional structures.\nThere has been tangible progress in bringing about the\nindependence of the legislative, executive and judicial\nbranches. At the same time, efforts to coordinate them are\nmoving forward without in any way affecting their\nseparate identities.\nThe Albanian State and Government have given\npriority to economic development by promoting free\ninitiative in the privatization process, principally in\nstrategically important sectors. We have also made a\ncontinuous effort to formulate and implement modern\nlegislation that can encourage and support domestic\ninvestment and can channel foreign investment into\nespecially profitable vital sectors of our economy.\nWe have every reason to appreciate the beneficial\ncooperation between Albania and the World Bank, which\nhas resulted in the implementation of projects of great\nimportance to the Albanian economy, and also in their\neffective management. We are grateful too for the support\nof the International Monetary Fund, whose activities have\nmade a great contribution to revitalizing my country's finances.\n\n\nWe are well aware that no State can have a healthy\neconomy or a solid democracy without secure public order,\nthe rule of law and a strong civil society. Among the\nthorniest problems now facing Albanian society and\nespecially the Albanian State are neutralizing both common\nand organized crime and putting an end to corruption in\ncertain sectors. Great efforts and substantial resources have\nbeen deployed in this area to increase the effectiveness of\nthe police and other administrative structures engaged in\ncrime-fighting. I take this opportunity to express my great\nappreciation for the assistance provided by the\nMultinational Advisory Police Element of the Western\nEuropean Union and by a number of individual States, in\nparticular for the restructuring and training of the Albanian\npolice and for the provision of logistical equipment.\nAt the same time, I would like to say that the\nGovernment of Albania, and I myself, attach great\nimportance to the direct commitment of the United Nations\nto the process of disarming the civilian population. I would\nlike to take this occasion to congratulate Mr. Dhanapala on\nhis last visit to Albania.\nConsidering corruption to be an extreme evil and a\nserious obstacle to the development of a healthy democracy,\nthe Albanian Parliament and Government have adopted\ntough legislative and administrative measures to deal with\nit, establishing specific structures to better uncover and\npunish abuse of power in certain corrupt sectors of the\nadministration and the judiciary.\nDuring previous sessions, Albania has stated \u2014 and\nwe still hold \u2014 that the main objective of our strategy is\nintegration into the Euro-Atlantic structures and into other\nglobal and regional organizations. Our clear objective is to\njoin the European Union, which we do not doubt for a\nmoment can be achieved, so the Albanian Government\nconsiders as a fundamental priority raising the level of its\nrelations with the European Union. I am glad to say that\nthere has been a qualitative improvement in those relations.\nCooperation has been intensified in various fields, which\nbodes well for the signing of an association agreement\nfairly soon.\nThere have also been positive developments in our\nrapprochement with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), following the modernization of the Albanian\narmy, and above all thanks to the unreserved help provided\nto the NATO forces during the Kosovo conflict.\nI am also happy to note that my country's efforts over\nmany years to become a member of the World Trade\nOrganization seem to be about to be crowned with\nsuccess.\nThe work of the current session is taking place while\nKosovo and the entire region are making efforts to heal\nthe wounds inflicted by the Milosevic regime. The\nconcerns expressed by the Albanian delegation at the\nfifty-third session with regard to the policy of \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d, which went as far as genocide, perpetrated by\nthe Belgrade regime against the Albanian population of\nKosovo, proved well-founded. In the framework of this\nchauvinistic policy, the most barbarous crimes were\ncommitted: tens of thousands of Albanians were\nmassacred, thousands of houses were destroyed or set on\nfire, and more than half the population were expelled\nfrom their land and had to go to neighbouring countries,\nparticularly Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro.\nThousands of other people went into the mountains and\nlived in unimaginable conditions in order to escape\ncertain death. The massacres at Ra\u00e7ak, Peja, Rahovec and\nMalishevo, the daily discovery of mass graves containing\nchildren, women, young people and old men and women,\nkilled by the Serb army, militias and policemen, will\ncontinue to testify to a genocide without precedent on the\nthreshold of the new millennium.\nIt is with horror that I condemn the execution of\ndozens of eminent Kosovar intellectuals and the\nimprisonment of hundreds of others.\nThe Milosevic regime ignored the warnings of the\ninternational community and its call for an acceptable\nresolution of the Kosovo crisis. It arrogantly rejected the\nproposals formulated in the Rambouillet agreement by the\nContact Group and increased the repression of the\nAlbanians in Kosovo, thus endangering peace and security\nin the Balkans. In these circumstances, the NATO\ncountries, legitimately defending the sacred principles of\nthe United Nations Charter, had to intervene militarily in\norder to force Belgrade to withdraw its armed forces from\nKosovo.\nWe congratulate the international community on\nhaving shown on this occasion unlike the similar situation\nin Bosnia, a firm will to condemn the crimes perpetuated\nagainst a defenceless population, take effective measures\nto put an end to those crimes and establish peace in the\ntroubled region of the Balkans.\nThe whole Albanian nation has expressed its\nprofound gratitude to NATO, the United States of\nAmerica, the United Nations, the Organization for\n2\n\n\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, and all the\ninternational forces which contributed to ending the\nhumanitarian disaster in Kosovo and re-establishing peace\nthere. In particular, I pay tribute to the action and the\npersonal commitment of Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, in the settlement of this\nconflict and the ending of the humanitarian crisis.\nI also pay special tribute to the International Criminal\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia for its commitment to\npublic exposure of the crimes against the Albanian people\nof Kosovo and for becoming an interpreter for the whole\nAlbanian nation in their just request that all those\nresponsible for crimes against the innocent population be\nput in the dock. I call on all countries, especially those in\nour region, to cooperate with the Tribunal, as recommended\nin Security Council resolutions.\nThe Albanian State has done everything to ensure that\nthe conflict in Kosovo is resolved as soon as possible and\npeace is re-established in the Balkans. Engaging in intense\npolitical activity, we have striven to ensure that the political\nforces in Kosovo adopt a common attitude and accept the\nRambouillet peace plan. The Albanian State, while\ncommitting itself firmly to defending its territorial integrity\nand sovereignty, has refused to respond to provocations by\nSerb forces at the border. Albania has not fallen for\nMilosevic's manoeuvres designed to extend the conflict in\nthe region.\nDespite our great economic and financial difficulties,\nAlbania has borne the burden of the humanitarian crisis of\nthe refugees from Kosovo. Half a million Kosovars\ndeported from their homes have found shelter among their\nbrothers in Albania. Albanian families opened their doors\nto their blood brothers, thereby earning widespread respect\nfor their generosity. As I recall this period, I would like to\nexpress our deep gratitude for he invaluable assistance\ngiven us by States and international organizations, both\ngovernmental and non-governmental, especially those\nworking within the United Nations framework. The United\nNations, implementing Security Council resolution 1244\n(1999), is today, in the aftermath of the Kosovo crisis,\nplaying a decisive role. The new civil administration,\ncomposed of representatives of the entire population of\nKosovo, is almost in place, with the help in particular of\nthe United Nations, the European Union and the OSCE; it\nis working feverishly in the edification, democratization and\nstrengthening of a multi-ethnic civil society, with respect\nfor human rights and a framework of institutions imbued by\nthat respect.\nKFOR is carrying out the difficult task of preserving\nstability and the fragile peace in the Kosovo region. I take\nthis opportunity to thank the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Bernard Kouchner, for his efforts\nto attain the established objectives. I am confident that the\nUnited Nations and the organizations supporting it will\ncontinue their action so as to eliminate all negative factors\nthat might compromise a secure and complete peace and\nthe future of the Kosovo region. We support the efforts of\nall the international and Kosovar political forces to ensure\npeaceful coexistence between Albanians and the ethnic\nminorities in Kosovo. We express our wish and\nconviction that these efforts, based on Security Council\nresolution 1244 (1999), will be crowned with success.\nThe end of the conflict in the Kosovo region and the\nconcern of the international community to transform the\nBalkans from the powder keg it has been into a region of\npeace and stability have given the countries in our region\na historic opportunity to achieve development, prosperity\nand democratization. We have resolved not to miss that\nopportunity. First and foremost, our societies must\nabandon their archaic chauvinistic mindset, which has\nbeen the sources of division and hatred and which should\nno longer outweigh the desire for unity, friendship and\ncooperation among peoples.\nWe must struggle towards and succeed in\nquarantining all policies that encourage hatred and ethnic\ndivisions, because such anachronistic policies have been\nthe source of human catastrophes and remain one of the\nmain causes of the destabilization of our region and the\ndelay in our economic development.\nOur countries share common interests in the\nstrategic, economic and security spheres. In this regard,\nwe want to become integrated into powerful structures\nsuch as the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO). But it would not be realistic to\nthink we will easily attain this objective. We fully realize\nthat we are at the initial stage of this process. Thus we\nbelieve that all the countries of the region should\ncoordinate their efforts in order to become \u2014 all together,\nnot separately \u2014 integrated into those structures.\nThe Stability Pact on South-Eastern Europe is the\nfundamental document for the consolidation of democratic\nvalues, for economic growth and for the strengthening of\nsecurity in our region. I take this opportunity to salute the\nfull support provided to this initiative by the countries of\nour region at the Cologne and Sarajevo meetings. The\nState and the Government of Albania support all efforts\n3\n\n\nthat have been undertaken within the political boundaries of\nthe former Yugoslavia to promote democracy and the\nprocess of integration in the region. We welcome all\ndemocratic developments in Serbia, the consequence of\nwhich should be to remove from power the political group\nresponsible for the crimes committed in the former\nYugoslavia and to eliminate the chauvinistic mindset that\nencourages war. Such a mindset is no longer acceptable in\ncivilized Europe.\nThe Albanian Government is adopting measures with\na view to attaining the objectives of the Stability Pact. The\nimmediate objectives include various ideas and concrete\nproposals aimed at the development of economic relations\nwith the countries in the region, the creation of inter-Balkan\ninstitutions to monitor respect for human rights and the\nstrengthening of security measures. The Albanian State\nexpects that in the near future the Balkans will become a\ndemocratic region with an economy intended to reach the\nlevel of those of the developed countries, a region that\nrespects human rights, in accordance with advanced\nEuropean and global standards. We believe that because of\nthe damage suffered during the conflicts in the former\nYugoslavia, and particularly in Kosovo, Albania deserves\npreferential treatment within the framework of the Stability\nPact.\nAs far as we are concerned, the free circulation of\npeople, ideas, capital and goods \u2014 a Balkan mini-\nSchengen \u2014 is the precondition for a rapid development of\nthe economy, social life and democracy of our region. A\ndemocratic Balkans is unimaginable if our countries build\nwalls in order to prevent the free circulation of people.\nReciprocal free movement would contribute greatly to\nbringing people together and to cultural exchanges and,\nthereby, to the elimination of the hatred and inter-ethnic\nconflicts that up till now have so cruelly shaken this part of\nEurope.\nAlbania appreciates the role currently being played by\nthe European Union, the United States of America and\nother countries in the framework of these positive\ndevelopments. It hopes that this interest in the development\nand democratization of the region will persist with the same\nlevel of commitment and the same intensity.\nWhile attaching priority to the problems of our region,\nthe State and the Government of Albania have been\nand continue to remain attentive to developments in other\nparts of the world. We welcome the progress in the peace\nprocess in the Middle East and Northern Ireland. For my\npart, I would like to express the fervent hope that these\nprocesses prove irreversible.\nWe appreciate the role played by the United Nations\nin organizing the referendum on the future of East Timor.\nWe hope the most recent agreements and resolutions, with\nthe international presence, in particular that of the United\nNations, will lead to the stabilization of the situation in\nthat country as soon as possible.\nGiven the ever-growing importance of multilateral\ninternational cooperation, Albania intends to become an\never more active Member of the United Nations and of\nother international organizations, in order to be able to\nbetter contribute to safeguarding peace throughout the\nworld. Albania salutes the efforts of the United Nations\nto continue to strengthen its role in resolving the acute\nproblems facing humanity today in the political, economic\nand humanitarian spheres. I take this opportunity to\nexpress my great appreciation for the action of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, aimed at reforming\nand reviving the Organization.\nIn connection with this reform, Albania is in favour\nof the democratization and strengthening of the Security\nCouncil so that it better reflects new international realities\nand has more transparent procedures and working\nmethods and a simplified decision-making process. We\nsupport the financial and budgetary reform of the United\nNations, the objective of which is better management of\nfinancial resources and, thus, the increased effectiveness\nof United Nations programmes and projects.\nAllow me to express once again to you,\nMr. President, and to all the delegations present here my\nfervent wish that this session of the Assembly will meet\nwith success in advancing global peace, stability and\nprosperity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate you\nmost warmly, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. My\ndelegation is confident that with your vast experience you\nwill steer us through the daunting array of issues before\nus with great skill. I assure you of the full cooperation\nand support of my delegation.\nMay I take this opportunity to express our gratitude\nto His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti for his leadership\nand for his contribution to the work of the fifty-third\nsession of the General Assembly.\nMy delegation takes great pleasure in welcoming the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga as they assume their rightful positions\nin the comity of nations. It is appropriate that, at this final\nsession of the General Assembly of the twentieth century,\nthe United Nations family has been expanded by yet\nanother three Members. We look forward to the valuable\ncontributions they will make to the Organization, and to\nworking closely with them on issues of mutual concern.\nThis century has witnessed perhaps the greatest\nchanges in the annals of civilization, from enormous\nstrides in science and technology to advances in social\nthought and organization. Yet we continue to witness the\nworst forms of devastation arising from conflict and from\nthe buildup of destructive capacity. The United Nations\nwas born out of the ashes of the Second World War as a\nreflection of the desire and aspiration of all people to live\nin peace and harmony. At this, the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly before the end of the millennium, it is\nincumbent upon us to consider whether the United\nNations has lived up to the high ideals and expectations\nof all its Members.\nThe primary objective and responsibility of the\nUnited Nations is the maintenance of global peace and\nharmony on the basis of international law and the\nsovereign equality of all nations. Even though the United\nNations moved swiftly to assume this important\nresponsibility of maintaining peace and security right\nfrom its inception, its effectiveness has not been optimal.\nThe end of the cold war raised new hopes and\nexpectations, and renewed efforts to exercise that\nresponsibility. The task has been complex and difficult,\nand, sometimes, decisive action on some issues has led us\nto question why there was inaction on others. In our view,\nthe primary mechanism for the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity must make use of early dialogue aimed at\npeaceful resolution of differences. The use of force to\nresolve conflict must be considered with extreme caution;\nit must be fully within the context of international law\nand must enjoy the support of all the members of the\ninternational community.\n25\n\n\nThe United Nations Charter entrusts responsibility for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security to the\nSecurity Council. While the Council must have the\nflexibility to act promptly, it, or its individual members,\nmust not operate in isolation. The Council must be\nresponsible to the international community at large and\nmust respond to our collective aspirations for a more\nrepresentative, relevant and effective Organization.\nBhutan associates itself with the position of the Non-\nAligned Movement, which maintains that new global\nrealities must be reflected through reform of the Security\nCouncil, in terms of both its composition and its working\nmethods. The legitimacy of an increased role and voice for\ndeveloping countries must find expression in an increased\npermanent representation on the Council. We trust that\ndeliberations on this matter will proceed within the\nestablished framework of General Assembly mechanisms,\nwith the involvement of all Member States and with\ncontinued transparency.\nThe threat to international peace and security posed by\nthe abundance of weapons of mass destruction as well as\nconventional arms has not diminished. Progress on nuclear\ndisarmament can take place only if the legitimate security\nconcerns of all countries are addressed and if there is a firm\ncommitment to the eventual elimination of all such\nweapons. Equal attention, we believe, must be given also to\nthe regulation of global trade in conventional weapons and\nsmall arms.\nTerrorism continues to jeopardize and undermine\nhuman rights, fundamental freedoms and security in a\ngrowing number of countries and situations. There is an\nurgent need to accord greater priority to the elaboration of\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism. The\nglobal community must enhance cooperation to prevent,\ncombat and eliminate this scourge.\nGlobalization offers unprecedented opportunities for\nsustained economic development. Paradoxically, the rapid\nprocesses of change and adjustment have been accompanied\nby intensified poverty, unemployment and social\ndisorientation. Fears that current patterns of market-driven\nglobalization may even give rise to further marginalization\nof developing countries are not altogether unfounded. All\nthese clearly indicate that there is an acute need for balance\nin order to forge a middle path for the process of\nglobalization.\nMy country welcomes the decision taken at the\nCologne Summit in June 1999 by the G-8 aimed at\nalleviating some of the debt burden of the heavily\nindebted poor countries. We are hopeful that the effective\nimplementation of this decision will go a long way in\nsupporting national efforts to reduce the debt burden of\nthese countries to more serviceable levels and open for\nthem the opportunities for real and sustained economic\ngrowth.\nWhile we commend our development partners that\nhave reached or surpassed agreed official development\nassistance targets, we regret that with a few exceptions,\nthe long-standing commitment to United Nations targets\nfor official development assistance remains largely an\nunfulfilled goal. In this regard, Bhutan joins other\ndeveloping countries in underlining the importance of the\nconvening of a high-level conference on the financing of\ndevelopment within the framework of the United Nations.\nBhutan recognizes that all parties must exert equal efforts\nin order to foster a successful development partnership,\nbut it is increasingly concerned by the growing\nmarginalization of least developed countries in global\ntrade, whose share remains below 0.4 per cent. While the\nleast developed countries have taken steps towards\neconomic liberalization and institutional reform, their\nsmooth integration into the global economy must be\nfacilitated through preferential access to markets and\nassistance for institutional capacity-building and\ninfrastructure development. In this regard, we are\nheartened by the general sensitivity and responsiveness\nshown by the World Trade Organization.\nAs a founding member of the South Asian\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) family,\nBhutan is committed to further strengthening cooperation\nin South Asia, where infinitely vast resources and\npotentials remain locked and unrealized. We have made\nprogress in fostering cooperation, particularly in the social\nfields, and in strengthening cooperation in the core\neconomic areas. Of special significance is our\ncommitment to establish the necessary mechanisms to\nenable SAARC to move from a preferential trade\narrangement to a free trade arrangement within a\nreasonable period of time.\nOne of the overriding responsibilities of the United\nNations is in the field of socio-economic development.\nOver the decades, the contributions of the various United\nNations agencies have been remarkable, although these\nhave sometimes been taken for granted. It is important\nthat we recognize their contributions and provide them\nwith the necessary resources to effectively continue their\nsupport to developing countries.\n26\n\n\nBhutan has always pursued a people-centred\ndevelopment process. Our national development strategies\nhave always aimed at enhancing gross national happiness\nrather than merely increasing gross national product. This\nconcept calls not only for economic development in the\nconventional sense, but for enriching the lives of the people\nin a holistic way, through the preservation and promotion\nof our rich cultural heritage, through the protection and\nconservation of our fragile mountain ecosystem and through\nthe strengthening and exercise of good governance.\nIn pursuit of an equitable balance between material\nand spiritual development, the Government has consistently\nallocated a large share of resources over the last four\ndecades for social services. Almost 30 per cent of the\npresent national budget is allocated to the provision of free\nbasic education and primary health care. To these are\nattributable a substantial jump in our literacy rate \u2014 and\nthe advance in enrolment rate \u2014 and an increase in life\nexpectancy for the average Bhutanese by 20 years in two\ndecades.\nWe have realized that balanced development is not\nalways the easiest route to take. It entails considerable\ncontemplation, a cautious approach and a deliberate\nchoice of a measured path. It requires patience, restraint\nand; indeed, courage: patience to persevere over many\nyears in order to reap long-term benefits, restraint and\nself-control to refrain from fleeting compulsions and\ncourage to sacrifice immediate gains in favour of long-\nterm sustainable development.\nI would like to seize this opportunity to thank the\nmany worthy members of this Assembly and the various\nUnited Nations and other multilateral agencies for their\ninspiration, cooperation and meaningful support in my\ncountry's endeavour to ensure progress and sustained\ngross national happiness."

        "file_text": "The tragedy in East Timor\nshows us again that when war and violence erupt the world\ncommunity turns to the United Nations for the resolution of\nconflicts and the preservation of peace. We welcome the\nSecurity Council\u2019s action to endorse the multinational force\nthat is now moving in to bring security and aid to the\npeople of East Timor. Norway will contribute with\npersonnel and financing.\nWe look to the United Nations for hope and solutions,\nand for the protection of human dignity and shared values\nin a world of injustice and conflict. That is why the United\nNations is indispensable. And that is why we, the Member\nStates, must make use of the United Nations for peace and\ndevelopment, whether it be in East Timor, in Kosovo or in\nthe Congo. In preparing for the Millennium Assembly, let\nus together address global challenges in a new spirit, with\na new sense of purpose.\nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, upon your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly.\nNorway looks forward to working with you. I also warmly\nwelcome the three new Members of the United Nations, the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga.\nAt the end of this century, globalization presents us\nwith political and moral dilemmas. There has been\nremarkable progress in technological innovation and in\neconomic and democratic development. But at the same\ntime, while the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting\npoorer. Poverty and pollution, violent conflict and violations\nof human rights continue to haunt far too many people\naround the world. Combatting poverty, preventing conflicts,\npromoting human rights: these are the main challenges at\nthe top of our common global agenda for the next century.\nWe must ensure that globalization benefits all, not just the\nfew, and we must protect the environment.\nTo achieve this, we need to strengthen the multilateral\nsystem. We must support the United Nations and its work\nfor global peace, security and sustainable development. We\nmust put the United Nations first.\nTogether we possess the knowledge and the resources\nneeded to eradicate poverty. But still, 1.3 billion people live\nin extreme poverty. This is unacceptable, morally and\npolitically. It is an injustice and an obstacle to economic\nand democratic progress. For all Member States, in the\nNorth and in the South alike, changing this situation must\nbe our priority. And the United Nations must be the\nprimary instrument. There is no alternative. Let us build\na global partnership aimed at eradicating poverty. Let us\nstart by mobilizing the political will and the financial\nresources needed to meet the target of cutting global\npoverty in half by the year 2015. It is a matter of political\nwill; it can be done now.\nNational Governments have the primary\nresponsibility for sustainable development and for meeting\nsocial needs. They must promote and protect the rule of\nlaw, human rights and democracy. They must fight\ncorruption and pursue sound economic policies. There is\nno doubt that development assistance is most effective in\ncountries where government is based on the principles of\ngood governance.\nThe international community must also do more to\ncreate economic opportunities for the developing world.\nThe following steps would have a major impact.\nFirst, we need to increase the transfer of official\ndevelopment assistance from the North to the South.\nNorway has been well above the United Nations target for\ntwo decades. We intend to increase our development\nassistance further, up to 1 per cent of gross domestic\nproduct.\nSecondly, we need partnerships that enable national\nGovernments to lead the way and determine their own\npriorities. The private sector and business interests must\nbe brought into the development process, as the\nSecretary-General has underlined.\nThirdly, development assistance and debt relief must\ngo hand in hand. Creditor nations must now give the\npoorest members of the world community a new start.\nNorway\u2019s national debt-relief strategy is particularly\ndesigned for this purpose. We also support the momentum\ncreated by the Group of Seven States to give highly\nindebted poor countries substantial debt relief.\nFourthly, the entry of developing countries into the\nglobal market must be facilitated, not obstructed. This\nmust be focused on during the new round of multilateral\ntrade negotiations in the World Trade Organization.\nIn recent years, we have seen an increase in civil\nwars, often with an additional element of foreign\ninvolvement. The root causes can often be linked to\nethnic tension, as well as to inequity in the distribution of\n17\n\n\nresources - economic, social, natural and political. During\nthe 1990s, the activities of the United Nations have been\nmore extensive than ever before in the conduct of\npreventive diplomacy, in the deployment of peacekeeping\nforces and in the provision of humanitarian aid to the\nvictims of war.\nBut at the same time, there are critics who claim that\nthe United Nations has failed. Of course, many things could\nhave been done better, but we must not forget the many\nsuccesses and we must not forget that it is we, the Member\nStates, who are responsible for giving the United Nations\nthe mandates to act and the money and the means to\nsucceed. Let us not make the United Nations a scapegoat\nfor our own shortcomings. Instead, we must make sure that\nthe Security Council can fulfil its primary function in\ninternational peace and security. We must act in accordance\nwith the United Nations Charter and international law. We\nmust put the United Nations first.\nThis means enhancing the capacity of the United\nNations for conflict prevention, crisis management and\nlong-term development. All Members must meet their\nfinancial obligations to our world Organization and its\npeace operations. Creating common security is not cost-\nfree. In particular, it is the duty of the most powerful\nmembers of the United Nations to set an example for\nothers.\nThe United Nations must develop further its\ncooperation with regional organizations. As Chairman-\nin-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE), Norway has been working to build\ncloser relations with the United Nations system. We need\nconstructive interaction between all international,\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations involved\nin peacekeeping and post-conflict work in Europe and\nelsewhere.\nKosovo is a tragic example of the complex conflicts\nthat we have seen in recent years. Building lasting peace\nthere will require the concerted efforts of all actors\ninvolved: the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO), the OSCE, the European Union and\nothers. Our immediate concern is to secure a safe\nenvironment for all the people of Kosovo through a credible\ninternational presence.\nWe must promote integration between all the peoples\nand nations of south-eastern Europe. We must include\neveryone and isolate no one. This summer, at the Sarajevo\nSummit, we pledged to make the Stability Pact a key\nelement of our efforts to ensure that democracy, peace\nand prosperity become firmly rooted all over south-\neastern Europe.\nAt the same time, our efforts to build peace in the\nBalkans must not be made at the expense of the poorest\npeople elsewhere in the world. They should not pay the\nbill.\nThe United Nations and its agencies play a central\nrole in providing emergency aid to victims of war\neverywhere. Humanitarian assistance should be\ncomplemented by efforts to promote reconciliation,\ndemocratic development and respect for human rights.\nCompliance with international instruments is needed\nto protect civilians in armed conflicts. We welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report and the Security Council\nresolution adopted last week. At the forthcoming Red\nCross Conference in Geneva, we must generate the\nmomentum needed to secure the protection aspects of\ninternational humanitarian law. The early entry into force\nof the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court\nwill be a vital contribution to the rule of law.\nWe must focus on human security, taking individuals\nand their communities as our point of departure.\nCombating poverty is crucial to human security.\nThe proliferation of anti-personnel mines and small\narms and the use of child soldiers pose a threat to human\nsecurity. They inflict deep wounds on society and\nindividuals. Recently, in Russia, we have seen how\nterrorism strikes innocent people. We strongly condemn\nsuch terrorist acts, for which there can be no excuse.\nInternational efforts to deal with these serious issues must\nbe intensified.\nWe must vigorously pursue nuclear disarmament and\nnon-proliferation. The principles and objectives set out\nunder the process established by the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) must be\nhonoured. The early entry into force of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and ratification\nof the Treaty on Further Reduction and Limitation of\nStrategic Offensive Arms (START II) are crucial\npriorities. So are START III negotiations to lower nuclear\narsenals, and so is a cut-off treaty. These are all crucial\nelements in a global agenda for sustainable human\ndevelopment.\n18\n\n\nWhen natural disasters strike, the poor are the most\nvulnerable. The recent tragedies in Turkey and Greece\naffected us deeply. Increasingly, man\u2019s pressure on the\nenvironment seems to be a contributing factor to natural\ndisasters, which often cause extensive destruction in\ndeveloping countries. We must step up our efforts to assist\ndeveloping nations so that they become less vulnerable. In\nthis regard, Norway attaches great importance to the special\nsession of the General Assembly, to be convened next\nweek, on the Barbados Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates.\nConflict prevention, humanitarian aid and development\nefforts must go hand in hand. We must deal with the\nunderlying causes of poverty and need, not just the\nsymptoms. Political and economic reform should run in\nparallel with humanitarian aid. We must close the gap\nbetween relief and long-term development. This calls for\ncloser cooperation and the involvement of the whole United\nNations family as well as the Bretton Woods institutions.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s reports on Africa (A/52/871-\nS/1998/318 and A/54/133-E/1999/79) clearly demonstrate\nthat poverty, underdevelopment and violent conflicts are\nclosely linked: we cannot address one without addressing\nthe others.\nThe Secretary-General has pointed to the need for a\ncomprehensive approach and better coordination of conflict\nprevention and post-conflict peace-building in the United\nNations system. The Secretariat has already embarked on\nthe process of implementation and follow-up. Norway fully\nsupports the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative and is ready to\nprovide practical and financial support for this important\nendeavour. We will set aside $3 million for the Secretariat\nto use for this purpose.\nThe situation in Africa gives rise to concern. Armed\nconflicts are hampering development in many countries.\nAIDS is also taking a heavy toll. There are positive signs\ntoo: we are witnessing the growth of democracy, transfers\nto civilian rule, free elections and economic and political\nreforms in many African countries. But poverty remains a\nmajor challenge.\nNorway remains firmly committed to peace and\ndevelopment in Africa. We will work with our African\npartners for conflict management and development\ncooperation. We will work with the United Nations, the\nOrganization of African Unity, subregional bodies such as\nthe Southern African Development Community, the\nEconomic Community of West African States, and others,\nto achieve our common aims.\nThe Middle East peace process is at a critical\njuncture. The vision that the parties had in 1993, when\nthe Oslo Accords were signed, is still valid. The fact that\nIsrael and the Palestinians have now embarked on final\nstatus talks is a very positive sign. Strong support for the\npeace process must remain a high priority for the\ninternational community. We must work together with the\nparties to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\nthat will guarantee prosperity and security for all\ninvolved.\nThe world needs an effective multilateral machinery\nto cope with common challenges. For the next century,\nwe must, first, build a stronger United Nations in the\nfields of global security and economic and social\nprogress; secondly, use the United Nations as the primary\ninstrument for peace and development, democracy and\nhuman rights; and thirdly, tackle poverty and conflict\nprevention as the main challenges at the top of our\nagenda. It is up to us, the Member States, to make this\npossible. Together, we must make it happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I\nwould like first of all to extend to you, Sir, my warmest\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I have no\ndoubt that your long diplomatic experience and your deep\nknowledge of international relations will enable you to\nguide the work of this session to a successful conclusion.\nYour election is a token of appreciation from the\ninternational community to you personally and to your\ncountry, Namibia, which is noted for its prestige in Africa\nand in the world. Tunisia, which stood by the fraternal\n14\n\n\nNamibian people in their successful struggle against\ncolonialism, is proud of its close ties with your country and\nlooks forward to strengthening and developing them further\nin the interests of our two countries and peoples.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to express our\nsincere gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti,\nfor his valuable efforts during his presidency of the fifty-\nthird Assembly and for the wise manner in which he\nconducted its work, which had a very positive impact on\nthe deliberations.\nI take this opportunity also to express to the Secretary-\nGeneral our great appreciation for his relentless efforts in\npromoting and strengthening the pacific, negotiated\nsettlement of disputes and crises in various parts of the\nworld. We commend him for his dedication to enhancing\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the Secretariat and to\nstrengthening the Organization's role in meeting\nhumankind's desire for progress, security and peace.\nI extend Tunisia's congratulations to the Republic of\nNauru, the Republic of Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga\non their admission to our Organization.\nWhat characterizes this session is that it is being held\nat the close of a decade that began with the prospect of an\nend to the cold war, witnessed the emergence of new\nconcepts and future-oriented visions designed to avoid any\nrepeat of past errors and crises, and aimed to establish a\nnew world order based on security, peace, cooperation and\nstability. Although optimism marked the early stages of this\nnew era, subsequent developments have compelled the\ninternational community to conduct a comprehensive review\nof the immediate past in order to solve the various\ndifficulties and problems of our world today.\nAs we meet during this session at the dawn of the\ntwenty-first century, we have a propitious opportunity to\ndiscuss and exchange views about various possible methods\nfor amending the approach that we have taken over the last\nfew years and identifying its weaknesses and deficiencies.\nWe must then devise a renewed approach that will provide\nfuture generations with the capacity to adapt, overcome\nobstacles, preserve international peace and security and\nensure well-being and prosperity for all humanity.\nFor the framework of such a renewed approach to\nmaintaining international peace and security, we have in\nmind three main themes. First, the change that has taken\nplace in the approach to armaments and to their role in the\nworld. Secondly, the growing need for increased attention\nto settling regional disputes. Thirdly, the transformation\nof economic and social development into one of the\ncornerstones of peace and security globally. Despite the\ngreat strides which the international community has made\nin these three areas, much remains to be done before we\nachieve the goal of a qualitative transition that would\nallow us to guarantee security and tranquillity for all\npeople and for the generations to come.\nOur world possesses huge arsenals of weapons,\nespecially weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons\nforemost among them. It is extremely important, in our\nview, for the nuclear Powers to take rapid steps to\neliminate these weapons, especially given the limits of the\ncurrent non-proliferation regime in the long term and the\nimpossibility of contemplating non-proliferation as a\nsubstitute for completely dismantling and destroying all\nnuclear weapons and banning them in the future.\nWe believe that as we move closer to the twenty-\nfirst century, the international community has a historic\nopportunity to achieve this noble goal or at least to\nconclude an agreement on nuclear disarmament. In\nworking towards this goal, it is extremely important to\nensure that non-nuclear weapon States are not subject to\nthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in violation of\ntheir security and territorial integrity. Consideration must\nbe given to the fact that non-nuclear-weapon States\nconstitute the overwhelming majority of Member States\nand have freely chosen not to possess nuclear weapons.\nWe would like, in this regard, to address another\naspect of disarmament: small arms. We all know how\ndestructive small arms can be. Tunisia supports all\ninternational efforts to curb small arms proliferation and\ntrafficking.\nTunisia, which has abided by all disarmament\ntreaties and conventions, reiterates its total commitment\nto the disarmament objectives and its strong resolve to\ncontinue contributing towards the achievement of these\ngoals in the various relevant fora, especially the\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva. Tunisia recently\nhad the honour of joining the Conference, following the\nConference's decision last August to expand its\nmembership by admitting five new countries.\nIn implementation of the Ottawa Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction, Tunisia destroyed large quantities of mines\nduring an official ceremony on 29 June 1999 attended by\n15\n\n\na representative of the United Nations in Tunis. We hope\nthat all States parties to the Convention will participate in\nthe Convention process without delay so that the\nConvention's objectives are achieved and transparency is\npromoted pursuant to the Convention's article 7.\nThe outbreak and persistence of conflicts in many\nparts of the world compel our Organization to be constantly\nready to assume its responsibilities and to play the role it\nhas been assigned in this regard by the Charter. We believe\nthat the efforts aimed at consolidating preventive\ndiplomacy, collective security, the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes and adherence to international legality are\nfoundations of international peace and security and should\nbe further upheld.\nHowever, despite the numerous successes of our\nOrganization in this field, there are still many hotbeds of\ntension and war that require more coordination and\ncooperation if they are to be curbed and prevented from\nspreading. I should like in this regard to address the\nquestion of so-called \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d. This is a\nsensitive and delicate issue. It requires, in our view, a\nthorough and profound analysis taking into account all its\naspects, especially those related, first, to the sovereignty of\nStates and the need to preserve it as a natural right\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations as a\nfundamental element of international relations; and,\nsecondly, the necessity to save the lives of civilian\npopulations in times of conflict, in accordance with the\nprinciple of international solidarity.\nAll States Members of the Organization are called\nupon to consider all the implications of these principles in\norder to reach consensus on this issue and to contribute in\na considered and balanced way to the debate on it. Such a\ndebate should not be confined to the Security Council, but\nshould also involve the General Assembly.\nThe issues related to the security problems confronting\nthe African continent should remain at the top of our\npriorities. These issues need the strong material and\nfinancial support of the international community if they are\nto be resolved. Africa, in turn, has given top priority to the\nquestion of the settlement of internal disputes. The\nOrganization of African Unity Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention, Management and Resolution has played an\nimportant role in this regard. Since its inception, the\nMechanism has achieved encouraging results that reflect the\ndetermination of African countries to rely, first and\nforemost, on their own capacity to solve the problems that\nthreaten the security of the continent, in full coordination\nwith the United Nations. Given its importance, the\nMechanism needs stronger financial and technical support\nfrom the international community, which would help to\nenhance its capacities and to develop its effectiveness and\nefficiency.\nWe must stress in this regard the extreme importance\nof development, a basic guarantor of lasting security.\nIndeed, there can be no stability without sustainable\ndevelopment. Despite the relentless efforts of African\ncountries in the political, economic and social fields\naimed at improving the situation of their peoples, there\nare still many difficulties that prevent many countries\nfrom implementing their development programmes.\nIt has become a matter of urgency that the African\ncontinent receive strong and continuous support on the\nbasis of its national priorities. We note in this regard that\nthe initiative of the Security Council and the General\nAssembly to convene meetings to discuss and follow up\nthe situation in Africa bears testimony to a growing and\nconsolidated awareness of the need to address African\nproblems. While commending this approach, we must\nemphasize the need to adopt practical plans which\nAfrica's partners can translate into concrete realities in an\neffective manner.\nWe commend the various initiatives of the United\nNations, its specialized agencies and the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions to promote sustainable development in Africa.\nWe believe, however, that it is important to ensure\ncoordination between United Nations initiatives and those\nundertaken by donor countries if such initiatives are to\nsucceed. In this framework, we look forward to the\nadoption of practical initiatives that respond to the\nproposals spelt out in the report of the Secretary-General\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of sustainable\npeace and development in Africa, particularly regarding\nthe debt problem.\nIn Tunisia, we are aware of the important role that\neconomic and geographical groupings play in today's\nworld in addressing the challenges posed by globalization\nand in adapting to constant important changes. This\nawareness prompts us to pursue our endeavours, along\nwith our brothers in the Maghreb countries, to complete\nthe establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union, which\nremains a strategic and firm choice and which also\nrepresents the aspirations of the people of our region to\n16\n\n\nprosperity, security and integration. This choice is even\nmore pressing in the light of our country's endeavours to set\nup a Euro-Mediterranean space as a framework for\ncooperation between all Mediterranean countries, for\nsolidarity between its peoples and for a cultural and social\ndialogue on the basis of the noble values and high\nprinciples in which we all believe.\nWith respect to the Middle East, where the conflict\nhas lasted more than half a century, peace, which is\ncherished by the peoples of that region and indeed by the\nwhole world, still faces difficulties despite the efforts that\nhave been made by the international community,\nparticularly since the early 1970s. There is no doubt that a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace is the only way to\nconsolidate the foundations of stability and security and to\nenable all parties to devote their resources and energies to\nthe development efforts of their countries and to ensuring\nthe well-being of their peoples.\nTunisia has followed with satisfaction the new\ndevelopments brought about by the signing of the Sharm el-\nSheikh Memorandum, which has created a new encouraging\nclimate for the reactivation of the peace process and the\nfaithful and full implementation of all agreements and\ncommitments. We hope that the final status negotiations\nwill lead to the resolution of the most important issues,\nparticularly the recognition of the inalienable rights of the\nPalestinian people, in particular its right to establish an\nindependent State on its land, with Jerusalem as its capital.\nOn the basis of this firm position of principle in\nsupport of the peace process, and eager as it is to see the\npeace process succeed on all tracks, Tunisia insists on the\nimportance of reactivating negotiations on the Syrian and\nLebanese tracks from the point at which they stopped, as\nwell as on the necessity of the complete and unconditional\nwithdrawal of Israel from South Lebanon and from the\nSyrian Golan Heights, in compliance with the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions and on the basis of the principle\nof land for peace. Occupation and peace cannot co-exist.\nRegarding the Lockerbie issue, Tunisia expresses its\nsatisfaction at the recent positive developments, to which it\nand other parties of good will contributed. It also reiterates\nits call for a speedy and final lifting of the embargo\nimposed on the brotherly Libyan people.\nWith respect to the question of Iraq, Tunisia reiterates\nits call for a peaceful solution in the context of international\nresolutions. It also calls upon the international community\nto join efforts to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi\npeople so that all the efforts of the peoples of that region\ncan be directed towards development and the promotion\nof stability. Thus, Tunisia, which has called for respect\nfor international legality, expresses the hope that a\nsolution will soon be found to all the humanitarian issues\nresulting from this tragedy, particularly the question of\nKuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons, in\nconformity with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nRegarding the question of the three islands of\nGreater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, Tunisia\nreiterates its support for the resolution of this dispute\nbetween the United Arab Emirates and Iran through\npeaceful means, either through direct dialogue or, if that\nshould prove impossible, by referring the question to the\nInternational Court of Justice.\nIn another region of the world, the international\ncommunity has focused its attention in recent months on\nanother important question, that of East Timor. In this\nregard, we welcome the adoption of Security Council\nresolution 1264 (1999) and hope that its implementation\nwill enable the people of East Timor to achieve self-\ndetermination and will, at the same time, maintain\nsecurity in the region and preserve the sovereignty and\nintegrity of Indonesia. We commend Indonesia's courage\nin responding to the wishes of the people of East Timor\nand the international community. We believe that a final\nsettlement of this issue can be achieved only in an\natmosphere of conciliation that involves all parties\nconcerned, and with the support and blessing of the\ninternational community.\nOne of the most important phenomena characterizing\nthe end of this century is the growing globalization that\nnow dominates various aspects of our social life.\nAlthough it has created new opportunities in the field of\neconomic development, it is likely, if not brought under\ncontrol, to lead to further disruption in international\nrelations and development plans. The international\ncommunity must seriously and firmly address the\nchallenges posed by globalization. This entails the\ndemonstration of stronger political will from all parties\nand the implementation of all the commitments made,\nparticularly at the important conferences of the United\nNations.\nFollow-up and implementation of the\nrecommendations of international conferences is, in our\nopinion, of great importance. In this regard, we would\nlike to express our satisfaction with the continuing work\nof the preparatory Committees for the two special\n17\n\n\nsessions of the General Assembly to review and appraise\nimplementation of the Beijing Platform of Action dealing\nwith women's and family issues and of the Copenhagen\nWorld Summit for Social Development, which will be held\nin June, in New York and Geneva respectively. However,\nwe note with concern that, despite the efforts made at the\nUnited Nations, which has placed the eradication of poverty\nhigh on its agenda, the agreed target set at the Copenhagen\nSummit for increasing the amount of official development\nassistance to 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of\ndeveloped countries has not yet been met.\nThis situation requires action at the international level\naimed at achieving solidarity, which we consider an\nessential link between peoples. In this context we place the\nrecent call by His Excellency Mr. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali,\nPresident of the Republic of Tunisia, to all world leaders\nand to various United Nations and other international\ninstitutions for the creation of a world solidarity fund. The\nobjective of this fund would be to collect voluntary\ndonations and contributions to be used in the fight against\npoverty and in the development of the poorest regions in\nvarious parts of the world, particularly in the least\ndeveloped countries that undergo various tragedies and\ncrises. Our country will endeavour, through its contacts\nwith brotherly and friendly countries and at the United\nNations and other international organizations, to rally the\nnecessary support for this noble humanitarian project and\nfor the elaboration of modalities for its creation as soon as\npossible. This will enable us to be more responsive to our\noptions and commitments, which have gained the\nacceptance of the international community and which have\nbeen set forth in the recommendations of various\ninternational conferences.\nWe also rely on United Nations institutions, such as\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population\nFund (UNFPA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of\nthe United Nations (FAO) and other institutions in view of\ntheir prestige and experience as well as their interest in the\nfight against poverty, to contribute efficiently to the speedy\ncreation of this fund.\nThe year 1999 represents a new landmark in the\nconsolidation of the democratic process in Tunisia. It will\nbe marked by pluralistic presidential and parliamentary\nelections based on full transparency and freedom of choice\nfor citizens within the context of freedom and respect for\nlaw. Tunisia has undertaken a programme of substantial\nreforms over the past 12 years in different areas, having\namended the Constitution, allowing political pluralism and\na multiparty system, eliminating special courts and\nenacting legislation in conformity with our obligations to\ninternational treaties in the field of human rights, which\nTunisia has been among the first countries to ratify.\nIn the same spirit, Tunisia has long undertaken to\npromote women's freedom and gender equality. It\npublishes a special journal on children's rights and a code\non the care and rights of the elderly, handicapped and\nother vulnerable categories. All these reforms embody\nTunisia's global vision regarding all dimensions of human\nrights and confirm our country's strong belief in the\nuniversality of such principles.\nThe creation of many multilateral organizations,\nparticularly the United Nations, represents the most\nimportant achievement of the international community in\nthis century. Thanks to the solid institutional edifice in\nwhich our Organization holds a privileged place, rules\nregulating relations between States have been codified,\nand common objectives, programmes and strategies have\nbeen elaborated in order to address the problems\nconfronting the world.\nDespite the successes and achievements in this\nregard, certain weaknesses still mark international\nrelations, and various new disruptions and dangers have\nemerged. In the context of all the developments and\nchanges that have occurred, the United Nations remains\nthe ideal forum and haven for the elaboration of collective\nstrategies to overcome challenges.\nWe believe that the millennium summit, to be held\nduring the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly,\nconstitutes an ideal opportunity, which the international\ncommunity should fully utilize, evaluate its\naccomplishments and build a strategy based on them in\norder to usher in the new millennium with diligence and\nconfidence. That summit will also be a historic occasion\nfor heads of State and Government to debate this matter.\nIn this regard, we believe that the Organization\nneeds to be provided with all the necessary means to play\nan effective role in international relations and affairs.\nReforming the Organization and its various structures on\nthe basis of the developments and changes that have\noccurred will certainly ensure its vitality. Among the\nurgent tasks that the Member States need to address today\nis to reform the Security Council in a way that would\nreflect the profound changes the international community\nhas witnessed, ensure global representation in this vital\n18\n\n\nbody and consolidate the principles of transparency and\ndemocracy in its working methods.\nWe need to stress, in this context, that we expect the\nreform of the Security Council to lead to the fulfilment of\nthe requests of developing countries, primarily African\ncountries, to have permanent representation on the Security\nCouncil, which would allow them to contribute to the tasks\nand responsibilities assigned to this body in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the full\ncommitment of Tunisia to the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations as enshrined in the Charter, the same\npurposes and principles it has adopted and implemented in\nits foreign policy. Tunisia is a peace-loving and justice-\nloving nation. It has endeavoured relentlessly since its\nadmission to this body, and in all the forums to which it\nbelongs, to contribute with all the means at its disposal to\nstrengthen the foundations of international peace and\nsecurity. It makes every effort to encourage dialogue and\nnegotiations as the proper means for the settlement of\ndisputes and crises. It has participated in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations since the early 1960s and presently\ncontributes to three of them. Last June Tunisia signed with\nthe United Nations an agreement that would place standby\nforces at the disposal of the Organization.\nTunisia spares no effort in contributing to all\ninitiatives aimed at promoting cooperation, solidarity and\nunderstanding between countries and peoples. That is the\ndirection we have freely chosen and that we intend to\npursue if and when my country is given the honour of\nbeing elected to a non-permanent seat on the Security\nCouncil for the period 2000-2001 by the Member States\nand with the full support of the brotherly African Group,\nother groups and friendly countries. We look forward to the\nsupport of all Member States so that my country can\ncontinue working with them towards fulfilling the task of\nadvancing the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by congratulating\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election as President of this\nfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I wish him all\nthe best in carrying out his duties.\nAs the General Assembly convenes for the last time\nbefore the Millennium Assembly, I believe that it is\nappropriate to consider the United Nations future and how\nwe can prepare our Organization for the twenty-first\ncentury.\nFifty-four years after its founding, the United Nations\nremains the largest multi-purpose intergovernmental\nOrganization in the world. Indeed, with 188 Members, the\nUnited Nations has become truly global. I would like to\ntake this opportunity to welcome Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga\nto the United Nations family.\nThe United Nations faces a vastly different set of\ninternational issues from those of fifty-four years ago,\nwhen the Organization was founded. Most threats to\ninternational security and stability are no longer\nState-driven but rather derive from the malfunction or\ndysfunction of States. The consequences of these threats,\nhowever, are just as severe as the erstwhile threats by\nStates. Terrorism, corruption, economic collapse, nuclear\nmeltdowns, mass migration and ethnic strife are but a few\nof the challenges that the world has had to face in recent\nyears. The violent conflict in East Timor, \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d in Kosovo, and the recent re-escalation of\nviolence in Chechnya are but a few vivid examples of the\nnew kinds of threats that we face today.\nThe United Nations has a crucial role to play in\ncombating these and other international threats. But before\nit can start to play a more active role in the post-cold-war\ninternational order, serious structural reforms are needed.\nEstonia believes that reforms should focus above all\non the Security Council. Formally, the Council, originally\nintended to be the cornerstone of collective security, is\nvested with strong executive authority. Yet in practice its\nauthority is challenged. Because of a recurring failure or\ninability to take action, countries in crisis situations look\nless and less to the Council. In order for the United\nNations to avoid relegation to the status of a body that\ncreates norms but cannot ensure their implementation,\nvoting procedures and mechanisms in the United Nations\nmost powerful body should be reformed.\n\n\nThe key issue is voting practice, not the shopworn\nissue of non-permanent membership. The often\nirresponsible exercise of the veto, or even more often the\nthreat of the veto, has paralysed the Security Council and\nundermined its legitimacy. More and more often we witness\nsome permanent members taking actions to meet their\ndomestic interests and foreign policy goals in areas\nirrelevant to the issue at hand. We as Member States have\ngiven the mandate to the Council. Even before we are able\nto carry out the reforms, we must entrust the permanent\nmembers to use the veto with utmost responsibility.\nAs we look around this Hall, or at the globe, we can\nall observe that the world today is not what it was half a\ncentury ago \u2014 thank God. The United Nations was created\nto maintain peace in the wake of the turmoil of the Second\nWorld War. Today we are already into the second decade\nof the post-cold-war order, two generations removed from\nthe problems faced by our grandfathers. Why, then, should\nwe be constrained by obsolescent structures still based on\nthe power relationships of 1945? The guarantors of and\ngreatest contributors to stability in the world have changed\nfundamentally in the course of half a century. We need not\nfear opening a discussion on whether the moral and legal\nreasoning underlying Security Council membership in the\nwake of the Second World War is still appropriate for the\npost-cold-war era.\nFollowing from this, another area where Estonia\nbelieves reforms are vitally needed is that of the informal\nregional groups that provide the basis for election\nprocedures. Many of these groups are based on a now\nirrelevant cold war ideological and geopolitical alignment.\nA decade after the end of the cold war the East-West divide\nhas disappeared, and regional groups, such as the Eastern\nEuropean Group, which were a product of that divide,\nsimply no longer make sense. In order to make United\nNations structures correspond to today\u2019s realities, those\nregional groups should become truly geographic.\nAllow me now to turn to economic and social\ndevelopment. We can all agree that over the years the\nUnited Nations has been most successful in that area. The\nUnited Nations system has devoted more attention and\nresources to development than to any other international\nassistance effort. Although these non-political activities\nhave received less attention than efforts in the field of\npeacekeeping and diplomacy, they are no less important.\nMany countries, including mine, have benefited from\nUnited Nations assistance. We believe, however, that it is\ntime to start to pay back.\nProviding development and humanitarian assistance\nis a logical and moral consequence of our membership of\nthe international community. It should be the goal of\nevery country. In this regard, I would like to observe that\nmost United Nations activities, whether in the field of\npeacekeeping or economic assistance, almost invariably\nbecome permanent. Permanence, however, is not a sign of\nsuccess; it is a sign of failure. The United Nations should\ntherefore concentrate more on preventive actions and on\nimplementing well-planned, well-targeted and timely\nprogrammes with a clear exit strategy. That, in turn, will\nencourage success and positive development, not\ndependency.\nEstonia values the United Nations function as a\nnormative Organization that sets international standards\nand universal principles for its Members. The gross\nviolations of human rights witnessed this year, including\nkillings and mass deportations reminiscent of those\nexperienced by my country 50 years ago, show that it is\nmore important than ever that countries adhere to\ncommon international norms and standards in the field of\nhuman rights. As the only truly global Organization, the\nUnited Nations should play a greater role in making sure\nthat universal principles, enshrined in the United Nations\nCharter, are fairly and fully applied. To pursue this goal\nI call upon all countries to support wholeheartedly the\nactivities of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights.\nEvery year hundreds and thousands of innocent\npeople perish as a result of brutal terrorist actions. The\nGeneral Assembly has passed a number of resolutions on\nthe fight against terrorism, and currently no fewer than 11\nanti-terrorism conventions have been adopted. In the light\nof the recent terrorist attacks in Russia, we believe that\nthe fight against terrorism should be pursued with even\ngreater zeal. Terrorism of all kinds should be globally\ncondemned and eradicated. At the same time, however,\nthe fight against terrorism should not serve as a pretext\nfor equally gross violations of human rights, forcible\ndetention and the deportation of tens of thousands of\ninnocent people all over a country without due process,\nsimply because of the colour of their skin or their ethnic\nbackground.\nAllow me to conclude by saying a few words on the\nissue of financing. If the United Nations is to enter the\ntwenty-first century as a serious and effective\nOrganization, we must commit ourselves to economic\nrealities. This means administrative reform, zero budget\n2\n\n\ngrowth and fiscal responsibility, combined with a firm\ncommitment by all countries to pay their share.\nThe gist of Estonia\u2019s message is that the world has\nchanged dramatically in the past half century. Let us adapt\nthe Organization to reflect the realities of today. Let us\nmake the United Nations an Organization that will continue\nto play a vital and prominent role far into the new\nmillennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Under his\nenlightened guidance and leadership, our Organization is\ntoday well prepared to order the twenty-first century.\nI wish to join my voice to those of previous speakers\nin greeting and welcoming the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga, which\nhave just enlarged our United Nations community. Let\nthem share with us the noble ideals that brought us\ntogether and keep us together: the equality of peoples\nunder the law, respect for the sovereignty of every State,\ndemocracy and peace.\nSharing with everyone, our pride in belonging to the\ngreat family of the United Nations, our forum for\nmeeting, discussion, decision-making and solidarity;\nsharing the values that provide the foundations for our\ninternational community; and sharing in the vital\nprogrammes of cooperation carried out synergistically\namong all the different actors and constituents of our\nstructure and system \u2014 these, specifically, are the sources\nof our satisfaction.\nToday, less than 100 days from the new century and\nthe new millennium, we are keenly aware of the\ntimeliness of our discussions. Our fifty-fourth session is\nof particular significance in that it offers all of us the\nopportunity not only to undertake a retrospective\nexamination of the major events of the century, but also\nto seek ways and means to inject renewed dynamism into\nfuture international relations.\nThe commitments we made at the fifty-third session\nof the General Assembly must be implemented as rapidly\nas possible. We can achieve this through concerted efforts\nand our shared determination to succeed. However, to do\nthis, we must proceed urgently to apply the necessary\nmeasures for the restructuring of our Organization.\n5\n\n\nWe reiterate our support for the position of the\nOrganization of African Unity regarding the need to expand\nthe Security Council. The restructuring of that organ must\nbe based on the principles of democracy, transparency and\nequitable geographic distribution. On the question of the\nveto, in our view there is no room for equivocation: either\nit must be extended to all permanent members or it must be\nabolished.\nOur presence and our interactive participation in the\nconcert of nations prompts us to share our thinking on\ncertain subjects that constitute challenges of the highest\npriority at the end of the century, particularly the questions\nof armed conflict, the maintenance of peace, disarmament,\ninternational terrorism, democracy and human rights, and\nhuman and socio-economic development.\nWhile accelerating the integration of our global\nsociety, the end of the era of ideological confrontation has\nbeen conducive to the proliferation of conflicts of a\npolitical, socio-economic, ethnic, cultural or religious\nnature.\nIs there any need to stress that in all these conflict\nsituations the most vulnerable sectors of society \u2014\nespecially children, women and the elderly \u2014 are the first\nvictims. Madagascar therefore shares the general\nsatisfaction with the adoption by the Security Council of\nresolutions 1261 (1999) and 1265 (1999), on the protection\nof civilians in armed conflict.\nThere are some signs of satisfaction and hope: the\nsigning last 4 September of the Sharm el-Sheikh\nMemorandum; the signing in Lom\u00e9 on 7 July 1999 of a\nPeace Agreement for the conflict in Sierra Leone; and the\n10 July 1999 signing of the Ceasefire Agreement between\nthe principal parties to the conflict in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. Nonetheless, we note that,\nunfortunately, many hotbeds of tension remain or are being\ncreated throughout the world. The tragic situations in\nAngola, Somalia, Afghanistan and Kosovo are clear\nexamples of this.\nAs regards East Timor, Madagascar pays tribute to the\ncourageous efforts of the United Nations Mission in East\nTimor during the electoral process. We particularly\nwelcome the recent adoption of Security Council resolution\n1264 (1999), on decisive measures to put an end to the\ncrisis and to ensure strict respect for human rights.\nAs regards Western Sahara, Madagascar endorses the\ninitiative of the United Nations to organize a free, honest\nand impartial referendum, as well as the extension of the\nmandate of the United Nations Mission for the\nReferendum in Western Sahara until 14 December 1999.\nWe in Madagascar have lived in peace, but we have\nalways been aware of the need to preserve the Indian\nOcean as a zone of peace, and thus we are concerned\nabout the situation in the Comoros, our close neighbour.\nWe therefore welcome the opportunity to have hosted, in\nApril this year at Antananarivo, the Comorian inter-island\nconference, under the aegis of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU). We urge the international community to\nmaintain the efforts to implement the Antananarivo accord\nso as to bring about a democratic and unified Comorian\nstate.\nLast year marked the fiftieth anniversary of United\nNations peacekeeping operations. We salute the initiatives\nfor cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU\nand between the European Union, the OAU and\nsubregional organizations such as the Southern African\nDevelopment Community and the Economic Community\nof West African States. Nevertheless, in our view these\nactions should be in keeping with the principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations, such as respect for the\nsovereignty of States, respect for territorial integrity and\nnon-intervention in internal affairs.\nWhile we recognize the usefulness of peacekeeping\noperations, Madagascar considers that disarmament is\ninseparable from any effort to consolidate peace. Indeed,\nthe increasing deadliness of conflicts is connected with\nthe excessive accumulation of light weapons, of which\nthere are now an estimated 500 million. In our view the\nproblem must be resolved upstream, because practically\nall the hotbeds of tension are maintained by the\nproduction and sale of such weapons and illicit trafficking\nin them. As a party to the international conventions on the\nnon-proliferation of weapons and illicit trafficking in\nthem, Madagascar supports the idea of an international\nconference on the illicit arms trade, in all its aspects.\nAs we turn the page on a millennium tarnished by\nwars and conflicts, general disarmament must be a\ncommon and shared objective. In this regard, on 25\nAugust of this year Madagascar associated itself with the\nratification of the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel\nlandmines. Convinced that there can be no security in a\nworld teeming with nuclear, chemical and biological\nweapons, Madagascar welcomes the holding next year of\nthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n6\n\n\nAnother concern of our times is the struggle against\ninternational terrorism, a struggle in which we should be\nsteadfastly united. This is why we wish to we wish to\nsupport the development of a draft international convention\nto block the financing of terrorism. Our active participation\nat the last OAU summit, held in Algiers, in the adoption of\na convention for preventing and fighting terrorism,\ndemonstrates our determination to eradicate this scourge.\nFurthermore, this very day we have signed the International\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.\nAt a time when all the inhabitants of the planet share\nthe desire to live free from the horrors of violence,\ndiscrimination and exclusion, respect for democratic\nprinciples is no longer just a precept; it has become an\nabsolute necessity. We therefore exhort the international\ncommunity to condemn firmly any taking of power by non-\ndemocratic means. As the principal guarantor of universal\nvalues, the United Nations is called upon to take the lead\nin this area.\nAt the threshold of the twenty-first century, working\ntogether to promote human development and human rights\nis an obligation. This year, 1999 \u2014 the International Year\nof Older Persons \u2014 is crucial for the implementation of the\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing, adopted at Vienna\nin 1982. Madagascar therefore welcomes the initiative to\nconvene in 2002 a special session of the General Assembly\ndevoted to the updating of this Plan of Action.\nThe right to development is inseparable from the\neffective exercise of human rights. It must enjoy\ninternational support and solidarity so that development is\nextended to all human beings, not just to a privileged\nminority. For its part, Madagascar has spared no effort to\nstrengthen its institutional capacities. A National Human\nRights Commission and an observer office for human rights\nhave been established. We have also signed agreements\nwith the Office of the High Commissioner for Human\nRights to assist in promoting human rights.\nAware of the revival of transnational traffic in women\nand children as well as of modern forms of slavery,\nMadagascar adopted on 25 January 1999 a law designed to\ncombat paedophilia. Furthermore, we welcome the\nconventions produced under the aegis of the International\nLabour Organization on the employment of children and\nyoung people. Personally, I am happy to have signed the\nletter addressed to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfrom all the female Ministers for Foreign Affairs, a letter\nthat reiterates our unwavering support for the fight against\ntrafficking in human beings, particularly women and\nchildren.\nFrom one year to the next we are beset by the same\nconcerns. We do not wish to call it routine, but our\nagenda nevertheless reveals that we must experience the\nsame concerns time and again. The century is drawing to\nan end without the resolution of two major problems:\npoverty and the increase in social inequality. One billion\npeople live in extreme poverty, while another billion are\nenjoying a life of increasing luxury. Furthermore, a recent\nstudy has shown that at the beginning of the next century\nwe can expect the ratio of income differential between the\nrich and the poor countries to be on the order of 150 to\none.\nOur claims are therefore as legitimate as ever, while\nour efforts at development remain hampered by the\ncontinuing and ever-growing deterioration of the terms of\ntrade, by our strict dependence on external capital, and by\nthe disproportionate concentration of direct foreign\ninvestment in economic sectors to which access is\nrestricted.\nWithout wishing to belittle the advantages of the\ninescapable phenomenon of globalization, our fears\nremain profound in the face of the emergence of a\nunipolar order, which in certain cases promotes\nmarginalization, precariousness and insecurity; reduces\nour Governments\u2019 room to manoeuvre or capacity to act;\nand sometimes even affects our countries\u2019 exercise of\ntheir own sovereignty.\nWe therefore say \u201cno\u201d to selective globalization\nwhen it comes to liberalization, inasmuch as we are being\ncalled on to liberalize our trade, investments and financial\nflows at an accelerated pace, while this impulse to\nliberalize has not been nearly so strong in the case of\nproducts of interest to our countries or in the promotion\nof access to know-how and technologies.\nThe lack of consistency within the new world system\nalso applies to the links between our economic adjustment\nprogrammes and the various social and environmental\nobjectives: the struggle against poverty, the establishment\nof basic social infrastructures, the security safety net and\nthe protection and development of our environmental\nresources.\nWhile in no way calling into question the\ncommitments undertaken to its development partners,\nMadagascar expresses its solidarity with all the\n7\n\n\ndeveloping countries in calling for improved integration\nwithin the world economic system, allowing the promotion\nof regular and socially harmonious growth with a human\nand ecological face.\nThe challenges are numerous and varied. The\nelimination of poverty remains our priority. We continue to\nbelieve that this problem will be resolved only if the pace\nof economic growth is accelerated and maintained. The\ninternational anti-poverty strategy must include concrete\nmeasures to strengthen national efforts in such areas as job\ncreation, improved functioning of markets and social and\npolitical institutions, and the active participation of\nvulnerable groups in development.\nThe problem of external debt is a political question of\nthe highest importance in international economic relations\nand remains a genuine obstacle to the growth of most\ndeveloping countries. Arrangements and accords to date\nhave provided only limited solutions because of conditions\nof eligibility, new conditionalities, selectivity in loan-\nmaking, the excessive length of negotiations and constraints\nconnected to mandatory circulation.\nWe welcome the debt-reduction plan approved recently\nat the G-8 Summit in Cologne, but the slow pace at which\nthe reduction would seem to yield benefits tends to erode\nour hopes. This plan should be interpreted flexibly by the\ninternational financial institutions so that it may benefit all\ndebtors without exception. The African debt warrants\nparticular attention because of these countries\u2019 very limited\ncapacity for repayment. Indicators show that the African\ncan never be repaid. We therefore call simply for its total\ncancellation.\nWe are deeply concerned by the reduction of official\ndevelopment assistance, which today represents less than\none third of the international target agreed more than 20\nyears ago. It is urgent that this trend be reversed. Given the\nimportance of this question, Madagascar is following with\nparticular interest the preparatory work for the international\nmeeting on all aspects of development financing. The\ndiscussion on reforming the international financial\narchitecture is of the greatest interest to us, the objective\nbeing to free additional and foreseeable resources for\ndevelopment and to strengthen the systems that control,\nmonitor and regulate financial flows.\nWith regard to international trade, we support the\nmessage of the Group of 77 addressed to the forthcoming\nmeeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle, as well\nas the Marrakesh Declaration with regard to the preparation\nof the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD X), scheduled for\nBangkok early next year.\nThe question of commodities remains a subject of\nmajor concern to our countries. We therefore support the\nefforts of the relevant international institutions, UNCTAD\nin particular, to find more effective machinery that would\nallow us to increase our export earnings.\nRecognized as a global nature sanctuary because of\nthe wealth of its biodiversity, Madagascar remains deeply\nconcerned by environmental problems. We follow with\ninterest all United Nations activities for sustainable\ndevelopment and renew our appeal for increased support\nfrom our partners in the implementation of our national\nenvironmental programme, currently in phase 2.\nTo meet these challenges, we have two options.\nFirst, we are convinced that the reform targets we are\ncontemplating can be achieved only within the framework\nof revitalized international economic cooperation. This\nwould require a resumption of the North-South dialogue.\nIn this context, major international economic meetings\nshould be guided by a spirit of solidarity and a sense of\nshare responsibility between the various development\npartners. We must therefore advocate a global and\nintegrated approach to replace sectoral schemes, which\nare necessarily inadequate.\nThe second option, which we feel to be a\nprerequisite, requires the strengthening of South-South\ncooperation. In advance even of the process of integration\nwithin the inevitable system of globalization, it is\nnatural \u2014 even imperative \u2014 for the southern countries\nto organize themselves. Our progress in this area, being\ndispersed and isolated, has proved slow. Of course, we\nrecognize that priorities, methods and schedules differ.\nWe must concede, however, that the implementation stage\nof such cooperation now calls for the much greater unity\nand genuine political involvement of member countries.\nIn this manner, we envisage a reorganization of the\nSouth at all levels \u2014 subregional, regional, continental\nand global \u2014 grouping together all developing countries.\nMadagascar is firmly committed to this approach. That is\nwhy, at the subregional and regional levels, we are\nparticipating within the Indian Ocean Commission in the\nimplementation of a regional sustainable development\npolicy, to be endorsed by the forthcoming summit of\nheads of State and Government on 3 December. As a full\nmember of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern\n8\n\n\nAfrica, Madagascar was among the first to decide to apply,\non a reciprocal basis, a tariff reduction of 80 per cent for\nthe products of member States. This tariff preference is a\nprelude to a free-trade zone.\nAt the continental level, we welcome the appeal\nlaunched at the recent fourth Extraordinary Summit of the\nOrganization of African Unity at Sirte for greater economic\nintegration in Africa. Indeed, participants in this conference\nclearly affirmed that greater unity is one way to resist the\nthreat of globalization looming over the continent. Together\nwith all African countries, Madagascar urges the\ninternational community to lend its material and financial\nsupport and to share with our continent its own experiences\nin its achievement of unity.\nAccording to United Nations resolutions, Africa in the\n1990s has been a priority for action against poverty and\ninsecurity. In this regard, I welcome the financial\ncommitment of $150 million, announced three days ago on\n28 September by Mr. James Wolfensohn, President of the\nWest Bank, to its Partnership for African Capacity.\nThe contribution of every Member State to forging a\nnew Africa is an obligation. With this in mind, over the\npast three years Madagascar has built a structure that will\npromote democracy, human rights and multifaceted\ncooperation. An entire field of activity has opened up today,\nmaking our big island a major actor in regional, continental\nand international life.\nThe principle of sharing has been implicit in the\nactivities of our Organization since its Charter was written.\nWhatever reforms it has undergone and will undergo, we\nagree that it is important to preserve among us this noble\nprinciple, a rallying cry for our actions. There is also\nsharing to be done to reduce economic discrepancies which\nhave been growing over the last two decades; sharing to\nremedy the asymmetry of trade, if not actually to redefine\nsuch trade, and to ensure that such progress is immanent;\nand sharing to put an end to the role of war so as to finally\ninitiate the role of peace.\nWe remain convinced that only the United Nations\nwill be a true instigator of the culture of peace, prosperity\nand humanism in this world which must be interdependent.\nWe share the wish for success in the forthcoming great\nmeetings in the year 2000; at Bangkok for the tenth session\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment, at Havana for the South Summit, and here in\nthis very Hall for the Millennium Summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "So it is\nAfrica, through two of its most devoted and eminent sons,\nthat has the particular honour of leading the United Nations\ninto the new millennium. I refer to you, Mr. President, a\nworthy freedom fighter for our sister nation, Namibia; I\nnow salute your well-deserved election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly. I refer also to Mr. Kofi Annan, our\nSecretary-General, to whom the international community is\nindebted for the great perseverance and fervour he has\nshown in his promotion of the purposes and principles of\nthe Charter and in strengthening the role of the United\nNations.\nI am very moved to address this Assembly, because,\nby electing me 25 years ago to the presidency at its twenty-\nninth session, the General Assembly was even then showing\nits esteem for and interest in Africa and its consideration\nfor all of those generations of freedom fighters who, like\nthose of my country, have assumed the historic\nresponsibility of making a decisive contribution to the\nadvent of a better world. Twenty-five years have passed\nduring which the inexorable movement towards freedom\nhas followed its course, toppling the last bastions of\ncolonialism and racial segregation, and enshrining the\nright to sovereign equality of States and the right of\npeoples to development, self-determination and\nindependence.\nAt the same time, a new situation has emerged\nmarked by greater interdependence between nations,\nwhich, as they have gradually become more and more\naware of the unity of their destinies, can no longer afford\nto live in isolation nor remain indifferent or insensitive\nwhen something happens to one of their members.\nI have therefore come to speak about this common\ndestiny, on behalf of Africa and Algeria, at a time when\nour session has chosen the theme of the culture of peace\nand non-violence. Throughout this century, the world has\nconstantly evolved, created, destroyed, reinvented itself\nand moved forward. Despite ideological conflicts and\neconomic crises, political tensions and devastating wars,\nhumanity has made its way inexorably towards one and\nthe same history \u2014 one and the same destiny.\nNew challenges are today confronting the\ninternational community in a context occasioned by the\neasing of ideological struggles, the end of the cold war\nand the creation of a unipolar world, with its inherent\nparadoxes for development.\nOne of these challenges is what is today called\nglobalization: a global economy, a global political system,\neven global values and aspirations \u2014 but also, global\nproblems and dangers. In any case, implementation of\nglobalization is encountering a variety of barriers and\nobstacles. On the economic side, unequal development\nbetween nations certainly does not facilitate the\nestablishment of a universally accepted new world order.\nWorrying gaps are beginning to appear, especially in\nAfrica: a chronic deterioration in the terms of trade; a\ncrushing weight of debt; fratricidal conflicts;\nenvironmental degradation; increasing unemployment;\npersistent epidemics; falling numbers of children in\nschool; declining official development assistance and\nmeagre direct investment. Furthermore, two thirds of the\nleast developed countries and three quarters of the low-\nincome countries are in Africa. In addition, 50 per cent of\nthe continent\u2019s population live in abject poverty.\nThe thirty-fifth Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) Summit showed that Africans were ready to face\n11\n\n\nup to this miserable situation by working for peace, stability\nand cooperation and by entrenching political and economic\nreform more firmly. But it also revealed how insubstantial\nNorth-South cooperation is, showing that it is often limited\nby policies based on vested interests or selective\nintervention.\nThe Summit also pointed out the difficulties inherent\nin the social, cultural and psychological structure of our\ncountries, with many misunderstandings resulting from the\nmechanical application of criteria adopted in developed\ncountries not only in the economic but also in the political\nand cultural areas.\nThe problems which have still to be solved are\ntherefore numerous, and the international community sees\nthem every day in Africa, Asia, the Balkans and the Middle\nEast. To these problems must be added the global\ncontroversy between the champions of an optimistic\nuniversality that easily tolerates the advent of and\nadjustment to a unipolar world, and those who retain a\nsense of their own identity and consider, rightly, that the\ninterests of mankind lie in constructing a multipolar world.\nThese problems do not, however, mean that all hopes\nfor harmonious globalization are purely utopian: they\nmerely represent obstacles to an evolution which we know\nis unavoidable. What would be an illusion, however, would\nbe globalization of the impossible, globalization that ignores\nthe legitimate interests of humankind as a whole, because\nsooner or later that would be doomed to failure. The\nglobalization of problems is a fact of life; that is why it is\nimperative for us to find global solutions.\nIt cannot be overemphasized how discouraging it is to\nsee such a constantly widening gap between rich and poor\nand between rich countries and Third World countries that\nare stifled by debt. I certainly do not intend to complain to\nthe Assembly about the many upheavals of a \u201cThird\nWorldism\u201d whose approach and methods are at least 20\nyears old and have become obsolete. The world is no\nlonger as it was in the 1970s; it has changed radically. It\nseems to me, however, that this movement towards\npluralism and the market economy should be continued and\nencouraged, and that it should be accompanied by a\nmovement towards solidarity. In fact, I believe that the\nlogic of power and confrontation that has marked the\ntwentieth century should give way to a logic of solidarity\nthat will make international relations more humane, based\non fair exchange and shared prosperity.\nThe progress of nations would be incomplete if we\nrestricted ourselves to seeking it solely through the\nmarket. We must also continue to seek it simply by\npromoting the most basic human rights. In sharing the\nidea of human rights, it must be made clear that the\ndefinition and observance of human rights must take into\naccount the context of each of our States, with their\ndiffering traditions, social structures and priorities. For us,\nhuman rights are balanced by the duties of the citizen and\ngoverned by inescapable priorities. Apart from the\nstruggle against poverty, disease and illiteracy \u2014 ensuring\nthat every human being has the right to a decent and\ndignified life \u2014 is it not true that human rights also mean\nthe protection of society from terrorism, drug traffickers\nand purveyors of death of every kind? In this respect,\nthere are no discrepancies between our concerns and those\nof the developed world on the issue of democracy and\nhuman rights. Nevertheless, it remains true that these are\nissues of utmost importance and highest priority.\nThis is why we believe that the idea of the progress\nof the human race, and its emergence into the twenty-first\ncentury through the adoption of the laws of the free\nmarket, freedom of investment and other freedoms, cannot\nbe separated from its progress through development aid\nand solidarity with Third World countries. In other words,\nour interest should be focused on the renewal of\ninternational action within the United Nations system so\nas to adapt it to the new world contexts, to help it\nrespond to the legitimate expectations of the great\nmajority of nations and to bring about renewed progress\ntowards peace, stability, equity and shared prosperity.\nI come from a continent where people need to have\nfaith in justice, because they believe that the countries\nwhich exploited their resources to ensure their own\ndevelopment have a heavy debt to repay. They need to\nbelieve that, having given so much to building human\ncivilization in the modern era, they have the right to\ndemand that their dignity and their humanity should be\nfully respected. I seek also to remind this Assembly that,\nby letting poverty proliferate in a world which is\nbecoming increasingly interdependent, the rich countries\nand the community of nations are paving the way for\ndisruptions in national life and for international relations\nthat will be increasingly susceptible to threats of violence,\nconflict and discord, which are harmful to democracy and\nto economic activity.\nI also wish to recall that the failure of the Third\nWorld, and of Africa in particular, to make itself heard \u2014\na failure reflected in the results of the Uruguay Round \u2014\n12\n\n\ndoes not augur well for solutions to all the problems that I\nhave mentioned. Does our degeneration mean that we are\nirrevocably doomed to decline, and that the poverty of the\nmajority is irremediably bound to dominate the coming\ncentury? I prefer not to believe that that is the case; I prefer\nto believe rather that recovery is possible so long as\nconcerted and sustained action is taken in parallel with\naction by the United Nations.\nSuch action must have two tiers. The first tier lies\nwith the industrialized countries because the solution to the\nThird World\u2019s problems is in their hands, as the Managing\nDirector of the International Monetary Fund rightly stated\nover ten years ago: they have sufficient economic, financial\nand legislative leverage to initiate reform and to restore an\nenvironment conducive to growth for the developing\ncountries.\nThe second tier lies with the developing countries\nthemselves, which must take on the essential task of\nbecoming self-reliant by organizing their entry into the\nworld economy and by following through with economic\nand political reforms. Unfortunately, they have no other\nchoice.\nIt is against this background that Africans met last\nJuly in Algiers, where the thirty-fifth Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Summit was held. During this\nmeeting, which enjoyed a record number of participants,\nAfricans took stock of their achievements since\nindependence, weighed up current reforms in the light of\nexternal forces and internal realities and laid down the\nfoundations of a new approach to and a new vision of the\nfuture of the continent. Priority was given to concord and\npeace in Africa. Africa is determined to speed up the\nsettlement of the conflicts between Eritrea and Ethiopia and\nin the Great Lakes region, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and Sierra Leone. Activities within OAU and the\nsubregional organizations have been intensified towards\nrestoring peace and putting an end to the suffering of the\nrefugees.\nSimilarly, Africa has unequivocally stated that it\nsupports international legality, democracy and respect for\nlaw, and accordingly it has set out the guidelines for the\nOAU position on the situations in Angola and in Western\nSahara. It fully supports the United Nations initiatives there,\nas it does the OAU good offices in the Comoros, where it\nhopes that the Comoran people will proceed with\ndemocratic elections for their institutions so as to preserve\nthe country\u2019s unity and territorial integrity.\nA concern for peace and concord also underlies\nAfrica\u2019s assessment of the Middle East peace process,\nwhich it hopes will come to a comprehensive, fair and\nlasting solution based on withdrawal by Israel from the\nterritories unjustly occupied by it and on its recognition\nof the Palestinian people\u2019s legitimate and inalienable\nrights.\nOAU is similarly concerned about peace and security\nin the Gulf, where economic sanctions that are disastrous\nfor the affected populations should be lifted, as should\nthose unjustly imposed against Libya and Sudan even\nthough their Governments have fully cooperated with the\nrelevant investigations.\nThe human race must enter the new millennium free\nof the disputes born of the historical vicissitudes of the\ntormented and tragic century now drawing to its close. In\nthis context, hotbeds of tension and crises must be\neliminated. The suffering of peoples who are still unable\nto exercise their right to self-determination and\nindependence must end. The embargo imposed on the\nIraqi people must be resolved in a less harmful way, as\nour Secretary-General of OAU would say, in keeping\nwith United Nations resolutions. Terrorism, organized\ncrime, drug and arms trafficking \u2014 which undermine\nrelations between States and weaken peaceful and fruitful\ninternational cooperation \u2014 must be a top priority. New,\nethical international relations should also be prioritized in\norder to usher in a new era of peace and common\nprosperity.\nThe Algiers Summit, however, did not restrict itself\nto expressing, clearly, Africa\u2019s desire to bring to an end\nthe tragic phase of conflicts which are tearing it apart,\nand to go along, step by step, with the efforts of the\ninternational community to institute a just and long-lasting\npeace everywhere in the world. The Summit also studied\neconomic and development issues within the framework\nof the Abuja Treaty, consolidating macroeconomic\nreforms through the revival of sustained growth and\nthrough regional integration within the framework of\nAfrican unity, the principle of which has just been\nenshrined by the Sirte special Summit.\nThe Sirte Summit reaffirmed OAU solidarity with\nand support for fraternal Libya concerning the need for a\nfinal lifting of the unfair embargo imposed upon it. It\ndecided also to establish new rules and norms to facilitate\nthe development of operational structures and modalities\nfor OAU with a view to achieving effective union\nbetween the countries of Africa. Such a union will\n13\n\n\nguarantee Africa\u2019s security and strengthen cooperation\nbetween its peoples, which will gain Africa the respect and\nstatus it deserves in the light of the heavy cost it has paid\nthroughout history in sacrifice, slavery, exploitation and\ndespoliation during the colonial era. Such a union will also\npromote Africa\u2019s material and human potential and all that\nmakes it so different from the rest of the world. In short,\nthe Sirte Summit has reaffirmed in full the right of Africa\nto be an active part of the globalization process. As a\nresult, justice will be equal for all, and the new concepts\nintroduced by globalization will be immunized against any\nform of injustice, abuse or exclusion.\nThe Summit also affirmed the necessity of advancing\nnew reforms in the context of cooperation and partnership\nbetween the United Nations and OAU in all fields. Lastly,\nthe Summit proposed a new ethics for international\nrelations, where the requirements of production and\ncompetition should obscure neither the higher interest of\nhumanity \u2014 whose very existence is under threat from all\nkinds of environmental degradation and other scourges\naffecting the natural world, humankind and human values\nand institutions \u2014 nor the rights of nation States to their\nintegrity and sovereignty.\nWe do not deny the right of northern-hemisphere\npublic opinion to denounce the breaches of human rights\nwhere they exist. Nor do we deny that the United Nations\nhas the right and the duty to help suffering humanity. But\nwe remain extremely sensitive to any undermining of our\nsovereignty not only because sovereignty is our final\ndefence against the rules of an unjust world, but because\nwe have no active part in the decision-making process in\nthe Security Council nor in monitoring the implementation\nof decisions.\nFurthermore, inasmuch as the sovereign state remains\nbeyond dispute a place of social contract and the context\nwithin which human rights should be organized \u2014 political\nrights, as well as economic and social ones \u2014 the\ninternational community should favour stability as well as\nconcord and the culture of democracy for our developing\ncountries. But all this will remain a dream so long as the\nreal issues at stake, those of economic and social\ndevelopment, have not been clearly set out, because, for\nAfrica as for other continents, these issues are the crux of\nthe matter.\nThe debate on the concept of interference in internal\naffairs consequently seems far from over, as at least three\nquestions require exact answers: first, where does aid stop\nand interference begin? Second, where are the lines to be\ndrawn between the humanitarian, the political and the\neconomic? Third, is interference valid only in weak or\nweakened States or for all States without distinction? In\nany event, we firmly believe that interference in internal\naffairs may take place only with the consent of the State\nin question. We firmly believe that the countries of the\nSouth are capable of overcoming their difficulties, so long\nas solidarity, loyal assistance and the concern of the\ndeveloped countries and the international community do\nnot fail them.\nAlgeria has paid a very heavy price for democracy,\nand like other African countries must shoulder the high\nsocial cost of the reforms which it is undertaking. It has\nembarked upon a vast project of national renewal. It is\nworking hard to ensure civil concord, enhance democracy,\nestablish the rule of law and renew and modernize its\njudicial system and administration. In short, we are\nworking to create conditions for the best possible use of\nthe country\u2019s economic potential and for individual and\ncollective well-being in a society where peace has been\nrestored and where free enterprise, justice and dignity are\nguaranteed for all.\nThis is an enormous undertaking, but a necessary\none after a decade of ordeals in what was a war in\neverything but name \u2014 a war that was inflicted on us,\nand which allowed terrorism and extremism to do\nviolence against society, values, dignity and people\u2019s\nconsciences. My country is re-emerging, slowly, from\nthese tragic events, which were foreign to Islam. Many\nthings have been said in various forums about this ordeal\nwhich engulfed my country \u2014 most often, alas, by people\nwho are hostile to or who have only a superficial\nknowledge of Algerian society and its problems. I will\nrefrain here from condemning anyone\u2019s opinions, but I do\nbelieve that when a people has been exposed to a tragedy\nlike the one in Algeria, for a whole decade, and has faced\nup to it with the courage and tenacity which the Algerian\npeople have shown, then that people should at the least\nhave the right to use its own Republic\u2019s institutions to\ndefend itself.\nYes, my country has been wounded \u2014 the very\nflesh of its children has been wounded. Tens of thousands\nof them are dead \u2014 some victims of fanaticism, some\nvictims of others\u2019 madness. In general terms, people have\nbeen victimized by the general confusion that nearly\nbrought the Republic to its knees, hence Algeria\u2019s\noverwhelming desire to defend its existence.\n14\n\n\nIn this context of passions unleashed, disorder, the\ninstinct for murder, the marginalization of society,\ndevastating nihilism and blood and tears, men, women and\nchildren have lived through untold suffering and the\ncountry\u2019s infrastructure has been flagrantly and blindly\ndestroyed, with extremely negative effects on our economy.\nToday the Algerian people are licking their wounds.\nThe main thrust of our national recovery is civil concord;\nthis shows the innate magnanimity of our people and our\nunshakeable commitment to the lofty values of tolerance\nwhich characterize true Islam. Today, the Algerian people\nare rejecting violence because it is not part of our tradition.\nThey are committed to pivotal human rights, as they were\nduring their struggle for independence and during the\nbuilding of their country. They proved this in the\nreferendum of 16 September by saying a resounding \\\"yes\\\"\nto the law on civil concord adopted by the Parliament in\nJuly. They proved this also by opening their hearts and\nextending the hand of generosity to those who had defied\nsociety and the laws of the Republic. They are proving it\nthrough their reliance on the law, itself increasingly inspired\nby the lofty ideals of the State of law and which, without\nbeing repressive, may not be broken by anyone, including\nthe State. They have proved it because, true to their own\nselves, they know that peace and solidarity alone are the\nkeys to economic and social progress.\nThe principles which we are recommending in\ninternational relations we are also resolutely endeavouring\nto implement at home, on a national level. With the\nrestoration of peace, we shall consolidate all freedoms. We\nwill irreversibly establish a culture of democracy and\npluralism. We are currently committed to eliminating all\nbureaucratic obstacles to free economic activity throughout\nthe country, endeavouring in this way to establish the rules\nof social liberalism and the market economy.\nOn a regional level, we are pursuing negotiations with\nthe European Union on an association agreement and on the\nBarcelona process. We shall spare no effort in relaunching\nthe project to construct an Arab Maghreb Union on the\nbasis of renewed inspiration, rational action and realistic\naims established in such a way as to ensure a viable,\nreliable and long-lasting institution. Like other countries,\nAlgeria will pursue its negotiations to become a member of\nthe World Trade Organization. On an African level, it will\nwork unceasingly towards the advancement of the economic\nintegration agreements reached within the framework of the\nOrganization of African Unity; to settle the conflicts that\nare tearing the continent apart; and to promote long-lasting\npeace, which is favourable to sustained development.\nIn short, Algeria believes that in order to contribute\nin a useful manner to the future of the world, the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts, international stability, solidarity\nbetween nations and equity in international relations,\nAlgeria must adapt to the economic and political realities\nof this world, modernize, reinforce and liberalize the\ngeneral framework within which its economy operates,\nencourage private investment and ensure equal\nopportunity for all its citizens while ensuring their human\ndevelopment. This comprehensive and coherent action\nwill be taken by my country in order to adapt to the way\nthe world is now, so that it can succeed and so that it can\ngain its rightful place among the nations of the world, a\nplace we first won thanks to our tradition of support for\nthe ideals of this Organization.\nAlgeria is slowly but surely beginning to get back on\nits feet. It has entered a period of convalescence. It has\ndone so thanks to its people\u2019s potential, vitality and\nenergy and, thanks also to the solidarity shown by many\nsister nations and friends throughout the world. From this\nrostrum let me express the Algerian people\u2019s deep\ngratitude for and recognition of that solidarity.\nWe are at the end of one century and on the\nthreshold of the next. We are at the end of one\nmillennium and on the threshold of another. I share to\nsome extent the belief that these milestones of our era do\nhave an impact on the life and evolution of the human\nrace.\nThe twentieth century has had its moments of glory,\nnotably in bringing colonialism to an end, in combating\nracism and in eliminating apartheid. But it has also had\nits setbacks and failures, manifested in persistent\nunderdevelopment, in the not always successful struggle\nto eliminate poverty and in the never-ending quest for\nbetter concord between peoples.\nWill we draw enough inspiration from these\nmilestones to turn around mindsets that still rigidly abide\nby outdated concepts of international life? Will we be\nable to hold out a fraternal hand to each other so that\nwell-being can be better shared out in the world? Will we\nbe capable of preparing a world for future generations\nthat is better than the one in which we live? We can\nanswer all these questions with a \u201cyes\u201d, and it is with\nthese optimistic words of hope that I conclude my\nstatement."

        "file_text": "At the outset, please allow me to express, on\nbehalf of the delegation of the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea, our pleasure on congratulating you,\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We believe that your\ndiplomatic skill and rich experience will greatly contribute\nto our work at this session.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to extend my\ngratitude to Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of the Republic of Uruguay, for his tangible\ncontribution to United Nations activities during his tenure\nof his office as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session. I also express appreciation for the\nefforts of the Secretary-General towards strengthening the\nfunctions and the role of the United Nations.\nThe current session, which is being held at the\nhistoric turn of the century, has an important mission to\ngive new hope to humankind. The challenges and the\ndifficulties facing international society are growing ever\nmore complex and intricate. The cold war has ended but\ndomination and hegemony continue to exist. High-\nhandedness and arbitrariness continue to pose major\nthreats to international peace and security. Because of the\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness, so prevalent in\ninternational relations, the principles of justice and\nfairness are often disregarded and the principle of\nsovereign equality \u2014 a lifeline to United Nations\nactivities \u2014 is shaken to its very foundation.\nMoreover, we have recently seen grave situations\nwhereby the internal affairs of sovereign States are\ninterfered in by force. Today international society must\nchoose one of the two following options: whether the\ntwenty-first century will be a century of independence,\nequality and peace, or whether it will be a century of\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness. If we choose the latter,\nall countries with weak national defence capabilities will\nbe vulnerable to bombing, as was the case in Yugoslavia.\nAs we are all well aware, the Korean peninsula\nstands at the centre of international peace and security.\nTherefore, as a party directly concerned, I wish to take\nthis opportunity to present the details of views and\npositions regarding the present situation there. This will,\n6\n\n\nwe believe, be a most effective contribution to the work of\nthe current session.\nAt present, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nis being blatantly portrayed as a dangerous area of nuclear\nweapons proliferation and a source of missile threats. For\nexample, an empty tunnel is suspected of being an\nunderground nuclear facility and a satellite is labelled a\nballistic missile. These are now being used as pretexts for\nreviving a \u201cstar wars\u201d plan, a phantom of the cold war, in\na variant named \u201cthe missile defence system\u201d. Meanwhile,\nthe attempts of a defeated State to rearm and to re-emerge\nas a military power are being accelerated at the fastest\npossible speed and even a debate calling for nuclear\narmaments has come to the fore.\nPursuant to operation plan 502798, aimed at\npreemptive attacks against the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea, large-scale strike forces have been\nsurreptitiously amassed in and around South Korea. They\nare entering into actual combat readiness through various\njoint military exercises. It is becoming almost a reality, not\nsimply an assumption, that the Korean peninsula will\nbecome a second Balkans. In the Balkan region, a\nhumanitarian crisis served as a pretext for war, whereas on\nthe Korean peninsula, the so-called missile issue is likely to\nbe used instead.\nOur satellite launch is an exercise of equal rights in\nthe use of outer space that is recognized by the United\nNations. Strengthening our national defence capabilities is\nan exercise of our sovereign right of legitimate defence: it\ndoes not constitute a violation of any obligations the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea has under existing\ninternational treaties. Nevertheless, the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea has become a target of United States\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness. The reason is very clear:\nplacing the entire Korean peninsula under its control is a\ntop priority of the Asia strategy of the United States. As\nYugoslavia becomes an impediment to United States\ndomination over the Balkan area, so the adherence of the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea to socialism is\nconsidered an obstacle to its Asia strategy.\nMuch the same can be said about why Japan is so\nhysterically resorting to a campaign against the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea. Japan has not liquidated its\npast crimes against the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea, alone amongst countries. Japan is miscalculating\nthat, if the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were\nstifled, the issue of liquidating its past crimes would fade\naway by itself. Not only that, Japan is fabricating threats,\none after the other, as an excuse to become a military\nPower.\nOur people love peace and aspire to it even more\nthan others: they lived for the first half of this century\nunder the colonial rule of Japan and they have been living\nfor the second in a state of belligerence with the United\nStates. Nevertheless, we do not beg for peace: we want a\npeace in which we can enjoy an independent life, not the\npeace of slaves denied all freedom.\nSovereignty is the lifeline of the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea and socialism is the life of our people.\nIt is the unshakeable will of our people, and State policy\nof the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to defend,\nconsolidate and develop to the utmost our own style of\nsocialism, chosen by the people themselves. This is an\nexercise of the right to self-determination and freedom of\nchoice recognized by the United Nations. The present-day\nconfrontation on the Korean peninsula is in essence a\nconfrontation between those who are masters of their own\ncountry trying to defend all that is theirs and the foreign\nforces attempting to harm them. This is the main factor\nunderlying the continuing instability on the Korean\npeninsula.\nHerein also lies the answer to the question of who is\nposing a threat to whom. It is not easy for our people,\nwhose territory and population are small and who still\nlack almost everything, to defend their sovereignty single-\nhandedly in the face of the collective, hostile power\npolitics of the United States and its forces of\nsubordination. We have no alternative but to strengthen\nour national defence capability ourselves, although this\nmeans we must tighten our belts. Because of our lack of\ncapacity, Comrade Kim Jong Il, the great leader of our\npeople, is employing an \u201carmy first\u201d policy. This policy\nis our own unique way of uniting the whole people with\nthe army into a bulwark, thus enabling us both to defend\nthe country and develop its economy. Despite the\npersistent political, military and economic moves of\nhostile forces to suffocate us, up until now we have\nsucceeded in defending our sovereignty and preventing\nanother war on the Korean peninsula. This proves the\nstrength of the \u201carmy first\u201d policy, for defending\nsocialism and ensuring peace with weapons.\nThe way to ensure lasting peace and security on the\nKorean peninsula is to end the hostile relations between\nthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the\nUnited States and reunify Korea. The Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea and the United States are still in a\n7\n\n\nstate of temporary armistice. Easing tension on the Korean\npeninsula and eliminating the danger of war will be\npossible when the United States discards, among other\nthings, its hostile policy against the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea and concludes a peace agreement with\nit. There is no convincing reason why the United States\nmust continue to antagonize the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea alone in north-east Asia, almost 10 years\nafter the end of the cold war. We do not want war, but we\ndo strive to achieve the peaceful reunification of our\ncountry.\nWe have already made it clear that we would not\nregard the United States as a permanent enemy. We have\nalso fully shown our good faith through our sincere\nimplementation over the last five years of the Agreed\nFramework between the United States and the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea. We have also made it clear\nthat, while we will make continued efforts to catch up with\nneighbouring countries in the field of peaceful space\nactivities, we are ready for discussions on the missile issue\nat any time, if hostile nations are sincere in their intentions\nto dispel our concern. Now it is the turn of the United\nStates to prove its good faith to us with deeds, if it does not\nharbour ill intent towards the Democratic People's Republic\nof Korea. It is fortunate that the United States has recently\ndecided on a partial lifting of economic sanctions against\nthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but we look\nforward to a comprehensive and genuine lifting of them all.\nIf the United States stops pursuing its hostile policy\ntowards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and\nmoves towards improved relations, we also will respond\nwith good faith. For the present, we are to have high-level\ntalks towards a settlement of outstanding issues between the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and the United\nStates. These are to be held in response to the request from\nthe United States, and missile launches will be suspended\nwhile the talks are under way.\nThe United States should not attempt to test the\nstrength of our military capability or frighten and subdue\nour people with military threats and provocations. Reckless\nacts such as these will surely result in a strong self-defence\nresponse with possibly catastrophic consequences.\nThe United Nations should fulfil its responsibility for\nensuring peace on the Korean peninsula by implementing,\nas early as possible, General Assembly resolution 3390\n(XXX) B, calling for dissolution of the United Nations\nCommand.\nThe early achievement of national reunification is\nthe long-cherished desire of our nation. At the same time,\nit is a prerequisite for ensuring durable peace and security\non the Korean peninsula. As long as Korea remains\ndivided, the situation on the Korean peninsula and its\nsurrounding areas will never be stable. This is detrimental\nto peace in Asia and also in the rest of the world.\nWe have already established national reunification\nprinciples. The three principles of independence, peaceful\nreunification and great national unity, which the North\nand South of Korea confirmed and made public at home\nand abroad, in the 4 July joint statement, constitute the\ngrand reunification programme. They form the\ncornerstone of national reunification, which the United\nNations officially welcomed in the resolution adopted at\nthe twentieth session of the General Assembly.\nThe most above board and reasonable way to\nachieve reunification is the confederal formula, by which\nthe North and South of Korea would be able to realize\nnational reunification fairly and smoothly on the basis of\npreserving each other's ideas and systems as they are.\nAny attempts by one side to change the other, to make\nclaims about the \u201csunshine policy\u201d and engagement, while\nignoring the reality that two different ideas and systems\nare existing in the North and South, will only mean\nconfrontations and conflict.\nIn order to eliminate confrontations between the\nNorth and the South, and to promote national\nreconciliation and unity, the South Korean authorities\nshould abolish, inter alia, the national security law, which\nhas identified fellow countrymen as the enemy. The fact\nthat delegates of patriotic organizations for reunification\nin South Korea who visited Pyongyang last August were\nimprisoned, because of their participation in the grand\nreunification festival, shows a clear picture of anti-\nreunification acts and human rights violations by South\nKorean authorities wielding the national security law. The\nSouth Korean authorities are now talking about\nreconciliation and cooperation with the North. But behind\nthe scenes, they are criminalizing contacts and exchanges\namong the people and other personages of the North and\nSouth of Korea and are suppressing patriotic reunification\nforces by invoking the national security law.\nTherefore, as long as the national security law and\nanti-national and anti-reunification law remains in place,\nit is impossible to achieve national reconciliation and\nunity and realize contacts and exchanges between the\nNorth and South of Korea. Only when the South Korean\n8\n\n\nauthorities take an attitude of national independence and\npatriotism, instead of depending upon foreign forces and\ncollaborating with them, will North-South relations become\ncharacterized by trust and reconciliation and will a decisive\nbreakthrough be opened for reunification.\nOn 18 April of last year, the respected General Kim\nJong Il put forward the five point policy of great national\nunity to hasten the independent and peaceful reunification\nof the country. That policy is, first, to base oneself on the\nprinciple of national reunification; secondly, to unite the\nwhole nation under the banners of patriotism and national\nreunification; thirdly, to improve North-South relations;\nfourthly, to struggle against alien domination and anti-\nreunification forces; and fifthly, to develop exchanges,\ncontacts and dialogues and to strengthen solidarity and\ncoalition throughout the entire nation.\nGreat unity of the whole nation would be national\nreunification. Even though there are still numerous\ndifficulties and obstacles in the way of national\nreunification, we are optimistic about its prospects. Our\nnation is one, and so is our motherland. Under the banner\nof national reunification, our nation will achieve great\nnational unity without fail.\nThe twenty-first century should be a century of\nindependence, in which \u201cdominationism\u201d and high-\nhandedness are eliminated and the sovereignty of all States\nis equally respected. In order to bring about a new century\nof independence and of durable peace, a just international\norder that never tolerates high-handedness and arbitrariness\nshould be established.\nTo this end, the principle of respect for sovereignty\nshould be strictly adhered to as the supreme principle in\ninternational relations. The assertion that disarmament,\nhuman rights and humanitarian issues should be placed\nabove sovereignty should be firmly denounced as a\ndangerous attempt to justify both high-handedness and\narbitrariness. Disputes cannot be properly settled by high-\nhanded and arbitrary measures, such as sanctions and the\nuse of force. They should be resolved through dialogue and\nnegotiation on all accounts.\nCountries of Africa and the Middle East that are\ninsisting they should be responsible for resolving their\nissues through dialogue and negotiations are enjoying the\nsupport of the international community. What is important\nin establishing a just international order is to ensure fairness\nin the formulation and application of international treaties\nrelating to disarmament, human rights and so forth. In\nparticular, the double standard of abusing international\nlaw as a pretext for interference in the internal affairs of\nsovereign States and the use of force against sovereign\nStates should be strictly rejected.\nIn order for the United Nations to fulfil its\nresponsibilities and its role in accordance with the\nCharter, democracy should be practised in United Nations\nactivities. Without enhancing the authority of the General\nAssembly, and without an early restructuring of the\nSecurity Council, the United Nations will be unable to\nmeet the demands of a rapidly changing situation and to\ncope with new challenges. The authority of the General\nAssembly, where all Member States are represented and\ninteract democratically on an equal footing, should be\nenhanced.\nIf the General Assembly is empowered to deliberate\non crucial issues, such as ensuring international peace and\nsecurity, and finally examines important Security Council\nresolutions concerning sanctions and the use of force, this\nwill be conducive to ensuring fairness in United Nations\nactivities and preventing arbitrariness by individual\ncountries. The Security Council should be reformed in\nsuch a way as to have all regions equally represented in\nits composition and to ensure full transparency in all of\nits activities.\nIn this regard, we oppose under any circumstances\nthe permanent membership of a defeated nation that has\nnot liquidated its past crimes. We are of the view that the\nproposal put forward by member countries of the Non-\nAligned Movement to first increase non-permanent seats,\nwhich is relatively easy to agree upon at this stage,\ndeserves sincere consideration. Since the Security Council\nis taking its actions on behalf of the general United\nNations membership, its working methods and,\nparticularly, decision-making processes should be made\nmore transparent for all of the Member States.\nThe Government of the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea will continue to maintain\nindependence, peace and friendship as the fundamental\nideals of its foreign policy.\nWe are convinced that attaching importance to\nindependence, peace and friendship in international\nrelations conforms with the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations and makes a contribution to peace and\nsecurity on the Korean peninsula, in Asia and in the rest\nof the world.\n9\n\n\nIn conclusion, I assure the Assembly that the\ndelegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nwill make sincere efforts for the success of the current\nsession and will extend its active cooperation to the work\nof the presidency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first to\nextend to our President's distinguished predecessor, His\nExcellency Didier Opertti, Foreign Minister of Uruguay,\nPresident of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly,\nour gratitude for the excellent manner in which he\nconducted the work of the previous session.\nAllow me also to offer to the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga the\ncongratulations and warmest good wishes of the\nGovernment and the people of Sri Lanka on their election\nto membership of the General Assembly of the United\nNations. We welcome them and assure them of our\nunstinted support as they take up their places in the\nAssembly of nations.\nOur President's well-deserved election to the chair of\nthis historic final session of the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations for the twentieth century gives us great\npleasure. Many of us, Foreign Ministers, have known him\nwell over the years. We have worked with him, and we\nhave greatly admired the energy and dedication that he has\nbrought to the performance of his duties as the Permanent\nRepresentative of his country. The developing countries in\nparticular have cause to remember with gratitude the role\nhe has played in the deliberations of the Non-Aligned\nMovement and the G-77. He brings to his office wide\nexperience of the systems and practices of the United\nNations. He also brings to his office a high degree of\nsensitivity to the important issues of the day.\nI noticed with keen interest that in his opening\nstatement to the Assembly the President referred in\nconsiderable detail to the problem of child soldiers. This\nreference was particularly heartening to me as I had, on the\nbasis of the Graca Machel report, first brought the issue of\nchild soldiers to the attention of the Assembly in the course\nof my address in 1997. In Sri Lanka a rebel group has for\nseveral years been conscripting children, even as young as\n10, for battle. Even worse, it has been making children,\ngirls and boys, into suicide bombers, thus creating a\nhorrible new phenomenon of depravity and cruelty that the\nworld has never seen before. If the conscience of the world\nis not outraged by the tragic fate of these children in my\ncountry, then nothing will move us to action in defence of\nthe young and the helpless anywhere. In his opening\naddress to the General Assembly, the President referred\nto the boast of the \u201csoulless recruiters\u201d that children\n\u201care numerous and readily available, more malleable\nand impressionable, learn quickly, are small and\nagile, and quite simply require less food and\nsupplies than adults\u201d.\nHe described their fate as \u201chorrendous\u201d and said that in\nhis view it\n\u201cdemands that the United Nations show renewed\ncommitment and redouble its efforts as the\nrepository of humanity's conscience and social\njustice in the world.\u201d (A/54/PV.1)\nThe President referred to the work being done by inter-\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations to save\nchildren, and exhorted them to\n\u201ccontinue to blame and shame Governments for not\ndoing enough to protect our children's lives and their\nfuture.\u201d (ibid)\nBut in some countries Governments are completely\nblameless. In Sri Lanka no Government, either before\nindependence 50 years ago or after, has ever recruited\nchildren under 18 years of age into the armed forces. In\nmy country it is only the Liberation Tigers of Tamil\nEelam (LTTE) that resorts to this abominable practice.\nThese rebel groups are beyond the pale of the law. They\nacknowledge no international conventions. They are not\nanswerable to any international body. And yet they must\nbe brought to book. Some of them, the LTTE included,\noperate with impunity in certain countries, wearing the\ninnocent garb of charitable, religious or social\norganizations. They collect money for ostensibly anodyne\npurposes. But in fact the money goes to buy weapons for\nwar. And, in truth, host Governments which provide\nshelter to these organizations under the umbrella of liberal\nlaws of asylum and immigration know, or could easily\nfind out, that those moneys are going to fuel the very war\ninto which young children are being dragooned. These\nGovernments adopt as their explanation for inaction the\nimpeccable excuse that they do not have laws under\nwhich fund-raising for terrorist purposes can be punished.\nThis is true, but it will soon cease to be true when the\nconvention for the suppression of the financing of\nterrorism is adopted \u2014 we hope and pray \u2014 at this fifty-\nfourth session of the General Assembly, requiring all\nsignatory States to enact domestic legislation in keeping\nwith the provisions of the convention.\n25\n\n\nThe Secretary-General in his report (S/1999/957) to\nthe Security Council on the protection of civilians in armed\nconflict has recommended that the Security Council urge\nMember States to support the proposal to raise the\nminimum age for recruitment and participation in hostilities\nto 18, and demand that non-State actors involved in conflict\nnot use children below the age of 18 in hostilities, or face\nthe imposition of targeted sanctions if they do not comply.\nOne of the most effective sanctions would be the\nproscription of such organizations in countries where they\npresently collect money without let or hindrance, or their\nbeing named terrorist organizations, as by the United States\nof America, for instance, and the consequent illegalization\nof their activities.\nSince 1997 there has been considerable progress on\nthe question of child soldiers. The issue is now on centre\nstage. Regional conferences have been held, and a world\nconference is to be held next year. The office of the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary General for Children and\nArmed Conflict is operational. A growing number of\ncountries refer to this issue in the General Assembly and at\nother forums. Most recently the Foreign Ministers of the\nNordic Countries roundly condemned the practice and\npledged their support for its eradication. The Security\nCouncil has unanimously adopted its first-ever resolution on\nthe plight of children. The first decade of the next\nmillennium has been designated the International Decade\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children\nof the World. And the President stated that he would make\nit his business to add his \u201cvoice and devotion to\u201d the\n\u201claudable efforts to make the twenty-first century one\nof love and security for every child in the world.\u201d\n(ibid)\nIn Sri Lanka we have decided to set up a rehabilitation\ncentre for the children who desert the rebel army. The task\nof restoring them to health and normalcy is a daunting one.\nIt is a task for which we can certainly use all the help we\ncan get from those who have experience in that field.\nMy plea to the General Assembly today, two years\nafter I first brought up the question of child soldiers, is that\nwe must proceed with the utmost dispatch to rescue these\nchildren from their fate. They are already scarred; if we do\nnot act quickly they will be scarred beyond redemption.\nWe leave the twentieth century with many spectacular\nachievements behind us. But let us make no mistake \u2014 we\nmove into the twenty-first century carrying with us old,\nintractable problems that have been with us since the dawn\nof time. As the present century draws to a close, new\nproblems of unparalleled menace and danger have\nemerged. They will undoubtedly occupy our attention well\ninto the next century.\nPoverty, illiteracy, ill-health, hunger, unemployment,\nuncontrolled urbanization, the growth of mega cities \u2014\nthese are old problems which deeply affect over half of\nhumanity.\nWe have not addressed these problems with\nsufficient vigour over the past decades. While the United\nNations systems were set up to tackle these problems, the\ncapacity of the system to deliver results has been grossly\ninadequate.\nThe challenge of fighting human poverty must\nnecessarily continue to have the highest priority. The poor\ncontinue to become poorer, remaining deprived of the\nbasic necessities of life. This is morally outrageous in an\nera of abundance and conspicuous consumption. Poverty\ndegrades humanity and is a threat to the most basic of all\nhuman rights. The onus is on us to unite, to wage a moral\nwar, to eliminate the scourge of poverty from our midst.\nSri Lanka is of the view that any development\nagenda of the future must contain a social dimension and\nassure protection to the most vulnerable elements of our\nsociety. It is in this regard that the international\ncommunity must move beyond the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt Initiative. By revising the criteria of\nclassification, we would expand the number of countries\nthat could be helped towards achieving meaningful\nreduction in both the stock of debt and its servicing. Debt\nrelief and official development assistance, which has been\ndwindling in recent years, should be restored to its former\nlevels, void of conditionality, at least for the least\ndeveloped countries. A positive step would be the\ncancellation of their foreign debt. This would help release\ntheir very limited resources for social and poverty\nalleviation programmes. They must be urgently put on the\npath to sustainable development, if they are to survive.\nThough relieving these countries of a major portion of\ntheir debt burden is a commendable step, it is equally\nimportant to ensure that they do not relapse into the\npoverty trap.\nThe time has come for the countries of the South to\nformulate an effective and implementable economic\nagenda. The recommendations of the Non-Aligned\nMovement ad hoc panel of economists are of primary\nimportance in organizing the substantive work of the\n26\n\n\nagenda for the South. They include the need for the\nelaboration and regular updating of the developing\ncountries' agenda; development of a networking system\nbetween countries of the South, involving specialists and\nresearchers in the various fields of importance; an economic\ncoordination scheme to help identify and analyse aspects of\ninternational economic and trade-related issues; and the\nassembling and launching of expert groups, which could\nmobilize those national and inter-South institutions, like the\nSouth Centre in Geneva.\nThe South Centre could be a possible coordinating\nmechanism, which could facilitate the implementation of\nthe South agenda. With the increased marginalization of\ndeveloping countries in matters of international finance and\ntrade, it is imperative that we urgently put in place a\ncoordinating mechanism to implement the recommendations\nmade by the ad hoc panel of economists.\nThe general thrust of globalization and liberalization\nof the international economy has now become irreversible.\nThe growing linkages between countries, the opening up of\nmarkets, the spread of investments, the impact of\ntechnology on standardizing products, the shrinking of\ndistances and the speed of modern communications, offer\nnew windows of opportunity for developing countries,\nespecially if their positive aspects are seized upon and their\npitfalls avoided. The task facing us in the developing world\ntoday is one of adapting this twin process to conform to our\nown specific requirements and priorities. This, in our view,\nwould be the primary objective of an economic agenda of\nthe South in the evolving global economy of the future.\nAlthough there have been significant developments in\nthe world economy under the influence of the doctrine of\nglobalization and liberalization, it is imperative to recognize\nits limitations and drawbacks where developing countries\nare concerned. We need to grapple with the reality and\nshake off any feelings of complacency. It is now\nincreasingly evident that the benefits of globalization have\nby and large bypassed much of the developing world,\ndespite strict adherence to the tenets of the structural\nadjustment policies. The poorest among us \u2014 spanning the\ncontinents of Africa, Central America and Asia \u2014 have\nexperienced increasing marginalization in the world\neconomy.\nSurveying the South, we find it evident that\nglobalization and liberalization have, paradoxically,\nincreased the economic gap between rich and poor\ncountries. This is the conclusion reached in the tenth United\nNations Development Programme Human Development\nReport. Domestic liberalization measures undertaken by\nmany of the developing countries have also contributed\ntowards a widening of the gap between the rich and the\npoor. A number of countries have recorded some\nacceleration of economic growth in the wake of\nliberalization and deregulation. But they have also\nwitnessed a shift in income distribution in favour of those\nin the upper income groups. Domestic policy reforms\nundertaken by a large number of developing counties in\nthe direction of liberalization and deregulation have not\nsecured for them a place on the \u201cGlobalization Express\u201d.\nThe globalization and liberalization process is\nunfolding in a manner which gives developing countries\nlittle voice in shaping the policy framework that\nunderpins this procedure. The ad hoc panel of economists\nunder the aegis of the Non-Aligned Movement, which\nwas set up on a proposal made by Sri Lanka, has\nconcluded that there is very little opportunity for\ndeveloping countries to be represented at discussions and\nin the councils under which various aspects of the\nglobalization process are assessed, monitored and tailored.\nInitial optimism on globalization and liberalization\nis being replaced by anxiety and concern. The emergent\neconomies in Asia are in crisis, experiencing sharp\ndownward pressures on their currencies and capital\nmarkets and experiencing stresses, not only on their\neconomic structures, but also on their social fabric and\npolitical processes. Fears of widespread international\nrepercussions have borne fruit, and the impact of\ncontagion is all too evident. A bitter lesson that has\nbecome all too obvious is the vulnerability of economies\nto uncontrolled financial flows of various kinds,\nparticularly those of a speculative nature.\nThe globalization and liberalization environment\ncontains no safeguards to control and regulate\ndestabilizing forces in a situation in which rapid\nmovements of vast amounts of capital across national\nborders is a daily reality. The response of the multilateral\nfinancial institutions and the major Powers to the East\nAsian crisis has been ad hoc and ex post facto, but the\nneed in the first place was for preventive mechanisms.\nIn this milieu, Sri Lanka's response has been to\nmaintain as best it could a steady level of economic\ngrowth, despite an unfavourable external economic\nenvironment. Our capital account transactions have only\npartially been liberalized. In our view, foreign direct\ninvestment should be of a medium or long-term nature in\n27\n\n\norder to discourage excessive outflow of short-term capital\nduring a financial crisis.\nIt is now virtually established wisdom that the least\ndeveloped countries have been increasingly marginalized in\nthe globalization and liberalization process. A restructuring\nof the global financial architecture must include special\nprotection for these most vulnerable segments of our global\nsociety. Since a crisis in any one part of the global structure\nhas the power to cause havoc in the rest of the world\neconomy, we must look beyond national solutions to global\nones, for both are now irrevocably interlinked.\nSri Lanka, as chair of the Group of 24, has taken a\nspecial interest in building a consensus among developing\ncountries on the issues of reforming the global financial\narchitecture, and also on the matter of implementation of\nWorld Trade Organization agreements. As a member of\nregional groupings, such as the Group of 15, the Group of\n77, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Bangladesh-India-\nMyanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation\n(BIMST-EC) and the Indian Ocean Rim Association for\nRegional Co-operation (IOR-ARC), and also as the current\nchair of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation (SAARC), Sri Lanka hopes to play a part in\nevolving a developing country consensus on this issue and\ninitiating a healthy debate with developed countries, with\nthe hope of establishing a new, dynamic, mutually\nbeneficial international financial architecture. As a part of\nthis effort, we have been active in promoting a South-South\ndialogue and developing an agenda for the South.\nIn this connection, I wish to commend the\nobservations of the German Foreign Minister in his speech\nto the Assembly a few days ago. He said:\n\u201cThe United Nations third major task alongside\npeacekeeping and promoting human rights in the\ncoming century will be to bring about a reconciliation\nbetween rich and poor countries ... The development\nof the poorer and the poorest countries must not be\nleft to the invisible hand of the global market ... The\nrich countries have a responsibility to help poor\ncountries take advantage of globalization and enable\nthem to have a fairer share of the world economy by\nassisting them with internal reforms and by opening\nup markets ... Development cooperation in the\nbroadest sense must become one of the United Nations\ncore tasks to a greater degree than hitherto. Science\nand technology are geared far too much to the\nproblems of rich countries.\u201d (A/54/PV.8)\nThe phenomenon of nations pooling their resources\nand strengths, either for collective security or economic\ndevelopment, has been a particular phenomenon of the\nsecond half of this century. South Asia has been no\nexception, the only difference being that the process of\nregional cooperation commenced relatively late \u2014 just 15\nyears ago \u2014 in comparison to other parts of the world.\nWe were also clear from the very outset that our\nendeavours were targeted solely for economic and social\ndevelopment.\nThe early phase of regional cooperation in South\nAsia required the building of the necessary institutional\ncapacities of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation (SAARC). Once these capacities were in\nplace, we began during the last decade to work on the\ncore issues of economic and commercial cooperation.\nWe have made some progress in tariff liberalization\nin South Asia under the SAARC Preferential Trading\nArrangement. This progress has given us the confidence\nto contemplate the more ambitious task of establishing a\nregional free-trade area. At the SAARC Summit in\nColombo hosted by Sri Lanka last year, a decision was\ntaken, and thereafter implemented, to begin drafting the\nlegal treaty for a free-trade regime.\nThe Colombo Summit also manifested our\ndetermination as a region to equip ourselves to maximize\nthe opportunities afforded by the process of globalization.\nOur Commerce Ministers have been meeting regularly to\nprepare for the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nMinisterial Meeting in Seattle. We will be spelling out in\nSeattle our views on the achievements so far of the\nmultilateral trading system that has now been put in place\nand the course corrections we believe are required. We\nhave also networked our central banks and finance\nMinistries since the Colombo Summit, to strengthen our\ncapacities to anticipate and cope with developments in the\ninternational financial system.\nThe economic focus of our regional cooperation has\nnot made us unmindful of our other primary objective,\nnamely of social advancement for our region. The\nchallenges our region faces are many. They relate to\neducation, the empowerment of women, health and\npopulation issues, and so on. We are trying to evolve a\nlink between regional goals and national programmes in\nthe social sector through a depoliticized common vision.\nTo this end we have, again after the Colombo Summit,\ncommenced work on a Social Charter for South Asia.\n28\n\n\nThe gains we have made in regional cooperation in\nSouth Asia are certainly not the material of which\nsensational headlines are made. In fact, they may even have\ngone unnoticed in some quarters. Yet we in South Asia\nknow that our achievements are incremental, durable and\nlong-lasting. Whatever may be the burdens imposed by\nhistory on our region, our common aspiration for the\ndevelopment and welfare of our peoples brings the\nGovernments of South Asia together in collective\nendeavour. Our organization has an inherent strength and\nresilience that has enabled it to weather serious crises in\nrelations between some of our members. It has emerged\nstronger after each such test of its capacity for collective\naction.\nAmong the new problems of unparalleled menace and\ndanger that have emerged towards the close of the present\ncentury are heightened terrorist activities in many countries\nand ever-proliferating criminal activities in the areas of\nnarcotics, human trafficking and arms smuggling. Every\ntime I have spoken from this rostrum, I have argued that\nterrorism must be tackled collectively if it is to be tackled\neffectively at all. In earlier years this plea seemed to fall on\ndeaf ears. But a rash of terrorist bombings in the West\ngalvanized the rich and powerful countries into action.\nToday we have one Convention in place and two others\nunder consideration at this very session. I am content this\nyear merely to reiterate my plea that there should be no\nrelaxation in the fight against terrorism. I urge other\ncountries, particularly in the West, to follow the lead of the\nUnited States of America in enacting legislation to outlaw\nterrorist organizations.\nIn the unfolding debate on the stand-off between state\nsovereignty and the rights of individuals being subjected to\nmassive human-rights violations, we must be careful to see\nthat terrorist organizations do not reap the benefit of\nmisplaced sympathy in situations of civil conflict. Those\nwho resort to terror in pursuit of their political objectives\nmust never be permitted or encouraged to believe that\nunremitting terror will ultimately bring its reward in\nrecognition and results. On the contrary, it is only the\nrecognition that a campaign of terror will put its exponents\nbeyond the pale of civilized discourse that will persuade\nterrorists to seek other ways of gaining a hearing.\nAt the close of this century it is relevant to ask of\nourselves this question: do moral considerations any longer\ninspire or motivate our actions, or have we been completely\novertaken by pragmatic considerations reflected in our\nrespective national interests, subjectively defined?\nI would like, in this context, to make an observation.\nWe have all heard the familiar jibe that a diplomat is\nsomeone who is paid to lie abroad for his country.\nIndeed, foreign relations and foreign policy have always\nhad the reputation of being somewhat amoral, the object\nbeing to secure some national advantage, with the\nmorality of the end, or of the means used to secure the\nend, being relatively unimportant. But the consequences\nof this approach for international relations have been\ndeplorable. The Charter of the United Nations commences\nwith these memorable words:\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from the\nscourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has\nbrought untold sorrow to mankind, and\n\u201cto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights,\nin the dignity and worth of the human person, in the\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\nand small, and\n\u201cto establish conditions under which respect for\nthe obligations arising from treaties and other\nsources of international law can be maintained, and\n\u201cto promote social progress and better standards\nof life in larger freedom\u201d.\nOne has only to listen to these words to realize that\nthe 54 years that have elapsed since they were first stated\nhave brought serious disappointments. Not only has the\nworld experienced numerous wars, but nations and\npeoples have experienced many kinds of immoral\npressures and intimidation. Social progress and better\nstandards of life in larger freedom have, for many\nnations, been an ever-receding mirage. It is clear that\nthese noble aspirations need some backing, some\nstiffening, in their implementation.\nSome 2,500 years ago a great teacher was born in\nAsia. He was born a prince. He renounced the world and\nroamed the forests in search of truth until he received\nenlightenment. Let me recall that Buddhism was first\nestablished in the central plain of the River Ganges, just\nsouth of the Himalayas. From that beginning, at one time\nor another in the course of its history, the message of the\nEnlightened One spread to large areas of India, Pakistan\nand Afghanistan, to Sri Lanka, China and Japan, to\nIndonesia, Korea, Laos and Viet Nam, and to Myanmar\nand Thailand. I state this not with any sense of\ntriumphalism, but to note that this enormous expansion\n29\n\n\ntook place in peace. No battles were fought, no cities\nbesieged and no crusades commenced to further the\nexpansion of Buddhism. And when, in accordance with the\nBuddha's teaching that all things are impermanent, the tide\nreceded, no battles were fought, no cities besieged and no\ncrusades commenced to stem that tide. For all of us who\nare concerned with statecraft, this holds a fundamental\nlesson.\nI would like to quote in this connection from the great\nBuddhist Emperor Asoka, who, as the Assembly knows,\nunderwent a radical change of heart through contact with\nthe Dhamma. In his often-quoted thirteenth rock edict at\nKalsi, he proclaimed:\n\u201cAnd for the following purpose has this rescript on\nmorality been written, namely, in order that the sons\nand grandsons who may be born to me should not\nthink that a fresh conquest ought to be made; that, if\na conquest does please them, they should take pleasure\nin mercy and light punishments; and that they should\nregard the conquest by morality as the only true\nconquest\u201d.\nNot only the freedom of thought, but also the\ntolerance allowed by the Buddha is astonishing to the\nstudent of the history of religions. Asoka, following this\nnoble example of tolerance and understanding, honoured\nand supported all other religions in his vast empire.\nThe Buddha was just as clear on politics, war and\npeace. It is well-known that Buddhism advocates and\npreaches non-violence and peace as its universal message\nand does not approve of any kind of violence or destruction\nof life. According to Buddhism, there is nothing that can be\ncalled a \u201cjust war\u201d, which is only a false term coined and\nput into circulation to justify and excuse hatred, cruelty,\nviolence and massacre. Who decides what is just or unjust?\nThe mighty and the victorious are \u201cjust\u201d and the weak and\nthe defeated are \u201cunjust\u201d. Buddhism does not accept this\nposition.\nAs the Buddha says:\n\u201cThe victor breeds hatred and the defeated lies down\nin misery. He who renounces both victory and defeat\nis happy and peaceful\u201d.\nThe only conquest that brings peace and happiness is self-\nconquest:\n\u201cOne may conquer millions in battle, but he who\nconquers himself \u2014 only one \u2014 is the greatest of\nthe conquerors.\u201d\nBuddhist philosophy contains much more of\nrelevance to statesmen. In the past decade the observance\nof human rights has been a source of great concern and\ndebate in international forums. In this connection, I would\nlike to quote the words of a scholar who has examined\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article by\narticle, from a Buddhist perspective. He said:\n\u201cThe importance of this Declaration as a common\nstandard of achievement for all peoples and all\nnations is now acknowledged everywhere. From the\nreligious angle, it is possible to state that in this\nDeclaration lie enshrined certain values and norms\nemphasized by the major religions of the world.\nThough not directly expressed, the basic principles\nof the Declaration are supported and reinforced by\nthese religious traditions, and among them the\ncontribution of the Buddhist tradition, to say the\nleast, is quite outstanding\u201d.\nToday the teachings of the Buddha are studied and\npractised worldwide, and nowhere more avidly than in the\nWest. It is said that there are over 150 million known\nadherents of Buddhism in the world today. But if one\ntook into account the vast uncounted numbers of those\nwho practise Buddhism, that figure would be immensely\nhigher.\nAllow me, therefore, to suggest to this Assembly\nthat as the third millennium of human history opens it\nwould be fitting to recall the immense contribution to the\nunderstanding of the human condition that the teachings\nof the Buddha made 2,500 years ago. I suggest further\nthat it would be appropriate to honour the Buddha by\ndeclaring that Wesak, the sacred day for Buddhists the\nworld over, be observed as a special day by the United\nNations. Wesak marks the three most important events in\nthe life of the Buddha: his birth, his attainment of\nenlightenment and his passing away, all occurring on the\nfull-moon day of the month of May. This was the\nrecommendation made by an international Buddhist\nconference held in Colombo last November and attended\nby delegates from 26 countries. With the permission of\nthe President, a draft resolution to this effect, sponsored\nby a number of countries, will be introduced in the\nGeneral Assembly at its current session. The Government\nof Sri Lanka commends this draft resolution to the\nattention of the General Assembly.\n30\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Please accept my\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its current session. We are indeed\nglad to have a distinguished statesman from Africa\npresiding over important deliberations on global security\nand development. I am sure that your personal attributes, as\nwell as your diplomatic skills, will ensure the success that\nis expected from the Assembly. The delegation of Poland\nwill do its best to assist you in your important functions.\nMy compliments go also to the President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session, Mr. Didier Opertti of\nUruguay, for the outstanding commitment he demonstrated\nduring his presidency.\nIt is with satisfaction that we welcome in our midst\nthe new Members of the United Nations: the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\nIt was with the utmost attention that we listened to the\nSecretary-General's introduction of his report on the work\nof the Organization. His interesting and highly stimulating\nideas will guide us throughout the whole fifty-fourth session\nof the General Assembly. May I assure the\nSecretary-General of our deep respect and support for all\nhis endeavours.\nIn my statement today, I wish to focus on the three\nissues which, in my view, are at the centre of discussions\nwithin this Organization. These are, first, human\nfreedoms, and in particular the question of rethinking the\nprinciple of national sovereignty and non-interference;\nsecondly, current challenges to the United Nations\nCharter-based system of international security; and\nthirdly, coping with contradictions of globalization\nthrough better international cooperation.\nWe have recently been witnessing new, painful\nmanifestations of ethnic hatred in Kosovo. Armed clashes\nhave again shaken the north Caucasus. East Timor is\nanother example of intolerance and the folly of violence.\nWe pay homage to the victims of this violence. But the\npeople in all the crisis-stricken areas expect more from us\nthan just words of sympathy.\nWe should pose ourselves some questions: could\nthese new outbursts of conflict have been prevented? Is\nthere a political will to head them off in the future? If the\nanswer is positive, then what should be done to translate\nour political commitment into action in a concerted and\neffective way? How should the system of international\nrelations be improved to give people the hope that they\nwill not be left defenceless in the face of genocide and\npersecution?\nThe United Nations Charter-based system of\ninternational security was born of the lessons of a\ndevastating world war which started with blatant\nviolations of sovereignty of States. To address this reality,\nthe system of international law and institutions was\nrightly geared to give those nations a sense of security\nand to prevent inter-State conflict. Most of today's\nconflicts, however, are of an intra-State nature. They stem\nfrom human rights abuses, social tensions or the collapse\nof State structures. Can we tackle the new challenges with\nexisting concepts and notions only?\nWe have come to understand that absolute\nsovereignty and total non-interference are no longer\ntenable. There is not, and there cannot be, a sovereign\nright to ethnic cleansing and genocide. We have learned\nthat what should not be repeated is the unacceptable\ninaction which occurred in the past, such as in the\nRwandan crisis. Rwanda demonstrates what Kosovo might\nhave become had we not intervened in 1999. Kosovo\ndemonstrates what Rwanda might have been had we\nintervened in 1994. The burden of responsibility is\nenormous, the lesson clear.\n5\n\n\nAt the same time, we should follow the principle that\nour responsibility is the same for all ethnic groups. In\nKosovo the ethnic cleansing of Albanians by Serbs has\nbeen stopped and reversed, but now we witness that the\npresence of Serbs and Roma in Kosovo is under threat.\nIn this decade the international community has through\nits actions \u2014 recently in Kosovo and in East Timor \u2014\nrecognized the universal political and moral imperative to\nact in order to stop gross and systematic violations of\nhuman rights.\nThis recognition, setting aside the distinction between\ninter- and intra-State conflicts, reflects the spirit of the\nCharter of the United Nations.\nIndeed, the central figure of the system of the United\nNations must be the human being \u2014 his or her right to a\npeaceful life, to personal freedom, to a decent existence and\ndignity. When human life and freedoms are assailed and\nindividual rights brutally violated, then we must not remain\nindifferent and unconcerned: we cannot stand idle.\nThe imperative to act raises the question of the right\nto act. We have recognized that the walls of sovereignty\ncannot be used to conceal and legitimize the abuse of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Sovereignty\ncannot mean impunity for genocide and human rights\nabuses.\nLet us all remember that it remains one of the\nfundamental objectives of the United Nations\n\u201cto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the\ndignity and worth of the human person, in the equal\nrights of men and women and of nations large and\nsmall\u201d.\nThe primacy of the human person and human rights,\nhowever, has to be adequately reflected in the application\nof international law. This is not an easy task, first, because\nthere are still too many cases where behind hypocritical\nlip-service to human rights there exist practices of curbing\nand limiting those rights for the sake of preserving political\npower; secondly, because the legal framework of\nintervention, which should ensure the possibility of quick\nand effective action, is too often distorted by selective and\nsubjective interpretations.\nOn the one hand, the banner of humanitarian\nintervention should not be used as a pretext for imposing\npolitical control and domination from the outside. We want\nto make the walls of sovereignty surmountable, but not\nfor all purposes. On the other hand, the principle of\nhumanitarian intervention has to be fairly and consistently\napplied to avoid double standards.\nThe development of international law should thus\nuphold the basic truth that a sustainable, lasting and\nsecure order in international relations can be built only on\nthe freedom of the human being.\nThe principle of solidarity in international relations\nshould grow in importance, since it also provides the key\nto the effectiveness of the mission of the United Nations.\nActing for universal observance of human rights\nwhile preserving the necessary content of the notion of\nsovereignty raises the question of the best strategies for\nhumanitarian intervention. We have but to agree that\nintervention by force is an instrument of last resort. What\nis preferable is an early and cooperative engagement to\ncorrect the practices that give rise to concern. There is no\ndoubt that armed intervention is a sign of the failure of\ncooperative methods.\nWe support wholeheartedly the efforts to foster a\nnew culture of prevention. The basis for this philosophy\nshould be the universal recognition that international\ncommitments undertaken by States in the field of human\nrights are matters of direct and legitimate concern to other\nStates as well, before their abuse degenerates into a threat\nto international peace and security. Human rights do not\nbelong exclusively to the internal affairs of States.\nThe present session of the General Assembly will\nlead us into the year 2000. Let this symbolic date inspire\nus to reflect upon the mission of the United Nations, to\nmake the millennium summit a truly meaningful event.\nOn the eve of the next millennium, the world still needs\nthe United Nations, while the United Nations needs a new\nvision. Faced with new and more demanding challenges,\nwe are of the opinion that the solutions to them require\njoint and concerted actions by the whole community of\nStates. The United Nations needs a reinforced\ncommitment by its Member States to the purposes and\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter.\nLet us try to find new strength for the Organization\nby reaching back to the intellectual and normative origins\nof the United Nations. Contrary to some assertions, we\nbelieve that the Charter is not outdated in its basic\nmessage. What it needs is a new, fresh and visionary\nreading in the context of new international realities and\n6\n\n\nchallenges. For example, with respect to Chapter VIII of\nthe Charter, we note that many of today's conflicts are local\nin nature. It is for this reason that the relationship between\nthe United Nations and regional security needs to be further\nexplored.\nThose actors who are closer to events and have a\nlarger stake in regional stability might be the ones who\nwould be willing to react more promptly and with greater\ndetermination. This is why Poland supports increased\nresponsibility of regional organizations for conflict\nprevention and crisis management. In regions where such\norganizations exist and have the necessary potential, they\nshould be involved more actively in solving substantial\nproblems. One possible example of how to use them\nconstructively is the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe.\nThus, the key to effective use of the principle of\nsubsidiarity is closer political and operational cooperation\nbetween the Security Council and regional organizations.\nA debate on United Nations reform has been going on\nfor a number of years. The fiftieth anniversary of the\nOrganization stimulated the discussion, which resulted in a\nuniversal understanding of the need for changes. Many of\nthose changes have already been implemented, thanks to the\ntireless efforts of the Secretary-General. This process\nshould, however, be deepened and accelerated. The Security\nCouncil offers a case in point.\nThe Security Council, upon which primary\nresponsibility has been conferred for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, occasionally finds it\ndifficult to act in situations of inter-State or local armed\nconflicts, even when those situations have a dangerous\nspillover potential. Whether for reasons of broad ideological\nmotivations or narrow national interests, members can block\nvitally needed decisions, and adversely affect the security\nof certain regions. How are we to eliminate situations in\nwhich the Security Council is prevented from taking up its\nresponsibilities? How are we to increase the effectiveness\nof the Security Council, combining effectiveness with\nenhanced representativeness? Reform of the Security\nCouncil is long overdue: let us undertake a decisive effort\nto make it a reality. Let us think anew of how to strengthen\nthe authority of the Council and preclude the possibility that\nits decisions will be ignored or misimplemented by\nindividual States.\n(spoke in French)\nA few weeks ago, two young Africans froze to death\non their flight between Conakry and Brussels. They had\nstowed away in the landing gear of the aircraft. They left\nbehind a moving appeal addressed to the people and\npoliticians in charge in Europe that has already been\nquoted in this Hall. In view of the special nature of that\nappeal, I should once again like to quote from it. They\nwrote:\n\u201cHelp us. ... We are suffering enormously in Africa.\n... We have war, disease and we lack food. ... We\nwish to be educated and we ask you to help us so\nthat we can study and be, in Africa, just the same as\nyou are\u201d.\nThere is no more eloquent appeal to people's hearts and\nconsciences than those words of despair written by\nchildren.\nWe must find the right solutions to the social and\neconomic failures, to the threats and to the lack of\nprospects that people and societies face and consider the\nurgent need to change the present framework of\ninternational cooperation. Frustration and the lack of\nsocial action cause conflict and a lack of stability. We\nmust think about how to integrate our social and\neconomic programmes with the general imperative of the\nnew culture of prevention.\nPoland is prepared to participate in these efforts, the\naim of which is to build a world based on these\nprinciples. However, our resources are limited. Our\ncountry is only just emerging from a period of major\neconomic crisis caused by the communist system and its\ncentralized planning, with its waste and bad management.\nEven so, we are now creating a complex and effective\nsystem of cooperation for development that will\ndemonstrate our commitment in poverty eradication\nactivities. At the same time, we are prepared to share with\nother countries the development experience we ourselves\nhave acquired during the process of reform of our\npolitical and economic systems over the last 10 years of\ntransformation.\nGlobalization must become a process with a human\nface. Certain basic principles must be better integrated\ninto the development machinery: specifically, solidarity;\ncombating marginalization; responsibility; and equal\nopportunity. Combating marginalization: that of the least\ndeveloped countries, which do not yet enjoy the benefits\n7\n\n\nof globalization. Responsibility: that of Governments in\nimplementing policies of good governance, in respecting\nhuman rights and in being aware that the well-being of all\npeople everywhere is just as important as the well-being of\ntheir own nations. Equal opportunity: for the poorest, and\nthose who are still sidelined by society. And solidarity: in\nfacing our common challenges \u2014 terrorism, organized\ncrime, environmental threats, natural disasters, AIDS \u2014\ntogether.\nUnfortunately, we still have much left to do before we\nattain these goals. The 1999 United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) Human Development Report provides\nfresh, shocking evidence of social breakdown and threats to\nhuman security. The challenges I have just mentioned are\njust part of a more universal question: how can we respond\nto the new realities of the world? Global policies have not\nbeen fully adapted to cover the increasing number of\ncomplicated and contradictory phenomena that cannot be\ntackled with traditional diplomatic instruments. The process\nof designing policies is still basically the job of individual\nnations, whereas the challenges we are facing require\ncreative cooperation at the global level. It is for this reason\nthat, Governments must further integrate the idea of\ninternational cooperation into their national policies, while\navoiding the temptation of authoritarianism. This, however,\nhighlights the urgent need to revise and strengthen our\ninstitutional arrangements regarding the design of global\npolicy, particularly with regard to the most complex\nproblems of trade, finance and the environment.\nInternational cooperation must be more open to other\nactors in civil society by reflecting the rich network of\nrelationships. While several countries are re-evaluating their\nnational policies, democratizing their societies, privatizing\ntheir national economies and decentralizing economic and\npolitical power, at the international level we are, broadly\nspeaking, still confining ourselves to conventional\nintergovernmental actions. The United Nations must\npromote active international cooperation whereby\ngovernments and the various sectors of civil society act\ntogether towards common goals.\nIn this connection, we welcome the \u201cPartners for\nDevelopment\u201d initiative of the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD). By breaking from normal practice, this will\nallow more active participation by the public and private\nsectors and by representatives of government and the\nbusiness and intellectual worlds in resolving various\ncomplex development problems.\n(spoke in English)\nAs someone who has witnessed the atrocities but\nalso the tremendous progress that the twentieth century\nhas brought us, I look towards the coming century with\nmuch optimism. This optimism is justified first and\nforemost by the liberation of nations and peoples, the\nwave of democratization, the market reforms all over the\nworld and the universal understanding of human rights\nideals. Fewer people live in constant fear of arbitrary\narrest, torture or worse. I also look towards the coming\ncentury with hope because I see the predominant will to\nconsolidate those recent achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I would\nlike to congratulate you as you take on the honour and\nresponsibility of leading the Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. Allow me to express our deep appreciation to His\nExcellency Minister Didier Opertti, who led us last year\nwith admirable efficiency, insight and, on occasion, good\nhumour. I take this opportunity also to commend the\nSecretary-General for his dedication and inspiring\nleadership in the service of our Organization.\nI would also like to welcome Presidents Teburoro\nTito, Rene Harris and King Taufa\u2019ahau Tupou IV, their\ndelegations and the people of Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga,\nall fellow members of the Asia-Pacific family, to the\nUnited Nations. Their membership in our Organization\nshould further bolster the global consensus on peace and\nprogress in the world.\nAlmost a decade ago the cold war ended and we are\ntoday at the doorstep of a new century. Over those years,\nwe achieved much as individual nations and as Members\nof this Organization. Yet, our collective search for peace\nand progress for all continues. After many years of\neloquent debates, after hearing many persuasive proposals\nand formulations, how well indeed have we mastered the\nlanguage of peace. But the wars and strife that afflict our\nworld, even as we speak, show that we have neither fully\nlearned nor lived the ways of peace. As at its founding,\nour Organization is faced with the dire spectre of\ncountless multitudes living in utter dread and misery.\nThe much-touted new global order, where nations\nlive in harmony and peace, where growth and sustainable\ndevelopment are rights and not privileges and where\njustice rules and human rights are upheld remains a\npromise. We encounter newer threats to the peace, and\nold threats are re-emerging. Poverty stalks many lands.\nFar too many people have their human rights ignored or\nviolated. Our very Earth protests decades of unbridled\nabuse.\nOne of the clear victors at the end of the cold war\nwas the free market. For most of our lives, the assault\nupon the very idea and practice of the free market came\nfrom an ideology. Today, even that ideology embraces the\nmethods, if not the spirit, of the free market. It now\nseems that the growing reach of the free market, or\n9\n\n\nglobalization, is held back only by our inability to adapt to\nit fast enough.\nFor so many years, East Asia was admired for its\nsuccess with globalization. The so-called East Asian miracle\nwas little more than our region\u2019s economic response to it.\nOur fast growth doubled our incomes and moved tens of\nmillions of our people out of poverty. Up until July 1997,\nwe thought all was well.\nNow we know better; we have learned our lessons.\nOur difficulties could have been less severe or avoided with\nbetter public and corporate governance, with better\nmanagement of financial systems, with greater transparency\nand accountability; in other words, with greater openness,\nwhich is the heart and spirit of the free market or any truly\nfree system.\nHappily, the crisis did not destroy the conditions\nunderpinning East Asia\u2019s growth formula of\noutward-oriented industrialization. A propensity for high\nsavings, abundant highly educated human resources, higher\nproductivity and economic reform policies remain.\nToday, East Asia is on the road to recovery. Consumer\nconfidence is rising. Exports are booming. Inflation has\nbeen tamed. Investors are coming back. Japan, the Republic\nof Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia are all growing\nagain. The Philippine economy will grow by more than 3\npercent this year and over 5 percent next year. Yet, there is\nno retreat on our core reform agenda. Economic\nrestructurings continue. Greater economic integration goes\non. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\ncountries, for instance, took extraordinary steps to\nunderscore their commitment to free trade and investment.\nDuring its Hanoi summit last year, ASEAN resolved to\naccelerate, not retard, the establishment of the ASEAN free\ntrade area to the year 2002. We are accelerating the\nimplementation of the ASEAN Investment Area and\nASEAN Industrial Cooperation schemes. We have also\nmoved towards greater financial cooperation by establishing\nat the Asian Development Bank a regional economic\nmonitoring and surveillance mechanism. It should\nencourage transparency, institute better coordination of\neconomic policies and help ward off future financial crises.\nHowever, internal reforms cannot be enough. The\ncrisis also exposed the weaknesses lurking in the\ninternational system. Realizing early on that the\nphenomenon of globalization should be addressed\nmultilaterally, the United Nations has sought the\ncooperation of other multilateral organizations to strengthen\nnormative, legal and institutional frameworks in the hope\nthat the global economy can be managed more effectively\nand, perhaps more importantly, more equitably. For the\nyawning gap between poor and rich nations continues to\nwiden, and the pace and level of development of countries\nare, alas, more uneven.\nIn a fast-globalizing and interdependent world,\naugmenting the ability of developing countries to\nparticipate fully in the global economy is the win-win\nsolution for all. Insecure market access, high levels of\nprotection and support of agriculture in industrialized\ncountries and the continued high tariffs on industrial\nproducts from developing countries obviate greater\nprogress for all.\nThe international trading system must adopt a new\nparadigm in which sustainable development should be the\ncentral theme. The World Trade Organization Ministerial\nConference to be held in Seattle late this year should be\nnot only an opportunity to launch a new round of\nmultilateral trade negotiations. It should also be an\noccasion to imbue the process with a sense of direction\nthat responds to the development needs of developing\ncountries.\nThe global financial architecture must be\nstrengthened. There is urgent need, as the Committee for\nDevelopment Policy pointed out in its 1998 report to the\nEconomic and Social Council, for the coherent\ndevelopment and effective monitoring of international\nstandards and codes of conduct for private financial\nmanagement and capital flows. There is also need to curb\ndestructive competition and inconsistency in national\nregulatory frameworks.\nMore and more, countries and regions need to reach\nout to one another in the spirit of cooperation and\npartnership for development. The ten-year-old\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, or APEC, is\nfounded on this conviction. So is the much younger\nAsia-Europe Meeting, or ASEM. And it heartens us that\nthe East Asia-Latin America Forum, having recently taken\nits first steps, may soon join in the more sustained and\nstructured effort to link up for global progress. The\nPhilippines anticipates a similar region-to-region initiative\nwith Africa and will contribute its utmost to any such\ninitiative.\nFrom a historical perspective, we are still at the very\nearly stage of globalization. With globalization having the\npotential to grow exponentially, as do the revolutions in\n10\n\n\ntechnology and information that fuel it, this early stage is\nperhaps the most critical one. Only earnest international\ncooperation can ensure that this process does not lead to the\nmarginalization of any nation.\nBut, as our recent experience in East Asia shows,\neconomic progress alone cannot and does not engender the\noptimal well-being of nations or peoples. Progress in\nensuring political stability and security should accompany\ngrowth. Any asymmetry in the pace, breadth and depth of\nchange in these facets of the political economy is a seed of\nfuture instability. Moreover, just as our economic prospects\nare determined by our participation in the global economy,\nour future peace and security will depend not only on our\ninternal resilience, but also on the active cooperation of\nothers.\nIn East Asia the most urgent undertaking for ensuring\npeace is the reconfiguration of the strategic security\nstructure in the region. The holes left gaping by the end of\nthe cold war must be filled; the new parameters of the\nregional security equation must be defined. The situation in\nthe Taiwan Strait is a concern to us all. So are the issues of\nmissile development in the Korean peninsula and nuclear\ndevelopment and uneasy peace in South Asia.\nThe South China Sea remains a potential flashpoint.\nWe are hopeful that, in addition to measures advancing\nregional economic and financial cooperation, a regional\ncode of conduct in the South China Sea can be adopted at\nthe summit of leaders of ASEAN, China, Japan and the\nRepublic of Korea that we are hosting in Manila in\nNovember.\nEast Asia has clearly not yet settled all its great issues\nof war and peace. But we are trying hard and succeeding in\nsome important ways. At the sixth ASEAN Regional\nForum \u2014 the only forum on security that includes all the\nmajor Powers with a stake in our region \u2014 we agreed to\ndraft rules of procedure by which preventive diplomacy\ncould bolster and complement regional confidence-building\nmeasures. Last December we agreed to move closer to the\nfull activation of the ASEAN High Council and the dispute\nsettlement mechanisms mandated by the Treaty of Amity\nand Cooperation in Southeast Asia.\nThe 5 May 1999 Agreement on East Timor and the\nfree, fair and orderly conduct of the 30 August\nconsultations there are truly significant developments for\nlasting peace in our region. For the Philippines, it is of the\nutmost importance that the chaos there be quickly resolved\nand the horrendous human suffering be stanched. We\ntherefore welcome Indonesia\u2019s decision to invite the\nassistance of the United Nations and of a multinational\nforce, and its creation of a national commission of inquiry\nto investigate and bring to justice persons responsible for\nthe atrocities and human rights violations in East Timor.\nWe also commend the Secretary-General and the\nneighbouring and other countries for responding quickly\nto restore order and facilitate humanitarian relief in East\nTimor. As a fraternal neighbour of the peoples of\nIndonesia and East Timor, we will contribute all we can\nto ameliorate the humanitarian situation and put back on\ntrack a peaceful transition.\nElsewhere, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement is a\npositive development for the Middle East peace process.\nWe are also heartened by the agreements reached recently\nin Sierra Leone and the Congo, and between Eritrea and\nEthiopia. We hope that the resolution of the immediate\ncrisis in Kosovo will soon create the conditions conducive\nto the establishment of lasting peace there.\nIt is true that we have avoided major inter-State\nconflicts of late, and that States are more willing to\nresolve disputes peacefully. But the continuing tensions in\nvarious regions of the world could still draw nations into\nconflict and divert attention and resources away from\ndevelopment. For the Philippines, regional cooperation\nprovides a key to managing potential and actual conflict\nsituations. We have seen this in the efforts of the ASEAN\ntroika, the United Nations and the international\ncommunity to restore political stability in Cambodia, and\nin the dispatch of a multinational force to East Timor\nwith authorization from the Security Council and upon the\ninvitation of the Indonesian Government.\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that it is\nnecessary and desirable to provide support for regional\nand subregional arrangements and initiatives on matters of\ninternational peace and security. The United Nations,\nlacking the capacity, resources and expertise to address all\nissues unique to each region of the world, should\ncomplement rather than supplant regional peace efforts.\nThis, however, will require significant investment\nfrom all of us. In the first instance, we need to invest a\nlot of goodwill and build trust in one another so that\nclearer criteria and a more predictable basis can guide\nSecurity Council authorization for all types of peace\nmissions. We realize that no two situations are the same,\nbut inaction due to stalemates in the Council, in the face\nof serious threats to peace and human life, threatens the\n\n\n\ncredibility, legitimacy and future effectiveness of our\nOrganization.\nSecondly, the Organization and its Member States\nneed to invest in practical steps that can be taken in the\nareas of training assistance, joint peacekeeping exercises,\ngreater participation in standby arrangements, partnerships\nbetween countries whose contingents require equipment\nsupport and those able to provide it, and closer cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations.\nAnd thirdly, perhaps more important, we need to\ninvest our work and way of thinking with greater flexibility\nand innovation. The nature of conflict has changed. Crises\nand humanitarian situations now involve many more actors,\nfrom Governments and international organizations to non-\nState players. And their effects, just like their causes, are\nmore complex and far-reaching.\nLet us face it, much of what was considered before as\nthe internal affairs of a State is not so any more \u2014 or ever.\nHumanity is indivisible. Peace is indivisible.\nState sovereignty is important; it will always be. So is\nindividual sovereignty. That the redefinition of one should\ncoincide with the renewed consciousness of the other is, to\nmy delegation, not an accident. These developments need\nnot even be seen as parallel, as in they do not meet; for in\ntruth, they converge.\nBut we agree with the Secretary-General that the more\nimportant question is how the United Nations \u2014 the only\ntruly universal, if imperfect, arm of the international\ncommunity \u2014 is to respond to the political, human rights\nand humanitarian crises affecting so much of the world. We\nhave to be more innovative in our approaches to problems\nrelating to massive and systematic human rights violations.\nWe agree that empowering the United Nations enough to\nmatch its Charter mandates in today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s\nworld requires that we, the Member States, update our\nconcept of national interest.\nLast year, before this Assembly, I articulated\nPhilippine policy, thus:\n\u201cLike all other States, the Philippines pursues\nforeign policy to promote national security and\ndevelopment. But we view national security beyond\nthe traditional concerns of sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity. For in a global regime characterized by\nevolving multipolarity of political and military power\nand by growing economic and financial\ninterdependence, with all their attendant\nopportunities and risks, my nation\u2019s peace and\nprosperity increasingly depend on stability and\ngrowth abroad. As President Estrada has said: Our\nway of life, our fundamental values and our\ninstitutions can flourish and find true expression\nonly if we enjoy political stability, economic\nsolidarity, socio-cultural cohesion, moral consensus\nand ecological balance, at home and with our\npartners in the world. Our national security and\ndevelopment\u201d [or in short, our national interest]\n\u201cdemand that we actively advance the internationally\nshared goals of freedom, openness, peace, prosperity\nand justice.\u201d (A/53/PV.17, p.6)\nAfter the events of the last year, we are more\nconvinced that the collective interest, our common\ninterest, is my country\u2019s national interest.\nThe need to reform the United Nations is our\ncommon interest. Reforms should not only seek to make\nthe United Nations more efficient; they should make it\ntruly responsive to the new demands of international\npeace, security and development.\nThe Security Council, with its wide mandate and\nleadership role, should be at the centre of change and\nreform itself. It should be truly representative, democratic,\ntransparent and accountable. The use of the veto should\nbe rationalized.\nThe day may come when we shall have achieved\nconsensus on the reforms that we wish for our\nOrganization. The day may also come \u2014 and soon I\nhope \u2014 that the financial morass our Organization is in\nwill have passed.\nBut while these are critical to the very survival of\nthe United Nations, the continued existence of our\nOrganization would be far more meaningful if we could\ninvest it with a new openness and greater trust. The\nPhilippines believes that to achieve this, we must start at\nhome, in our own regions. We must, in appropriate\ncircumstances, be more open to hearing the views of\nothers and offering our own, even on issues deemed too\ncontroversial. A new openness would reflect the boldness\nwith which we should renew the promise of a new era.\nThe United Nations proved its great worth in this\ncentury. Its continued success in the next will depend\nentirely on us, on the goals we hope to achieve with it, on\n12\n\n\nwhat we are willing to invest in it. After all, we are the\nUnited Nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Guinea-Bissau is gratified,\nSir, at your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-\nfourth session of the General Assembly. The unanimous\nelection of a distinguished African diplomat such as\nyourself to this post is evidence of the conviction of the\nMember States of the Organization that, under your clear-\nsighted leadership, our work is certain to be successful.\nYour election is also a concrete expression of Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan's dedication to the cause of peace, as\nwell as a recognition of Namibia's significant contribution\nto international peace-building. We pay tribute also to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the great\nsensitivity and skill he displayed in fulfilling his duties\nduring the fifty-third session.\nWe would like also to express, on behalf of the\npeople of Guinea-Bissau and on my own behalf, our\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\nhis efforts towards international peace and security.\n8\n\n\nGuinea-Bissau also welcomes the new States Members\nof the United Nations \u2014 Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga \u2014\nwith which we intend to maintain relations of friendship\nand cooperation.\nOn the eve of the new millennium, Africa is\nexperiencing an increase in armed conflict that threatens\nregional peace and stability. Regrettably, West Africa has\nnot been spared this scourge. From the Liberian crisis to\nthat of Sierra Leone, not to mention Guinea-Bissau, our\nregion has been racked by periods of fratricidal violence\nwhose causes are manifold.\nIn the case of our country, the root causes of the\npolitical and military crisis include a lack of effectiveness\nand a loss of authority on the part of the State; poor\nmanagement; human rights violations; non-compliance with\nthe principle of the separation of power between sovereign\nbodies; corruption and deteriorating living conditions; and\ntotal frustration and despair on the part of those who fought\nfor freedom and their homeland.\nThe events of 7 June 1998 were a direct result of\nthese problems. Unfortunately, as is the case in every\nconflict, the crisis also resulted in a tragic situation for the\npopulation that included the loss of life, a massive flow of\nrefugees to neighbouring countries and large numbers of\ndisplaced persons, not to mention the devastation of the\neconomic and social infrastructure of the country.\nHaving experienced the horrors of war, the people of\nGuinea-Bissau today more than ever strongly aspire to live\nin peace and security, with hope for the future and in the\nfull enjoyment of their fundamental rights. Guinea-Bissau\nalso wishes to consolidate its unity and to promote a culture\nof peace and national reconciliation that is based on a\npluralist democracy with sound governance and on the rule\nof law.\nWe are determined to promote and protect the dignity\nof human beings and to enable their harmonious\ndevelopment. In this regard, we are pleased to note that a\nconference was convened recently in Guinea-Bissau for the\nreconciliation and unity of the people of our country. That\nevent of rare scope raised the awareness of our fellow\ncitizens and mobilized them with respect to national peace\nand reconciliation, which is a prerequisite for domestic\nsecurity and socio-economic progress.\nThe conference also received direct support from,\namong others, Sweden, the Netherlands and the\nrepresentative of the United Nations Secretary-General. All\nof Guinea-Bissau's vital elements participated, including\npolitical parties, non-governmental organizations, the\nGovernment, the military junta and our nationals living\nabroad.\nWe take this opportunity to affirm that we will spare\nno effort in working to consolidate the emerging\ndemocracy in Guinea-Bissau, basing ourselves on the\nsocial and cultural values of our people and on the\nprinciples of good relations as set out in the Charter of\nthe United Nations and that of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, in order to bring about a lasting peace in\nour country.\nIn this context, we will be holding legislative and\npresidential elections on 28 November, preceded by a\ncensus and the registration of electoral candidates. We\nwould like to reaffirm before the Assembly our\ndetermination to hold the elections as scheduled, despite\nthe slow response time of some of our partners in\ndevelopment with respect to the commitments entered into\nat the round table held in Geneva on 4 and 5 May.\nWe would like also express our heartfelt thanks to\nSweden, Portugal and the Netherlands for fulfilling their\ncommitments in a timely manner.\nWe take this opportunity to launch an urgent appeal\nto the international community to support Guinea-Bissau\nin its efforts to return to constitutional order, which is a\nprerequisite for restoring normal relations of cooperation\nwith its development partners.\nIt is also important to underscore our very positive\nrelations with the peoples of the subregion, in particular\nwith Senegal, and our desire to renew our fraternal ties of\ncooperation with the Republic of Guinea in order to help\nconsolidate peace and stability in the subregion.\nDespite the progress we have made in the struggle\nfor human dignity and freedom, the vast majority of\nhumankind lives in degrading conditions that are\nunacceptable to the collective conscience. This situation\nis the result of selfish interests that go against the moral\nand political values of the United Nations. The example\nof East Timor is a case in point.\nWith regard to East Timor, we are deeply concerned\nby the fact that after the popular consultation, whose\noutcome was favourable to the Maubere people, we\nwitnessed very violent acts which were completely at\nodds with the agreement of 5 May between Indonesia,\n9\n\n\nPortugal and the United Nations. We express our fraternal\nsolidarity with the heroic people of East Timor in the face\nof the genocide carried out by Indonesian militias. We\ncondemn those acts and demand respect for the desire for\nself-determination expressed in the popular consultation of\n30 August last. We welcome the strong \u2014 albeit late \u2014\nreaction of the international community aimed at restoring\npeace and security in that territory. We appeal for efforts to\nbe intensified and call for technical, material and financial\naid for the rebuilding of East Timor, which has been\nbrutally destroyed.\nGuinea-Bissau supports the international community,\nthe United Nations and the Organization of African Unity\nin their ceaseless search for a peaceful solution to the\nproblems affecting our continent. In this context, the\nsituation in Angola is of great concern for our country. The\ncivil war has imposed great suffering on the majority of the\npopulation of Angola, especially those in the most\nvulnerable sectors. This situation requires vigorous action\non the part of the international community to restore lasting\npeace in that neighbouring country. Guinea-Bissau demands\nthat UNITA unconditionally abide by the Lusaka Protocol\nso as to put an end to this long and painful conflict in that\nfraternal country.\nIn the Middle East, the peace process between Israel\nand Palestine deserves our utmost attention. In this regard,\nwe note with satisfaction the positive development in\nrelations between Israel and Palestine under the impetus\nprovided by the President of the Palestinian Authority,\nYasser Arafat, and the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak.\nIn Latin America, we hope that the economic and\ntrade embargo against Cuba will soon be lifted. We believe\nthat the realism of the international community must prevail\nso as to spare the Cuban people the suffering that they\ncontinue to endure.\nWhile it is true that peace and security are an\nindispensable condition for social and economic\ndevelopment, it is no less true that improving people's\nliving conditions is one of the foundations of social and\npolitical stability. However, one of the obstacles to pursuing\nthose objectives is our country's external debt. That is why\nthe external debt burden is a matter of constant concern for\nGuinea-Bissau. In this context, we welcome the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. We also\nwelcome the decisions taken at the G-7 summit recently\nheld in Cologne.\nWe take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to all\nthe organizations in the United Nations system working in\nour country for their substantial contribution not only to\nconsolidating national peace and reconciliation but to\nalleviating the suffering of our people. We also welcome\nthe decision to appoint Mr. Samuel Nana-Sinkam as\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General to head\nthe United Nations Peace-building Support Office in\nGuinea-Bissau, whose activities are greatly appreciated by\nour people.\nWe believe that we have made sufficiently clear our\ndetermination to hold elections on the scheduled date, 28\nNovember 1999. However, we know that democracy does\nnot end with elections. Support for the special emergency\nprogramme for Guinea-Bissau is therefore absolutely\nnecessary in order to ensure that the democratic gains are\nirreversible and to give sustained development in our\ncountry a chance. That is why we take this opportunity to\nappeal once more to the international community not only\nto take an interest in the elections but also to support the\ndetermined efforts of Guinea-Bissau to build its future."

        "file_text": "May I first congratulate you, Mr.\nPresident, on your election to this responsible position. I am\nsure that your vast knowledge and experience are a\nguarantee of the success of this session.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to express my most\nsincere congratulations also to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, for his contribution to strengthening the role\nof the United Nations in line with the challenges of the\nmodern world.\nI am going to spare the Assembly the review of this\nyear's international developments that it probably\nanticipated, because I come from a region that has\ngenerated enough bad news and is still the focus of world\nattention.\nSome of the developments in our region were not\nthe result of human will. The earthquakes in Turkey and\nGreece, which claimed tens of thousands of victims,\nshook the world. Regrettably, man-made disasters have\ntaken a high toll on our region. The war in Kosovo, the\nfourth in a row in the former Yugoslavia, has left in its\nwake a comparable trail of tragedies.\nNow that the war is over, there are two things we\nmust do: as soon as possible, repair the damage and\nalleviate the trauma it has inflicted, and build an\ninfrastructure of security and prosperity that precludes any\nfuture repetition of such tragic events.\nThe international community has in the past set itself\nsimilar ambitious tasks. This time, I hope, the experience\nit has gained has reached the critical mass needed for the\nachievement of lasting peace settlements in conflict areas.\nThe consequences of the Kosovo crisis have spilled\nover the borders of the region. That is why I find it\nworthwhile to share with the Assembly some conclusions\nabout what was, hopefully, the last war in the Balkans.\nWith the adoption of Security Council resolution\n1244 (1999), the world community has endorsed the\npolitical end of the system established by the cold war.\nThat resolution reflected the new international status quo\nand the understanding that has grown during the past 10\nyears of the importance of individual security.\n\n\nToday, the rights and dignity of the human individual,\ncivil freedoms and the international rule of law override\neven the sovereignty of States. This calls for a new\nresponsibility on the part of the international community for\ntheir protection. The resolution also showed the\ncommitment of Security Council members to international\nstability.\nParadoxical as it may sound, the Kosovo crisis has\nserved as a catalyst of post-bipolar relations and of a new\ntype of political dialogue among States. Significantly, for\nthe first time since the Second World War, four permanent\nSecurity Council members are participating in one force \u2014\nKFOR. Furthermore, they have been involved in\npeacekeeping operations \u2014 something that would have\nbeen unthinkable 10 years ago.\nThe Kosovo crisis has also highlighted the need for\nchange within the United Nations system itself. For\nexample, the world Organization is in serious need of a\nmechanism for compensating neighbouring States for\ndamage caused by international intervention or sanctions. I\nraise this issue not only because of the losses sustained by\nmy country during the past eight years from the embargo\nagainst Iraq and because of the military conflicts in the\nformer Yugoslavia, but also because this will increase the\nefficiency and boost the image of the United Nations. It\nwill certainly improve the credibility of United Nations-led\noperations and provide better motivation for individual\ncountries to participate.\nOn the other hand, the crisis in Kosovo promoted a\nnew type of relations among international organizations in\nrespect of the protection of human rights. As a result of the\ncrisis, a new kind of interface has been born between the\nUnited Nations and the regional organizations in Europe,\nsuch as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\nthe European Union and regional initiatives such as the\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. This has\nstrengthened the role of the United Nations on that\ncontinent.\nToday, the Balkan people expect the international\ncommunity to show the same commitment to the future of\nthe region as it did during the crisis. Threats to peace and\nsecurity should cease to be the only international mobilizing\nfactor, and we must act towards this end.\nI am convinced that the developments in the former\nYugoslavia have not been due to some peculiar Balkan\nmentality or to any historic predestination. Half a century\nago, Western Europe was embroiled in wars that were no\nless bloody. The difference is that after the Second World\nWar the nations of Western Europe were rescued at the\nsame time from fascism and communism. This helped\nthem attain a democratic and economic homogeneity that,\nin turn, enabled victors and vanquished alike to set aside\ntheir differences and build their present prosperity while\nrespecting human rights and protecting their national\nidentity.\nUnfortunately, a different lot fell to the countries of\nSouth-Eastern Europe after the Second World War. States\nlike Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, preserved\nand built up their potential for liberal-democratic\ndevelopment and a free market, and the rest of the States\nin the region were forced to become a part of the Soviet\ncommunist system.\nToday, 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the\nBalkans still lack democratic homogeneity. This has been\na source of tensions, which, translated into ethnic hatred,\nare the favoured tool of any totalitarian regime attempting\nto cling to power. But I am sure it is wrong to apply a\ncommon denominator to the whole region. Today\nBulgaria, as well as most of the Balkan States, is a\ncountry with a working democracy, a free market\neconomy and the rule of law.\nAn earlier democratic homogenization of South-\nEastern Europe can be achieved only if the vision for our\ncountries' integration with the rest of the European States\nis shared by both the Balkan nations and the people of\nWestern Europe. Efforts and perseverance to this end are\nthe safest guarantee for converting the whole of Europe\ninto a continent of peace, stability and prosperity.\nThis common European vision fully applies to the\nfuture Yugoslavia. There is hardly any country that has a\nhigher stake in Yugoslavia's earliest possible integration\nin the family of democratic Balkan States than Bulgaria.\nI cannot but share here the concern of the world\ncommunity at the continuing ethnic tensions in Kosovo,\nwhich distance us from the desired state of peace and\nethnic tolerance. Six months ago I firmly supported\nNATO's operation, designed to end ethnic violence\nagainst the Albanian population in Kosovo. Today, just as\nfirmly, I oppose ethnic violence against the Serb\npopulation in that province.\nThe Balkans have paid a high price for peace in\nKosovo. Today the region needs direct assistance for its\nreconstruction. The priority beneficiaries should clearly be\n2\n\n\nthe hardest-hit countries and areas. Nonetheless, rather than\ndiscussing figures and reparations, I believe it would be\nmore productive for both the Balkans and the world to\nadopt a clear vision for the future of South-Eastern Europe.\nThis future has no alternative but the transformation of the\nBalkans into an integral part of a united Europe of the next\ncentury.\nThe General Assembly is the right forum to discuss\nthe issue of how this can be done. The path leads through\nthe direct rehabilitation and reconstruction of the\nBalkans \u2014 the best form of assistance for our region being\n\u201chelp for self-help\u201d. The Stability Pact for South-Eastern\nEurope can provide the necessary framework.\nWe are convinced that the economic prosperity of the\nregion is a vital condition for achieving political stability.\nWe need infrastructure and strategic investment that\ngenerate and guarantee more security than any political\ndialogue. We need the promotion of trade and a maximum\ninvolvement of the economic potential of our countries in\nthe reconstruction effort. This will encourage them to\ncooperate with each other, while opening up the region and\ntransforming it into a natural, organic part of Europe, rather\nthan isolating it.\nThe crisis in Kosovo will be long over before its\neffects, such as the blockage of the Danube to shipping,\nhave been eliminated. The international waterway should\nnot become a new line of conflict; we should help it play\nits natural role of a link rather than allow it to act as a\ndividing line across Europe. The issue I am raising at this\npoint concerns both the economic damage that has been\ncaused and the very principles of the European architecture\nsince the end of the crisis in Kosovo.\nThe location of the Balkans at a crossroads has been\na curse for its people in the past; in today's globalized\nworld, it is our greatest blessing. The Balkans should serve\nas a link between Western Europe and Central Asia, the\nCaucasus and the Caspian Sea. It is one of the most\npromising regions for the coming century. A case in point\nis the restoration of the historic silk road, which crosses the\nwhole of Asia and links it to Europe. Restoration will entail\nhuge infrastructure projects and investment which in turn\ncould improve the quality of life of whole nations and\nregions.\nThe Balkan nations have already demonstrated a\nwillingness to adopt a new approach in their relations with\none another. The various forms of aid which neighbouring\nStates generously offered each other in response to the\nrecent natural disasters were a positive new sign. Another\nsignificant fact is the formation of the multinational peace\nforce for South-Eastern Europe, staffed jointly by\ncountries that were enemies earlier this century, including\nduring the cold war. It is an honour for my country that\nthe first headquarters of that force is based in Bulgaria.\nI cannot fail to mention here the success of the\ntrilateral initiatives between Bulgaria, Romania and\nGreece and between Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey for\ncooperation in combating organized crime and illegal\ndrugs and arms trafficking.\nThe Kosovo crisis calls for a contemporary rereading\nof the chronicles of the Balkan wars by all the Balkan\npeoples: the modern perspective will reveal to them that\nthose wars have done no country in the region any good.\nThe new task facing the political elite is to translate these\nlessons of history into a lasting commitment to peace and\ncooperation. Having paid such a high price in suffering\nand fear, it would be a pity if we failed to learn from our\nexperience.\nIn conclusion, I reiterate my country's willingness to\ncooperate with and contribute actively to the joint efforts\nof all Member States to streamline the United Nations, an\nOrganization with a key role in maintaining international\npeace and security and achieving the objectives of\nsustainable development in the coming century.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is just over half a\ncentury since the then British Prime Minister, Clement\nAttlee, presented the Charter of the United Nations to our\nParliament. He told our Parliament:\n\u201cWe are seeking not merely good relations\nbetween nations but between the human beings\nwithin nations\u201d.\nThe concept he saw expressed in the Charter of the United\nNations was revolutionary. That responsibility for the\nsecurity, freedom and development of people does not\nbelong solely to each State acting individually, but to all\nnations of the world acting as a united body.\nOver the past 50 years, the United Nations has done\nmuch to discharge that responsibility. The United Nations\nand its agencies have led programmes around the world that\nhave released the potential of individual human beings on\nevery continent. We have helped double the literacy rate\namong women in developing countries. We have helped\nimmunize 80 per cent of the world's children against some\nof the most lethal diseases. We have established the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights as the benchmark\nfor freedom for individuals. And this General Assembly\nplayed a leading role in insisting on equal democratic\nrights, regardless of race, and in forcing an end to\napartheid. Today the United Nations provides shelter and\nsanctuary to refugees in every corner of the world.\nAs we meet this week, United Nations agencies\nprovide homes, food, welfare, health and education to 19\nmillion refugees \u2014 more than the population of most\nMember States. We should take pride in these\nachievements, because it will help give us the confidence\nto tackle the challenges that remain.\nBut we must also be frank about where we have\nfailed. We have failed to deliver peace to many of the\npeoples of the world. We have not realized the vision of\nour founders, of nations and peoples within them living\nin peace with each other. We have averted world war. But\nwe have not averted a world with too much war.\nThat is why I want to support the excellent opening\naddress by our Secretary-General by focusing my remarks\nalso on what we must do if we are to replace failure to\nhalt war with success in preventing conflict. The\nharrowing scenes we have witnessed this past year from\nKosovo, from Sierra Leone, from East Timor and too\nmany other places underline the urgency of improving our\nperformance in preventing conflicts and also in stopping\nthem once they have started.\nI propose five priority areas for action. First, we\nmust tackle the root causes of conflict, starting with the\npoverty that breeds it. War is becoming a poor man's\nburden. In the modern world, wealthy nations no longer\nexperience the trauma of conflict on their soil. The\nsoundest basis for peace is prosperity, and the best way\nwe can prevent conflict is by promoting sustainable\ndevelopment. The forthcoming Millennium Assembly\nmust make a reality of the commitment to halving the\nproportion of people in extreme poverty and reducing the\nnumber of nations in heavy debt.\nSecondly, we must promote human rights and good\ngovernance. Development of a nation will be more rapid\nwhere people have the right to develop their full potential.\nConflict is more likely where governments rule without\nthe consent of their people.\nThirdly, we must curb the supply of weapons that\nfuel conflict. For decades, the United Nations, rightly, has\nfocused on halting the spread of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Yet in truth, in those same decades, the\nweapons that have killed masses in conflicts have been\nthe most common of small arms. In Friday's debate in the\nSecurity Council, we will have the opportunity to take\nforward action to halt the illegal trade in small arms, to\npromote regional moratoriums on small arms and to limit\narsenals of military firearms to legitimate Government\nagencies.\n34\n\n\nFourthly, we must stop the illegal trade in diamonds\nand other precious commodities which pay for the small\narms \u2014 and all too often the mercenaries \u2014 which sustain\nconflict. The markets for these commodities, especially the\nmarket in diamonds, are small and tightly located in a few\ncentres. We must encourage cooperation with those who\nmanage those markets to cut off the supply of funds to\nthose who are promoting conflict.\nLastly, I strongly endorse the view expressed by our\nSecretary-General this morning that we must counter the\nculture of impunity. Those who break international\nhumanitarian law, from Kosovo to East Timor, must know\nthat they will be held to account by the international\ncommunity.\nThe international criminal tribunals have shown what\ncan be done. We must build on their work by getting a\npermanent international criminal court up and running with\nall speed.\nBut we will not always succeed in preventing conflict.\nWe need, therefore, to be better equipped to restore peace\nwhen war breaks out. As my Prime Minister, Tony Blair,\nsaid in Chicago earlier this year, working out the conditions\nand identifying the circumstances when it is right in the\nmodern world to intervene is the most pressing problem in\nforeign policy today. His speech demonstrated that Britain\nis anxious to play its full part in that debate. Our starting\npoint is that our common interest in preserving the world\nfrom major conflict is greater than our individual interests\nas nations.\nGlobalization is the long and rather ugly term which\nis used to describe how in today\u2019s world we are\ninterdependent with each other rather than independent of\neach other. We are bound together by our strengthening\nlinks in trade and investment, in travel and communication.\nWhat happens in one country can have a direct impact on\nthe prosperity and the security \u2014 even the climate \u2014 of\ncountries on the other side of the world.\nAnd we are also bound together by the consequences\nof conflict. In Britain 90 per cent of the heroin on the\nstreets of our big cities is grown in Afghanistan under\ncover of the generation-long conflict in that land. In central\nAfrica, the upheavals of population sparked by the mass\ngenocide in Rwanda have destabilized the region and\ncaught up half a dozen countries in the conflicts that have\nensued. Across the countries of Europe there are now\nseveral hundred thousands of citizens of the former\nYugoslavia who have fled to seek sanctuary from the\nrepeated conflicts there. Just as few nations can stand\nalone in the modern world, there are now few major\nconflicts which remain only an internal matter with no\nimpact on the rest of the world.\nIf we are to respond adequately when conflict\nbreaks out, then the United Nations needs to develop\nthree strengths \u2014 credibility, consensus and capacity.\nIf the United Nations is to have the credibility to\npress the parties to a conflict to a solution, it must be\nmore representative of the modern world. A small\nincrease in the size of the Security Council would be a\nmodest price to pay for the big increase in its credibility\nwhich would come from a more representative permanent\nmembership.\nBut greater credibility would be pointless without\nconsensus on when the authority of the United Nations\nshould be invoked. Intervention must always be a last\nresort. We can all agree that the first responsibility for\nreconciling internal conflict rests with the State in which\nthat conflict arises. But we also have a shared\nresponsibility to act when we are confronted with\ngenocide, mass displacement of people or major breaches\nof humanitarian law. To know that such atrocities are\nbeing committed and not to act against them is to make\nus complicit in them. And to be passive in the face of\nsuch events is to make it more likely that they will be\nrepeated.\nCredibility, though, also requires us to demonstrate\nnot just the consensus, but also the capacity, to act. We\noften hear demands that the United Nations should do\nsomething. Let us be honest \u2014 the United Nations is\nnothing more than the aggregate of its Member States.\nThe United Nations cannot do something except when we,\nits Member States, are prepared to provide the means.\nWe need to ensure that the United Nations has a\nsound financial base, which requires all of us to meet our\nassessed contributions in full, on time. But we must also\nensure that when peacekeeping forces are required, they\nare made available. Britain has signed a standby\nagreement earmarking forces we are prepared in principle\nto provide for emergency peacekeeping work. Such\nagreements enable the United Nations to plan for\nemergencies with greater confidence that we can rapidly\nput in the field the right skills, with the necessary\nequipment. A score of other Member States have signed\nsimilar agreements. The more of us that do so, the greater\n35\n\n\nwill be the capacity of the United Nations in brokering a\nbasis for peacekeeping deployment.\nBut in Kosovo we discovered that it was less difficult\nto put together an armed force to end the military violence\nthan to assemble a United Nations police force to keep civil\norder. Today, therefore, I can announce that Britain will\nfollow up our standby agreement with the United Nations\non troops with a similar agreement increasing the number\nof United Kingdom police officers available for United\nNations troops. This will include a commitment to a rapid\nresponse squad, ready for deployment at short notice when\nit is urgently needed. We shall also be establishing with the\nUnited Nations a flagship training course in Britain to train\npolice from around the world to play their part in our joint\nmissions.\nI am conscious that the agenda I have set out is an\nambitious one. But, in all humility, I have to say that it is\nless ambitious than the visionary programme set out half a\ncentury ago by the founders of the United Nations. As our\nSecretary-General said earlier this year, unless we can unite\naround the aim of confronting massive human rights\nviolations, against crimes against humanity, then we will\nbetray the very ideals of our founders.\nIn the modern world in which we live \u2014 the modern\nworld of satellite communications \u2014 we know instantly\nwhen such violations are taking place. We have the\nresources and the mobility to move our assets quickly in an\nemergency. Modern technology has made all of us each\nother\u2019s neighbours. We now need to match that technology\nwith an international doctrine that also reflects the modern\nworld. And it must be founded on the clear principle that\nthe only war we agree to wage is one in which our nations\nare united in combating conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Your brilliant election, Mr. President, to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at this session pays tribute to your\npersonal merits and your eminent qualities as a diplomat,\nand to your country, Namibia, a country that is to us a\nsymbol of the struggle against oppression. First of all, allow\nme to address our most sincere and warm congratulations\nto you. Your country and Burkina Faso share the same\nideals and values, and a similar vision of the future of\nAfrica and the world. Suffice it to say that we extend to\nyou in advance our willingness and cooperation for the\nsuccess of your mission.\nWe must also pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr.\nDidier Opertti, who so brilliantly discharged his important\nresponsibilities during this particularly trying year. I pay\ntribute as well to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nwhose work at the helm of the United Nations deserves\nour appreciation and our fullest support.\nFinally, I would like to congratulate the three new\nMembers that have joined the great family of the United\nNations \u2014 Tonga, Nauru and Kiribati.\nThis session of the General Assembly \u2014 the last of\nthe century \u2014 is beginning at a time when recurring and\npersistent inter-State and inter-ethnic conflict and hostility\nare characteristic of the international scene.\nThe globalization of the international economy and\nthe liberalization of world trade appear to have worsened\nthe economic and social differences between peoples. The\nlofty objectives of our Organization \u2014 the promotion of\npeace, security, justice and equality \u2014 seem to be\nreceding into the distance.\nWe are faced with increasing challenges, which is\nmaking the task of the United Nations more difficult. And\nyet we sense that the coming millennium will be a time\nof growth for our peoples, in particular those of the\ndeveloping countries.\nThe waning century threw down every possible\nchallenge, but it also gave rise to great hopes. It has been\none of the most productive as regards legal instruments\naimed at enhancing the protection and promotion of\nhuman rights. Nevertheless, grave dangers emerged during\nthis period that came close to jeopardizing humankind's\nvery existence. The memory of the two great wars\nremains very much alive.\nIt must be underscored that the United Nations \u2014\nborn of the general upheaval of the post-war period and\ncharged with working towards peace and a genuine\ncollective security for our world \u2014 has accomplished a\ngreat deal, with the assistance of regional or subregional\norganizations such as the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU), the Organization of American States, the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations, the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and so on.\nBut despite all these efforts, the quest for peace\nremains an immense and difficult undertaking. On the\ninternational scene, wars, conflicts and confrontations of\n12\n\n\nall stripes continue to rage, wiping out any progress made\nin the field of development.\nIn the Middle East, the level of tension between the\nparties remains very high, even though recent political\nchanges have given rise to hopes of a comprehensive\nsolution to the Palestinian question, particularly since the\nsigning of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum on 4\nSeptember last.\nIn an international situation so fraught with conflict,\nwe can only rejoice at seeing the spectre of war, which had\nseemed inevitable, recede from East Timor thanks to the\nwisdom and realism of the parties to this painful conflict.\nI cannot fail to mention the military intervention of the\nNATO countries in Yugoslavia and more specifically in\nKosovo, an operation whose legitimacy was supposedly\nbased on the right of humanitarian intervention. But my\ncountry, Burkina Faso, is among those that believe that\nsuch an intervention should take place only on the basis of\na clear and precise mandate and under the supervision of\nthe United Nations.\nThough the objective of this type of intervention \u2014\nprotecting a victimized minority \u2014 may seem defensible,\nthe manner in which it was carried out is a cause for\nconcern because it represents a challenge to the United\nNations and to the basic norms of international law.\nBurkina Faso is gratified that the United Nations has taken\nup its proper role in the resolution of this conflict.\nBut Africa is undoubtedly the continent that has\nsuffered the most from these crises. Though peace has been\nrestored in Guinea-Bissau, and in Sierra Leone the Lom\u00e9\nAgreement, signed on 7 July 1999 with the active\nparticipation of Burkina Faso, has put an end to the gunfire,\nwe must continue tirelessly to strive to resolve the situation\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the Horn of\nAfrica and in Angola.\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a solution\ncan be found if security issues, which remain the essential\nconcerns of the various States involved in the conflict, are\ntaken into consideration. Accordingly, Burkina Faso\nconsiders that the Lusaka agreements must be accepted by\nall of the parties if indeed they wish to give peace a\nchance.\nTurning to the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea,\nPresident Blaise Compaor\u00e9, during his tenure as the head of\nthe high-level OAU delegation and in close cooperation\nwith the United Nations, made every effort to promote a\npeaceful settlement of this conflict, in conformity with the\nmandate he was entrusted with at Ouagadougou by the\nthirty-fourth Summit of Heads of State or Government, in\nJune 1998.\nOur efforts led to the acceptance by both parties of\nthe Ouagadougou framework agreement, and, at the\nthirty-fifth OAU Summit, held in Algiers, of the\nmodalities for the implementation of that agreement. We\nare convinced that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the\ncurrent Chairman of the OAU, to whom we have passed\nthe torch, will strive to ensure a successful outcome to\nthis delicate situation. In doing so he will enjoy the\ncontinuing and vigorous support of the OAU Secretary\nGeneral, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, and the cooperation of\nthe United Nations and all of the States that have played\na very positive and discreet role in finding a pacific\nsolution to the conflict between these two brotherly\ncountries. To this end, he will require the cooperation of\nboth parties and the support of all, particularly the United\nNations.\nThe fratricidal conflict in Angola has lasted more\nthan two decades, despite all of the sanctions and\nmeasures taken against Mr. Jonas Savimbi and his\nmovement, UNITA. Burkina Faso is convinced that, as in\nother cases \u2014 particularly in Sierra Leone and the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo \u2014 it is only through\na dialogue between the parties that a just and lasting\nsolution can be found.\nIt is clear that, because of their increasingly complex\nand interrelated nature, the various conflicts I have\nmentioned cannot be resolved in a just and lasting way\nunless the efforts of all are conjoined. This includes not\nonly the parties to the conflict and the international\ncommunity \u2014 meaning the United Nations \u2014 but also\nthe regional and subregional organizations.\nIn this respect, we noted, throughout our mandate as\nChairman of the OAU, the determination and commitment\nof this Organization fully to discharge its responsibilities,\nas evidenced by the various initiatives it has undertaken.\nWe stand convinced that Africa has resolutely\nconsidered the serious consequences these multiple\nconflicts entail for the economic and human development\nof its population. Accordingly, at the thirty-fifth OAU\nSummit in Algiers, it took the courageous and historic\ndecision of declaring that the year 2000 would be a year\nof peace and security throughout the continent.\n13\n\n\nOf course, we know full well that in order for that\nobjective to be attained, the support of the international\ncommunity is crucial, not only at the political level, where\nits backing will be needed for the implementation of our\ndecisions and resolutions, but also at the equally important\nlevel of logistics and material support, technical assistance\nand humanitarian considerations.\nBut any peace is fragile that is not backed by genuine\ndisarmament. That is why we support all international\ninitiatives in this field, in particular the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\nMy country has joined in the fight against anti-\npersonnel mines by signing and ratifying the relevant\nConvention. Burkina Faso is gratified at the growing\nsupport of the international community for the initiative of\nthe Economic Community of West African States relating\nto a moratorium on the production and transfer of light\nweapons. Together with other members of the international\ncommunity, my country is also participating in\npeacekeeping operations, in particular in the United Nations\nMission in the Central African Republic.\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, it is\ndistressing to note that the world economy is still\ndominated and controlled by a minority of States that\nmanipulate its rules and the way it operates in their own\ninterests and to the detriment of the interests of the great\nmajority \u2014 the countries that make up the South.\nWith regard to social development, poverty has\ncontinued to increase in developing countries, where about\n1.5 billion people \u2014 one quarter of the world's population\n\u2014 are living on less than $1 per capita per day. Food\nsecurity is far from guaranteed in those countries, while in\nthe affluent countries food is destroyed on a huge scale in\norder to stabilize prices. The scarcity of drinking water\nsupplies and medical services condemns a third of humanity\nto a life expectancy of no more than 40 years. Illiteracy\ngreatly limits the access of the poorest to knowledge and,\nby extension, to information about how their countries are\nrun. The most disadvantaged and vulnerable strata \u2014\nwomen, children and elderly people \u2014 do not fully enjoy\nthe benefits of a legal protection system.\nAt a more general level, there are unacceptable\ndisparities in international economic relations between the\nindustrialized and the developing countries. The latter are\nbecoming increasingly vulnerable because of the chronic\nstructural imbalance in trade with the developed countries.\nDespite the decisions taken by the ministerial conferences\nof the World Trade Organization, the integration of the\nless advanced countries into the multilateral trading\nsystem is still an issue, particularly with regard to the\nspecial and differentiated treatment that should be granted\nto those countries. The greatest challenge in the twenty-\nfirst century will undoubtedly be the struggle against the\nmarginalization of the countries of the South.\nThe burden of debt remains a constant concern, too,\ndespite the initiative of the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt Initiative and the important decisions\ntaken by the Group of Seven Summit in Cologne, which\nI welcome.\nIn order to promote the genuine and lasting human\ndevelopment to which all developing countries aspire, we\nmust work for greater justice and equity in international\ntrade, through the implementation of various measures,\nincluding price stabilization and export guarantees for the\nproducts of developing countries through the revaluation\nof raw materials and the stabilization of export earnings;\nindex-linking of the prices of raw materials to those of\nindustrial products; free access for the products the South\nto northern markets through the elimination of\nprotectionist measures; reform of the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions to bring them into line with the needs and\npreoccupations of the developing countries; and the\npromotion of a genuine North-South dialogue. In this\nrespect, Burkina Faso welcomes with interest and\nsatisfaction the European initiative to hold an economic\nsummit next year for the European Union countries and\ntheir African partners.\nAs everyone knows, we can make many plans, have\nmany ambitious dreams and imagine all sorts of\ntransformations for our world. But if we do not place\njustice, equity and solidarity at the heart of all our\nprojects, they will remain fantasies. Justice demands, for\nexample, that we not starve a population through the use\nof international sanctions in order to punish its\nGovernment. Since I am touching upon that subject, I\nwould like to reaffirm our full solidarity with the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya, and I hope that, as a result of the\nconcessions made by that country with regard to the\nLockerbie affair, the unfair sanctions against the brotherly\nLibyan people will be lifted for good. Since the historic\ndecision at Ouagadougou, this requirement has become\nimperative, in our view.\nIn this context, the issue of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan also deserves attention. In the interests of equity\nand of the principle of universality, Burkina Faso believes\n14\n\n\nthat it is unfair virtually to ostracize 22 million Chinese\npeople. That is why we firmly support the initiative to\ncreate a study group to examine the particular and\nexceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan\nso as to determine how that entity could be represented in\nthe United Nations.\nIn that connection, in the interests of justice within\ninternational relations, we must restructure the Organization\nso that we can better respond to the demands of our time\nand the expectations of humanity. If the United Nations is\nto be more democratic and more just, such reform must go\nto the heart of its main body, the Security Council, whose\ncomposition and operating methods must be reviewed and\ncorrected. The operational capacities of the Organization \u2014\nthe structures and activities linked to the promotion of\neconomic and social development \u2014 must also be\nstrengthened.\nBurkina Faso believes the human being to be the\nsupreme measure of all things. That is why human rights\nand the dignity of humankind are at the centre of our\nconcerns. In fact, since 1991, my country has been\nsteadfastly undertaking an irreversible process of\ndemocratization that has led to several rounds of municipal,\nlegislative and presidential elections under conditions\nrecognized by international observers as being calm and\nunbiased. The process is being consolidated and the culture\nof democracy and citizenship in a republican system is well\nunder way. The stability and security of our country in the\ncurrent turbulent environment bear witness to that fact.\nWe believe that no price can be placed on democracy\nand freedom. That is why we will spare no effort to\nstrengthen and extend those values. Burkina Faso intends to\nmake a modest contribution to building a more human\nworld of greater justice and solidarity, because we are\nconvinced that the new international order to which we all\naspire requires that political, economic and social forces\nthroughout the world join hands and become catalysts of\nprogress for the benefit of humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I\nreserve a special word of appreciation and esteem for the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the notable way\nin which he has been fulfilling his difficult task at a\nmoment when so many and such complex challenges face\nthe United Nations and so many hopes are placed on the\nOrganization\u2019s capacity to act.\nI address the Assembly still under the impact of the\nwave of emotion, indignation and revulsion that swept\nover the entire world as a result of the tragedy that befell\nthe people of East Timor after the announcement of the\nresults of the popular consultation on the future of that\nTerritory, which was conducted in an exemplary manner\nby the United Nations on 30 August.\nAnyone who saw the pictures of the Timorese on\nvoting day \u2014 clutching their registration cards, waiting in\norderly lines for the long-awaited moment to express\nfreely their will \u2014 must have reacted with strong emotion\nand surely perceived, on those faces and in those gestures,\nthe universal appeal of democracy, freedom and justice.\nThe striking contrast between the example of silent\ncourage and civic sense given by the Timorese when\nmassively participating in the ballot and the barbaric acts\nof revenge that followed clearly reveals what was at stake\nin this process.\n\n\n\nI do not wish to dwell on the history, unfortunately so\nlittle known, of the struggle for independence waged by the\npeople of East Timor over the last 24 years. Nor will I\nrecount the procession of horrors they had to suffer and,\nunfortunately, are still suffering to win their freedom.\nHistory teaches us that the birth of a new nation is usually\na conquest by its people, achieved as a result of a painful\nprocess. The case of East Timor is not an exception. By\ntheir courage, determination and willingness to fight and\nsuffer, the people of East Timor have earned the right to\nbecome an independent nation. I wish to pay tribute to\nthem, as well as to their leader, Xanana Gusmao, whose\nhuman and political qualities have commanded the respect\nof all who have met him. And on behalf of the Portuguese\npeople, I would like here to bow before the memory of all\nthe Timorese who paid with their lives for the dignity of\ntheir people.\nThe events of the last few weeks in East Timor have\nrocked the conscience of the international community and\nforce us to reflect on the responsibility of the United\nNations, as the representative organ of that community, for\nthe construction of a more just and humane international\nsociety. As universal awareness of the inalienable value of\nthe dignity of the human being takes hold at this end of the\ncentury, an increasingly heavy responsibility is falling to\nthe members of the international community to articulate\nprinciples and interests, in the knowledge that for interests\nto be legitimate principles must be upheld. That awareness\ndemands, from all those holding public office, prompt and\nfirm responses to moral and juridically unacceptable\npolitical behaviour, as well as to the humanitarian tragedies\nand cycles of regional instability that these provoke.\nWorld public opinion, which takes shape before our\neyes as a result of the globalization of the means of\ncommunication, expects those answers from us and has\ntrouble understanding why double standards are so often\nused in situations where identical principles are at stake.\nWe all know that the international community has not\nalways been able to rise to meet these challenges. Suffice\nit here to recall the tragedy of Rwanda, the cases of the\nSudan and Somalia, the delay in reacting to the conflicts in\nBosnia and Kosovo, and so many other situations of human\nsuffering that, tragically, were inadequately addressed.\nWe should therefore pay tribute to the energetic\nreaction of the international community to the wave of\nviolence and terror that struck East Timor in recent weeks\nand to the resulting mobilization of a multinational force\ntasked with guaranteeing the peace and security of that\nterritory, protecting and supporting the United Nations\nMission in East Timor and facilitating the humanitarian\nassistance operations for the people of that territory. Let\nme offer my thanks to all those who have contributed to\nthis outcome and, in particular, to the countries that have\nbeen willing to constitute this force.\nIn this instance, and beyond the dramatic human\naspects, the very credibility of the United Nations was at\nstake. How could the United Nations, having organized\nthe popular consultation, betray the confidence placed in\nit by the people of East Timor? Although the reaction was\nnot as prompt as the Timorese deserved and Portugal\nwould have wished, the adoption of Security Council\nresolution 1264 (1999) shows the world that the Council\ndoes not remain indifferent to challenges to its authority,\nnor does it allow them to go unanswered.\nLet this case be not an exception, but rather an\nexample for the future. Swiftness of reaction by the\nSecurity Council is a condition of its authority and\neffectiveness.\nMuch of what has happened is irreparable and\ncannot be forgotten. I say this with great bitterness, and\nmay I add that in this as well as in other cases, we cannot\nencourage a culture of impunity.\nNevertheless, the arrival of the multinational force in\nEast Timor is opening up a horizon of hope, and now we\nmust take care of the living and attempt to save whatever\ncan be saved.\nI consider the following to be immediate priorities.\nFirst, guaranteeing security in East Timor is the priority\ntask before us so as to ensure respect for the individual\nrights of the Timorese and to allow them at last to live in\npeace without the threat of violence and persecution.\nWithout security we will not be able to undertake with all\nthe necessary vigour and amplitude the urgent tasks of\nhumanitarian assistance to the population of East Timor.\nSecondly, we must channel humanitarian aid to East\nTimor with the utmost urgency, to feed, to treat and to\nprovide shelter to the tens of thousands of displaced\npeople scattered all over the territory; to take care of all\nthose whose belongings have been systematically\nplundered; to bring comfort to those who have lost\nmembers of their families and friends and who helplessly\nwitnessed scenes of horror that will be forever engraved\nin their memories; to reunite families \u2014 in brief, to come\nto the rescue of a population traumatized by an orgy of\nviolence to which it fell victim.\n12\n\n\nThirdly, we must attend to the situation of those\nTimorese, well over 100,000 of them, who have been\ndeported to Indonesia or have fled the Territory and who\nare now mostly in West Timor. The continuous access of\nhumanitarian assistance to those populations is urgent and\nindispensable, including by the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commission for Refugees and other institutions for\nthe protection of human rights, to safeguard the life and the\ndignity of the refugees and to ensure their unimpeded return\nto East Timor.\nFourthly, we must accelerate the transfer of effective\nauthority in the Territory to the United Nations, as foreseen\nby the Agreements of 5 May, as a consequence of the result\nof the popular consultation held on 30 August. Any delay\nwhatsoever would be unacceptable. It is also important to\ndefine a timetable for the complete withdrawal, in the\nshortest possible time, of the Indonesian forces in the\nTerritory. That is the only way to restore peace and stability\nin the region and to lay the foundations of a healthy\nrelationship between the future State of Timor and\nIndonesia, a country which we hope will be able to\nconsolidate the democratic promise heralded by its current\ntransition process.\nFinally, there needs to be an enormous reconstruction\neffort in the Territory, which was totally devastated by\npillaging, looting and destruction during recent days. To\nthis end, the generous commitment of the international\ncommunity will be indispensable.\nPortugal has expressed its full willingness to contribute\nto all of these tasks. Owing to the responsibilities it has\ntowards the brotherly people of East Timor and the\nunconditional solidarity that unites both peoples, Portugal\nhas expressed, from the first hour, its readiness to join the\nmultinational force. To avoid any delay \u2014 since every\nminute counts, in terms of lives and in terms of\nsuffering \u2014 we agreed, while ready to participate\nimmediately, to defer our presence in the force to a later\nstage.\nWith regard to humanitarian assistance and\nreconstruction for East Timor, we are doing, and will\ncontinue to do, our utmost. I would like here to appeal\nvigorously to the international community, to the\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations and to the non-\ngovernmental organizations to contribute to this effort.\nWith the Territory under occupation, and the attempt\nat annexation by Indonesia never recognized by the United\nNations, the people of East Timor waited a quarter of a\ncentury to exercise the right of self-determination to\nwhich they were entitled as the people of a Non-Self-\nGoverning Territory, as prescribed by the United Nations.\nWithin the framework of resolution 37/30 of 1982,\nPortugal, as the administering Power of the Territory,\nIndonesia and the United Nations at last arrived at an\nAgreement on 5 May.\nThe popular consultation was agreed upon, with\nexplicit reference, both in the Agreement of 5 May and in\nSecurity Council resolution 1236 (1999) of 7 May, to the\nresolutions of the General Assembly that have represented\nand continue to represent the Magna Carta of the right of\ncolonial peoples to self-determination: resolutions 1514\n(XV), 1541 (XV) and 2625 (XXV).\nIn spite of all the intimidation, the people of East\nTimor democratically exercised on 30 August their right\nto self-determination and chose, by a clear and\nunequivocal majority, their collective future, thereby\nacquiring, unconditionally and irrevocably, the right to\nconstitute an independent State at the end of the\ntransitional administration period that the United Nations\nwill soon initiate.\nEast Timor is reaching freedom with wounds and\nscars of past suffering; but it is carrying the embryo of\nhope, and it will now, I sincerely hope, arrive, free of\nresentment, as a member of the community of States.\n(spoke in English)\nThe question of East Timor is about a people and\nabout fundamentals: human dignity, international law and\nmoral and universal conscience.\nIn spite of all the terrible events of the past, let us\nsalute, at the end of the International Decade for the\nEradication of Colonialism, the self-determination of East\nTimor.\nAllow me to end by formulating a vow and a hope:\nthat as soon as possible the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations may hear the free and sovereign voice of\nTimor Lorosae.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let\nme congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency\nof this General Assembly, a truly global parliament where\nall mankind is represented and finds expression in its\ndiversity and its fundamental unity. Your election and your\npersonal qualities honour your country and your region.\nI would like to congratulate also the delegations of\nKiribati, Tonga and Nauru, and through them their\nGovernments and peoples, on their recently becoming\nMembers of this Organization. We are convinced that they\nwill contribute constructively and positively to the work of\nthe United Nations, and that their presence here reaffirms\nthe universal and democratic vocation of the General\nAssembly.\nWe are holding this session at a transcendental\nmoment in human history. At the threshold of a new\ncentury and a new millennium, it is timely for the peoples\nof the world to reflect on the future of our countries and of\nthe international system. Facing the new millennium, we\nmust draw lessons from the era that we are leaving behind,\nin which we learned all the good and all the evil that we\ncan do. We saw the first man walking on the moon, the end\nof apartheid in South Africa and peace agreements signed\nin Central America; but we witnessed also the consequences\nof the nuclear mushroom cloud and the aberration of the\nHolocaust, ethnic conflicts and local wars which in the last\n40 years have caused more deaths than the two world wars\ntogether. We have seen the bright-lights of democracy and\nfreedom, but also the deep shadows of poverty and the\nviolation of human rights.\nThis has been a century of great contrasts. While in\nsome parts of the globe peace is signed, in others war is\nnever ending. While thousands of millions live in poverty,\na small group lives in opulence. While we celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, in many parts of the world gross violations of\nhuman dignity are committed. Yes, this has been a century\nof many contrasts. It has given us plenty of reasons to be\nproud, but it has also made us ashamed of the cruelty and\nhardness of the human heart. For these reasons we should\nnever forget the lessons of the twentieth century.\nIn the context of these lessons, we, the 188 nations\ngathered here \u2014 each with its own flag and symbols, each\nwith its own political, commercial and strategic interests,\neach with its own problems, suffering, visions and\ndreams \u2014 express our readiness to take up the challenges\nof the new century, which must take shape, beginning\nnow, as the century of human rights and human\ndevelopment.\nFor these reasons, we have to recognize that the\ngreatest failure of the United Nations and the international\ncommunity in recent years has been the persistence of\ncruel armed conflicts and civil wars, which cause\ncontinued humanitarian crises and prevent the peaceful\ndevelopment of nations. The real victims of war are the\ndisplaced and refugee children and elderly, the raped\nwomen, the youngsters killed, the workers whose\nworkplaces are destroyed, the students whose schools are\nbombed and the sick who cannot receive treatment. While\nwar persists, human rights cannot be respected.\nIn this sense, we condemn the atrocities committed\nin East Timor against the civilian population, and we join\nthe whole world in demanding that its will, democratically\nexpressed, be respected. We view with satisfaction the\nquick action of the Security Council, which will allow for\nthe deployment of an international peacekeeping force in\nthat Territory in order to prevent a greater humanitarian\ncrisis. In retrospect, this crisis teaches us that the\ninternational community must be willing to actively and\npromptly support the processes that it initiates.\nRegarding the situation in the Middle East, we watch\nwith hope the progress in the search for a peaceful and\ndefinitive solution on the basis of full compliance with\nthe Oslo accords. We acknowledge the tireless efforts of\nPresident Barak, of Israel, and President Arafat, of the\nPalestinian Authority, and their commitment to peace and\nthe future of their peoples.\nI would like to express my condolences to the\npeople of the Republic of China on Taiwan for the tragic\nearthquake that devastated its territory on Monday, 20\nSeptember, and the recent after-shock. My most heartfelt\nsympathy goes to the families of the victims and the\ninjured.\nCosta Rica has a firm relationship with the Republic\nof China on Taiwan. We admire its shared economic\nprogress, its respect for human rights and its democracy,\nmuch promoted by President Lee. Our deep commitment\nto the cause of peace prompts us to view with concern the\ngrowing differences and instability in the region during\nthe last year. We fear that these threaten peace and might\nunleash a new armaments race. For this reason, we trust\nthat the differences will be resolved through constructive\n8\n\n\ndialogue and negotiation in good faith, with respect for the\ninterests of the whole Chinese people.\nWe must remember that the United Nations was\nestablished with precisely the mandate of eradicating the\nscourge of war, and it must again take the lead in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Costa Rica\ntherefore supports the efforts to reform the Security\nCouncil, which cannot be limited simply to an increase in\nthe number of its members, even if this might be useful.\nRather, the reform effort must centre on the Council\u2019s\nrevitalization.\nFifty years ago Costa Rica abolished its army. In line\nwith this example, it has advocated disarmament throughout\nthe history of the United Nations, in order to build a world\nof progress and peace. The abolition of the army allowed\nour society to become an example of dialogue, respect and\nthe peaceful coexistence of all social groups. Costa Rica\nactively promotes demilitarization because it knows its\nextraordinary benefits for human development; in this\ncontext, we have proposed the creation of a fund for the\ndemilitarization of Central America, as well as the\nstrengthening of, and full compliance with, the mechanisms\nof international law, in order to guarantee international\npeace and security and respect for human rights throughout\nthe world.\nCosta Rica considers that humanitarian crises are in\nthemselves threats to international peace and security. When\nthey arise, the United Nations and the Security Council\nmust not attempt to avoid their responsibility, whatever\nreasons are invoked. Nowadays any massive violation of\nhuman rights, any humanitarian emergency, requires the\ncoordinated action of the international community, through\nthis Organization. For there to be justice at the global level,\nthe rule of law and full compliance with the principles that\ngave birth to the United Nations must prevail.\nIn this context, we recall the importance of the prompt\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, and thus\ncall on all States that have not yet done so to sign the\nStatute with a view to its prompt ratification, and we\nreiterate the need to accelerate the negotiations on its rules\nof procedure. Costa Rica hopes to receive promptly the\nfinal text in order to proceed to its ratification.\nFurthermore, we must recognize that conflicts and\ncrises are multifaceted and that they present a series of\npolitical, military and economic problems. In this context,\naction undertaken by the United Nations must be designed\nnot only to re-establish peace in military terms but also to\nre-establish peace in terms of social justice, democracy\nand development. The actions taken by this Organization\nshould not be centred only on the Security Council but\nmust actively include the General Assembly, the\nEconomic and Social Council and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme as participants in the peace-\nbuilding process.\nMy people\u2019s manifest desire is for the new century\nto be truly the century of human rights and human\ndevelopment. I would like to express to the international\ncommunity the desire of a people that, since the\nnineteenth century, has been building the foundation of a\nfar-sighted society by balancing in a single equation\nrespect for human rights, freedom, peace, active tolerance,\nfraternity, democracy and solidarity.\nThe end of the cold war, the knowledge-based\neconomy, awareness of gender issues, an understanding of\nthe rights of the persons with disabilities and of\nminorities, respect for the rights of the future generations\nand for environmental protection, and the processes of\nglobalization have all begun to delineate a new human\norder: a twenty-first century with a more human mankind.\nIn this new context, which is just now showing its initial\ncharacteristics, the human development agenda and the\nhuman rights agenda must coincide and complement each\nother. The twenty-first century is taking shape as that in\nwhich individuals and peoples will demand the right to\nhuman development, which is nothing more than the\nappropriate implementation and effectiveness of the\ninstitutions of freedom: human rights, the rule of law,\npluralism, competition, solidarity and harmony with\nnature.\nIt is at once a right and a duty to take part, actively,\ncreatively and jointly, in the creation of such\ndevelopment, because the twenty-first century is called\nupon to be the century of high-intensity citizenship. Male\nand female citizens are, together with the State and the\ninternational community, the creators of their own\nopportunities and the builders of their own development.\nPassivity is a thing of the past.\nWe in Costa Rica who are part of this change\ngreatly value the foresight and sense of responsibility of\nour forefathers, which have made of our small motherland\nthe second-ranking country in Latin America in terms of\nhuman development and the oldest and most stable\ndemocracy in the region. Even as early as the end of the\nnineteenth century, Costa Ricans enjoyed the continent\u2019s\nhighest levels of education and health, thanks to the\n9\n\n\ncountry\u2019s far-sighted devotion to education, the rule of law,\ndemocracy, social solidarity and international trade. Since\nthe early days of our independent and republican life,\nsolidarity and human rights, in their fullness, have been a\nway of life for us Costa Ricans. Not in vain was our first\nConstitution called the \u201cCovenant of Harmony\u201d. Thus, last\nyear when hurricane Mitch devastated Central America, in\nthe midst of the pain over the loss of Costa Rican lives and\nthe serious economic damage, we also took on the suffering\nof our Central American brothers and sisters. We were side\nby side with them, sharing with them our food, medicine\nand territory.\nFaithful to its humanitarian tradition, Costa Rica\nimplemented the most generous immigration policy put\nforward by any nation in recent years, giving hundreds of\nthousands of illegal immigrants from the region \u2014\namounting to more than 10 per cent of our population \u2014\nthe opportunity to normalize their situation with a minimum\nof requirements, as well as the opportunity to enjoy full\nequality with our nationals in access to our social welfare\ninstitutions. We hope that other countries that are sought\nout by immigrants because of war, poverty, natural\ncatastrophes and ethnic conflicts will follow this example.\nOur country is making great efforts to look after these\nhundreds of thousands of immigrants; therefore, we reiterate\nour need to be helped so that we can strengthen the health,\neducation and basic-services systems that we use in order\nto meet their needs.\nAt this end of the century, it has been my task to\npromote vital transformations for the future of our small\nnation. We are protecting human beings even before they\nare born. We are fighting against child labour and the\nsexual exploitation of minors. We are opening havens for\nour adolescent mothers, and we are fighting the aggression\nsuffered by women in many homes the world over. We are\nstrengthening the family, providing it with more and better\nopportunities. We are working in favour of the rights of\nelder adults and those of workers, in order to deepen our\nsocial achievements of the 1940s and to guarantee a\nretirement pension in old age as a universal human right.\nCosta Rica is today acknowledged to be the healthiest\nsociety in Latin America, with high levels of computer\nliteracy. It is the oldest democracy on the continent and a\nleader in the conservation and protection of the\nenvironment. Its human development levels are comparable\nto those of developed countries. Nevertheless, we face\nserious problems that prevent us from indulging in\nmisguided self-congratulation.\nWe are aware that progress in the field of\ndevelopment depends on our own actions and on the\ninternational context. Human, civil, cultural, economic,\npolitical and social rights have equal importance and\ncomplement one another. Having acknowledged the\nindivisibility and interdependence of these rights, it is a\nmatter of concern that there is still some reluctance to\naccept the right of all nations to human development.\nThe awarding of the Nobel Prize to Amartya Sen for\nhis work on the welfare economy and on the\nunderstanding of poverty, inequality and hunger reminds\nus that global development must include the fight against\ninequalities and extreme poverty. This, however, must not\nbe a struggle in which developed countries take part only\nout of a feeling of human solidarity; rather, it must be a\nstruggle that involves the entire system of nations through\nthe creation of appropriate instruments and mechanisms\nfor action that offer opportunities for development\nthrough trade and investment. We welcomed the views of\nHarvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs \u2014 published\nrecently in The Economist and supported yesterday by\nPresident Clinton and today by Vice-Chancellor Fischer\nof Germany \u2014 regarding the urgent need to establish new\nmechanisms to ensure the necessary resources for the\npurchase of medicines and vaccines to combat tropical\ndiseases, thus securing their development and ensuring\ntheir distribution to the poorest and most helpless sectors\nof mankind.\nCosta Rica has spoken out to have the international\neconomic order allow the development of those countries\nthat are lagging behind. If we do not take action in this\ndirection, the conditions necessary for the long-term\nmaintenance of international peace and security will not\nbe created. We have constantly advocated a more just and\nequitable economic and commercial order, one that will\nprovide all nations with access to the benefits of the\nglobalization process and that will provide small\ndeveloping States with better opportunities to enter into\ncommercial agreements. Before the European Union we\nhave also advocated secure and tariff-free access for Latin\nAmerican agricultural products to the European Union\nmarkets, whose protectionism costs Latin America $4.223\nbillion dollars annually.\nIn order to promote the development of small States,\nit is indispensable to establish open trade systems so that\ntrade and investment can become engines of economic\ngrowth and so that more and better opportunities for\nemployment will be created in a region that suffers\npoverty and unemployment.\n10\n\n\nThe developed countries' trade restrictions are barriers\nto our human development, as are the policies of the\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrict\nsupplies of oil and to raise its price artificially at a time\nwhen the traditional exports of Latin America are suffering\na dramatic slump in prices.\nOn the other hand, the nations gathered here face the\nchallenge of building an international financial system that\nwill protect small States from economic crises. Small\neconomies do not cause the crises, but we do suffer their\nadverse effects and we have not received the necessary\nsupport to face them. To correct this situation, Costa Rica\nproposes the creation of a precautionary fund with a\nflexible and speedy financial mechanism to solve the\nfinancial emergencies of small and vulnerable States, which\nare frequently forgotten by the international financial\ncommunity because of their limited global impact.\nAs a country that has succeeded in building a culture\nof protecting and preserving the environment, we stress, as\nwe did at the summit between Europe and Latin America\nheld this year in Rio de Janeiro, the urgent need to build an\ninternational system that will reward those who protect the\nenvironment and penalize those who contaminate or destroy\nit. Currently, my country is developing a system of\npayments to the owners of forests for environmental\nservices and more than one fourth of our territory is\nprotected in reservations or national parks. Costa Rica\nreiterates the need to take action to better apply the Kyoto\nProtocol; to make greater use of new markets; and to\ndetermine efficiently the costs of pollution and the profits\nof preservation in order to maintain the sustainable use of\nnatural resources.\nJointly with Norway, we performed the first global\ntransaction of certificates of greenhouse-gases reduction.\nThis mechanism should receive the support of all countries,\nnot only in order to apply the right to human and\nsustainable development in each country, but also to extend\nthe life of the human species on our planet. Let us recall\nthat, in this task, the obligations are shared but\ndifferentiated. It is time to move from words to deeds.\nIt is clear that, if financial systems of broader\ncoverage are not established; if more open trade schemes\nare not implemented; if protectionism by developed\ncountries, which limits our access to their markets, is not\nreduced; and if the global benefits of our forests are not\nrecognized, developing countries will see a decline in their\nopportunities for economic growth; inequalities will\nincrease; poverty will further deepen; political stability and\nsocial peace will be threatened; the loss of natural\nresources will rise; and illegal immigration towards\ndeveloped nations will intensify, all creating an\nenvironment of instability and uncertainty harmful to the\nnew millennium.\nWanting the developed countries to recognize the\nright to human development of small countries is not\nutopian. It is the real aspiration of those peoples that have\nfaced with meagre resources the tragedies of wars and the\nwrath of nature. Solidarity and fraternity among nations\nmust be genuine. The twenty-first century awaits us. Let\nus all join hands. Humankind must enter this new age\nunited. The twenty-first century must be the century of\nhuman rights \u2014 the century of human development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I take great\npleasure in congratulating the President on his well-\ndeserved election, which honours him personally and his\ngreat country, Namibia. On behalf of the Ecuadorian\nGovernment and on my own behalf, allow me to greet\nhim most cordially and wish him every measure of\nsuccess.\nI warmly welcome the three new members of this\nOrganization, Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga, and congratulate\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, Mr. Didier\nOpertti, for the intelligent way with which he conducted\nthe work of the previous session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe border conflict between Ecuador and Peru that\nhad prevailed since the very foundation of our republics,\nduring the first part of the last century, was concluded on\n26 October 1998 by means of a negotiation process begun\n22\n\n\nin February 1995. This historic event, reached by the\nsigning of the peace agreement in Brasilia, allowed the two\ncountries to change their relations entirely and to transform\nthe conflict into peace and, now, to transform peace into\ndevelopment.\nImmediately upon the signing of the peace agreement,\nMr. Jamil Mahuad, President of the Republic of Ecuador,\nput an end to the acquisition of war materials, reduced\nmandatory military service and, in close collaboration with\nEcuadorian soldiers, reoriented the action of the armed\nforces toward tasks linked to development and internal\nsecurity.\nThe comprehensive peace formula, reached with the\nassistance of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States,\nincluded not only the delimitation of the border, but also a\ntreaty on navigation and trade, a broad-ranging agreement\non the integration of borders and the establishment of a\ncommission on building trust and security, among several\nother peace measures.\nIn accordance with the agreement, Ecuador and Peru\nhave established an institutional structure that is now fully\noperational in order to attain the goals of an ambitious\nprogramme that includes the construction of five bi-national\nroads, joint development of our river basins, the building of\nphysical infrastructure and the achievement of a human\ndevelopment programme designed to improve the living\nstandards of the residents along our borders, who during so\nmany decades of stagnation in their territories were victims,\nparalysed by fear and uncertainty.\nTo reach this goal, we have combined our efforts,\nconvinced, at the same time, that we will be able to count\non international cooperation. We hope that the border\nbetween Ecuador and Peru will serve as an example of the\nfruits of peace for the world. We want to see highways\ninstead of trenches, irrigation canals instead of\nfortifications, hospitals instead of combat airplanes and\nelectric plants instead of missiles and anti-personal mines.\nIn the name of Ecuador, I call upon the international\ncommunity, on each one of the member countries, on\nfinancial and development cooperation organizations and on\nnon-governmental organizations to contribute their aid,\nsmall or large, to this new peaceful and friendly space our\ntwo Latin American nations have built.\nHaving resolved its long-standing border dispute,\nEcuador reiterates its traditional commitment to continue a\npermanent search for mutual agreements through the\npeaceful settlement of disputes and its firm decision not\nto become involved in any international war conflict.\nWithin the framework of these principles, Ecuador\nrecognizes the gravity of the armed confrontation that is\nsearing its neighbour the Republic of Colombia, but\nconsiders that fight to be of an internal nature. Hence, it\nfully supports the efforts of the Government of President\nAndr\u00e9s Pastrana to reach peace by negotiating with the\nrebel groups in that country. In that regard, any intention\nto internationalize an armed conflict whose solution\nconcerns only the people of Colombia could be counter-\nproductive and dangerous.\nThe struggle for development and the efforts to\ncombat poverty undertaken by Ecuador during the past\nyear have been severely affected by multiple crises in the\ninternational arena and by natural disasters that strongly\nhit many places of the world, and Ecuador in particular.\nThe violence of climatic phenomena makes it imperative\nto urgently implement a strategy for international\ncooperation to prevent the disastrous consequences of\nthose natural disasters on the population, the economy and\nthe environment. With the support of the United Nations,\nEcuador has proposed the creation of an international\nresearch centre on the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon that would\ncontribute to improving the world capacity for prediction\nand early warning and to facilitate the adoption of\nprotective and precautionary measures to mitigate the\neffects of the phenomenon.\nThe aftermath of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon cost the\nequivalent of one half of our annual export revenues. In\naddition, the severe impact of the sharp price deterioration\nof our main export products, particularly oil, has caused\neconomic stagnation, the closure of production units and\nthe rise of unemployment. The crisis in the financial\nmarkets of Asia and Latin America has also spread its\nnegative effects over our country, while the prosperity of\nother, developed areas did little to mitigate the effects of\nthat crisis. Within that context of great difficulties, the\nconditions under which Ecuador renegotiated its foreign\ndebt became extremely difficult to comply with. On 28\nAugust 1999, the national Government used the legal\nmechanism of deferring for one month the payment of its\nBrady bonds debt service and at this time it is preparing\nto commence a process of restructuring these obligations\nthat will enable it to share in a more equitable way the\ndebt load among all the actors of this financial\nrelationship.\nIn 1999, poverty affects 61.3 per cent of the\nEcuadorian population. Last June the unemployment rate\n23\n\n\nwas 15.6 per cent. Four out of ten Ecuadorians have a daily\nincome of less than $2, and two out of ten earn less than $1\nper day. Global malnutrition affects more than 40 per cent\nof the children; one out of three do not complete the sixth\ngrade, and 40 per cent of all children and adolescents are\nschool drop-outs. These imbalances break social cohesion,\nlimit the possibilities for the exercise of an effective\ndemocracy and reduce the validity of citizens' rights. The\neconomic readjustment measures that the Government of\nEcuador intends to apply will necessarily be conditioned by\nsocial development objectives, such as the reduction of\npoverty and malnutrition, the improvement of health\nindexes, the increase of access to better education, the\nreduction of unemployment and the increase of family\nincome.\nEcuador strongly believes that market mechanisms\nstimulate competitiveness and efficiency, but also that the\ninstitutional framework within which these processes take\nplace must be capable of correcting distortions, putting\nlimits on financial speculation and contributing to putting\nin place more stable and predictable systems of pricing, so\nthat the living conditions of millions upon millions of\nhuman beings are not put at risk, and the stability and\nlongevity of democratic regimes are not threatened by\nsocial discontent and economic crises.\nIn Ecuador, President Jamil Mahuad and his\nGovernment have maintained democracy with a strong grip\ndespite difficult circumstances. Social discontent from the\ncontraction in output, natural disasters, the financial crisis,\nthe drop in international prices for raw materials and\ncommodities caused an increase in poverty and unleashed\nextensive manifestations of social discord.\nIn facing situations such as these, we need to have an\ninstitutional economic order that gives a way out,\nparticularly for countries with small economies, which are\nthe most vulnerable to and most likely to be affected by\nextreme economic crises.\nOn the eve of a new millennium, humankind is\ndeveloping one scenario alone, a scenario not only of\ninterdependence but also of globalization. In this global\nenvironment, all countries are involved in huge processes\nof market integration, liberalization of trade barriers,\nstandardization of norms and adaptation and establishment\nof institutions so that they can cope.\nNevertheless, globalization has so far not generated an\nequal distribution of prosperity, scientific progress, human\nhealth or cultural benefits. Right now, more than ever,\nwhen humankind is a single whole, we must establish\nshared ways to preserve, first and foremost, human\ndignity and well-being, the basic requirements of the\nhuman being, which are based on security and human\ndevelopment.\nOne example of the effects of human insecurity are\nthe great migratory waves that we are presently\nwitnessing. Ecuador calls upon the General Assembly to\norient cooperation strategies in terms of the human\nsecurity perspective in dealing with shifts in human\npopulation that demand a better distribution of prosperity\nfar from the extremes of opulence and destitution.\nEcuador eagerly welcomes the new focus on providing a\nmodel for international policy including the notion of\nhuman security, especially at a time when the scourge of\nviolence, drug trafficking, terrorism and environmental\ndeterioration have become more acute and when we have\nwitnessed armed conflicts around the world during the\npast year.\nCombating transnational crime is a shared endeavour\nfor all civilized peoples. In particular, controlling the\ntraffic in drugs and illicit drug consumption warrants\ncoordinated, universal action. Ecuador has made its\ncontribution and is prepared to continue making its\ncontribution towards this end. It has therefore acceded to\nmany international treaties and undertaken many\ninternational obligations, which it has fulfilled faithfully.\nOur country is looking forward to the Millennium\nSummit with great anticipation. The summit will be a\nhistoric opportunity for the community of nations at a\ntime when the challenges of the twenty-first century\noblige us to define and to affirm a common commitment\nto a universal project of understanding and cooperation\nthat will inspire the United Nations in the coming century.\nThe Millennium Round negotiations of the World\nTrade Organization, and other continental and regional\nrounds, should be processes that open up to the\nopportunities and challenges for creativity and effort and\nenable us to narrow the gap between the prosperity of just\na few countries and the poverty of the great majority.\nEcuador firmly believes in open markets, economic\nintegration, foreign investment and strengthening the\nmultilateral trading system. For this reason it has worked\nwithin the Andean Community on improving relationships\nwith the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and\nthe European Union on negotiations for the Free Trade\nArea of the Americas, and on its growing links with the\n24\n\n\nPacific basin, but it believes also that these processes must\nnot ignore the individual features of the smaller countries\nand must strike a balance that will enable them to achieve,\nsoon, an international system that is equitable and based on\nsolidarity.\nEcuador was the second country in Latin America to\npromulgate a national human rights plan, and it did so from\na broad-based and democratic perspective. The plan was\nconceived and prepared on the basis of a consultation\nprocess in which civil society and the State participated\nfully. This fact has earned special recognition from the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, which described the Ecuadorian plan as a\nmodel for other countries.\nOur country gives national priority to the project\nentitled \u201cTowards a culture of peace\u201d. In this context, under\na presidential initiative, Ecuador is promoting wide-ranging\nactivities linked to international efforts in accordance with\nthe United Nations culture of peace project and the\nproclamation of the Year 2000 as the International Year for\nthe Culture of Peace.\nOver the past year the international community has\nwitnessed an aggravation of regional conflicts: war has left\ndeep scars in various parts of the world. In this context, the\nUnited Nations has had to play a special role in resolving\ninternational conflicts, and its concerted and decisive action\nhas enabled it to resolve some of them successfully.\nNevertheless, strengthening our world Organization's\nactivities in this field must be carried out in such a way\nthat all measures taken under the Charter follow its\nprinciples faithfully so that the United Nations keeps the\nnecessary international credibility and continues to be the\nlegitimate mouthpiece and manager for collective action to\nmaintain international peace and security.\nAs a party to the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel\nmines, and given that it has been directly affected by the\nproblem of anti-personnel mines, the elimination of these\nweapons of war is of particular interest for Ecuador. Since\nthe signing of the peace agreement with Peru, our two\ncountries have begun removing and destroying the mines\nalong the border. We are sure that the international\ncommunity will continue to offer its cooperation in carrying\nout our two countries' demining programme. On behalf of\nEcuador, I thank the States and organizations that have\ncontributed or pledged to contribute to this cause.\nIn the light of the realities of the situation facing\nhumankind, Ecuador reaffirms its unwavering support for\nthe multilateral system and, consequently, for the United\nNations which, since its creation, has been the universal\nmeeting place of all nations to work for the ideals and\ngoals shared by all peoples inspired by the purposes and\nprinciples of the Organization. Ecuador draws its\ninspiration from the ideal of achieving a world of peace\nand freedom, of social justice and development, of fruitful\ncoexistence of peoples and nations, a world in which\nGovernments work together to solve the complex\nproblems besetting humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Please allow me to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at\nthis session. I am confident that with your wisdom and\nexperience, you will be able to accomplish your lofty\nmission successfully. At the same time, I would like to\nexpress my appreciation to Mr. Opertti for the\ncontribution he made as President of the General\nAssembly at its previous session. I also wish to take this\nopportunity to extend my sincere congratulations to the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga on their admission to the membership\nof the United Nations.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is of\nspecial significance, as it is the last one of this century. A\nreview of the past may help us predict the future. In\nretrospect, during the past century humanity, on the one\nhand, created unprecedented material wealth and culture\nand, on the other, suffered from the scourge of two world\nwars and the ordeal of the cold war, which lasted for\nalmost 50 years. Since the end of the cold war, the world\nhas been moving towards multipolarity and the overall\ninternational situation has started to relax. The\nmaintenance of peace, the pursuit of stability and the\npromotion of development have become the common\naspiration and demand of the people of all countries.\nNevertheless, the harsh reality suggests that the world is\nfar from tranquil. The cold-war mentality still lingers on.\nHegemonism and power politics have manifested\nthemselves in new expressions. Military blocs are being\nexpanded and reinforced, and there is an increasing\ntendency towards military intervention. Triggered by\nethnic, religious and territorial issues, regional conflicts\nand disputes continue to emerge one after another. The\nconflict between the North and the South has become\never more acute. The gap between the rich and the poor\ncontinues to grow. World peace is still elusive, and\ndevelopment faces even more serious challenges.\nHegemonism and power politics are the root causes\nof the turmoil in today\u2019s world. The outbreak of war in\nKosovo sounded a resounding alarm. A regional military\norganization, in the name of humanitarianism and human\nrights, bypassed the United Nations to take large-scale\n15\n\n\nmilitary actions against a sovereign State, thus creating an\nominous precedent in international relations. This act was\na violation of the United Nations Charter and other\nuniversally recognized norms governing international\nrelations. It has eroded the leading role of the United\nNations in safeguarding world peace and security and\ngravely undermined the authority of the United Nations\nSecurity Council. During that war, the Chinese Embassy in\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was bombed, which\ncaused heavy casualties and much loss of property. It was\nan incident such as has rarely been seen in diplomatic\nhistory, and naturally roused the utmost indignation of the\nentire Chinese people and the strong condemnation of the\ninternational community.\nAs a permanent member of the Security Council,\nChina has held a clear and consistent position on the issue\nof Kosovo. We seek no selfish interests and are only\nupholding justice. For the sake of peace, we maintain that\nthe Kosovo issue should be resolved through peaceful\nnegotiations on the basis of respect for the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\nand with guarantees of the legitimate rights and interest of\nall ethnic groups in Kosovo. We are opposed to the use of\nforce under any pretext.\nMankind is on the threshold of the twenty-first\ncentury. Where should the world go? What kind of new\ninternational political and economic order should be\nestablished? These are urgent questions facing the\nGovernments and the peoples of all countries.\nThe world is undergoing significant and profound\nchanges. A changed world calls for a corresponding new\ninternational political and economic order. World peace and\ndevelopment demand the establishment of a just and\nreasonable new international order, which is the common\naspiration of the international community. It should be\nbased on the five principles of peaceful coexistence, the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and\nother universally recognized principles governing\ninternational relations. In this connection, I wish to\nhighlight the following points.\nThe first relates to sovereign equality and non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of others. Such arguments\nas human rights taking precedence over sovereignty and\nhumanitarian intervention seem to be in vogue these days.\nSome countries have even put such arguments into practice.\nWe believe that it is the sacred duty of all Governments to\npromote and protect human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms, and that all countries have an obligation to\npromote and protect the human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms of their own peoples in accordance with the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and\ninternational human rights instruments, and in the light of\ntheir respective national conditions and relevant laws. But\nas political systems, levels of economic development,\nhistory, cultural background and values vary from country\nto country, it is only natural that countries should have\ndifferent interpretations and even diverging views on\nhuman rights. Countries should engage in dialogue and\nexchanges on the basis of equality and mutual respect so\nas to better understand each other, expand common\nground and handle their differences properly, rather than\nresort to confrontation or interference in the internal\naffairs of others under the pretext of human rights.\nThe issue of human rights is, in essence, the internal\naffair of a given country, and should be addressed mainly\nby the Government of that country through its own\nefforts. Ours is a diversified world. Each country has the\nright to choose its own social system, approach to\ndevelopment and values that are suited to its national\nconditions. The history of China and other developing\ncountries shows that a country\u2019s sovereignty is the\nprerequisite for and the basis of the human rights that the\npeople of that country can enjoy. When the sovereignty\nof a country is put in jeopardy, its human rights can\nhardly be protected effectively. Sovereign equality, mutual\nrespect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of others are the basic principles governing\ninternational relations today. In spite of the major changes\nin the post-cold-war international situation, these\nprinciples are by no means out of date. Any deviation\nfrom or violation of these principles would destroy the\nuniversally recognized norms governing international\nrelations, and would lead to the rule of hegemonism; if\nthe notion of \u201cmight is right\u201d should prevail, a new gun-\nboat policy would wreak havoc, the sovereignty and\nindependence by virtue of which some small and weak\ncountries protect themselves would be jeopardized and\ninternational peace and stability would be seriously\nendangered.\nThe Kosovo crisis has proved that to engage in so-\ncalled humanitarian intervention in a sovereign State with\nneither a mandate from the Security Council nor the prior\nconsent of the country concerned will cause a greater\nhumanitarian catastrophe instead of resolving the problem.\nIn view of this, under the current circumstances, the\nprinciples of respect for State sovereignty and non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of others must be\n16\n\n\neffectively strengthened rather than weakened in order to\nmaintain world peace and stability.\nThe second principle is the pacific settlement of\ninternational disputes. This principle, initiated by the Hague\npeace conference 100 years ago, is now an important\nprinciple of the United Nations Charter and a basic\nprinciple of contemporary international law. History shows\nthat deviation from this principle over the past century has\nled to, \u201cthe scourge of war, which twice ... has brought\nuntold sorrow to mankind\u201d, and to foreign aggression,\nwhich has inflicted tremendous suffering on the peoples of\na number of countries. In the current international situation,\nadherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of\ninternational disputes is still highly relevant to the\ncontemporary world.\nThe pacific settlement of international disputes is\npredicated on the non-use and non-threat of force in\ninternational relations. We maintain that handling State-to-\nState relations with the mentality and modalities of \u201chot\u201d\nwars, cold wars, power politics or bloc politics will get\nnowhere. All international disputes and regional conflicts\nshould be resolved in a fair and reasonable manner through\npeaceful negotiation and consultation on the basis of\nequality, rather than through the arbitrary use or threat of\nforce based on the power of military superiority. Only in\nthis way can fundamental solutions to disputes or conflicts\nbe found without complicating or aggravating them or\nleaving behind a hidden peril. And only in this way can\nStates coexist in harmony and achieve common\ndevelopment. This is the only way to lasting peace and\nstability in the world. Otherwise, the world will never be a\ntranquil place.\nThe third principle relates to strengthening the role of\nthe United Nations and preserving the authority of the\nSecurity Council. The role of the United Nations is\nindispensable for the achievement of genuine peace and\ndevelopment and for the establishment of a just and\nreasonable new international order. Strengthening the role\nof the United Nations is in line with the historical trend; it\nmeets the needs of the times and conforms to the shared\naspiration of all the world\u2019s peoples. In order to strengthen\nthe role of the United Nations, efforts should first be made\nto uphold the sanctity of the purposes and principles of the\nCharter. The most important reason why the United Nations\nhas been able to grow from 51 founding Members to its\ncurrent size is that it has acted according to these purposes\nand principles. Those purposes and principles of the Charter\nof the United Nations have already taken deep root in\ninternational practice and form a legal basis on which\npeaceful and friendly relations between countries are\nguided. It is the view of the Chinese Government that\ndespite the great changes that have taken place in the\ninternational situation, the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter are still relevant. We are opposed\nto any irresponsible interpretation or revision of them,\nwith whatever excuse.\nIf the United Nations role is to be strengthened, the\nauthority of the Security Council must be preserved.\nAccording to the provisions of the Charter, the Security\nCouncil shoulders primary responsibility for safeguarding\ninternational peace and security. It has been proved that\nthe role of the Security Council is irreplaceable. Given\nthe current circumstances, it is imperative to preserve its\nauthority and leading role. Any act to weaken this\nauthority or to impose the will of an individual country or\na group of countries on the Security Council is very\ndangerous. Instead of contributing to the maintenance of\npeace, it will further breed power politics and\nhegemonism and will give rise to endless troubles.\nIf the United Nations role is to be strengthened, it is\nessential to ensure that all Member States have the right\nto equal participation in international affairs, so that their\nreasonable propositions will be fully reflected and their\nlegitimate rights and interests protected by the United\nNations. Decisions adopted by the United Nations must\ngive expression to the common will of the majority of its\nMember States. Any attempt by a few countries or a\ngroup of countries to monopolize world affairs and decide\nthe destiny of the people of other countries goes against\nthe trend of the times and will never succeed.\nFourthly, we must foster a new security concept and\nsafeguard international security. The old security concept\nis based on military alliance and arms build-up and does\nnot help safeguard international security, still less build a\nlasting peace in the world. In today\u2019s world it is\nnecessary to foster a new security concept that satisfies\nthe needs of the times and to explore new ways of\nmaintaining peace and security. The core of the new\nsecurity concept should be mutual trust, mutual benefit,\nequality and cooperation. The Five Principles of Peaceful\nCoexistence and the purposes of the United Nations\nCharter are the political foundation for the maintenance of\ninternational security, while mutually beneficial\ncooperation and common development constitute its\neconomic guarantee. Dialogue on an equal footing, full\nconsultation and peaceful negotiations are the right way\nto maintain international security.\n17\n\n\nRelaxation in the international situation and the\ndisarmament process are complementary to each other. It is\nregrettable, however, that some recent negative\ndevelopments in the international situation have seriously\nhindered the healthy development of the disarmament\nprocess. How to promote the disarmament process, prevent\nan arms race and safeguard international security have\nbecome pressing concerns for the international community.\nWe are opposed to any attempt, on the basis of excuses that\nare not genuine, to seek military strength that goes beyond\na country\u2019s legitimate defence needs. We are also opposed\nto any attempt to restrict and weaken other countries in the\nname of disarmament and non-proliferation in order to seek\nabsolute, unilateral security supremacy for one country or\ngroup of countries. We call on the international community\nto take the new security concept as a guideline and\nwholeheartedly promote the healthy development of the\ndisarmament process, in the interest of world peace and\nsecurity.\nFifthly, we must reform the international economic\nsystem and promote the common development of all\ncountries. The old and irrational economic order has\nseriously impeded the sound development of the world\neconomy, further widening the wealth gap between the\nNorth and the South. The East Asian financial crisis that\nbroke out two years ago has affected many countries in the\nworld. To prevent financial risks and ensure economic\nsecurity has become an urgent task facing many countries,\nespecially the developing countries. The world economy is\nan interrelated and indivisible whole. All members of the\ninternational community should take a responsible approach\nand, in a spirit of risk sharing, strengthen their cooperation\nand jointly promote a steady growth of the world economy.\nTherefore, it is necessary to reform the current\ninternational economic and financial systems. The United\nNations and the international financial institutions should\nearnestly construct a framework to prevent and overcome\nfinancial and other economic risks. Accordingly, the\ndeveloped countries should take on more obligations. The\ndeveloping countries have the right to equal participation in\nworld economic decision-making and the formulation of\nrelevant rules. In the new round of negotiations that will\nsoon begin in the World Trade Organization, the reasonable\ndemands of developing countries should be fully reflected.\nCooperation should be strengthened on the basis of mutual\nbenefit. No country should prejudice other countries\u2019\neconomic security and development by virtue of its\neconomic, technological and financial advantages. We\nshould all oppose trade discrimination, the rich bullying the\npoor and the arbitrary resort to economic sanctions or the\nthreat of sanctions against other countries. The developed\nand developing countries both have their own advantages\nand should learn from each other to make up for their\ndeficiencies so as to achieve common sustainable\ndevelopment.\nMoreover, on such global issues as the environment,\npopulation, poverty and debt the developed countries\nshould not shirk their responsibility and obligation; rather,\nthey should take the lead in providing technological and\nfinancial assistance to the developing countries. We deem\nit necessary for the United Nations to hold a special\nconference at an appropriate time to discuss the\nglobalization of the world economy, in order to promote\ninternational cooperation in this field and to achieve\ncommon prosperity.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China will soon celebrate\nits fiftieth anniversary. For half a century, especially in\nthe last 21 years of reform and opening-up, earth-shaking\nchanges have taken place in China, and the Chinese\npeople have scored tremendous achievements in socialist\neconomic, political and cultural development as well as in\ndiplomatic and other endeavours. Following Hong Kong\u2019s\nreturn to the motherland the year before last, the Chinese\nGovernment will soon resume the exercise of sovereignty\nover Macao. At present, China enjoys political stability,\nsustained economic growth, national unity, social\ntranquillity and progress. Although difficulties and serious\nchallenges still lie ahead, we are confident and capable of\novercoming the difficulties, rising to the challenges and\nforging ahead with every aspect of the socialist cause of\nbuilding a strong, prosperous, democratic and culturally\nadvanced country.\nIn the face of international vicissitudes, the Chinese\nGovernment will steadfastly take up economic\ndevelopment as the central task, resolutely press ahead\nwith reform and opening up, consistently maintain social\nstability and unswervingly pursue an independent foreign\npolicy of peace. We are willing to continue to develop\nfriendly relations and cooperation on the basis of the five\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence with all other countries\nin the world and to make our due contribution to\nsafeguarding world peace and promoting common\ndevelopment.\nThe Chinese Government and people will, as always,\nresolutely safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity and will continue to advance the great cause of\nnational reunification. It is a fact universally recognized\nby the international community that there is only one\n18\n\n\nChina in the world, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of\nChinese territory and that the Government of the People's\nRepublic of China is the sole legitimate government\nrepresenting the whole of China. China's territory and\nsovereignty are absolutely indivisible. The ultimate\nreunification of the motherland represents the common\naspiration and firm resolve of all the Chinese people,\nincluding our compatriots on Taiwan. No force can hold us\nback in this great cause.\nThe Chinese Government will continue to adhere to its\nestablished policy for settling the question of Taiwan. We\nare firmly opposed to any efforts to create \u201cindependence\nfor Taiwan\u201d, \u201ctwo Chinas\u201d, or \u201cone China, one Taiwan\u201d.\nAll moves to divide the motherland are doomed to failure.\nChina's great cause of national reunification can and will be\naccomplished.\nA few days ago a powerful earthquake shook China's\nprovince of Taiwan. This earthquake caused heavy loss of\nlife and property damage for our compatriots in Taiwan.\nWe are extremely concerned about this catastrophe and\nexpress our sympathy to our compatriots on the island. We\nalso express our condolences to the families of the victims\nof the earthquake. People on both sides of the strait are\nbrothers and sisters in one big family. The disaster that hit\nTaiwan and the pains of our compatriots on the island are\nshared by the entire Chinese people. We will provide every\npossible support and assistance to alleviate the harm caused\nby the earthquake.\nI take this opportunity to thank the President of the\nGeneral Assembly and the international community as a\nwhole for their sympathy, condolences and assistance.\nThe twenty-first century is dawning. The future of the\nworld is bright, and the new century is bound to be a more\nsplendid one than this. The Chinese people stand ready to\nwork with the people of other countries for the\nestablishment of a just and rational new international order,\nfor peace and development in the new century, and for the\noverall progress of human society.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "This year is very\nspecial to Bangladesh at the United Nations. It is the\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of Bangladesh\u2019s admission to this\n\u201cParliament of Man\u201d. I bring greetings from the people of\nBangladesh.\nIt is gratifying to us that on this twenty-fifth\nanniversary, we have you, Sir, presiding over the General\nAssembly. You are a freedom fighter. You lead a country\nwhich was liberated in recent times, and yet, in its short\nmembership in the United Nations, it has contributed so\nmuch to the work of the Organization.\nWe convey our sincere appreciation to Foreign\nMinister Didier Opertti of Uruguay, our President during\nthe last session, for his excellent work. I would also like to\nwelcome the three new members of the General Assembly:\nKiribati, Nauru and Tonga. We sense their joy and\nexcitement, as we experienced 25 years ago.\nI convey our sincerest thanks and gratitude to the\nSecretary-General and to all Member States for their\nsupport and assistance in helping us overcome the aftermath\nof the disastrous floods that hit our country last year. The\nmagnitude of the disaster was unprecedented in our history.\nThe support of the international community was a source of\ninspiration and encouragement to our people in facing the\nchallenges of rehabilitation and reconstruction.\nI stand here today with pride and satisfaction. The\nFather of our Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur\nRahman, 25 years ago delivered our first address to the\nGeneral Assembly as head of Government of the\nsovereign and independent State of Bangladesh. His\nmessage on that day expressed the nation\u2019s gratitude to\nthe international community for standing by our people in\nthe darkest days of oppression; to apprise the international\ncommunity of our great struggle for freedom and self-\ndetermination; to articulate to the world our faith in\ndemocracy, justice, freedom and human rights; and to\nspell out the basic elements of our foreign policy.\nDespite the political upheavals in the country since\nthen, none ventured to alter the foreign policy guidelines\nlaid down by the Father of our Nation. We were thus able\nto contribute positively to the United Nations by serving\nin several important commissions and executive bodies in\nits system and participating actively in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. We were privileged to preside\nover the forty-first session of the General Assembly and\nto serve one term in a non-permanent seat on the Security\nCouncil.\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman carried the\ntorch of an indomitable people to the United Nations\nwhen he stood at this very rostrum before the General\nAssembly in 1974 and said,\n\u201cThe noble ideals enshrined in the Charter of\nthe United Nations are the very ideals for\nwhich millions of our people have made the\nsupreme sacrifice. I know that the souls of our\nmartyrs join us in pledging that the Bangalee\nnation fully commits itself to the building of a\nworld order in which the aspiration of all men\nfor peace and justice will be realized.\u201d\n(A/PV.2243, para. 2)\nTwenty-five years later, I am here to renew that\npledge. In these 25 years we have seen the partnership\nbetween Bangladesh and the United Nations mature. From\nour early reconstruction needs for national development\nto steps for empowering people and establishing social\njustice, the United Nations has been with us. We have\nalso been able to lend support to the strengthening of the\nOrganization and have contributed in its efforts to\neradicate poverty and disease, maintain peace and security\nand support the fulfilment of the rights of the oppressed\nand the subjugated. We sincerely hope that the\ndevelopment of cooperation between Bangladesh and the\n14\n\n\nUnited Nations agencies in our country will be expanded\nand strengthened in future years.\nBangladesh has noted with great concern the recent\ndecline in commitments by donor countries to the United\nNations development system, and to the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) in particular. Bangladesh\nattaches great value to multilateral assistance as a reliable\nand trusted source of impartial expertise and urges donor\ncountries to meet the commitments made in the Executive\nBoard of UNDP for the multi-year funding framework,\nenabling countries such as Bangladesh to plan development\nprogrammes accordingly. Recalling the recent statement of\nthe G-8 in Cologne, Bangladesh wishes to note with pride\nthat it is already utilizing over half of the country funds\navailable from UNDP for programmes relating to improving\ngovernance, which are helping us to address fundamental\nconstraints to faster development. Now is the time for\ndonors to recognize the commitment we have made and the\nsuccess we have achieved by increasing resources for these\nvaluable programmes.\nWithin months of his historic address to this world\nbody in 1974, my father and the Father of our Nation,\nalong with my mother and three brothers, the youngest one\nbeing 10 years of age, were brutally assassinated by a\ngroup of murderous and misguided military officers on 15\nAugust 1975. Amongst those killed were my uncles, my\ntwo sisters-in-law, two cousins and a host of other relatives.\nMy sister and I were the only survivors, as we were out of\nthe country at the time. Coups and counter-coups followed\none another at regular intervals, leading to military rule of\none sort or another. I was forced to live in exile from the\nlate 1970s to the early 1980s. I began to struggle from exile\nagainst the autocratic rule. After coming home in 1991, I\nstepped up that struggle for the restoration of people\u2019s right\nto vote and their right to freedom and to food. I was\nharassed and arrested by the authoritarian regimes, and\nseveral attempts were made on my life. But nothing could\ndeter me either from my path or from my goal, the\nrestoration of democracy. The movement grew in strength,\nand finally victory was on the side of the people. Today\ndemocracy has taken firm root in Bangladesh for all time\nto come.\nWe have strengthened the parliamentary system. Prime\nMinister\u2019s question time has been introduced. The session\nis televised and broadcast live. To institutionalize\ndemocracy and make it sustainable, we have ensured the\npeople\u2019s right to vote by introducing the institution of a\nnon-party, caretaker Government to be formed three months\nbefore each election. My struggle now is to guarantee the\npeople\u2019s right to food; in other words, economic\nemancipation to a sustainable livelihood. I am driven by\na desire to create a just environment, not only for my\nown people but also for all of humankind.\nThe creation of the United Nations was aimed at\nsparing the world from the scourge of another world war\nand to ensure that human beings are guaranteed their\nbasic rights. During its more than 50 years of existence,\nit has stood the test of time. National and internationally,\nwe have taken peace and development as two vital and\nintegrally linked objectives. We have taken steps to foster\npeace regionally. Immediately after it came into office,\nmy Government took the initiative to solve the Ganges\nwater-sharing issue with our neighbour, India. We solved\nthis long outstanding issue successfully in December\n1996. I visited India and Pakistan following the nuclear\ntests in South Asia and urged that we all must do our\nutmost to deserve peace in our region and devote our\nlimited resources to economic and social development.\nAn accord was concluded in December 1997\nbetween the Government and representatives of the tribal\npeople living in the south-eastern part of our country\nwithout third-party mediation. The accord brought peace\nafter more than two decades to the strife-torn area of the\nChittagong Hill Tracts. Peace now reigns in the area: the\nformer insurgents surrendered their arms and returned to\npeaceful lives; all 63,000 refugees from across the border\nhave returned; and there have been no incidents of\nviolence there since the signing of the accord.\nWe have no illusions that the key to our\ndevelopment and progress is directly linked to investment\nin our people. Our efforts are now being directed towards\ntransforming our vast human resources into a productive\nforce. Our development programmes are targeted on rapid\npoverty alleviation. We have adopted policies to\nstrengthen the socio-economic infrastructure of our\ncountry. We have given priority to the various social\nsectors, including education, health care, poverty\nalleviation and population growth control, and we have\nallocated more than 30 per cent of the budget to the\nsocial sectors with the objective of poverty alleviation,\nempowerment and human development. Our programmes\ninclude shelter and sustainable livelihood through the\nAshrayon programme, housing for the poor, health care,\neducation for the poor, microcredit, old-age pensions,\nincome transfers to destitute women and targeted poverty\nalleviation programmes. This effort towards the economic\nemancipation of the people is our preoccupation now: we\n15\n\n\nwant to build the golden Bengal dreamt of by the father of\nour nation.\nWe have adopted specific policies to ensure equality\nbetween women and men. We have promulgated laws and\nset up institutional mechanisms to promote women\u2019s rights,\nto ensure that they have choices and opportunities, that\nvictims are given redress and that stern punishments are\nmeted out to rapists for their deeds. The effectiveness of\nmicrocredit in empowering women has been phenomenal.\nWe have also brought women into decision-making at all\nlevels. During the last local Government elections, more\nthan 14,000 women were elected to office.\nIn our foreign policy, we adhere to the principle of\nfriendship towards all. It is a constitutional requirement to\nbase our international relations on the principles set out in\nthe United Nations Charter.\nHow do we address the critical issues of the new\nmillennium? We consider peace to be a fundamental human\nright to be attained, sustained, promoted and carried\nforward at all times. Without development there can be no\npeace, and without cooperation, no development. There is\nno option, then, but to have genuine cooperation between\nthe developed and the developing countries for the\neradication of poverty and the fulfilment of the people\u2019s\naspirations for development.\nBangladesh has been the coordinator of the least\ndeveloped countries for the last two decades.\nWe believe strongly that special measures should be\ntaken by the international community to help these\ncountries in their efforts to develop and to participate fully\nin the global economy. Human rights is the essence of\npeace. Unless we ensure that citizens live a life of dignity,\nwhere their rights are secure, we cannot have a just and\npeaceful world. This is equally true for communities and\nnations. In our region, we have nurtured the South Asian\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which has\ntaken many initiatives to improve the lives of the peoples\nof the region. At the subregional level, we are cooperating\nwith Bhutan, Nepal and India in the South Asian\nDevelopment Quadrangle.\nThe United Nations is the only universal body that\ndeals with all fields of human activity. It has been a\ncatalyst in many initiatives and has bettered the lives of\npeople around the world. In the 1990s the United Nations\nconvened a series of global conferences to address major\nchallenges facing humankind. They addressed problems\nwhich were beyond the capacity of individual countries to\nsolve and which called for wide-ranging international\ncooperation. I believe that the international community\nshould ensure coordinated and integrated follow-up for\neffective and full implementation of the decisions of those\nconferences. In Bangladesh, we have taken concrete\nmeasures in this regard.\nWe need to ensure that the United Nations can\ncontinue to meet the evolving needs of humankind in the\nnext century. For that, we must have an effective and\nefficient United Nations. I am happy that Bangladesh has\nbeen at the forefront of the adoption of these steps at the\nUnited Nations. In this regard, I would like to put on\nrecord our great appreciation of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan. He has made remarkable achievements\nin the short time that he has been at the helm of the\nUnited Nations. He fully deserves our wholehearted praise\nand support.\nThere is no denying the fact that the world needs the\nUnited Nations. But we must remember that it is equally\ntrue that the United Nations needs the world. All\ncountries must do their best to fulfil their commitments to\nmake the Organization strong and durable. This has been\nthe endeavour of Bangladesh for the last 25 years.\nMay Bangladesh live forever. Long live the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me\nfirst to congratulate you on your election to the\n\n\n\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. It gives me great pleasure to see the international\ncommunity honour both you and your country through your\nelection to this high office. I am confident that, given your\nvast experience and diplomatic skills, you will be able to\nsteer the proceedings of the Assembly to a successful\nconclusion.\nI join other speakers in expressing our gratitude to\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti, for the\ndedicated and effective manner in which he had guided the\nwork of the General Assembly at the last session.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to commend\nthe Secretary-General for his great dedication to the\nOrganization and the many contributions he has made in the\nservice of the international community.\nMalaysia would also like to join other Member States\nin welcoming, most warmly, the Republics of Kiribati and\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as new Members of the\nUnited Nations. We look forward to working closely with\nthem, particularly on issues of common interest to the Asia-\nPacific region whence we come.\nThe twentieth century is coming to an end. Before we\nenter the twenty-first it is useful to review the events of this\ncentury so that we may learn from our experience and\nhopefully we will know how to conduct the affairs of the\ntwenty-first.\nThis century saw the most destructive wars which\ndestroyed billions of dollars of property and killed millions\nof people. It saw the most inhuman dictatorship in Germany\nwhere six million Jews were tortured and killed. It\nwitnessed the first nuclear bombs that killed hundreds of\nthousands instantly and many more due to the after-effects.\nWhen the greatest war in human history ended, this\nbody, the United Nations, was founded. We thought there\nwould be peace as the great Powers worked together in the\nUnited Nations. But that was not the case. Immediately the\nvictors divided themselves into two camps and initiated the\ncold war. However, it was the threat of a hot war that kept\nthe war cold. Each side built huge arsenals of nuclear and\nnon-nuclear weapons and glared at the other across deep\nchasms of misunderstanding as they threateningly fingered\ntheir nuclear triggers.\nFor the colonies of European nations there was an\nup side. Fear of defections to the other side forced the\ntwo camps to relax their grips on their colonial territories.\nCountries gained independence, but their survival\ndepended on their skills in playing the Western bloc\nagainst the Eastern bloc.\nUnfortunately this choice to defect to the other side\ndid not last. Suddenly the Communist side collapsed.\nLured by the apparent wealth of the Western free-market\nliberal democracies, the Eastern bloc jettisoned their\nauthoritarian centrally planned economies and adopted the\nliberal democratic free market overnight. They thought\nthat since they would now have a system similar to that\nof the Western bloc they would get the friendship,\ncooperation and help from the Western countries.\nThey were naive enough to think that after 70 years\nof command economy and dictatorship they could\novernight switch to the free market economy under the\nliberal democratic system. They soon found out that they\nknew nothing about how to make the system work and\nthat they would get no help from the Western nations.\nInstead the Western nations saw in their incompetent\nfloundering an opportunity to destroy the Eastern bloc, in\nparticular the principal flag-bearer, forever.\nEven as the inability to manage a free market\nresulted in galloping inflation, destruction of State\nenterprises and massive unemployment, the hedge funds\nand the Western financial institutions moved in to devalue\nthe currencies and make debt defaulters of this once\npowerful enemy. Despite knowing that these people could\nnot manage a free market liberal democracy\nat all, they were nevertheless urged and threatened into\ncontinuing anyhow. There was no going back for the\nEastern bloc countries.\nThe destruction of the Eastern bloc was complete. It\ncould never again militarily challenge the Western liberal\ndemocratic free marketeers. Now there would be only one\nchoice for the world, and no defection would be possible\nfor the countries of the world, big or small. With this the\nliberal democratic free market capitalists saw no more\nneed to be gentle in spreading their systems or in\nprofiting from them. No one would be allowed any other\npolitical or economic system except what was prescribed\nby the sole dominant bloc. The true ugliness of Western\ncapitalism revealed itself, backed by the military might of\ncapitalism's greatest proponent.\n4\n\n\nFor the small countries, the demise of the Eastern bloc\nis a major disaster. Now they are exposed to pressures\nwhich they cannot resist, and very quickly they learned that\nthe free marketeers intend to milk them dry. As for their\npolitics, the instability of the liberal democratic system,\nwhich comes with a lack of understanding of its intricacies\nby the leaders as well as the people, meant that they would\nstay in a state of continuous turmoil, verging on anarchy.\nA few countries apparently managed to grow and\nprosper, but not for long. The currency manipulators and\nshort-term investors of the rich soon impoverished these\ncountries through devaluing their currencies and share\nprices. Impoverished and politically unstable, they were\nforced to borrow from the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF). Whether by design or through sheer lack of\nunderstanding, the economic regime imposed by the IMF\nfurther destroyed their economies. Soon their political\nfreedom was also subverted, and many had to accept\npolitical direction by the IMF, or the loans would not be\nmade available. For practical purposes, there was no more\nindependence.\nSo for the small independent countries of the world,\nthe future looks bleak. They are now being told that the\nworld should be borderless, that capital, goods and services\nshould flow freely between countries. There should be no\ndiscriminatory taxes to protect local industries or products.\nLocal banks, industries and products must compete on the\nsame footing as imported products, and their banks and\nindustries must compete with foreign banks and industries\nset up in their countries. No conditions must be attached to\nforeign banks and businesses which want to set up\noperations in their countries. They must have national status\nlike those given to local businesses. This way, it is said, a\nlevel playing field will be created and competition will be\nfair.\nBut can competition between giants and dwarfs be fair\neven if the playing field is level? The giant banks,\ncorporations and industries from the rich countries, with\nhuge local markets, can afford to lose money in a small\nforeign country when they make huge profits at home and\nelsewhere. The small businesses in the small countries will\ngo bankrupt if they lose money repeatedly. In the end they\nwill have to sell to the giant foreign companies or close\ndown altogether. There will be no more big local\ncompanies; there will be only branches of large foreign\ncompanies who will indulge in transfer pricing and will\nrepatriate most of their profit.\nThe efficient may produce better and cheaper goods,\nbut if a country does not export its own products to earn\nforeign exchange it will not be able to pay for imports.\nCheap high-quality goods mean nothing if you have no\nmoney to pay for them.\nThe markets of the poor countries may not be big,\nbut impoverishing them would result in lost sales for the\nrich. That was what happened when the currency traders\nimpoverished the countries they attacked. These countries\ncould not buy the products of the rich; that is, the rich\nlost their markets, and world trade contracted. Free,\nunrestricted flow of goods and services across borders\nmay be good for a while, but eventually it will destroy\nmarkets and result in contraction of world trade. The\nworld would actually become poorer because of free\ntrade.\nAfter the last war, the confrontation between East\nand West led to most of the colonies being liberated and\nbecoming independent countries. Being independent\nmeant the right to govern their countries themselves.\nUnaccustomed to wielding so much power, many of these\nGovernments failed. They became hopelessly indebted to\nthe banks of the rich countries. Their people suffered\nfrom incompetent and frequently oppressive rule. But the\nprinciple that prevailed in the third quarter of the\ntwentieth century was that no one should interfere in the\ninternal affairs of a nation. That, in fact, was the essence\nof independence.\nAs long as the world was divided into Eastern and\nWestern blocs, this principle was respected. But then a\npresident decided that his country had a right and a duty\nto see that human rights were not abused anywhere in the\nworld, irrespective of borders and the independence of\nnations. No one conferred this right on this crusading\npresident. But small things like that were not going to\nstop him.\nThe claim to victory of the West in the Gulf War\nwas regarded as a moral endorsement of the right of the\npowerful to interfere in any country\u2019s internal affairs.\nSoon, it was not just human rights. Systems of\ngovernment and of the administration of justice and the\nfinancial and commercial systems came under scrutiny of\nthe powerful countries. They insist that there must be\nonly one way of administering a country, and that is the\nliberal democratic way. They insist that there can be only\none economic system for the whole world, and that is the\nfree market system. They insist that there must be\nopenness in everything, transparency, separation of the\n5\n\n\nprivate from the public sectors, non-discrimination between\nethnic groups, and no discrimination against foreigners in\nfavour of nationals.\nAll these and more sound very good. They have\napparently worked for the developed countries of the West,\nmaking them rich and powerful, giving their people high\nstandards of living. But will they work for everyone? They\nseem to have forgotten that they took centuries to make\ntheir system work. Their transition from feudal oppressive\nrule was based in copious blood. Both rich and poor were\nmassacred as reforms were forced by a succession of\nuncaring tyrants, many elected by the people.\nEven today their system has not brought freedom and\nequity to large segments of their people, yet they insist that\nall the countries of the world, new or old, must\nimmediately adopt the only system of government \u2014 their\nsystem, their liberal democratic system. The newly\nindependent countries, which knew only the authoritarian\nsystem of government, cannot but fail. The former\nCommunist countries in particular found themselves unable\nto cope with the destabilizing challenges directed at\ngovernment authority in a liberal democracy.\nBut the new countries are not going to be allowed\ntime to learn and operate the system. They must change\nnow, immediately. If their countries are destabilized, if their\npeople suffer, if they regress economically, that is\nirrelevant. The important thing is that they must\ndemocratize and liberalize. If they fail to do so, they will\nbe forced to do so through arm-twisting, trade sanctions and\nmilitary action, if necessary.\nThat these measures are more oppressive than those of\nthe disapproved regimes and systems does not matter. The\nadoption of the approved system would destabilize the\ncountries further and cause further suffering. All this does\nnot matter, because the most important thing is the adoption\nof the system, not the benefit to be derived from it.\nIt is the same with economic management. There must\nbe liberalization and deregulation. The Government should\nnot help the business sector, should not give it any\nprotection. If businesses are attacked by outside forces,\nfairly or unfairly, and they lose, then let them die. They\nmust be inefficient if they lose, and the world has no time\nor sympathy for inefficient losers.\nAnd so giant currency traders, their funds leveraged\none hundred times or more, are pitted against central banks\nwith limited reserves and without leveraging rights. The\neconomies of whole countries and regions are destroyed,\nbut the cries for protection by these countries are ignored.\nThe fields are level, and the free movement of capital is\na part of the secret free trade. Everyone must accept\nwhatever happens because it is free trade. All the\ncurrency traders are doing is to discipline Governments so\nthat they conform to the system and do away with their\nbad old system.\nIn the financial crisis, Governments may not help\nbusinesses to recover. To do that means a bail-out of\ncronies. Let them die; let there be blood. Only then will\nGovernments be considered serious in wanting to reform\ntheir systems, to adopt best practices, world standards and\nthe only proper way to administer the economy. If the\nGovernment becomes bankrupt in trying to do this, that\nis all right. The important thing is to do things correctly,\neven if the country is destroyed, the people starve to\ndeath, anarchy reigns and the Government overthrown.\nThere is a touching concern on the part of the West\nover human rights. But the definition of human rights\nseems limited to an individual\u2019s right of dissent against\nthe Government. Millions of people in a country will be\nmade to suffer through sanctions and even bombings in\norder that a few dissenters may enjoy their rights of\ndissent. Apparently the rest of the population, hundreds of\nmillions of them sometimes, have no rights. Their rights\nare not considered human rights. Thus depriving millions\nof the right to work as a result of currency trading is not\nconsidered as a violation of human rights. In the Western\nperception only individuals have rights; the masses do\nnot.\nThe concern over child labour and sweatshop\nfactories is expressive of a sense of caring. Unfortunately\nthe concern is shown only when the products of child\nlabour and sweatshops compete successfully with the\nproducts of highly paid, high-living four-day-a-week\nworkers in the developed countries.\nChild labour and sweatshops are not something\nwhich anyone would defend, but consider the extreme\npoverty of the people in some countries. They have no\ncapital, no technology or expertise, no markets at home,\nno Harvard-trained managers. All they have is low-cost\nlabour. For the workers, the tiny wages that they earn are\nfar better than starvation and death. If we really care, then\ninvest and pay high wages. The sweatshops will disappear\nand adults will earn enough to feed their children. Forcing\nthem to stop child labour and sweatshops will only cause\nmore suffering for their people. Telling them to stop\n6\n\n\nproducing children is not a solution either. We know that\nthe poor have a higher birth rate than the rich. To stop the\npopulation explosion which the West is worried about,\nenrich these people. Closing their sweatshops and stopping\ntheir children from working will only impoverish them\nfurther and cause them to have more children.\nWith the end of the East-West confrontation, conflicts\nhave increased instead of decreased. The Palestinian\nproblem is still not resolved, but the sanctions against and\nthe bombing of Iraq, the sanctions against Libya, the\nconflicts resulting from the break-up of the Soviet Union,\nand the stirring up of unrest and rebellions, or near-\nrebellions, by open support for insurrection go on. Before,\nit was the Communists who stirred up rebellion everywhere,\nincluding in Malaysia. Now we have the liberal democrats\ndoing exactly the same in the same manner, complete with\nsupply of arms. Whether it is a communist or a liberal\ndemocratic insurrection, the people suffer not one bit less.\nThe United Nations seems helpless. Indeed, it is often\nbypassed by the big and the powerful. Now groupings of\npowerful nations or even one nation by itself seem to\ndecide when to step in and when to step out. While they\nlike to wield power, they are inordinately unwilling to pay\nthe price. \u201cTele-wars\u201d are conducted using high technology,\nsuch as the so-called pinpoint bombings, in order to avoid\nbody bags coming home. This unwillingness to face the\nenemy often results in the unnecessary killing of innocent\npeople and the destruction of the wrong targets.\nUnfortunately, no one should expect any change for as\nlong as the United Nations belongs to the permanent five.\nThe structure of the United Nations will continue to reflect\nthe glorious victory of these nations 50 years ago. For the\nsmall countries, yearly speeches and various anniversary\nspeeches will be allowed. Occasionally there will be\nmembership in the Security Council. But despite the fact\nthat at least three of the permanent five are vociferous\nadvocates of democracy, there will be no democracy in the\nUnited Nations. The only saving grace is the agencies and\ntheir good work.\nUnfortunately, some in the United Nations have rather\nunusual principles. Normally a neutral or unbiased person\nwould be chosen to study, report on and give an opinion or\npass judgment on something. But the United Nations chose\na person well-known for his virulent attacks against the\nMalaysian judiciary to report on that institution. The United\nNations then conferred on him total immunity with respect\nto the laws of his country without reference to or consent\nby the country. This immunity apparently extends beyond\nhis task of reporting his findings to the United Nations.\nHe may publish his opinions and defame people and the\nsubject of his study anywhere and everywhere. Is there no\nlimit to a United Nations Commissioner\u2019s or Rapporteur\u2019s\nimmunity?\nWe are told that Governments must not interfere\nwith the judiciary. Yet in this case the Government is\nexpected to instruct the judiciary not to act against this\nUnited Nations Commissioner for breaking the laws of\nthe country. I am not blaming the Secretary-General for\nthis. It is the peculiar system and principles which guide\nthe choice of the United Nations Commissioner or\nRapporteur that I find unacceptable. Nor do I think it\nproper to hint at dire consequences for the Malaysian\nnation if this man is not freed from court action for open\ncontempt and defamation. There is something not right\nhere which the United Nations needs to look into.\nBut small countries lack a public forum to air their\nviews freely. The Western media distorts everything that\nthey say or do. Again we are expected to give immunity\nto western journalists; they may break our laws, but no\nlegal action may be taken against them. I would like to\npoint out that in Malaysia not even the King and the\nhereditary Sultans are above the law.\nThis then is the scenario in the last quarter of the\ntwentieth century. We will carry this baggage into the\ntwenty-first century and the new millennium. For the poor\nand the weak, for the aspiring tigers and dragons of Asia,\nthe twenty-first century does not look very promising.\nEverything will continue to be cooked in the West. Just\nas communism and socialism came from the West, liberal\ndemocracy, globalization, a borderless world,\nderegulation, unfettered free flows of capital and their\nflights to quality, the disciplining of Governments by the\nmarket and by currency traders, and a host of other ideas\nall come from the West. And what is from the West is\nuniversal. Other values and cultures are superfluous and\nunnecessary. If they remain, there will be a clash of\ncivilizations. To avoid this clash there should be only one\ncivilization in the world. Everything should be\nstandardized according to Western best practices. They\nmay change only if the West changes. Thus the globalized\nworld will be totally uniform. Variety is equal to\nintransigence and must therefore be eliminated.\nMalaysia has just gone through a very traumatic\nexperience. In a matter of weeks, 42 years of hard work\nto develop the country was destroyed, in particular the\n7\n\n\naffirmative action to reduce the enmity between races in\nMalaysia.\nWe have devised our own formula for recovery. With\nthe blessings of Allah, we have turned around and are on\nthe road to recovery. But we are being pressured to\nabandon our currency control. We do not understand why.\nIt has done us a lot of good. It has done no harm to\nanybody except a few thousand rich currency manipulators.\nForeigners doing real business in our country have profited\nfrom the so-called controls. But we are still being urged to\nconform to an international financial system which has\nenabled the unscrupulous to destroy the wealth of many\nnations.\nNo serious attempt is being made to change the\ninternational financial system. So far there is only talk\nabout intentions. But the threat of financial, economic and\npolitical destabilization remains.\nMalaysia wishes only to be allowed to manage things\nin its own way, in the interests of its own people. We will\nnot harm others. We are not turning our backs on the\nworld. We have always cooperated with the rest of the\nworld, in particular with the United Nations. We will\ncontinue to do our bit for world peace. Just as we accept\ncriticism, warranted and unwarranted, we hope others will\nalso tolerate our criticism of them. Free speech would be\nmeaningless if criticism could be directed only at the poor\nand the weak and never at the rich and powerful. In\ncriticizing others, we are only exercising our right to\nfreedom of expression.\nWe are not too enchanted by the prospects we foresee\nfor the next century. But I can assure the Assembly that we\nwill be a responsible nation, friendly towards all who are\nfriendly towards us and harbouring no bad intentions\ntowards anyone.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I\nextend my congratulations to Mr. Gurirab on his election\nand my warmest respects to his predecessor, Mr. Didier\nOpertti. My very best wishes go to them both and to our\nfellow Members, together with my great appreciation to\nSecretary-General Annan for all his work on behalf of the\nGeneral Assembly during the past year.\nI would like to offer a special welcome to our new\nMembers, the Kingdom of Tonga and the Republics of\nKiribati and Nauru. They join us at a time when all of us,\nbig and small, are feeling what we might call the \u201ccutting\nedge\u201d of certain problems. These problems cut very\ndeeply indeed into the lives of the people we all\nrepresent. They are the ones the United Nations will be\nincreasingly called upon to address in the coming\ndecades.\nI refer to a host of challenges facing us on the eve\nof the new millennium, problems touching on all aspects\nof human affairs: overpopulation, migration and\ndiminishing resources; economic and financial problems;\nsocial and cultural ones; far-reaching environmental ones;\nand even transnational criminal ones. These are what I\nwould describe as today's problems. I say this because\ntoday we are at a special time when the birth of a new\ncentury is bound to provide renewed hope for the people\nwe represent. This means that every one of us here, from\nthe newest Member to the great nations of the Security\nCouncil, has a valued contribution to make to our efforts\nto meet this Organization's overriding future challenge.\nThis challenge, I feel, amounts to a choice between\ntwo basic approaches. On the one hand, we can continue\nto devote our severely stretched finances to deal with\nwhat I would respectfully call yesterday's problems. I call\nthem that because many date back to the founding years\nof the Organization. They are most obvious, of course, in\nthe Middle East, where a just and lasting settlement for\nthe Palestinian people is so long overdue. Others are the\nlingering concerns of the century before that. A few even\ngo back half a dozen centuries or more.\nYet we are still using up many scarce human and\nmaterial resources sticking temporary patches over these\nproblems. Of course, sadly, that is always going to be\npart of our work. We have them in every continent, every\nregion and subregion, even today in our own part of the\n34\n\n\nworld in South-East Asia. But this should not be the prime\ngoal of the General Assembly or of the Security Council,\nfor we have an alternative.\nThis is to give our wholehearted support to the\nSecretary-General in his efforts to direct us towards the\nthings the United Nations is equipped to do: identifying the\ncauses of future division and possibly inevitable conflict;\ncoordinating world efforts to address them; and devising\neffective solutions. I hope we can resolve to choose this\nlatter course, as it is what the United Nations does best. It\nis why, if anyone should ask: \u201cIs the world a better place\nfor its people than it was over 50 years ago?\u201d, we can\nanswer with conviction: \u201cYes\u201d. And if asked why, we can\nsay, equally surely: \u201cBecause this Organization exists\u201d.\nThis has been well illustrated over the last few years.\nThe United Nations has demonstrated great compassion for\nthe people of the world. Together with various non-\ngovernmental bodies, it has resolutely sought to direct\nMembers' attention to the major problems we will face in\nthe next century.\nThis is preventive diplomacy at the highest level. It is\nwhat we are trying our best to do in our own region in\npolitical and security matters through the Regional Forum\nof the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nand, in economic affairs, with our partners in the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC). The\nSecretary-General and his staff are therefore to be\ncommended for their efforts to conduct it on the wider\ninternational stage in spite of all their financial constraints.\nI believe that this aspect of our work is the reason\nwhy the United Nations has survived and, in fact, grown in\nmembership. It is why our people still look up to this body\nin their hopes for the future. However, if we are to continue\nto enjoy such esteem, it is most important for the United\nNations to strengthen its role. The way to do this is clear.\nWe must press ahead with plans for reform.\nWith this in mind, I am very pleased that some of the\nSecretary-General's reform measures have been successfully\nimplemented. Certainly, a few complex issues, such as the\nreform of the Security Council, remain unresolved, but I\nhope these matters can be completed quickly. It is a crucial\ntest of our ability to proceed with reform and we very\nmuch welcome the efforts of all who have been actively\nworking to achieve progress in this matter. What is called\nfor, as always, is enormous political will on all our parts\nand a determination to work together. We dearly hope that\nthis will be the hallmark of our millennium celebrations.\nToday's world, of course, tests every concept of\ninternational cooperation. In South-East Asia, we have\nfound this out the hard way. In doing so, we have learned\nmany lessons from the economic crisis which struck our\nregion two years ago. Perhaps the most important is a\npowerful human one. This is the need to work together as\nneighbours and partners, to appreciate each other's\nconcerns and to do what we can to help each other. In\nshort, we have learned about the vital need for\ncooperation in the hard, practical terms of today's\ncompetitive, globalized world.\nAt the same time, we have begun to recognize what\nwe need from this Organization and how important it is\nfor our people. Basically, it is to this body that we look\nto stimulate our awareness of what will be required if we\nare to meet the challenges of the new century\nsuccessfully. That is why we very much appreciate the\nprogrammes which have been set up this year and will\nbegin over the next five years to do just this. We offer\nthem our full support, whether it be on global matters, as\nin the recent International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment; on special concerns, such as this month's\nspecial session on sustainable development in small island\ndeveloping States; on such basic human concerns as the\nproblems faced by older persons, women and children; on\nsuch human needs as proper food and shelter; or merely\non the chance for our people to lead a peaceful and non-\nviolent life in a decent environment.\nWe are gradually beginning, therefore, to identify the\nkind of relationship we wish to have with this\nOrganization. It is one in which the world body as a\nwhole assumes the role performed so well by its many\nworkers in the field. It does not try to take on jobs it is\nnot suited for; rather, it advises, it provokes, it stimulates\nand it helps.\nThis, I believe, is the way forward. For this reason,\nI am particularly encouraged by the Secretary-General's\nplans for next year's millennium summit. I look forward\nto hearing him review and maybe more closely define the\nrole of the United Nations. I hope it will be along the\nlines I have mentioned, addressing today's problems and\nsuggesting tomorrow's solutions. On that note, Mr.\nPresident, may I assure you and the Secretary-General of\nour support in all your efforts on our behalf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me express my\nsincere congratulations, Sir, on your election as President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Under your\nleadership, I am confident the Assembly will effectively\naddress the issues before it.\nMy Government salutes the Secretary-General, the\nSecretariat and the United Nations agencies for their\ndedication and commitment to building peace and\nconfidence around the world. The Solomon Islands also\napplauds the Secretary-General\u2019s programme of\nmodernization and revitalization of the Organization,\naimed at creating a more effective United Nations to\nbetter serve the development needs of its Members, thus\nensuring peace and security in the twenty-first century.\nMy country will be a committed partner in achieving this\ngoal in the new millennium.\nThe Government and people of the Solomon Islands\nwarmly welcome the admission of our sister nations \u2014\nthe Republic of Nauru, the Republic of Kiribati and the\nKingdom of Tonga \u2014 as new Members of the United\nNations. This makes the principle of universality, as\nstipulated by the United Nations Charter, a near reality. It\nis also further testimony that the United Nations is\nindispensable. Its body of international laws is central to\nthe protection and security of our small island States.\nWhile there have been important successes for the\ninternational community, peace and development in many\nparts of the world remain precarious. The past decade has\nwitnessed the increase in the world\u2019s illicit drug problem\nand its related crimes, terrorism, large-scale movement\nand trade in small arms and the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction. Equally\nalarming is the rise in local and regional conflicts in\nvarious parts of the world and the threat they pose to\nnational and international peace, stability and\nadvancement. Poverty, meanwhile, remains a major\nobstacle to the economic progress of many developing\ncountries, especially the least developed. In addition, the\neconomic threats associated with globalization and trade\nliberalization have increased in recent years.\nFor small island developing States like the Solomon\nIslands, post-cold-war security now embraces human,\nenvironmental and economic dimensions. The most\nimportant asset of any country is its people. In a small\nisland developing State like mine, investment in human-\nresource development is not only vital, but a critical\nprerequisite to embracing national peace, stability and\neconomic prosperity.\nIn this connection, the Barbados Programme of\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States, as reiterated by many representatives\nat the special session earlier this week, remains a valid\nblueprint for the sustainable development of small island\n6\n\n\ndeveloping States, including my country. The environmental\nand economic vulnerabilities of small island developing\nStates present major difficulties to our efforts to achieve\nsustainable development. Climate change and sea-level rise\nare matters of survival for the small island developing\nStates. Annex I parties must fulfil their commitment under\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange.\nThe increasing incidence and magnitude of natural\ndisasters are particularly alarming. On the other hand, the\noverall decline in official development assistance flows, the\nerosion of trade preferences, falling primary commodity\nprices and limited market access could severely harm our\nsmall and fragile economies. Hence, greater international\nsupport is required for the successful implementation of the\nBarbados Programme of Action in the future.\nMy Government recognizes the importance of good\ngovernance to advance human development and to promote\nsustained economic growth. We are taking measures\ntowards this end. The call for good governance, however,\nmust be accompanied by the necessary resources and the\ncreation of an enabling regional and international\nenvironment.\nAllow me to outline the views and some of the steps\ntaken by my Government to address some of the\naforementioned issues, including our efforts to create and\nstrengthen accountable administrative and financial\ninstitutions, as well as the appropriate policies and\nlegislation.\nWhen my Government assumed office in September\n1997, we were confronted with a major financial crisis in\nthe public sector. The domestic financial system was\noverburdened with public debt, which the Government was\nunable to service. Additionally, the Asian financial crisis in\nlate 1997 further deepened the crisis in the domestic\neconomy. The public service was unable to deliver goods\nand services effectively and efficiently. The private sector\nbecame stagnant. This state of affairs demanded an urgent\noverhaul of the public sector and the need to create a\nvibrant private sector. Short-term, medium-term and long-\nterm measures had to be taken.\nThus, my Government responded with a series of\npolicy statements committing itself to a broad-based\nprogramme of policy and structural reforms. The overall\ngoals of the policy and structural-reform programme are to\nfoster financial and macroeconomic stability, to establish a\nmore effective and efficient public service and to create an\nenvironment for the private sector that is conducive to\nviable growth and sustainability.\nIt is obvious that, although we have the primary\nresponsibility to implement our reform initiatives, we\ncannot do it alone. The experiences of small economies\nthat have undertaken similar reforms indicate that such\nreforms can be accelerated by access to capital \u2014 often\ngrant in aid \u2014 technical assistance, technology transfers,\nassured markets for primary commodities and links to\nnew market locations. Therefore, the political will that my\nGovernment has demonstrated has to be supplemented by\nsignificant international support if we are to fulfil the\naspirations of our people.\nI am grateful to our bilateral and multilateral\ndevelopment partners for the positive response they have\nshown so far towards our reform initiatives. Additional\nassistance will be required to implement, in particular, our\nmedium-term development strategy and our public sector\ninvestment programme.\nPeace and development are mutually interdependent.\nIn this connection, the current insurgency on the island of\nGuadalcanal is a big set-back to our development efforts.\nIt has already affected various sectors of the economy and\ncaused the displacement of more than 30,000 people.\nWhile the crisis may not be comparable to major conflicts\nin other parts of the world, its net result in human loss\nand suffering is relative. This crisis has to be understood\nin the context of our smallness, our limited resources, our\nethnic and cultural diversity and our history. The Solomon\nIslands, with a population of 400,000, has more than 80\ndifferent languages. Thus, if the insurgency is left to\nescalate, it could seriously threaten national peace and\nsecurity.\nMy Government is, therefore, firmly committed to\nan early resolution of the conflict. The engagement of the\nCommonwealth special envoy is a preventive measure to\nbring about reconciliation between the parties concerned.\nI wish to acknowledge the assistance of the\nCommonwealth Secretariat in this regard. Three\nagreements to settle the crisis have been reached. We are\nworking very hard to ensure their implementation.\nI am also grateful for the prompt response of the\nUnited Nations Secretary-General to my request for a\nUnited Nations mission to assess the humanitarian aspects\nof the crisis. My Government is committed to working\nclosely with the appropriate United Nations agencies to\nimplement the recommendations of that mission. We also\n7\n\n\nappreciate the humanitarian assistance of our development\npartners, including the Red Cross, to the displaced\npopulation. My Government is fully aware of the need to\npursue the necessary policies and programmes for nation-\nbuilding through the creation of long-term development\nstrategies that promote social cohesion and national unity.\nMy Government attaches great importance to regional\ncooperation, security and development. The political,\neconomic and environmental regional organizations in our\nregion, including the South Pacific Forum, the South\nPacific Environmental Programme, the Pacific Community,\nthe South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency and the South\nPacific Geoscience Commission, provide vital mechanisms\nfor policy advice and action on issues of regional concern\nand interest, especially in the areas of the environment,\npopulation, fisheries resources management and\nvulnerability index. The Solomon Islands has benefited\nfrom their contributions and thus will continue to support\nand actively participate in their activities. The thirtieth\nSouth Pacific Forum meeting, to be held in Palau next\nweek, provides an opportunity for us to discuss how best to\nstrengthen regional cooperation in order to effectively cope\nwith the challenges of the new millennium and to harness\nthe opportunities it will bring.\nFurthermore, my Government will continue to support\nthe efforts of the Government of Papua New Guinea to\nrebuild peace and confidence on Bougainville. We also note\nthe contributions of other South Pacific neighbours and of\nthe United Nations in this process.\nThe Solomon Islands further welcomes the progress\nmade in the last decade in the decolonization process in\nNew Caledonia. We reiterate our support for the aspirations\nof the Kanaks of New Caledonia to attain self-government\nand political independence. The process towards self-\ndetermination for other remaining non-self-governing\nterritories, including Guam and French Polynesia, must also\nbe facilitated. The United Nations is well placed to continue\nto facilitate this process.\nMy Government is concerned about the deterioration\nof law and order in East Timor following the referendum\non self-determination. The parties concerned must now\nhonour the outcome of the referendum. Violence must not\nbe used to deny the choice that was made by the\noverwhelming majority: the chance to move forward. The\nSolomon Islands appreciates the leading role of Australia\nand New Zealand in the international peacekeeping mission\nin East Timor.\nAt this juncture, let me renew the support of the\nSolomon Islands for the appeal of the 22 million people\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan to be represented in\nthe United Nations and its related organizations. Taiwan\nis capable of and willing to fulfil the obligations\ncontained in the Charter of the United Nations. Its\noutstanding economic success has enabled it to play a\npositive role in promoting world trade and in eradicating\npoverty. It has rendered development assistance, including\ntechnical training and technology transfer, to developing\ncountries, including my own. It has responded to United\nNations appeals for emergency relief and rehabilitation\nassistance to countries that have suffered from natural\ndisasters and wars.\nRegarding the accomplishments of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan, are these not sufficient to merit\ndiplomatic recognition from the international community?\nTaiwan's membership in the United Nations system would\ncontribute substantially to the security and stability of the\nAsia-Pacific region and of the world in general. It would\nalso provide an effective basis for peaceful dialogue. The\nprocess of self-realization, supported by the United\nNations, has resulted in the membership of North and\nSouth Korea in the United Nations. The United Nations\nought to give similar consideration to the question of\nTaiwan. Ideally, the membership of the Republic of China\non Taiwan, together with the People's Republic of China,\nwill make a stronger United Nations. The Solomon\nIslands would welcome the opportunity to work through\nthe United Nations system to achieve a peaceful and just\nresolution.\nMy Government joins those who spoke before me in\nsupporting the call by the Secretary-General to accord\nhigh priority to preventive action to address the rise in\nlocal, national and regional conflicts. Are the current\nmechanisms available to the United Nations adequate to\neffectively resolve small-scale armed conflicts? Is there a\nrole for regional organizations to make a contribution to\nthis preventive approach? The reform of the Security\nCouncil should include consideration of a workable and\neffective preventive strategy. In addition, a\nreconfiguration of the United Nations regional groupings\nis necessary to reflect present-day realities and to\naccommodate the interests and concerns of Member\nStates.\nPerhaps the most profound challenge for the next\ncentury is how to deal with the imperatives of\nglobalization, that is, capitalizing on its positives and\nmitigating its negatives. In other words, the challenge of\n8\n\n\nglobalization in the new era is not to halt the expansion of\nglobal markets, but to find the rules and institutions for\nstronger governance to preserve the advantages of global\nmarkets and competition within a framework of cooperation\nto enhance human progress.\nOnly the United Nations and other international\ninstitutions have the scope and the legitimacy to generate\nthe principles, norms and rules that are essential if\nglobalization is to benefit everyone. Developing countries,\nin particular the least developed, need international support\nto build the capacities to enable us to become more\neffectively and beneficially integrated into the global\neconomy. Debt relief, new and additional resources for\ndevelopment and better diverse trade opportunities are\nrequired to facilitate this process.\nThe Millennium Assembly, to be held in September\n2000, affords a unique opportunity for all States to discuss\nand exchange views on how best to address the many\nchallenges facing us. My Government looks forward to\nparticipating actively in this important gathering. Equally\nimportant are the special session of the General Assembly\nto review the implementation of the outcome of the World\nSummit for Social Development and Further Initiatives: the\nreview of the Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women;\nand the Third United Nations Conference on the Least\nDeveloped Countries, to be held in the year 2001.\nFinally, the United Nations needs adequate financial\nresources to achieve its objectives. The current financial\ndifficulties do not bode well for the Organization. Member\nStates must honour their Charter obligations and pay their\ndues in full, on time, and without conditions. Despite our\nown economic and financial constraints, my Government\nhas settled most of its arrears to the United Nations,\nincluding contributions to the regular budget for 1999 and\npeacekeeping operations.\nThis century has witnessed vast advances in transport\nand communications technology, the increase of global\ntrade and wealth and improvements in the area of\ninternational peace and security. New information and\ncommunications technologies have driven globalization.\nUnfortunately, these achievements, including the benefits\nand opportunities of globalization, have not been widely\nenjoyed and distributed. Global governance of globalization\nmust focus on human security, development, equity, ethics,\ninclusion and sustainability. Let us unite in the spirit of the\nnew millennium to build a better world to live in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all,\npermit me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to your\nimportant post as President of the General Assembly. We\nare convinced that thanks to your wisdom and experience\nyou will successfully guide the deliberations of this\nimportant forum.\nOver the past century mankind has made\nunprecedented strides in its overall progress. It has\ndemonstrated with unprecedented force the creative genius\nand potential of the human mind. But at the same time,\nunfortunately, it has highlighted inherent human failings\nthat are the root causes of tremendous social and political\nupheavals, the further exacerbation of global problems\nand the emergence of new challenges.\nOne of the most significant achievements of the\ntwentieth century is the founding of the United Nations,\nwith its indispensable legal framework and mechanisms\ngiving it the tools to organize collective action on the part\nof States in order to counter current and future threats.\nTajikistan would like to see the strengthening of the\nUnited Nations and of its Security Council, as the body\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nIt is extremely timely and useful, on the threshold of\nthe twenty-first century, to rethink philosophically the\nlessons we have learned in order to define the principal\nparameters of a future world order and to develop a\nprogramme of action to put them into practice.\nWe see many valuable and mutually enriching ideas\nin such initiatives as the convening in the year 2000, at\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, and the\nmillennium summit; the proposal by Russia to elaborate\na concept of peace in the twenty-first century; the idea of\nIran of a dialogue between civilizations; and the plans of\na number of States regarding a culture of peace and other\ninitiatives.\nTajikistan, for its part, intends to continue\ncontributing, insofar as it is able, to this intellectual\nendeavour aimed at encouraging all States to join their\n\n\nefforts and concentrate on the main areas of international\ncooperation.\nHaving won their independence eight years ago, the\npeople of Tajikistan have made their choice in favour of\ndemocracy. Although our movement towards the reform of\nthe political system and market transformations in the social\nand political sphere has been seriously tested, despite all\nodds we have risen to the challenge. Today we can state\nfirmly that we will not veer from the road we have chosen\nof building a democratic, law-abiding and secular society in\nTajikistan.\nThe most recent proof of this are the results of a\npopular referendum on amendments to the Constitution of\nthe Republic of Tajikistan, held on 26 September last,\nwhich have demonstrated growing support for efforts of the\nGovernment to establish lasting peace and accord in our\ncountry and, on that basis, to build up further civil society\nand to form stable democratic institutions.\nMany States have needed hundreds of years to reach\ntoday\u2019s level of democracy. Tajikistan, like other new or\nrestored democracies, will have to cover that distance\nwithin a shorter period of time while gradually tackling\ndifficult and complex tasks in the civil, political, economic,\nsocial and cultural areas. It is clear that this will require\ntimely, adequate and coordinated support from the United\nNations, and we look forward to such support.\nI wish to note with great satisfaction that the\ntransitional period provided for in the General Agreement\non the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in\nTajikistan has entered its final stretch. Thus the way\ntowards further strengthening of the fundamentals of\npeaceful democratic development has now been opened up.\nIn this context of critical importance, we are looking\nforward in the next few months to presidential and\nparliamentary elections in Tajikistan, which we hope will\nbe successful with the necessary assistance from the United\nNations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe.\nNow more than ever before, the peace process in\nTajikistan needs active support, particularly material and\nfinancial assistance from the international community. We\nhope to see remedied very soon the situation wherein donor\nStates allocated only a small percentage of funds pledged\nin response to the appeal made this year by the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations for humanitarian assistance\nto Tajikistan. We would like also to express the hope that\nat the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, as in\nprevious years, full support will be forthcoming for the\ndraft resolution on granting international assistance for\npost-conflict projects in Tajikistan.\nThe Government of Tajikistan, despite great\ndifficulties, has consistently been implementing a\nprogramme of economic reforms in order to create an\neffective market economy. Step by step, an appropriate\nlegal framework is being set up to provide a favourable\nenvironment for the development of small and\nmedium-sized businesses, for foreign investments and for\nthe promotion of market institutions, including in the\nareas of finance and banking.\nThe efforts of our Government are being supported\nby the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and\na number of other influential and authoritative\ninternational financial and economic institutions and\nagencies. At this new stage of development resulting from\nthe transformation in our economic and political systems,\nwe in Tajikistan are counting on the international\ncommunity to provide as much support and assistance as\nit can.\nThe disparity in the value placed on human life and\ntragedy depending on whether one is in Europe or\nelsewhere is cause for profound regret. If a hotbed of\ntension flares up in Europe, it is contained and eliminated\non the double. And this is wonderful. However, it is\nparticularly hard for us to bear given the large-scale\nconflicts that have been spilling blood in Asia for\ndecades. And is Afghanistan really not a European\nproblem \u2014 Afghanistan, whose drugs are destroying the\nlives of hundreds of thousands of unfortunates, including\nin Europe? Afghanistan is not just Asia\u2019s pain and\ntragedy. It is Europe\u2019s, too.\nWe are extremely perturbed by the continuing intra-\nAfghan conflict. The international community must take\nall necessary steps to restore peace in Afghanistan as\nquickly as possible. It is unthinkable that the 20-year civil\nwar that has already wreaked such irreparable losses on\nthe long-suffering Afghan people should turn into a new\n100-year war and continue into the third millennium.\nWe are deeply convinced that the only way to put an\nend to the long-drawn-out bloodshed in Afghanistan is\nthrough a political settlement to the conflict which would\nhave as its cornerstone the formation of a broad-based\nGovernment that reflects and protects the interests of all\n\n\n\npolitical, ethnic and religious groups and strata of Afghan\nsociety.\nWe are sure that the main thrust in any settlement to\nthe conflict in Afghanistan should be towards strengthening\nthe leading role of the United Nations as the key mediator\nbetween the parties in restoring peace and achieving\nnational reconciliation: the efforts of other international\norganizations, and of States, should complement and\nreinforce the work of the United Nations; they should not\nbe undertaken in isolation from it, much less run counter to\nit.\nIn the context of strengthening the central role played\nby the United Nations in coordinating international efforts\nwith regard to Afghanistan, the \u201csix plus two\u201d group of\nfriends and neighbours must redouble its efforts. We\nbelieve that the Security Council should once again very\nseriously review the situation in and around Afghanistan\nand that it should take action, including imposing sanctions\nagainst those who are violating Security Council and\nGeneral Assembly resolutions.\nEngulfed in the flames of conflict, Afghanistan is the\nsource of the many dangers, destabilizing the situation in\nTajikistan, the whole of Central Asia and far beyond. In the\ncountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States,\nactive bilateral and multilateral cooperation is under way on\ncountering the penetration from Afghanistan, and the\nproliferation in our region, of militant Taliban ideology,\nweapons, crime, terrorism and various forms of extremism.\nI wish in particular to stress the seriousness of the\ndrug problem. Specifically, the protracted war in\nAfghanistan has turned that country into one of the world\u2019s\nmain drug centres. The Taliban movement has chosen an\nextremely dangerous course in turning the territory under its\ncontrol into a gigantic drug production and distribution\nfactory and warehouse. Also, despite appeals from the\ninternational community, this factory of death continues to\nincrease its output.\nIn this context, I should like to remind the Assembly\nof the proposal I put forward at the twentieth special\nsession of the General Assembly in June 1998 (A/5-\n20/PV.2) to create a \u201ccordon sanitaire\u201d around Afghanistan\nthat would put a covering force along the drug routes out\nof that country. This idea was conceived because, given the\ncurrent social and economic conditions in our country, it is\nno simple matter for Tajikistan to guard its 1,500-kilometre\nfrontier with Afghanistan reliably. There is also a trend\ntowards using Tajikistan not only as a transit route for\ndrugs but also as a reprocessing station, and even towards\nexpanding the market with Tajik consumers, all part of\nthe plans of international criminal groups to destabilize\nthe situation in our country. Still, the bulk of the drugs\nfinding their way into our territory is still destined for\ntransshipment to other countries, primarily European ones\nthrough Russia and the Transcaucasus. In this sense, the\nTajik-Afghan border is the first line of defence for many\nother States, and the joint efforts of Tajik and Russian\nborder guards to plug the leaks in it are serving the\ninterests of a substantial part of the international\ncommunity.\nWe note with satisfaction that our appeal has not\ngone unheeded and that over the past year there has been\na breakthrough in Tajikistan\u2019s cooperation with the\nrelevant United Nations agencies, in particular the United\nNations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP),\nwhose leadership\u2019s support for the measures taken by the\nGovernment of Tajikistan to combat drug trafficking is\nbecoming ever more active.\nUnder the agreements and projects reached and\ndeveloped between the Government of Tajikistan and\nUNDCP, a number of specific activities are planned to\nincrease the anti-drug capabilities of law enforcement\nagencies and the military, in particular those operating in\nareas adjoining the Tajik-Afghan border. An anti-drug\nagency reporting directly to the President of the Republic\nhas been established. Cooperation between Tajikistan and\nUNDCP is a shining example of how efforts can be\ncombined in order to fight shoulder to shoulder against\none of the most terrible human evils. We are open to this\nkind of cooperation with all interested States, international\norganizations and institutions.\nThe world has recently been witness to brazen acts\nby international terrorists who are increasingly operating\nunder the banners of political extremism and religious\nfanaticism. Tajikistan shares the view that the fight\nagainst terrorism is one of the most pressing problems\nfacing mankind today. Suffice it to mention the situation\nin Afghanistan, which confirms that narco-dollars are\nhelping create an environment favourable to terrorism.\nWe condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations\nand deem it necessary to coordinate the actions of the\nentire world community to eradicate this scourge at the\nglobal, regional and national levels. We think it would be\nuseful to convene, under United Nations auspices, a year-\n2000 conference to decide on joint organized world action\nto combat terrorism; this will be discussed at the fifty-\nfourth session of the General Assembly.\n3\n\n\nTajikistan has consistently supported United Nations\nefforts in the sphere of environmental protection. We\nappreciate the growing United Nations attention to the\nserious ecological problems facing our country and other\nStates of Central Asia. We hope that the approach of the\nyear 2000, which the United Nations has declared the\nInternational Year of Mountains, will help mobilize the\ninternational community\u2019s potential to help preserve\nbiodiversity and natural mountain ecological systems. This\nis of particular importance to Tajikistan as a predominantly\nmountainous country.\nWe note with satisfaction that the leadership of the\nSecretariat, in particular Under-Secretary-General Sergio\nVieira de Mello, is showing increasing interest in\ncooperation with our country to ward off the threat of a\nmajor natural disaster in the Central Asian region related to\nthe problem of lake Sarez.\nIn this context, we believe it is time to focus world\nattention on the question of fresh water in all its aspects.\nTherefore, Tajikistan has proposed that 2003 be declared\nthe International Year of Water. This initiative is prompted\nby the menacing deterioration of a situation in which\nmillions of people lack access to clean water. It is well\nknown that because of water pollution half of the world\u2019s\npopulation lives in unsanitary conditions; more than 5\nmillion people a year die, and more than 3 billion become\nill. As the population increases, the likelihood of \u201cwater\nwars\u201d between States for sources of fresh water grows ever\ngreater. Issues of water and other challenges of the new age\nare thus directly linked to problems of security in the\ncontext of interdependence.\nIn addition to its humanitarian aspects, the problem of\nwater has other dimensions, in particular economic and\necological ones. Water is our common heritage, and it is\nnecessary to ensure that all States share in the responsibility\nto preserve it for the benefit of future generations.\nConstructive global cooperation could become a worthy\npolitical dimension of the twenty-first century, and could\nguarantee that this will never acquire a military aspect.\nWe hope that the international community will respond\nfavourably to our initiative on the resolution of water\nproblems, which are of crucial importance not only for\nTajikistan, which is rich in water resources, but also for the\nmajority of other States Members of the United Nations.\nIt is vital to repair broken links and to create a new\nmodel for relations, particularly in the area of transport and\ncommunication. Addressing that key task will to a large\nextent determine the development in the next millennium\nof all Central Asian States that lack an outlet to the sea;\nthese include Tajikistan.\nMy people has drawn new strength from peace and\nstability. The construction of a railroad, industrial\nenterprises and social infrastructure is now under way\nalong the ancient historic Great Silk Road, which runs\nthrough the territory of Tajikistan. This year we are\ncompleting construction of a transboundary route that will\ngive us access to the sea. That is our contribution to\nrestoring direct communication among individuals and\npeoples along an ancient route that in the Middle Ages\nserved as a bridge between East and West and that made\npossible dialogue among civilizations.\nWe expect that in the near future goods will flow\nalong this route in both directions. This will undoubtedly\nfoster better mutual understanding among all peoples of\nthe East and the West, and also will have a positive effect\non strengthening regional security and cooperation among\nneighbouring countries in Central Asia.\nExperience has shown that turning to one\u2019s own\nroots is always a powerful means of spiritual therapy,\nespecially for those who have overcome the tragedy of a\nfratricidal war and are entering a period of active post-\nconflict reconstruction. Now we are at the stage of\nrenewal and of building a new democratic society, and we\nlook back once more at our long history. At a time when,\nwith active support from the United Nations, the process\nof national reconciliation is nearing its objective, our\ncountry is celebrating the 1,100th anniversary of the\nfounding of the State of the Samanids, which marked the\nbirth of Tajik statehood. We express our appreciation to\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization and to all the States and international\norganizations that responded to our appeal and have\nsupported efforts to undertake international activities\ndevoted to this momentous anniversary.\nThe age of the Samanids was not only a time of an\nunprecedented flourishing of science, culture and\nphilosophy and of the emergence of Tajik statehood. It\nwas also the time of the birth and blossoming of the\nmediaeval humanism that so enriched world civilization.\nAllow me to express the hope that in the third\nmillennium, now so close, the humanistic ideals will\nilluminate for the world community the arduous road to\nuniversal peace, sustainable development and peaceful\nconstruction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

His efforts towards bringing about the\nindependence of Namibia are well known, and many of\nus remember when he occupied a seat on the right side of\n33\n\n\nthe main section of this Hall, sitting as an observer behind\nthe name plate of the South-West Africa People's\nOrganization (SWAPO).\nMr. Gurirab's call for the return to Africa of its\nplundered artwork and artifacts struck a chord, as those of\nus who studied the African liberation struggles will recall\nthat some 25 years ago, when he was a younger individual,\nhe pleaded with this body for the return of African icons\nwhich adorned European and North American museums and\nprivate collections. My country is most supportive of his\nplea and would urge that the priceless treasures of artwork,\nicons and relics be returned to the continent from which\nthey were taken.\nMy country also wishes to thank his predecessor,\nDidier Opertti, who hails from Latin America and the\nCaribbean, for the astute and skilful manner in which he\nconducted the affairs of the fifty-third session. Likewise,\nmy nation's sentiments go out to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan, and we wish him continued success in the arduous\ntasks of bringing peace, harmony, development and justice\nto a global community not yet united into a true family of\nnations.\nA warm welcome is simultaneously extended to the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga on becoming full-fledged members of\nthe United Nations.\nTo the people of our sister Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) State of the Bahamas, we extend our profound\nsympathy in the wake of the devastation wrought by\nHurricane Floyd upon the islands of Abaco, Eleuthera, San\nSalvador and Cat Island, as well as other parts of the\ncountry. We thank donor countries and international\ninstitutions for the assistance given in the past, and we hope\nthat there will be a speedy response to the needs of the\nBahamian community at this time.\nIn this regard, special mention has to be made of\nKuwait for the manner in which it follows up on assisting\nsmall Caribbean countries in times of peril, and we urge the\ninternational community to work towards the preservation\nof that country and the maintenance of the dignity of its\npeople.\nIt was with delight and glee that I read the Secretary-\nGeneral's descriptive definition of globalization, as it took\nin some of the considerations that my country has brought\nbefore this body over the past three years. He stated,\n\u201cGlobalization is a summary term for the\nincreasingly complex interactions between\nindividuals, enterprises, institutions and markets\nacross national borders. The manifold challenges it\nposes, challenges that cannot successfully be\naddressed by nation States acting on their own,\nprovide the most immediate and obvious reason for\nstrengthening multilateral cooperation. Globalization\nis manifest in the growth in trade, technology and\nfinancial flows; in the continuing growth and\nincreasing influence of international civil society\nactors; in the global operations of transnational\ncorporations; in the vast increase in transboundary\ncommunication and information exchanges, most\nnotably via the Internet; in transboundary\ntransmission of disease and ecological impact; and\nin the increased internationalization of certain types\nof criminal activity. Its benefits and risks are\ndistributed unequally, and the growth and prosperity\nit provides for many is offset by the increasing\nvulnerability and marginalization of others \u2014 and by\nthe growth of 'uncivil society'.\u201d (A/54/1, para. 220)\nClearly, globalization leads to the reduction of the\nsovereignty of States, with the weakest and the smallest\nbeing the biggest losers. Sadly lacking in the arguments\nfor globalization is the need to give consideration to the\npace, direction and content of liberalization due to\ndifferent levels of development and the need to build up\nnational capabilities. Above all is the insistence on the\nprinciple of free trade for the developing world and an\nexemption from the same for the industrialized countries.\nProtective devices are inbuilt for farmers in the dominant\neconomies, which include subsidies, guaranteed markets,\npayments not to produce beyond a certain level in order\nto maintain price levels and quite often insistence that\nimported farm belt products come in by way of limited\nmeans of processing and under the most stringent of\nguidelines. On the other hand, when former colonial\ncountries provide preferences to their previous colonies of\nexploitation, challenges are mounted through the World\nTrade Organization by multinational enterprises. There is\nno more blatant example than Chiquita in regard to the\nCaribbean banana producers.\nThe sad thing is that there is clear knowledge that in\nmodern times there has never been free trade. It is not my\nintention to de-glorify Richard Cobden and John Bright,\nbut the repeal of the corn laws in nineteenth-century\nBritain had more to do with the failure of the potato crops\nin Britain and Ireland, strikes by workmen against wage\nreductions and an alliance of industrial and commercial\n34\n\n\ninterests against the landed gentry than it had to do with\nfree trade. Yet irrespective of the fallacy of this free trade\nargument, recipients of benefits under the Lom\u00e9 Convention\nare literally being told that they, but not the dominant\nPowers, must conform to and operate under the fallacy.\nAny disaster to banana production in the Caribbean\nwill affect not only the banana-producing countries, but all\nof the Caribbean Community. Our countries are striving to\nremove themselves from dependence on aid. Glenys\nKinnock, a member of the European Parliament, put it\nsuccinctly when she stated that the banana trade provided\na ladder out of poverty for the Caribbean region and that\nthe call for the regime to be dropped and direct aid to be\nsubstituted was unrealistic. She went on to state that it was\nwrong to claim that attempts to diversify were not taking\nplace.\nIn CARICOM, we do not wish to become international\nmendicants; otherwise the current situation, in which some\ndominant countries exercise undue pressure upon our\nmodus vivendi, will increase to the point where we will\nhave to dance to whichever tune the piper or pipers play.\nThe United Nations should be viewed as the foremost\ninternational body with a semblance of egalitarianism. It\nshould not be viewed as the institution of the dominant\ncountries in the five regional groups; and, more than that,\nit ought to be the body that stands up to the encroachment\nof multinational enterprises that attempt to stifle the lifeline\nor lifeblood of legitimate and sovereign countries. If indeed\nthe United Nations is the champion of equality, of\nsovereignty, of the maintenance of traditional practices\nwhich in reality do not harm others, then the collective\ncountries should denounce this imposition by a\nmultinational entity, which will bring ultimate and profound\nhardships upon our humanfolk \u2014 be they young men or\nold men, children or maidens, matrons or old women. We\nhave said it before, and will reiterate that what is being\ninflicted upon the Caribbean banana producers is an act of\nwar.\nThe perils of our States are certainly not limited to\nbananas, and Antigua and Barbuda, as well as the majority\nof countries represented on the Executive Board the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), were most\nsurprised to experience a challenge from a member of the\nSecurity Council relating to our first-country cooperation\nframework. This was presented, by a country with which\nwe have cordial relations, as being a matter of principle, as\nAntigua and Barbuda's per capita income is $8,000 and in\n1998 it ranked twenty-ninth in the Human Development\nReport. There was absolutely no mention of the fact that\nin the vulnerability index, Antigua and Barbuda ranks\nextremely high, due in part to the frequency with which\nhurricanes batter our twin-island State or threaten our\nlovely shores. Consequently, Antigua and Barbuda once\nagain had to offer a reminder that its graduation from the\nloan windows of international financial institutions and\nfrom development assistance of other international\nagencies, based only on the narrow criterion of per capita\nincome, which ignores the serious and persistent problems\nconfronted by Antigua and Barbuda and most Caribbean\nsmall island developing States, is both unfair and unjust.\nWe also had to point out that 5 per cent of our country's\npopulation consists of Montserratans who have been\ndisplaced by volcanic eruption. This has meant expanding\nour infrastructure to accommodate the unfortunate souls\nfrom the Emerald Isle.\nAntigua and Barbuda supports the concept of UNDP\nand the United Nations Population Fund working with\nand rendering assistance to countries described as having\ntransition economies, as well as countries which have\nsuffered the ravages of internecine warfare, that have\nabsorbed significant numbers of refugees and which are\nsubject to many vulnerabilities, including natural disasters,\nand are victims of economic practices which work against\ntheir advancement. The work of UNDP is valued\nworldwide, and countries which are most vulnerable\nshould certainly be at the forefront for assistance and\nguidance. We have to ask once again if we must be\npenalized because of our successes. I sincerely hope that\nin this body, particularly among the major financial\ncontributors, that it is not the view that small island\ndeveloping States cannot advance beyond a certain level\nof development, as, otherwise, they would be\noverreaching themselves and delving into a domain\nreserved for members of a certain club. Antigua and\nBarbuda takes its role in the United Nations very\nseriously and will remain dedicated to the principle of\negalitarianism.\nWe annually recite our vulnerabilities, paying most\nattention to the furore of natural disasters, and over the\nlast 10 years my country has experienced four hurricanes.\nWhereas it is a glorious sight to witness volcanic\neruptions in Montserrat from Antigua, the reality of the\ndangerous consequences is always present. We are\nadditionally faced with the activities of Kick'em Jenny, an\nundersea volcano off the spice island of Grenada. The\nCaribbean Development Bank is providing a grant to the\nSeismic Research Unit of the University of the West\nIndies for the establishment of a mechanism for\n35\n\n\ncontinuous monitoring of the volcano. According to one\nscholar,\n\u201cNot only will the communities of the Grenadines and\nnearby islands have to guard against debris ejected\nduring a volcanic explosion, but the entire Caribbean\nwill be jeopardized by the threat of seismic waves,\nknown as tsunami\u201d.\nThis is yet another example of our vulnerability.\nIrrespective of our trials, tribulations and unfair\ncastigations, my country, when appraised objectively, has\nbeen considered a marvel; hence its continued high ranking\non the human development index. We practise the\nWestminster model of parliamentary democracy and do so\neffectively. Our national elections are open and transparent.\nOur first national hero, Sir Vere Cornwall Bird,\nappropriately dubbed Father of the Nation, died this year,\nand Members of Parliament in both the House and the\nSenate were lavish in their praise of one who was\ninternationally acclaimed \u2014 particularly in Africa, where he\nhad an impact on many of its leaders, both during and after\nthe colonial era, and in the African diaspora of the New\nWorld.\nWe have remained committed to the empowerment of\nthe socially and economically challenged. Women occupy\nsenior positions in the civil service and are represented in\nsignificant numbers in the professions. In one they\noutnumber men. In the area of violence against women,\nlegislation has been enacted to give greater protection to the\nfemale members of our society. In the desire of the\nGovernment to ensure that its people enjoy a decent\nstandard of living and an improved quality of life, the\nGovernment has energetically tackled this responsibility.\nAnd, in the absence of truly vibrant private sectors to lead\neconomic growth and development as in developed\ncountries, the tasks performed by the Government have\nexpanded and have become more demanding.\nAntigua and Barbuda has, however, never been short\non ideas as to how to help itself and as to how it can be\nassisted internationally in overcoming vulnerability and\naccelerating sustainable development. Sustainable\ndevelopment is foremost in our thinking. At the sixth\nmeeting of the Commonwealth Consultative Group on\nEnvironment at the United Nations in April, we received\nsupport from the attending States for the ideas posited.\nIn the first place, Antigua and Barbuda hopes that the\nvulnerability index being developed by the Commonwealth\nsecretariat and the World Bank task force will be\nintroduced as soon as possible into international\norganizations. This must be borne in mind from the\nperspective that we have repeatedly addressed the\nlimitations and unfairness of using per capita income in\nassessing our economic efficacy.\nSecondly, following the decision of the disputes\ntribunal of the World Trade Organization supporting the\ncontention of the discrimination directed at the banana\nregime operating under the Lom\u00e9 Treaty, there is an\nurgent need for the World Trade Organization to apply\nspecial and differential treatment to small island\ndeveloping States as it does to least developed countries.\nIf markets in Europe are eroded for small States, those\nStates will deteriorate economically, socially and\npolitically to the point of placing yet another burden on\nthe international community. This deduction is made from\nan analysis of the dispute tribunal's ruling, which suggests\nthat the entire quota system for imports by the European\nUnion from the African-Caribbean-Pacific countries for\nall products is now under threat.\nIn the third place, we would like to reiterate the call\nmade for a disaster fund in 1995 by our Prime Minister,\nThe Right Honourable Lester Bird. He made that call\nfollowing the devastation of hurricane Luis, which wiped\nout one year of Antigua and Barbuda's gross domestic\nproduct in 36 perilous hours. Whereas the existing\nmechanisms address the purpose of relieving immediate\nsuffering and agony, they are woefully insufficient for\nreconstruction and rehabilitation.\nAs one who represents his country on the Committee\nof 24, the so-called Decolonization Committee, I was\nsomewhat taken aback to hear the Foreign Minister of a\ncountry that had previously supported non-intervention\nstate that the United Nations has failed to address well-\nknown conflicts of catastrophic proportions in a timely\nmanner. It would therefore seem that more and more\ncountries are moving towards the acceptance of joint\naction in a given country if there is a clear case of\ngenocide and a total violation of human rights.\nWhat happened in East Timor goes well beyond the\npoint of frustration. Since my country has from quite\nearly on advocated the right of the people of Western\nSahara to self-determination, we have been saddened each\ntime that plans for a referendum among the Sahraoui\npeople have been delayed. We believe that each and every\npostponement interferes with and impedes the will of self-\ndetermination. The happenings in East Timor will have a\n36\n\n\nfurther impact on the will of the staunch and hardy\nSahraoui people, and this gives us cause for great concern.\nIt is important that everything be done to avoid a repetition\nof what has happened in East Timor after people have\nexercised their right of self-determination.\nLike other countries, my country believes that\nintervention in affairs within another State should be the\nlast resort. But there are many questions to be answered in\nregard to oppression, degradation and dehumanization. The\nEast Timor example should set us working to avoid another\ncatastrophe of that magnitude. I have long marvelled at the\nprophetic brilliance of the former Foreign Minister of\nUruguay, Eduardo Rodr'guez Larreta, who in 1946 argued\nthat non-intervention could not be converted into a right to\nconvoke one principle in order to violate all other principles\nwith impunity. Nothing, however, is being advocated here\nexcept that we address ourselves meaningfully towards\nmeasures to avoid another East Timor.\nSo much have we been looking forward to the new\nmillennium that we have defied the laws of mathematics\nand brought forward the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury by making it come about in the last year of the\ntwentieth century. Even at the United Nations is the year\n2000 being proclaimed as the beginning of the new\nmillennium. Be that as it may, it is not sufficient to\nproclaim a new millennium and to have the grand, planned\ncelebration. The commitment to the eradication of poverty,\nthe achievement of peace and security and cooperation for\ndevelopment should be sincere, meaningful and followed\nthrough to the level of profound accomplishment.\nAntigua and Barbuda cherishes the United Nations and\nis not unmindful of the numerous advances that have come\nabout as a result of its impact in conflict resolution, the\nmaintenance of peace, the shelter and sanctuary provided to\nrefugees, the promotion of human rights, the eradication of\ncertain diseases and numerous other tangibles. Thus,\nAntigua and Barbuda remains ready to continue\ncontributing to the advancement of humanity and will, as it\nhas done in the past, insist on the principle of\nmultilateralism. Together, our countries, large and small,\ncan make contributions in overcoming the plagues with\nwhich we are afflicted and move towards peace, cohesion,\nharmony and the alleviation of poverty in the coming\ncentury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nfirst let me congratulate you on your election to your high\noffice and assure you of the full cooperation and support\nof the Austrian delegation. I am convinced that we will\nhave a successful session of the General Assembly, the\nlast in this century, under your able guidance.\nAustria fully endorses the statement which was so\neloquently delivered by the Foreign Minister of Finland\non behalf of the European Union. I would like to add the\nfollowing observations to that very comprehensive\nstatement.\nThe United Nations in many ways finds itself at a\ncrossroads. The Organization has to find its role and\nstrengthen its relevance in an increasingly turbulent world.\nTo be sure, we are able to make progress on specific\nissues. But is that enough in the face of mounting global\nchallenges? Much has been said and written in the last\nfew years about globalization, and I believe we are all\naware of the speed and impact of this very dynamic\nprocess. What we still need is a coherent political\nresponse to this phenomenon. We have to meet the\nchallenges and make the best possible use of the\nopportunities presented to us.\nWhile our everyday work must be focused on\nreaching achievable goals within a realistic time, we must\nnever lose sight of our larger duty to provide human\nsecurity in its fullest sense. This means that we have to\nprovide individuals and communities with security,\ndignity and quality of life. We have to protect them\nagainst threats to their safety and well-being, such as\nconflict, discrimination, poverty, organized crime,\ncorruption or repression.\nIn recent years, a number of initiatives have been\nsuccessfully launched, in particular on landmines, small\n17\n\n\narms and child soldiers. Austria is working very actively to\npromote the human security agenda, and I would like to\nhighlight three priority areas: human rights education, the\nfight against child pornography and the fight against what\nthe Secretary-General has aptly termed the uncivil society.\nOn the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the\npresence of the United Nations in Vienna next month, we\nwill organize a high-level meeting on these and other\naspects of human security.\nMost threats to human security have a human rights\ndimension. This is why a human rights security agenda\nmust include an overall strategy aimed at the strengthening\nof a worldwide human rights culture. Recent events in\nKosovo or East Timor have shown that the most basic\nrights cannot be taken for granted. Again and again we will\nhave to assert the universality and indivisibility of human\nrights. We therefore stress the importance of human rights\neducation, which is essential for the promotion and the\nachievement of stable and harmonious relations within\ncountries and among communities. We must redouble our\nefforts in support of the United Nations Decade for Human\nRights Education. Next year\u2019s mid-term evaluation of\nprogress made in the Decade provides an ideal opportunity.\nInstitutions and organizations with specialized expertise in\nour countries should identify specific ideas for further\naction on human rights education activities at national level,\nin foreign policy, and in the context of development\ncooperation.\nEvery man and every woman must know his or her\nrights in order to become a full and equal member of\nsociety. People must be provided at the national and the\ninternational level with effective remedies for human rights\nviolations. We therefore welcome the successful conclusion\nof negotiations on the Optional Protocol to the Convention\non the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against\nWomen. Its adoption by the General Assembly and its early\nentry into force will have great significance for women\naround the world.\nHuman security starts in the smallest entities of our\nsociety. The mutual learning process within families is one\nof human beings' most valuable experiences. The family, as\nthe fundamental unit of society and the natural environment\nfor the growth and well-being of all of its members, should\nbe afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that\nit can fully assume its responsibilities within the\ncommunity, because it is within the family, first and\nforemost, where children, the most vulnerable group in\nsociety, seek support and protection.\nMillions of children are being exploited worldwide.\nTheir basic human rights are being denied in many ways.\nFor some time now, and in particular during the Austrian\npresidency of the European Union, Vice-Chancellor and\nForeign Minister Sch\u00fcssel has been trying to focus\nattention on one particular aspect: child pornography on\nthe Internet. Next week, Austria will host an international\nconference on combating child pornography on the\nInternet. Organized by Austria, the European Commission\nand the United States of America, the conference will\nbring together high-level officials from Ministries of the\nInterior and Justice, the judiciary and the police, experts\nfrom international organizations, non-governmental\norganizations and the industry, especially Internet service\nproviders. The United Nations system will be represented\nby experts from the United Nations Children's Fund and\nthe United Nations Centre for International Crime\nPrevention. The main objectives of the conference are to\nreinforce cooperation between law enforcement officials\nand the judiciary, establish codes of conduct for Internet\nservice providers and the further development of hotlines\nand networks between them. The results of this initiative\nwill be presented to the United Nations.\nThe fight against drugs and transnational organized\ncrime has rightly been accorded priority status in the\nwork of the United Nations. I am glad that the reform\nmeasures introduced by Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nhave reaffirmed Vienna's role as the United Nations\ncentre for fighting uncivil elements in society.\nAustria is particularly worried by reports about the\nsituation in Afghanistan, where the areas under poppy\ncultivation area apparently doubled in 1998. We are\ntherefore appealing to all partners to enhance their efforts\nin assisting the United Nations International Drug Control\nProgramme (UNDCP) to combat the cultivation and\nproduction of drugs in that region and elsewhere. As a\npractical contribution to this effort, Austria will sponsor\na UNDCP training seminar for Central Asian drug\nauthorities this autumn. Austria strongly believes that drug\ncontrol is, above all, in the interests of our children and\nfuture generations.\nIn April 2000, the first United Nations conference in\nthe new millennium, the Tenth United Nations Congress\non the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of\nOffenders, will take place in Vienna. The key issues\ncontained in the preliminary draft of the Vienna\nDeclaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges\nof the Twenty-First Century (E/1999/30-E/CN.15/1999/12,\npara. 3), whose final forum will be adopted at the\n18\n\n\nCongress, address the most burning questions in\ninternational crime prevention: trafficking in human beings,\nsmuggling migrants and illicit transfers of firearms.\nIn this context, I can say with satisfaction that the\nAustrian initiative to elaborate an international legal\ninstrument against the smuggling of migrants, which\nAustria presented to the General Assembly two years ago,\nhas gathered a great deal of support among United Nations\nMember States. Currently, intensive negotiations within the\nframework of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of\na Convention against Organized Transnational Crime are\nbeing held and will hopefully be concluded next year with\nthe adoption of a universal protocol against the smuggling\nof migrants.\nThe last of the series of world Conferences in the\n1990s showed that an innovative yet pragmatic approach\ncan work. This was the Third United Nations Conference\non the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space,\nUNISPACE III, which took place in Vienna in July this\nyear. The Conference focused on the question of how to\nensure that space technology will benefit humanity in the\ntwenty-first century and that it is used effectively to\npromote security in all its forms for the benefit of all\ncountries. It has provided developing countries with\nopportunities to define their needs for space applications for\ndevelopment purposes and to identify ways and possibilities\nfor them to participate in international programmes which\ndevelop these applications. UNISPACE III was both a\nnovel and a successful type of Conference in bringing\ntogether industry and academia, and young people, as equal\npartners and incorporating their insights into the final\ndocuments.\nIn the twenty-first century, the United Nations and the\ninternational community will be judged by their capacity to\nprevent armed conflict. At a time when the world's\nproblems appear to be growing and the resources to tackle\nthose problems seem to be shrinking, we must be more\nstrategic than ever in devising new ways to approach these\nchallenges.\nAgain and again we have had to face the fact that the\ninternational community is not in the position to bridge the\ngap between early warning and early action. In future,\nefficient mechanisms will have to be implemented by\ninternational organizations in order to act at an early stage.\nIn our response to looming refugee crises, much faster\naction is needed to avoid human catastrophes like the ones\nwe have witnessed in Kosovo and East Timor.\nAs part of its development cooperation concept,\nAustria is currently working on a comprehensive strategy\nfor conflict prevention which combines all available\nmeasures, from facilitation and mediation to a targeted\nuse of the instruments of development cooperation.\nAustria is actively involved in the Arusha peace process\nfor Burundi and is offering a broad range of seminars and\ntraining programmes on preventive diplomacy, in\nparticular with its partners in Africa. Austria's\ndevelopment cooperation aims to promote both\nsustainable development and sustainable peace.\nAustria has always lent its active support to United\nNations efforts to maintain international peace and\nsecurity. Since 1960, it has been one of the major\ncontributors to United Nations peacekeeping missions. At\nthe moment, more than 1,500 Austrian troops, civilian\npolice, military observers and civilian experts are serving\nin United Nations peacekeeping, and other United Nations\nmandated operations, and in missions in which regional\norganizations are participating \u2014 from Kosovo to East\nTimor, and from Western Sahara to Tajikistan. We will\ncontinue to do our utmost to assist the United Nations in\nits efforts to enhance stability in many areas of tension\naround the world.\nIf we are to cope with all these challenges, we\nclearly have to reinforce the rule of law in international\nrelations. A large part of the legal basis already exists.\nWhat is needed to make it work is our common political\nwill to monitor and to ensure its application. This can\nonly happen in the framework of the United Nations, in\nparticular through the Security Council.\nIn view of the United Nations primary responsibility\nfor the maintenance of peace and security, it is crucial\nthat the United Nations prove its ability to act quickly and\ndecisively in conflict situations. The decisive action taken\nduring the Gulf war in 1990-1991 raised international\nhopes and expectations for the future.\nBut already during the terrible conflicts in the\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, it took the Organization much longer to\nfind a successful crisis solution. It only managed to do so\nby applying a sensible subcontracting policy with regional\norganizations. The recent tragedies in Kosovo and East\nTimor have both brought the United Nations and the\nSecurity Council to the brink of being perceived in\ninternational public opinion as ineffective or unable to act.\n19\n\n\nThe Security Council, which carries the primary\nresponsibility for international peace and security, must\nmaintain its ability to act. It cannot be seen to be driven by\nthe subjective interest of members rather than by an\nobjective assessment of real requirements. It goes without\nsaying that the permanent members bear a particular\nresponsibility in this regard, which includes financial\nobligations. The privileges of permanent membership come\nwith a heavy obligation: to act whenever necessary. If a\npeace operation has to be established, it must not matter\nwhether the conflict situation is located in an area of little\nstrategic interest or whether the country in question\nmaintains unwelcome relations with another entity. Its\nmandate and size must be based on the conditions on the\nground, and not depend on anybody\u2019s willingness to finance\nit. Should the Security Council be seen to be unable to\nfulfil these functions, we will have to heed the call for\nreforms, including the role of its permanent members.\nOn East Timor, the Security Council has finally lived\nup to its special responsibilities assigned to it under the\nCharter. This proves that the international community must\nact decisively when confronted with massive violations of\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights.\nAustria welcomes Security Council resolution 1264\n(1999) authorizing a multinational force for East Timor\nunder Chapter VII and the commitment of the Indonesian\nGovernment to cooperate with this force in the\nimplementation of the mandate. We hope that this initiative\nwill contribute to bringing about national reconciliation,\nlasting peace and respect for the will of the people of East\nTimor, expressed so clearly during the consultations on 30\nAugust 1999. Austria underlines the necessity to urgently\nprovide humanitarian assistance, and will also contribute to\nthese efforts.\nThe vote on the future of East Timor must be\nrespected by all sides. Austria, while underlining its desire\nto see a strong, democratic and united Indonesia, looks\nforward to recognizing East Timor once the process\ntowards independence is complete.\nAustria sharply condemns the atrocities committed in\nrecent weeks. Those who planned, authorized or executed\nthese acts must be held individually and personally\naccountable and be brought to justice.\nAfter a long impasse the peace process in the Middle\nEast is back on track. Austria greatly welcomes the\nmemorandum signed by Israel and the Palestinians at\nSharm el-Sheikh, which removes the obstacles to the\nimplementation of the Wye Agreement. Furthermore, we\nhave taken note with satisfaction that implementation on\nthe ground has already begun. Here I should especially\nlike to point to the handing over of territory, the release\nof Palestinian prisoners and the beginning of the final\nstatus negotiations. This clear commitment of the parties\nshould augur well for further speedy progress on the road\nto peace. Now it will also be necessary to bring about\nnew momentum in the Syrian/Lebanese track of the peace\nprocess by relaunching the negotiations between Israel,\nSyria and Lebanon. I think that all parties agree that\npeace and mutual understanding are the only viable option\nfor a prosperous future for all nations in the Middle East\nregion.\nThe western Balkans, being geographically so close\nto Austria, will remain in the foreground of Austrian\nforeign policy. The most burning problem is currently the\nsituation in Kosovo, which merits the joint attention of\nthe international community. I would like to commend the\nwork which has already been carried out by the United\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\n(UNMIK) and by KFOR, and the progress realized so far,\nin spite of such difficult circumstances. True, in the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244\n(1999), and in our efforts to bring Kosovo back to\nnormalcy, there are delays and setbacks, in particular the\ninsecurity, the tensions in Kosovska Mitrovica, and the\nexodus of the majority of Kosovo Serbs and other\nnon-Albanians. Nevertheless, one must not forget the\nparamount importance of the Kosovo issue for the\nstability of the whole Balkan area, which is why we must\nnot become discouraged when we meet problems. Rather,\nwe have to understand them as an incentive to redouble\nour efforts. Yesterday\u2019s demilitarization agreement\nbetween KFOR and the UCK is, I would say, a very\nencouraging step in the right direction.\nIn addition to setting up a functioning civil\nadministration, including police, creating a democratic\npolitical atmosphere respectful of human rights,\nrepatriating over 1 million refugees, and reconstructing\nthe infrastructure and the economic life of Kosovo, it is\nUNMIK\u2019s crucial task to facilitate a political process\nleading to a definite status of the province. This is a very\ncomplicated endeavour, which requires sound and prudent\npreparation. We must not try to rush things, since it is\nclear that stability and reconciliation have to be\nestablished and solidified before we can tackle the final\nstatus question.\n20\n\n\nThe same holds true for Montenegro. We must, and\nwe will continue to, support the Montenegrin reform\nprocess, and we must not allow forces in Belgrade to\nundercut those pluralistic and economic improvements. For\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a whole, we will\ncontinue to work towards democratization, political reform\nand respect for human and minority rights. Upon such\nchanges \u2014 which are not only urgently necessary but\nwhich are also yearned for by the Serb and Yugoslav\npeople \u2014 Yugoslavia should, and will, take its rightful\nplace in the international community.\nIn spite of some progress made by Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, it still needs and deserves our intense help \u2014\nboth politically and financially. At the same time, it is\nincreasingly necessary for the Bosnians themselves to take\non more responsibility for their future and to start a process\nof decoupling themselves from dependency on international\nassistance.\nLet me emphasize at this juncture Austria\u2019s strong\nbelief in the protection and promotion of minorities in\ngeneral. This attitude is based on historic experience and\nthe conviction that ethnic minorities constitute a true\nenrichment of our societies.\nIt is of interest for the international community to\nrecall that there are existing successful settlements of\nimportant minority issues in Europe. In particular, I think\nof the Austrian minority in the South Tyrol, which today\nenjoys a well-balanced autonomy on the basis of the Paris\nTreaty of 1946 between Austria and Italy. Time and again\nit has been noted that this formula could be an example for\nthe settlement of minority disputes in other parts of the\nworld.\nThough regional organizations and coalitions of the\nwilling have credibly shown their readiness to take on\nresponsibilities in the maintenance of international peace\nand security, the United Nations continues to provide the\nindispensable political, legal and institutional links to ensure\nthe acceptance, legitimacy and accountability of their\nrespective efforts.\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE) plays a central role in promoting peace,\nsecurity and stability in the regional context, in particular\nthrough its broad range of activities in the area of conflict\nprevention, crisis management and post-conflict\nrehabilitation. The broad scope and complex nature of the\nsecurity challenges in the region requires a pluri-\ninstitutional response. But that implies also an effective\ncooperation among the institutions concerned. The OSCE,\nas a regional arrangement according to Chapter VIII of\nthe Charter of the United Nations, is closely cooperating\nwith the United Nations in many fields and regions, such\nas in Kosovo. In our capacity as the next Chairman-in-\nOffice of the OSCE, we will continue the efforts to\nstrengthen the relationship between the OSCE and the\nUnited Nations at both the political and field levels.\nLet me conclude by confirming Austria's strong\ncommitment to the United Nations. In a little less than\none year, our Heads of State or Government will\nparticipate in the millennium summit. I hope that this will\nbe the occasion to unlock the potential of the\nOrganization. We must use the wonderful tool of our\nOrganization as it was meant to be used: to ensure our\nsurvival on this planet in peace, freedom and dignity. On\nspaceship Earth the supplies are limited, so we have to\nmake the best possible use of them. Whatever our\ndifferences, we all know what needs to be done. Let us\nfind the political will to do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "My\ndelegation welcomes the election of the Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. Mexico knows him as an experienced diplomat\nwhose contribution will guarantee that our work strengthens\nthe ability of the United Nations to face the challenges of\nthe next century. In welcoming his election, we pay tribute\nto the constructive role Namibia plays on the international\nstage.\nMy delegation would also like to place on record its\nappreciation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay,\nMr. Didier Opertti, for his outstanding guidance of the\nfifty-third session.\nI wish also to express the satisfaction of Mexico at the\nadmission of the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to membership of the\nOrganization. Their presence among us strengthens\nuniversality, the very essence of the United Nations.\nMy delegation is participating in this session with the\nwill to negotiate and the desire to cooperate that have\nalways characterized Mexico's foreign policy. We are\nconvinced that the proposals we make and results we\nachieve will contribute to designing the international order\nof the twenty-first century; we shall be an active participant\nin the debate.\nNow more than ever it seem essential that we review\nthe system we devised at San Francisco in the light of our\nexperiences over the past 54 years and of the progress\nachieved in the field of international law. In that review we\nmust ensure that the interests of all Member States are\ntaken into account in line with the Charter principle of the\nsovereign equality of States.\nMexico is proud of its multilateral outlook. My\ncountry has always seen the United Nations as the ideal\nforum to propose, negotiate and agree on solutions and\ncommon strategies that will enable us to face our collective\nchallenges. We Mexicans are convinced that it is imperative\nto spare no effort to make our Organization the primary\nforum for generating comprehensive policies, policies that\nguarantee lasting peace and security, and the development\nand welfare of all peoples on earth.\nAs it does every year, the General Assembly has a\nbroad and complex agenda before it at this session. I wish\ntherefore to focus my statement on three topics that I\nconsider to be of paramount importance for the future of\nthe Organization and of the community of nations: world\npeace and security; international cooperation in the field\nof natural disasters; and the financial architecture of the\nnew century.\nThe Preamble and Article 1 of the Charter state that\nfundamental aims of the peoples of the United Nations\nare to live together in peace and to solve their disputes\nwithout resorting to the use of force. The attainment of\nthose aims is our only guarantee if we yearn for a stable\nand secure international community that reveres friendly\nrelations and goodwill among all peoples and all nations.\nWe note with growing concern that, far from\ndisappearing, conflicts have multiplied and their nature\nhas changed as a consequence of the reshuffling of forces\nin the international arena. Today, these ever-proliferating\nconfrontations are to a great extent internal ones,\npresenting formidable challenges to an Organization\nconceived to resolve disputes between States. We still\nlack clear-cut mandates and a defined consensus on how\nto address this new state of affairs. This often divides us,\nnot on the ultimate goal \u2014 peace \u2014 but on the means to\nachieve it. Given the absence of a new political contract\nthat enjoys the support of all Members of the United\nNations, Mexico will continue firmly to maintain that the\nsearch for solutions to conflicts, whether they be internal\nor international, must be in conformity with the letter and\nthe spirit of the San Francisco Charter. Its principles\ncannot be subjected to interpretations varying with\ncircumstances or to unilateral whims. We cannot allow\nthe authority or the legitimacy of the Organization to be\ndamaged. We cannot accept actions that openly contradict\nthe intentions of the founders and that weaken the rights\nof the community of States.\nMexico has always maintained that the use of force,\neven when motivated by the loftiest humanitarian\nimpulses, is no solution; to the contrary, it generates\nfurther instability, uncertainty and violence. But my\ncountry has shown restraint when the Security Council\nhas acted in strict compliance with Chapter VII of the\nCharter. Even so, the Mexican Government reiterates the\nvalue of the peaceful settlement of disputes and firmly\nrejects the existence of an alleged right to intervene,\nparticularly when it is proclaimed outside the framework\nof international law.\n31\n\n\nThis is one of the most pressing challenges that we\nmust face as we move towards the new millennium.\nEssentially, we are striving to give the United Nations the\npolitical underpinning that will enable it to face new threats\nto peace and security in line with the thinking that inspired\nthe authors of the San Francisco Charter. If we fail, we run\nthe risk of eroding international negotiating tools and of\ndoing precisely what we want to avoid: weakening the\nOrganization.\nFor these reasons, my delegation invites all Member\nStates to begin an exercise in collective thinking that will\nenable us to solve the dilemma of humanitarian crises\ncaused by internal conflicts on the one hand and of the\ncapability of the United Nations to respond on the other.\nThis must be an exercise in deep thinking that will lead us\nto lasting solutions, which will both preserve peace and\nprotect the lives and human rights of those involved in\nconflicts.\nAllow me now to turn to another topic that I deem\ncentral to the future of the United Nations: international\ncooperation in the event of natural disaster. In view of the\nregrettable recurrence of natural disasters, it is urgent to\nthink about a creative and effective international division of\nlabour so that responses by countries, regions and\norganizations do not constitute isolated efforts or temporary\nrelief. They should instead constitute a comprehensive\nstrategy that will contribute to lasting stability.\nWe have all witnessed the sad consequences of natural\ncatastrophes. Recent experiences highlight the urgent need\nfor an effective machinery to address more rapidly and\nmore fully the needs of affected populations. These\nexperiences show also that at the very outset of the tragedy\nit is essential to mobilize broader support efforts to\ncontribute to full recovery in the shortest possible time.\nAt the regional level, the countries of Latin America\nand the Caribbean have taken important steps that serve as\nan example of the proposed new division of labour to deal\nwith natural disasters. In the declaration on technical\ncooperation for the prevention and relief of natural disasters\nadopted at the summit meeting of the Permanent\nMechanism for Political Consultation and Concertation (Rio\nGroup), held in Mexico City in May, we undertook the\ncommitment \u201cto promote permanent measures of technical\ncooperation on every phase of natural disasters\u201d. This\nmarks significant progress in the field of international\ncooperation. It aims not only to repair the damage but also\nto include preventive measures, and is designed to ensure\nassistance not only at the time of crisis but also during\nthe reconstruction period.\nLikewise, during their summit, held in June 1999 at\nRio de Janeiro, heads of State or Government of Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean and of the European Union\ndecided to launch an important programme of cooperation\nin the sphere of environmental and natural disasters. Its\ngoal is to help improve the capacity of the most\nvulnerable nations of both regions so we can prevent and\ndeal with disasters. To that end, they agreed to establish\nan appropriate system of international assistance at all\nphases from prevention and early warning to emergency\nassistance and mitigation, without neglecting rehabilitation\nand reconstruction.\nMy delegation is convinced that these experiences\ndeserve to be considered by this Assembly so that their\nmerits may be assessed and disseminated throughout the\nworld. The United Nations must play a central role in\nmaking this strategy international. It is urgent to have\nnational listings of civil defence organizations with\nupdated inventories of available resources to help in\ndisasters, and handbooks to guide us in the effective\nmanagement of international cooperation. In other words,\nthe Organization must respond in terms of who will\nprovide international cooperation when natural disasters\nstrike, what they will provide, and how they will provide\nit.\nLastly, I would like to refer to the financial\narchitecture of the new century. A year ago, in this same\nforum, I voiced the concern of Mexico about the harmful\neffects that financial crises have on our societies. At that\ntime, I proposed that the Member States, coordinated by\nthe Secretary-General, should undertake to reflect on how\nto improve our early-warning capacity in order to prevent\nand confront in a timely fashion the occurrence and\nproliferation of financial crises. This initiative found\nsupport in resolution 53/172, entitled \u201cThe financial crisis\nand its impact on growth and development, especially in\nthe developing countries\u201d.\nSubsequently, we proposed to the Secretary-General\nthe undertaking of an effort at the regional level in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean as part of a broader\nendeavour that will have to involve other areas, including\ndeveloped countries and the international financial\nagencies.\nEarlier this month, in close collaboration with the\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\n32\n\n\nCaribbean, we held a meeting in Mexico City under the\nheading \u201cTowards a stable and predictable international\nfinancial system linked to social development.\u201d High-level\nGovernment officials of the countries of our region\nparticipated, as well as specialists and prominent officials\nof multilateral institutions working in financial and social\nfields.\nAt that meeting, we undertook an in-depth analysis of\nthe international financial architecture and its connection to\nthe social development of our peoples. We also reaffirmed\nour conviction that it is urgent and necessary to define a\nnew world financial scheme that includes a social\ndimension. The conclusions of that regional meeting have\nbeen conveyed to the Secretary-General, and I would like\nrefer to just a few of them.\nFirst, we participants expressed our concern over the\nfact that once the most visible effects of the crisis are\novercome, we observe a dangerous attitude of complacency.\nThe countries of the region are convinced that a renewed\neffort is required in order to strengthen the global financial\nsystem, and we reaffirmed our commitment to actively\nparticipate in this task.\nSecondly, we emphasized the need to have a stable,\ntransparent, predictable, organized and secure international\nfinancial system. To this end, we, the various participants\nmust accept and fulfil our respective responsibilities. The\ninternational financial agencies must redesign their policies\nin order to respond to the great challenges created by\nfinancial markets. They must develop early-warning\nmechanisms and expand their resources to help economies\nin trouble in a timely and appropriate way. For their part,\ncountries must commit themselves to following\nmacroeconomic policies that lead to growth and social\njustice. They must recognize, in order to remedy the\nproblem, the part played in the crisis by the absence of\nadequate supervision and regulation of national banking\nsystems. A solid banking system is essential to protect a\ncountry from speculative movements of capital.\nThirdly, we recognized the devastating impact that\nfinancial crises have on the social situation and the\nprospects for development of our countries. In this respect,\nwe expressed the need to advance towards a financial\narchitecture that reconciles the economy with society and\ninternational finance with sustained social development. We\nreaffirmed in this sense our absolute conviction that\nsustained growth is the most effective way to reduce\ninequality and poverty.\nFourthly, we agreed that the ultimate goal of the\ninternational development banks must be precisely human\ndevelopment. We deemed it fundamental for those\ninstitutions to give high priority to financial support for\nthe formation of basic networks of social protection in\ntimes of crisis, without losing sight of the broader\nobjectives of growth and development.\nFifthly, we agreed that the United Nations must play\na central role in promoting integrated social development\nthrough forging an international consensus that helps\nsupport and rebuild the global financial architecture. It is\nencouraging to learn that in the year 2001 the United\nNations will sponsor a high-level meeting on financing\ndevelopment. That will be an ideal opportunity to address\ncomprehensively the problem of social and human\ndevelopment, including its financial aspect.\nThus, we will follow up on the conclusions and\nrecommendations coming out of the meeting in Mexico,\nand on those from other meetings and forums, in order to\ninclude all actors in the design of the financial\narchitecture for the twenty-first century. We will be\nattentive to efforts in this direction on the part of\nSecretary-General.\nThe United Nations must strengthen its position and\nits mandate as the principal forum of debate and for\nseeking consensual solutions that guide the work of the\ninternational community in the face of problems and\nsituations that affect us all. It is essential to continue the\ntask of establishing a more democratic and transparent\nOrganization that fully reflects the interests and objectives\nof its Members and that is a forum that truly represents\nall of them. I am sure that all of us want a United\nNations where fairness and justice reign.\nLooking towards the Millennium Assembly, we must\ncontinue to foster cooperation and closeness among\nnations in order to strengthen peace and security, push\ndisarmament ahead, promote development and the\nstruggle against poverty and ensure full respect for\ninternational law.\nIf we are really being overtaken by events in the\nglobal arena, we must strengthen our frame of action. If\nit is necessary to reform our Organization to guarantee its\neffective performance, let us do so. But let us do so\ncollectively, with respect for the juridical principle of the\nequality of States. Let us not allow this forum to lose its\nprestige or its influence. Mexico will not retreat from its\ncommitment to the letter and the spirit of the San\n33\n\n\nFrancisco Charter. To the contrary, it will participate\nactively in the effort to guarantee the vitality of the United\nNations in order to build a better world, both for ourselves\nand for future generations.\nThis is the aim of the proposals I have made on behalf\nof the Government that I have the honour to represent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I have no doubt that your long experience and\nproven diplomatic skills will guide the work of this session\nto a successful conclusion. Moreover, we interpret your\nelection as a well-deserved recognition of your country,\nNamibia, for which the Cypriot people entertain feelings of\nadmiration and friendship.\nI would also like to take the opportunity to express my\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Opertti of Uruguay,\nfor the determined leadership with which he steered the\nwork of the fifty-third session.\nCyprus joins other States in extending a warm\nwelcome to the new Members of the United Nations: the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga.\nAs we are rapidly approaching the dawn of the new\nmillennium, we have an obligation to reaffirm our\ncommitment to this truly global Organization and to the\nideas that have made the United Nations the hope of\nmankind for a world governed by peace, justice and the\nrule of law.\nAnd yet, the challenges that we face seem at times\ninsurmountable. Our world is characterized by a large array\nof old and constantly emerging new problems, such as\nviolent international conflicts and internal strife. Moreover,\nthe United Nations has to respond to many challenges, such\nas the eradication of poverty, sustainable development, the\nfight against terrorism and drug trafficking, the control of\nepidemics and natural disasters, and the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nThe Organization's efforts in these areas have been\nconsiderable and must not be underestimated. I take this\nopportunity to reaffirm my Government's strong\ncommitment to the United Nations and our support for the\nongoing efforts to reform it, so that it will be able to\nsuccessfully meet the considerable challenges that lie\nahead.\nCyprus will work towards the successful conclusion\nof the Millennium Assembly. We look forward to an\ninteractive Summit. We anticipate an in-depth and result-\noriented discussion, with the participation of civil society,\nduring the work of the many special sessions on various\nfacets of the Organization's work.\nOne of the major issues of concern to all humanity\nis disarmament. I would like to reaffirm our support for\nthese efforts including, inter alia, a strengthened review\nprocess of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) and the effective implementation of the\nChemical Weapons Convention.\nIn the field of human rights, the United Nations\nplays a very special role not only in developing and\nenhancing the regime of human rights instruments, but\nalso in the prevention of possible violations and the\nconstantly expanding humanitarian relief efforts.\nOn the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nGeneva Conventions, we reaffirm our commitment to the\ncause of human rights and the promotion of humanitarian\nlaw. Cyprus fully supported the adoption of the Statute of\na permanent International Criminal Court.\nCyprus follows the situation in the Middle East with\nintense interest. We rejoice at the winds of hope that have\nrecently appeared in the efforts to finally achieve peace in\nthat long-tormented area and welcome the recent Israeli-\nPalestinian agreement. Cyprus, as a neighbouring State\nwith close relations to the parties involved in the Middle\nEast, reiterates its support for a just, lasting and\ncomprehensive settlement based on the relevant United\nNations resolutions and the implementation of the peace\naccords.\nThe recent tragedy that has unfolded in Kosovo has\ndemonstrated the fragility of peace in the heart of Europe\nand the imperative need to address a new array of\nproblems that have the potential to destabilize an entire\nregion. The international community, as well as the\nparties involved, have an obligation to create the\nconditions for reconciliation, so that what has transpired\n5\n\n\nin Kosovo and Yugoslavia in general will never be allowed\nto take place again.\nCyprus fully supports Security Council resolution 1244\n(1999) and calls for full respect for the human rights of all\nKosovars, irrespective of their origin, as well as for the\nsovereignty of all States in the region. My Government also\nwelcomes the initiative of the European Union that led to\nthe adoption of the Stability Pact last June as an important\ninitiative that will contribute considerably to the economic\nand political stabilization of south-eastern Europe and help\nits peoples construct a new future.\nCyprus welcomes the several United Nations initiatives\nand recommendations stemming from the follow-up to the\nreport of the Secretary-General concerning Africa. The\ninternational community should redouble its efforts to assist\nthe countries of Africa to overcome the ethnic strife and\nwars; to eradicate poverty; successfully to combat disease;\nto win the fight against drug trafficking; to obtain\nsustainable development; and to face the challenges of the\nfuture.\nThe recent devastating earthquake that struck Turkey\nhas once more demonstrated the frailty of human beings\nbefore nature's incredible power of destruction. I take this\nopportunity to reiterate to the Turkish people our sympathy\nfor the enormous losses suffered and to urge the\ninternational community to lend a helping hand for the\nreconstruction of the devastated areas. Despite the political\nproblems that exist between our respective States, the\nmagnitude of the suffering of the Turkish people has deeply\nmoved the people of Cyprus.\nI wish to congratulate all those countries which rushed\nto save Turkish lives, and in particular Greece, which,\ndespite its many differences and problems with Turkey, was\none of the first countries to send its teams to work side by\nside with Turkish teams to rescue the Turkish people who\nwere buried alive under the ruins of the earthquake. I want\nalso to congratulate Turkey for reciprocating in the same\nmanner after the subsequent earthquake in Greece and I\nwish to salute the new spirit of friendship which has started\nto emerge between the two countries.\nThis year marks a quarter of a century since the\nTurkish invasion and unlawful occupation of 37 per cent of\nthe territory of the Republic of Cyprus. I could today, from\nthis podium, point an accusing finger at Turkey and talk at\nlength about the ethnic cleansing it practised against the\nGreek Cypriots, which resulted in 180,000 Greek Cypriots\nbecoming refugees in their own country. I could bring up\nthe drama of the relatives of the 1,600 Greek Cypriots\nmissing since the invasion of Cyprus by Turkish forces in\n1974. I could point out the many violations of human\nrights of the Greek Cypriots by citing decisions of the\nEuropean Court and reports of the European Commission\nof Human Rights, holding Turkey responsible for such\nviolations. Today I will abstain from doing so, because I\nprefer to look to the future, and not to deal with the past.\nWe are currently waiting for the United Nations\nSecretary-General to issue invitations to both sides to take\npart in negotiations, under the auspices of the United\nNations, in the most ambitious initiative ever undertaken\nto find a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem.\nThis initiative enjoys the active support of the\ninternational community, and particularly the Group of the\neight most industrialized countries, the Security Council,\nthe European Union and the Non-Aligned Movement.\nWe are well aware that currently the international\ncommunity, and especially those States which are in a\nposition to influence the foreign policy of Turkey, are\nworking methodically to persuade Turkey and the Turkish\nCypriot leader, Mr. Denktash, to participate in talks\nwithout any preconditions; that is, not to insist on the\nrecognition of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern\nCyprus, and not to demand that negotiations be conducted\nbetween the two States, instead of communities, as\nenvisaged in the Security Council resolutions.\nRegrettably, on 16 September the Prime Minister of\nTurkey, Mr. Ecevit, in a public statement, not only\ninsisted on the two preconditions I have just mentioned,\nbut added that the economic embargo against the Turkish\nCypriots must be lifted. The Prime Minister of Turkey\nknows that the so-called embargo is a result of a decision\nof the European Court, to the effect that certificates of\norigin and/or quality issued by the so-called Turkish\nRepublic of Northern Cyprus cannot be accepted by the\nEuropean Union, because the State referred to is not\nrecognized. The Prime Minister of Turkey should also be\naware that there is a category of reciprocal measures that\nneed to be discussed and resolved, and that the question\nof the embargo falls in that category.\nI have already stated publicly, but also to the\nSecretary-General and to the heads of State or\nGovernment of the five permanent members of the\nSecurity Council, that we are ready to respond positively\nto the Secretary-General's invitation to attend the talks\nand to negotiate a solution to the problem within the\n6\n\n\nparameters established by the international community\nthrough Security Council resolutions. The parameters so\nestablished provide that Cyprus must be a bicommunal,\nbizonal federal republic, with a single sovereignty, an\ninternational personality and a single citizenship, and that\nthe settlement must exclude union, in whole or in part, with\nany other country or any form of partition or secession.\nMy vision for the solution of the Cyprus problem\nwithin those parameters requires a partnership of the two\ncommunities that would constitutionally provide for the\nmaximum degree of internal self-administration for the two\nconstituent cantons, provinces or states. Adhering to the\nprinciple of the equal political status of the constituent\nparts, it must provide them with the same rights, powers\nand functions regarding their respective separate internal\nself-administration. The constitution must also provide for\nthe effective participation of both communities in the\nfederal Government.\nSuch a federation, becoming a member of the\nEuropean Union, will thrive at home and abroad, enjoying\ngenuine peace, stability and security, based on international\nlaw and legality. It will be supervised by an international\nforce authorized by the Security Council, under terms and\nconditions so defined as to give the force the right to\nintervene if it finds that one community, by unlawful acts,\nputs in danger the safety of the other community or\nattempts to destroy the independence, territorial integrity\nand sovereignty of the federal State or destroy the\nagreements reached.\nI have stated that both communities must learn from\nthe mistakes of the past and must work hard for the\ncreation of a common and bright future for all, instead of\nclinging to attitudes which brought about the tragedy in the\nisland. It is, therefore, imperative that we find a just,\nworkable and viable solution which will safeguard the\nhuman rights of every citizen and heal the wounds of the\npast, bringing at the same time a sense of security to both\ncommunities by providing full disarmament under\ninternational supervision.\nOur side will approach negotiations on the Cyprus\nproblem with courage and flexibility, partly because we\nrecognize that solving it is in the interest of all Cypriots,\nbut also because that will contribute to the overall stability\nof the region, which is so much demanded by the\ninternational community.\nI regret that Mr. Denktash is reported to have refused\nto respond positively to any initiative to negotiate with me\nas representative of the Greek Cypriot community, on the\npretext that I am also the President of the internationally\nrecognized Republic of Cyprus.\nTime and time again I have explained to him that I\nsit in the talks not as the President of the Republic of\nCyprus, but as the representative of the Greek Cypriot\ncommunity, because the Security Council resolutions call\nupon the two communities to negotiate, not upon the State\nof the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot\ncommunity.\nIt also saddens me when he attempts to set aside the\nparameters for the solution of the Cyprus problem, set by\nthe international community and the high-level\nagreements he made before the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations twice, for a bicommunal, bizonal\nfederation. He attempts now to set new parameters for the\nsolution, based on two separate sovereign States, and to\nimpose their acceptance by refusing to come to the\nnegotiating table unless his conditions are met.\nIn support of his precondition, he advances the\nargument that the term \u201dequal political status\u201d, referred to\nin United Nations resolutions, must be interpreted to mean\nthat his break-away Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\nmust be recognized, since the Republic of Cyprus is\ninternationally recognized, in order that the two\nnegotiators may have equal status. He forgets that the\nSecurity Council, by its resolution, deplored the action of\nthe Turkish side of declaring a separate State, and asked\nall its members not to recognize it, a request with which\nall complied, with the exception of Turkey, the occupying\nPower.\nThe parameters for the solution of the Cyprus\nproblem are already in place. They are included in the\nrelevant United Nations resolutions. What is required is\nthe political will of the two sides. I can assure the\nAssembly that the Greek Cypriot side stands ready to\nnegotiate in good faith so that a bicommunal, bizonal\nFederal Republic of Cyprus will finally become a reality.\nI join my voice with those of the G-8, the Security\nCouncil and the European Union in asking Mr. Denktash\nto come to the negotiating table without preconditions. I\nhonestly believe that within the parameters of the Security\nCouncil resolutions we can find a solution which will\nsafeguard the legitimate interests of both communities and\nbring peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n7\n\n\nI wish also to repeat my invitation to the Turkish\nCypriot community to join forces with us in our European\nUnion accession course. That course, which is the greatest\nachievement since the establishment of the Cyprus\nRepublic, is continuing with success. Accession to the\nEuropean Union will benefit both communities equally.\nThe Cyprus problem has often been described as\ncomplicated and intractable. I do not share this view. The\nCyprus problem can and will be solved if the international\ncommunity demands its solution with the necessary\ndetermination, within the parameters it has set.\nIn the effort for the solution of the Cyprus problem, as\na small State, Member of the United Nations, we rely on\nthe support of the international community and the United\nNations. We look upon its Charter as a beacon of justice,\nand on the United Nations as the hope for a better future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Far too many challenges leave us doubtful, despite\nsome positive events in the continent, in particular the\npolitical changes in South Africa and Nigeria.\nIn Angola, the many statements and decisions of the\ninternational community remain unimplemented because of\nJonas Savimbi's stubborn adherence to the logic of war. The\nwar in Angola, which has rendered fruitless the efforts of\nan entire generation of diplomats, has revealed the limits of\nour Organization in the restoration of peace. This is the\noccasion to reaffirm that the solid base for a definitive\nresolution of the conflict remains the effective\nimplementation of comprehensive mandatory sanctions.\nThey alone will lead to the complete isolation of Mr.\nJonas Savimbi and UNITA, so long as the international\ncommunity truly complies.\nWith regard to the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, we welcome the conclusion of the Lusaka\nAgreement, which opens the way to resolving the political\nand military crisis in that fraternal country. My country is\ncounting on the commitment of the various protagonists\nfor the Agreement's implementation. We strongly hope\nthat the observer mission planned by the United Nations\nwill be effective and that it will create favourable\nconditions for the holding of a Great Lakes regional\nconference, which the international community is calling\nfor wholeheartedly.\nThe conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is another\nmajor concern in Africa. We invite those two fraternal\npeoples to rise above the situation by fully supporting the\npeace plan of the Organization of African Unity to put an\nend to that war.\nLastly, we cannot fail to pay tribute to the courage\ndisplayed by the authorities of Sierra Leone, who have\nagreed to pay a very high price for the restoration of\npeace in that country.\nIn this world, in which the universality of principles\nis often limited by force, great men can be guided only\nby the interests of their peoples. A year ago, from this\nvery rostrum, I proclaimed our faith in the future of our\ncountry following the civil war that started on 5 June\n1997. I said then that for the Congolese Government the\nfuture was national reconciliation, the restoration of\npeace, the reconstruction of the country and the\nresumption of the democratic process. We have explained\nthis great project wherever and whenever we could \u2014 at\nthe United Nations, at the Organization of African\nUnity and in all our contacts with all of our partners \u2014\nand we have found understanding and attention\neverywhere.\nIn the context of the resumption of the democratic\nprocess, we have carried out an administrative census of\nthe population in order to identify the electorate; we have\nelaborated a draft Constitution; and we have established\nour higher courts \u2014 the Supreme Court and the High\nCourt of Justice.\n13\n\n\nRegrettably, this impetus has been hampered by a\nresumption of violence, orchestrated once again by those\nwho on several occasions plunged our people into\nmourning \u2014 first in 1993-1994 and then in 1997 \u2014 and\nwhose only aim is the partition of Congo into ethnic\nghettos.\nThe consequences have been catastrophic for the entire\ncountry. These have included heinous crimes such as the\nassassination of officials and leaders of local communities,\nthe kidnapping of tens of thousands of people to serve as\nhuman shields for the armed groups, and the systematic\ndestruction of infrastructures vital to the economy of the\ncountry.\nBut those plans to overthrow institutions have failed.\nToday the pacification efforts made by the Government\nhave borne fruit. The fighting has ended. Several former\nmilitia members of the failed regime have laid down their\nweapons and have given themselves up to the authorities.\nWe are also seeing a mass influx of civilians back into\nBrazzaville and to the main towns in the interior.\nThe guests who did us the honour of participating in\nthe Pan-African Music Festival that the city of Brazzaville\nhosted from 1 to 8 August 1999 witnessed the\ndetermination of the Government and the entire people to\nrebuild this country as a haven of peace. That event \u2014 a\ntime of great joy and reunion for the Congolese people \u2014\nstrengthened our conviction that the worst was behind us\nand that henceforth we could look to the future with\ncalmness and optimism.\nAll of these steps forward on the path of peace are to\nthe credit of one man, President Denis Sassou Nguesso. His\nfaith in reconciliation and national unity was again made\nclear on 14 August 1999 on the occasion of the national\nholiday, when, on behalf of the fraternal republic, he\nsolemnly reaffirmed his desire for dialogue and decided to\ngrant amnesty to all combatants guilty of war crimes who\nagreed to renounce violence and definitively to lay down\ntheir weapons.\nIn this same context of a return to a stable situation\nunder full control throughout the national territory, the\nGovernment reiterates its firm and unswerving will to\nresume the inter-Congolese political dialogue with a view\nto pacification and reunion in order to consolidate the\nnewfound peace and security, strengthen national unity and\nthe reconciliation of all the sons and daughters of the\nCongo, rebuild the country on a lasting basis, and resume\nthe democratic process, which had been interrupted by\nviolence.\nThe offer made was favourably received, leading in\nparticular to the return to Brazzaville of many political\nleaders who had gone into exile following the war of 5\nJune 1997. We are confident in the positive outcome of\nthis process.\nIn the wake of such a tragic period, naturally we are\nstriving to cope with emergency situations. These include\nthe shelter, management and social reintegration of tens\nof thousands of displaced persons, a humanitarian tragedy\nwhose scale has not always been clearly perceived by the\ninternational community; the protection of people and\nproperty; the respect of human rights; and the restoration\nof normal living conditions in many war-torn\ncommunities \u2014 an overwhelming task that anyone would\nagree requires means exceeding by far the capacities of a\nState bled dry such as Congo is today.\nWe are assuming all of our responsibilities, and here\nwe call on the international community, which should\naccompany our efforts with greater commitment and\ncontribute, as it wishes to do, to the restoration on a\nlasting basis of peace, security and democracy and to the\nreconstruction of Congo.\nAt a time when our people are suffering from\npoverty and destitution and from the economic crisis,\nthere is no place for conflicts that are both fratricidal and\nsuicidal.\nIn the context of the quest for sustainable and lasting\npeace and development in Africa, specific and practical\nmeasures must be resolutely taken along the lines of the\nconclusions contained in the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral of our Organization. Among those conclusions,\nwhich we unanimously supported, I would like to mention\nthose relating to the proliferation of, and illicit traffic in,\nsmall arms, which is an important factor in the increase\nin terrorism and crime in our States.\nThat is why, at the thirty-fifth Summit of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), held last July in\nAlgiers, the African Heads of State and Government\ndevoted most of their consideration to ways and means of\nconsolidating peace in order to create modern States\nbased on the primacy of law, respect of the fundamental\nrights and freedoms of citizens, and the democratic\ngovernance of public affairs.\n14\n\n\nAlong the same lines, on 20 September last, at the\nopening of the general debate, the current Chairman of the\nOAU, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the People's\nDemocratic Republic of Algeria, clearly set out in this very\nHall Africa's views on the key questions of peace, security,\neconomic development and international cooperation. The\nCongo associates itself fully with that important declaration.\nI cannot conclude this political analysis without\nmentioning other areas of tension that are a source of\nconcern for us at this session. Thus we express the hope\nthat the impetus provided by the Wye River accords and the\nSharm el-Sheik Memorandum on the Middle East will be\nconsolidated. The Government of the Congo is also closely\nfollowing the evolution of the situation in East Timor and\nwelcomes the efforts of the international community, which\nled to the dispatch of an international force to restore peace\nin that territory and to ensure the respect of the political\nwill clearly expressed by that people during the referendum\norganized by the United Nations.\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, building\npeace and security in the world requires real commitment\non our part to work for economic and social development.\nIn this context, our planet can never be certain of lasting\npeace so long as there is destitution and poverty, which not\nonly affect the quality of human life but are also a cause of\npolitical instability.\nBut how can we achieve lasting sustainable\ndevelopment when the world economy is opening up no\nencouraging prospects for developing countries, when debt\nreceives discriminatory treatment in initiatives whose\nconditions for implementation show how illusory they are,\nwhen resources allocated to official development assistance\nare constantly declining, and lastly, when there is a clear\nrefusal to grant developing countries opportunities to\nintegrate their economies into the new trade system.\nIn any case, because of what is at stake, globalization\nwill be the main challenge of the next century. Today it is\ngiving rise to fears because of the threat it implies to the\nsovereignty of our States and to our cultural and historical\ncharacteristics, and because it raises grave questions about\nour countries' prospects for development. Its implementation\ncalls more than ever for the creation of appropriate, agreed-\nupon mechanisms so as to translate into reality hopes for\nhumankind's unified development and for prosperity shared\namong peoples.\nIt was in this context that recently, at Algiers and at\nSirte, that the Heads of State and Government of the\nmember countries of the Organization of African Unity\nresolutely committed themselves to working for the\nstrengthening of subregional economic groups, in\naccordance with the spirit of the Abuja Treaty.\nThe coming century will bring with it challenges for\nour Organization. Overcoming them will require\nharmonized approaches taken in a representative context.\nThus my country attaches particular importance to the\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations and to the\nrestructuring of its main bodies, so as to combat the\nuncertainties born of an unequal world and to take firm\nsteps to make multilateralism truly democratic. The\nUnited Nations remains an irreplaceable tool. However, it\ndeserves to be rethought and revitalized so that it will be\nequal to the challenges confronting us.\nTo succeed, we will need to join together the will,\nthe efforts and the means of the whole of the international\ncommunity. Congo reaffirms its commitment to make its\nfull contribution to the achievement of that goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me\ngreat pleasure to convey to you and your country, Namibia,\nmy heartfelt congratulations on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly for this session. We\nare fully confident that your ability, well-known experience\nand personal talent will crown our work with success, to\nwhich the delegation of Cape Verde will contribute its\ngreatest efforts.\nWe would like to express our appreciation and\ngratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of\nUruguay, for the professionalism and devotion with which\nhe conducted the work of the Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession. We would also like to say that, at a time when the\ninternational community must confront complex challenges,\nit is a great privilege for the United Nations to be able to\nrely on the creativity, dynamism and determination that the\nSecretary-General brings to his lofty office.\nWe are pleased to welcome the Republics of Kiribati\nand Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as new members in\nour Organization.\nThe annual session of the General Assembly which\nopened a few days ago will lead us into the next\nmillennium; during the session, preparations will be made\nfor various important events planned for the year 2000,\nincluding the special sessions of the General Assembly on\nthe implementation of the outcome of the World Summit\nfor Social Development and Further Initiatives and the\nFourth World Conference on Women.\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly will\nalso prepare for a major event, the millennium summit.\nTherefore, this will be a time when we will need to\ndemonstrate not only our most lucid thinking, but also and\nperhaps primarily a firm will to act. The core of our\ndiscussions will be the great challenges that humanity faces\ntoday and will face in the foreseeable future, and we will\nneed to identify what must be done to meet them\nsuccessfully. In that regard, clarification of the role which\nthe United Nations must play and specific ways for it to\nattain this goal must be a priority of the summit agenda.\nWe are at the end of a decade marked by a new phase\nin international affairs, a decade, however, that was one of\nunmet expectations when we think back to how high they\nwere at its beginning. The experience of the past few years\nhas been one of continuous increase in the complexity and\nfrequency of emerging situations leading to a veritable\noverhaul of concepts and perceptions. But we are not sure\nthat we are any closer to the major solutions we lack. It\nmight even be said that we have embarked on a process\nthat has its own logic and momentum and in which the\nattainment of common aspirations does not always seem\nto be the driving force. Yet today, and not only today, we\nhave at our disposal sufficient intellectual and material\nresources to build a successful future. It is therefore\ndisquieting to have to acknowledge that, despite all this\npotential, humankind is still incapable of controlling its\nown destiny. Acquiring this ability is an imperative,\ntherefore, and must be the fundamental goal of our\ndebates at the dawn of the new millennium.\nGiven that the destiny of humankind is a collective\nchallenge, control over it must be sought collectively for\nit to be meaningful. The effective implementation of the\nconcept of \u201cinternational community\u201d, which has been the\nbasis of our political philosophy for a long time now, can\nno longer be avoided or postponed as it has been so far.\nWhen the millennium summit meets a year from\nnow, the leaders of the world must be prepared to start\nrebuilding an international community and usher in a new\nera in which sustainable human development will become\na real right for all peoples; in which international justice\nwill be more effective; and in which the United Nations\nCharter will no longer be applied in a manner that bends\nwith the wind.\nDemocracy as a means of ordering and managing\nsocieties has seen important progress during this decade.\nIn its most visible aspects, such as the selection of leaders\nthrough pluralistic, more transparent processes, it is\nbased on an understanding that governance by elected\nofficials can and should bring peace, prosperity and\njustice to a society and that elected leaders are politically\naccountable for the results obtained.\nAs we all know, these assumptions are not absolute\nand are becoming even less so. When looking at\ngovernments individually, it is apparent that command\nand control of important factors which determine the\nwell-being of citizens are sorely lacking. Meeting the\nnecessary conditions for each State to succeed depends to\na large extent on multilateral concertation and\ncooperation. This dialogue between States, however, will\nnot be enough to resolve all the points at issue, which are\nincreasingly in the hands of third parties.\nToday, therefore, there is a growing gap between\nsocial responsibility \u2014 which remains limited to the\npublic and the political domains \u2014 and the availability\n10\n\n\nof the wherewithal and will to act on which this\nresponsibility is based. However the situation evolves,\nadjustment must be ensured through revitalization of this\nsame concept of \u201cinternational community\u201d to which I\nreferred. Once again, this concept proves to be the\ncornerstone of the quest for a harmonious and prosperous\ndestiny for humankind.\nThe progress to which we aspire will always coexist\nwith differences and even inequality. Of that we are well\naware. But the shocking magnitude of poverty today must\nprovoke a gut feeling of rejection that makes it imperative\nfor this situation to be remedied at any cost. The palliative\nmeasures that we seek to introduce and maintain should not\nlull us and cannot take the place of definitive solutions. It\nis imperative that poverty should no longer be seen as an\nacceptable or inevitable by-product of the economic and\nsocial process: rather, we should come to see it as a serious\nbreakdown in it that must be attacked and corrected. Even\nin societies considered to be well off, poverty victimizes\ncertain segments of the population that lack even the\nminimum material conditions to live in dignity. The least-\ndeveloped countries are even less able to roll back poverty\nin any meaningful way.\nSpeaking of poverty necessarily prompts a discussion\nof the situation in Africa, where the greatest number of\nleast-developed countries are found. We have said\nbefore \u2014 and this does not detract from Africa's own,\ninherent responsibility \u2014 that the way Africa has been left\nout of development is also a failure of the international\nsystem. Africa's development difficulties have often been\naggravated by conflicts, but we cannot just wait for peace\nto happen there or be discouraged by the current situation.\nFinally, while conflicts in Africa have many causes,\neconomic underdevelopment has been recognized as an\nimportant factor. It is therefore regrettable to witness the\nreduction in development assistance in Africa; this has a\ndirect negative impact on the living conditions of its\npeoples, including a decline in health standards, the\ndooming to failure of adequate education prospects and a\nslowdown in provision of the necessary African\ninfrastructure. The impact has been worsened by the\ndecrease in official development assistance to small island\ndeveloping States, some of which \u2014 in apparent\ncontradiction to their particular structural constraints \u2014 are\nshowing relatively acceptable human development\nindicators and higher gross national product per head\nindicators than those found at the bottom of the world\nscale. That, together with the good performance of these\ncountries, has often been used to justify a precipitous and\ndisastrous reduction in official development assistance.\nWe would not claim that our countries should be\nspared from changing and improving in order to mobilize\nand rechannel resources towards these areas and many\nothers that I have mentioned. I would, however, stress\nthat this reduction in assistance, due to a certain \u201cfatigue\u201d\nthat sometimes takes on the appearance of a form of\npunishment, cannot solve anything. Rather, development\nassistance policy should continue to seek means of\ncombating and eliminating wasteful activities and\nguarantee an effective channelling of resources towards\nactivities that are necessary to development.\nOf course, we agree that official development\nassistance is not the key to prosperity. But, added to\nvigorous strides with regard to debt to ease the current\nfinancial stranglehold, it facilitates the creation of\nfavourable human and material conditions for direct\ninvestment, competitiveness, fruitful trade and Africa\u2019s\nlasting integration into the world economy.\nThis reference to Africa\u2019s external debt is not mere\nrhetoric. While welcoming recent steps taken and\nannounced by countries and groups of creditors that have\na particular solidarity with Africa, I must say that this\nquestion has for too long been dealt with too\nungenerously, too late and too slowly. Today\u2019s steps,\nlimited in content and in the range of countries concerned,\nand with overly restrictive eligibility conditions, would\nhave had much more impact if they had been taken when\nthey were so urgently demanded a long time ago.\nMoreover, they would have facilitated the continuation\nand necessary deepening of the economic and political\nreforms under way on the African continent, and would\nhave stimulated increased African regional cooperation.\nAfter 24 years of illegal occupation and extreme\nsuffering inflicted on the people of East Timor, the\nprocess of self-determination appeared to be leading to an\nhonourable conclusion for all interested parties. But with\ngreat dismay and indignation we witnessed violent events\nin the Territory in recent weeks. These vile acts,\nperpetrated by people determined to reverse the choice of\nindependence that the Timorese clearly expressed at the\nballot box, could and should have been prevented, and\nthey should receive the total rejection and most vigorous,\neffective condemnation of the international community.\nSince the illegal occupation and annexation of East\nTimor by Indonesia, Cape Verde always strongly\n\n\n\ndefended the cause of the Timorese people and always\nfought for the retention of the problem of East Timor on\nthe Assembly's agenda. We reaffirm our tireless support for\nEast Timor\u2019s independence and for the territorial integrity\nof this fraternal country, and we call upon the United\nNations to act with all necessary firmness to promote and\nguarantee the full implementation of the New York\nagreements, in particular the provisions of Security Council\nresolution 1264 (1999).\nWe therefore welcome the arrival of the International\nForce in East Timor (INTERFET) and strongly support any\nnecessary measures it might take to carry out its mission of\nrestoring order and security; protecting the Timorese people\nfrom coercion, intimidation, violence and terrorism; and\nguaranteeing a peaceful transition towards independence.\nHowever, our pleasure at the effective quick reaction\nby the international community as a result of the pressure\nof worldwide public opinion should not allow us to forget\nthe thousands of Timorese suffering great shortages and\nbrutal violations of their most elementary human rights, or\nthe men, women and children persecuted and forcibly\ndeported to West Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia simply\nbecause they freely exercised the right of a people to self-\ndetermination under the aegis of the United Nations. It\nfollows that the international community has a moral and\nlegal duty to give them immediate, sufficient humanitarian\nassistance; to promote and guarantee the return of all\nTimorese refugees and deported persons, with dignity and\nsecurity; to bring to international justice all those morally\nand physically responsible for crimes against humanity and\ngross violations of the most fundamental human rights,\ncommitted in East Timor in a planned, systematic way; and\nto provide substantial, effective support for the\nreconstruction of a country which has suffered from\ncriminal, premeditated destruction.\nIn Angola, unfortunately, hostilities have resumed and\nthe prospects for the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol\nhave vanished, despite United Nations intervention, which,\nit must be acknowledged, has not been successful. The\nclear inability of the international community to secure\nstrict compliance by all the parties and States concerned\nwith the commitments that they undertook under\nagreements negotiated under the aegis of the United\nNations, including resolutions of its own bodies, has led to\nthe re-emergence of this conflict. That is because it has not\nprevented UNITA from seriously rearming and impeding\nthe extension of State administration to the whole of\nAngola's territory.\nThe magnitude of the long and bloody conflict in\nAngola should be a source of great concern to the\ninternational community, which should continue and\nintensify its efforts to identify possible ways of restoring\npeace to Angola, efforts that should be deployed by all\nthe entities that can contribute. Cape Verde will not fail\nto participate to the extent that its resources allow.\nOne priority must be to bring together everything\nneeded to deal with the unprecedented humanitarian\ncatastrophe hitting Angola. The need is great and urgent.\nEverything possible should be done to provide immediate\nand adequate humanitarian assistance to the people\nsuffering from the scourge of war.\nCape Verde follows with the same fraternal\nsolidarity developments in neighbouring Guinea-Bissau,\nwhere the Government is making preparations, with the\nassistance of the United Nations and the international\ncommunity, to hold free democratic elections.\nWe look forward to the success of the people of\nGuinea-Bissau as it enters a new stage in its life, when\nthe whole of society is preparing to rebuild its country\nand to use all of its resources to improve its living\nconditions. We call upon the international community to\nprovide ongoing generous support to rebuild the country\nwithin this long-term process.\nWe welcome recent events reflecting the decision of\nthe United Nations to intervene more concretely to\nmaintain peace in Africa, particularly in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and Sierra Leone \u2014 and we hope\nsoon in Eritrea and in Ethiopia.\nToday it is clear that our continent is more than ever\ndetermined to harmonize its efforts to control and resolve\nconflicts in the region while hoping for the necessary\noutside support to strengthen its capacity in this regard.\nRegional responsibilities cannot, however, take the place\nof the responsibilities of the United Nations, which must\nfully play the role given it by the Charter.\nAs well as efforts to contain and resolve conflicts,\nthere must be \u2014 as has often been stated, but all too\noften not put into practice \u2014 efforts to prevent them.\nThey are often rooted in long-standing situations of\ninjustice, exclusion, inequality and the denial of rights.\nThe latter is something that individuals, groups and even\nwhole nations continue to suffer from.\n12\n\n\nWherever flouted dignity cannot properly voice its\nlegitimate demands, wherever those demands do not receive\na reasonable response, conflict is brewing. It is true that\nsome established situations do not lend themselves to rapid\nor dramatic change. In those cases sincere dialogue and\nhealthy compromise may open the way to a progress that\nintolerance and lack of willingness can never bring about.\nWhile the conflicts prevailing today are basically\ninternal, it would be irresponsible for us to ignore the\nexternal factors that feed them. From classic territorial\ndisputes to more diffuse questions with an impact on the\nacquisition of advantages in economic competition, we see\non the international scene various factors that thwart the\ndesired security and balance. We must replace the narrow\ncriterion of national self-interest, or its equivalents, as the\nparadigm of international affairs with multilateral\nparticipative arrangements based on equity.\nAmong the items on the agenda that this session\ninherited from the previous one, reform of the Security\nCouncil is a key element for rebuilding and revitalizing the\nUnited Nations. For some years it has been the subject of\nongoing negotiations. This entire time, we feel, was needed\nfor the various bases and arguments underpinning existing\npositions and proposals to be properly understood.\nThe questions posed are complex, and we cannot deny\nthe relevance of any position. The basic divergence, we\nthink, lies in the priority given by some to the preservation\nof the Council\u2019s effectiveness and by others to the\nrepresentation of the current body of Member States. We\nbelieve that the impasse we are facing is clear and that the\nconsideration we have already given to the matter should\nenable us to take decisions in the not-too-distant future.\nWe believe that increasing the Council\u2019s effectiveness,\nwhile increasing the number of its members, is a challenge\nwithin our grasp. In our view, we should not give more\nweight to the size of the gap, which is quite small, between\nthe various proposals made in this area than to the special\nnature of the fundamental principles of representative\nparticipation.\nFor example, how can one, by attaching more\nimportance to the question of effectiveness, refuse to give\nthe African countries, which represent almost 30 per cent\nof the United Nations membership, at least two permanent\nseats enjoying full powers?\nWe hope, Mr. President, that under your enlightened\nguidance we can make a big leap forward in the\nconsideration of this important agenda item during the\ncurrent session.\nBefore I conclude, I wish to reiterate what a constant\nsource of inspiration the Charter is to us. I refer in\nparticular to the noble and always relevant words of the\npreamble, whose implementation will be a constant\nchallenge to us in the course of the century to come.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation\nof Uganda, I should like to congratulate His Excellency Mr.\nTheo-Ben Gurirab and all the Vice-Presidents on their\nelection to guide the deliberations of the General Assembly\nat its last session of this century. I also thank the President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session for the\neffective manner in which he discharged his responsibilities.\nAllow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts on behalf\nof the United Nations, especially in the area of the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nUganda is pleased to welcome to membership of the\nUnited Nation the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\nAt the end of this turbulent century and on the eve of\nwhat my delegation hopes will be a more peaceful and\nprosperous new century, the United Nations stands out as\nthe best hope for the future of humankind, international\ncooperation and solidarity. Uganda believes that a strong\nand effective United Nations is the best guarantor of\nworld peace and the most effective instrument to prevent\nanother world war. My Government is therefore\ndetermined to play a constructive role in ensuring that the\nUnited Nations of the twenty-first century will be\nincreasingly dedicated to the noble principles and\npurposes enshrined in the Charter. Those principles and\npurposes, which have stood the test of time, must\ncontinue to serve the peoples of the world and guide this\nworld Organization.\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, the\neconomic situation in Africa and the living conditions of\nthe vast majority of Africans are a cause of concern for\nmy delegation. By virtually any standard, the African\ncontinent remains marginalized. The statistics for the\ncontinent are dismal. With slightly over 10 per cent of the\nworld's population, sub-Saharan Africa accounts for a\nmeagre 1.5 per cent of world trade. The region receives\nless than 0.6 per cent of total foreign direct investment.\nCoupled with this is the fact that Africa's export earnings\nhave been on the decline due to a significant decrease in\nthe demand for primary commodities; Africa's terms of\ntrade have not improved; a crushing debt burden and a\nserious lack of capacity to generate domestic savings have\nworsened the economic situation. These negative trends\nhave increased the dependence of most sub-Saharan\nAfrican countries on official development assistance, but\nofficial development assistance itself has also been on the\ndecline, falling from 0.33 per cent of the combined gross\nnational product of donors members of the Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development in 1992 to\n0.22 per cent in 1998. This is a far cry from the 0.7 per\ncent target agreed upon by the international community in\nthe early 1970s.\nThe current state of economic globalization indicates\nthat Africa remains the least integrated continent and the\nmost marginalized economically. Africa has effectively\nbeen locked out of the benefits accruing from\nglobalization. The challenge before the international\ncommunity is to adopt and implement, as a matter of\nurgency, concrete measures to mitigate the negative\nconsequences of globalization on African economies. The\nUnited Nations must take the lead in efforts to restructure\nthe international monetary system to make it more\nresponsive to the plight of African and other developing\ncountries. Uganda believes that fundamental restructuring\nof the present international economic system is essential\nto transform the world from a mere constellation of\nwealthy cities surrounded by a galaxy of abject poverty\ninto a truly global village.\n33\n\n\nThe pivotal role played by transnational corporations\nin this inequitable economic system demands that the\nUnited Nations play a more active role in our collective\nefforts to regulate the activities of these powerful non-state\nactors. My delegation would like to propose the revival of\nthe United Nations Centre on Transnational Corporations\nand the United Nations Commission on Transnational\nCorporations for that purpose. The increasing control and\ndominance exercised by global corporations over the world\neconomy has serious consequences for many of us. It is\ntime Governments, and not multinational corporations, set\nthe international agenda for economic cooperation and\ndevelopment.\nI would like to underscore Uganda's commitment to\nuphold the tenets of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms. We believe in the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and all other international human rights\ninstruments. At the national level, Uganda has incorporated\nthe universal principles of human rights into the basic law\nof the country, and we are committed to the principles of\ngood governance, transparency and accountability.\nThe world is aware of the great debate taking place in\nUganda about the process of our democratization. In\naccordance with our Constitution, the people of Uganda\nwill exercise a free choice to determine their system of\ngovernance in a referendum next year. I take this\nopportunity to invite observers and others who may wish to\nwitness the referendum to do so when the time comes.\nWith regard to internal conflicts, Uganda has granted\na blanket amnesty to all who lay down their arms and\nbecome part of civil society. An amnesty Bill is before our\nParliament, and in a very short time will be passed into\nlaw.\nI would be remiss if I did not emphasize Uganda's\ncommitment to the observance, in the region, of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms. In 1994 the world was\nwitness to genocide in Rwanda in which an estimated 1\nmillion people were massacred. A similar act was about to\nbe perpetrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in\nthe course of 1997 and 1998. Apart from our legitimate\nconcerns about our national security and territorial integrity,\nUganda finds it unacceptable that gross violations of the\nright to life should again be carried out in its\nneighbourhood or anywhere else in the world.\nIt is vital for all of us to recognize the sanctity of the\nright to life. We are glad to note that the evolution of\ninternational law on human rights no longer condones\ngenocide under the guise of non-interference in a\ncountry's internal affairs. The principle of non-interference\nin the internal affairs of States has been so fundamentally\neroded that the international community should now\nopenly adopt a definitive convention which will permit\ninstant intervention in cases of massive threats to the right\nto life.\nIn July 1998 the United Nations Conference of\nPlenipotentiaries overwhelmingly adopted the Statute for\nthe establishment of an International Criminal Court.\nUganda has consistently identified itself with the entire\nprocess which culminated in the adoption of the Court's\nStatute. It was to many a triumphant moment for those\nhitherto yearning for a world in which individual persons,\nregardless of their socio-economic or political attributes,\nwould be held personally accountable for acts or\nomissions resulting in genocide, war crimes and crimes\nagainst humanity. At present work is under way in the\nPreparatory Commission for the Court to define\naggression as a core crime. Once the Statute comes into\nforce, it holds humanity's best hope for a new world legal\norder under which nobody, however high or low, can\nengage in horrendous crimes with impunity.\nWe urge the international community to support our\nefforts in the Great Lakes region focused on stopping,\naverting and reversing progression towards further chaos\nand restoring peace. Such support must include real\nimprovement of the socioeconomic wellbeing of our\npeoples through debt cancellations, promotion of\ndemocratic governance, adherence to sustainable human\nrights standards and, above all, strengthening our regional\nconflict- resolution mechanisms, peacemaking and peace-\nbuilding initiatives.\nThroughout this year world attention has been\nrepeatedly drawn to the fact that citizens of the world are\nabout to enter a new millennium. I would like to share\nwith the Assembly Uganda's expectations for the new\ncentury and millennium with regard to the role of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe in Uganda recognize that the United Nations\nplayed a pivotal role in the decolonization of Africa and\nother parts of the world. The United Nations played an\nequally vital role in the eradication of institutionalized\nracial discrimination in southern Africa. For all these\nefforts we are grateful.\nThe question arises as to what should be the vision\nand goals of the United Nations through the next century.\n34\n\n\nIt is the view and expectation of the people of Uganda that\nthe focus of the United Nations should be the elimination\nof poverty in Africa and the rest of the underdeveloped\nworld. The factors underlying underdevelopment have been\nmentioned several times. However, implementation of\nsolutions has fallen short of expectations.\nWe urge the United Nations to adopt concrete\nmeasures to deal with problems of the external debt burden,\nilliteracy, disease and famine. We expect the United\nNations, through the World Trade Organization, to create a\nmore favourable international trading regime which can\npromote fair competition and permit the ascendancy of\nprimary commodity producers from abject poverty to\nreasonable wealth.\nUganda supports the heroic struggle of the Sahraoui\npeople for self-determination, and we look forward to the\nholding of a referendum by the United Nations to enable\nthe people of that territory to freely determine their destiny.\nMy delegation would like to express deep appreciation to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and former United\nStates Secretary of State, Mr. James Baker, for their tireless\nefforts in this regard. We appeal to the Government of the\nKingdom of Morocco to respect the verdict of the Sahraoui\npeople and to facilitate the implementation of whatever\ndecision they make.\nThe situation in the Great Lakes region, and\nparticularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has\nbeen cause for serious concern, not only to the countries in\nthe region, but also to the international community. On its\npart, Uganda continues to view issues of peace and stability\nin the region with the utmost seriousness, which they\ndeserve.\nUganda's desire for peace and stability is born out of\nits conviction that without regional peace and security there\ncan be no meaningful economic development and social\nwell-being of its people. Uganda is hopeful that the\nconflicts that today beset many countries in the region will\ngive way to peace and eventual socio-economic\ntransformation. We are also hopeful that, with the region's\nresolve, we shall be able to surmount the challenges and\nexploit the opportunities of the new millennium. Indeed,\nsustained efforts are being made to put an end to the crisis\nand contribute to the search for peaceful solutions to the\nproblems facing the region. And whereas efforts and\ncontributions towards peace in the region have traversed a\nlong and difficult road, there is optimism for the future.\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\ncountries in the region, with the support of the\ninternational community, have been working tirelessly\ntowards promoting a peaceful solution to the crisis. We\nacknowledge the regional efforts, under the leadership of\nPresident Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, which culminated\nin the signing of the ceasefire Agreement. I pay tribute to\nall the parties concerned for this achievement and to all\nwell-wishers for their continued support for the peace\nprocess. The Agreement was thoroughly negotiated to the\nsatisfaction of all the parties.\nUganda appeals to the international community to\nassist in efforts to operationalize the Joint Military\nCommission and the Political Committee, which are\norgans of the Lusaka Agreement and the key to the\nsuccess of this Agreement and, therefore, to peace in the\nsubregion.\nUganda is committed to the implementation of the\nLusaka Agreement and believes that all the signatories to\nthe Agreement are committed to its success. Against this\nbackground, it was unnecessary for this matter to be\nincluded on the agenda of the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly. The Ceasefire Agreement essentially\ncovers the two primary causes of the conflict in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, namely, the external\nand internal dimensions. Regarding the external\ndimension, a mechanism was established to handle the\nsecurity concerns of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and its neighbouring countries, including Uganda.\nIn particular, the Security Council was requested, in\ncollaboration with the Organization of African Unity, to\nconstitute, facilitate and deploy an appropriate\npeacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo to ensure implementation of the Agreement,\nincluding the tracking down, disarming and documenting\nof all renegade forces in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\nRegarding the internal dimension, the Congolese\nparties agreed to undertake political negotiations as a\nresult of which the parties are expected to conclude an\nagreement leading to a new political dispensation in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, to the restructuring\nand rebuilding of a new national army in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and to the establishment and\nstrengthening of State administration over the entire\nterritory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is\nUganda's hope that the inter-Congolese negotiations will\nprovide an opportunity for the Congolese parties to\naddress issues of good governance. Our desire for the\n35\n\n\nCongolese people to reach mutual understanding derives\nfrom the fact that political instability in any neighbouring\ncountry directly impinges on our own security and\neconomic development. We will look forward, therefore, to\nthe early beginning and success of the inter-Congolese\nnegotiations.\nRegarding the conflict in the Sudan, Uganda supports\nthe ongoing peace initiative launched under the auspices of\nthe Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\nand with the facilitation of President Daniel arap Moi of\nKenya. As a neighbour and a member of IGAD, Uganda\nhas been working closely with the other countries in the\nregion in efforts aimed at a peaceful resolution of the\nconflict. However, peace in that country remains elusive.\nUganda is convinced that the fundamental issue in the\nSudanese crisis is the link between state and religion. In a\nmultireligious and multicultural society such as the Sudan,\nthe only way to achieve good governance is to guarantee\nfreedom of worship, equality and respect for all.\nAt the bilateral level, we are concerned at the\nincreasing hostility towards Uganda from the Sudan, as\nmanifested in the consistent violation of Uganda's territorial\nintegrity and in active support for rebel groups that are\ndestabilizing us. Uganda has embraced and will continue to\nembrace all initiatives aimed at reconciliation with the\nSudan, despite the fact that all previous initiatives have\nfailed. I would like to single out initiatives by former\nPresident Rafsanjani of Iran, President Bakili Muluzi of\nMalawi, President Qadhafi of Libya, former President\nMandela of South Africa and others \u2014 all these efforts\nhave come to naught.\nThe three East African countries of Kenya, Tanzania\nand Uganda are very conscious of the fact that political\nstability is a prerequisite for economic development and\nhave taken the necessary measures to achieve this objective.\nThe three countries, together with their partners in the\nregion, are engaged in regional peace efforts for Burundi,\nthe Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nthrough organizations such as IGAD and the Southern\nAfrican Development Community. The three countries have\ninvested in peace in order to ensure regional stability\nbecause of the recognition that peace and political stability\nare vital if the region is to attract investments.\nToday, our region has created a favourable\nenvironment for foreign investment. There exists a very\nstrong political will to move the region towards closer\ncooperation. We have harmonized many of our economic\npolicies, and a number of joint activities in support of\nregional economic integration are being undertaken. The\nthree countries are now in an advanced stage of\ncementing the relationship by signing a treaty that would\nestablish the East African Community before the end of\nthe year. We thank our development partners who have\nbeen supporting our efforts towards regional economic\nintegration and look forward to continued cooperation,\nespecially in the area of infrastructure development and in\nthe field of capacity-building for the private sector, which\nhave been identified as the key areas.\nIn conclusion, I would like to state that Uganda\nshares the vision of an African renaissance in which\nAfrican peoples participate fully in their systems of\ngovernance and in the process of determining their\ndestiny. We believe that this is a recipe for rapid\neconomic development and therefore for the eradication\nof poverty in Africa."

        "file_text": "First let me\ncongratulate you, Sir, the Foreign Minister of Namibia, on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly this\nsession. I certainly recall my meetings with you and your\nPresident in your country last year.\nI also wish to welcome three new Members to the\nUnited Nations \u2014 Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga \u2014 all very\nclose friends and neighbours of New Zealand. I trust that\nthe faith they have shown in the United Nations will be\nfulfilled in the years ahead, and we certainly look forward\nto working closely with them.\nWhen addressing this Assembly, especially as a\nrepresentative of a smaller Member State, one is reminded\n10\n\n\nthat the United Nations must remain the fundamental point\nof reference in international relations. Indeed, that is a truth\nthat all Member States have an obligation to acknowledge.\nFurthermore, it is of course sound policy for all who need\nand rely on the rule of international law in place of\nlawlessness. And it is particularly important to restate it at\nthis time. The United Nations collective security\nframework, which is one of the fundamental elements of\nthe Charter together with cooperation on economic and\nsocial problems and promoting respect for human rights,\nhas perhaps never been more severely tested than in this\nlast year of the twentieth century.\nArmed conflicts, many of them internal and ethnically\nbased, have continued to present a serious moral challenge\nto the international community, and they are likely to do so\nfor the foreseeable future. The Security Council's response\nto these problems does not always increase our confidence\nin the Organization.\nThe Secretary-General's remarks in his statement at the\nbeginning of this debate about the need to reconcile\nuniversal legitimacy with effectiveness in defence of human\nrights were most timely. New Zealanders place a very good\ndeal of faith in the United Nations: when we see on our\ntelevision screens evidence of violence and inhumanity\nagainst the vulnerable, and we are told that the Security\nCouncil cannot reach an agreement on collective action, we\nare left worried, and wondering whether our trust in the\nSecurity Council is well placed. A Council which loses the\ntrust of the people is a Council which will become\nirrelevant.\nI want to talk to the Assembly about two extremely\nserious challenges the Council faced this year: Kosovo and\nEast Timor. Both highlight the importance of the actions of\nthe Security Council.\nIn East Timor, following President Habibie's\ncourageous offer to the East Timorese people, prompt and\neffective action was taken by the Security Council to set in\ntrain the popular consultation process. The ballot \u2014\nundertaken in extremely difficult circumstances by highly\ncommitted United Nations workers, international and local,\nall of whom deserve acclaim \u2014 produced a resounding and\nincontrovertible expression of the will of the East Timorese\npeople. This was the essential basis for the international\ncommunity's response since the ballot.\nPost-ballot events were appallingly tragic and have\nrightly provoked a strong reaction around the world. The\ndispatch to Jakarta and Dili of the Security Council mission\nled by Ambassador Andjaba of Namibia was a key step\nin addressing this grievous situation. The efforts made by\nrepresentatives of all countries present at the time of the\nmeeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\nleaders in Auckland, joined by the British Foreign\nSecretary representing the European Union, reinforced the\nSecretary-General's urging that Indonesia accept the offer\nof international help. The assistance could not have come\ntoo early.\nNew Zealand is proud to be a contributor, alongside\nthe forces of other nations from the region and from\nfurther afield, and under the leadership of Australia, to the\nUnited-Nations-authorized multinational force that is now\noperating in East Timor. Our soldiers from New Zealand\nare on the ground in East Timor right now. We are\nprepared also to take part in the United Nations\npeacekeeping operation foreshadowed in Security Council\nresolution 1264 (1999), and we urge the Council to take\nprompt action \u2014 next week would not be too soon \u2014 to\nestablish this operation, which would be part of the\nUnited Nations transitional administration in East Timor.\nWe are contributing to the efforts of humanitarian\nagencies to provide support to the hundreds of thousands\nof ordinary people who have been displaced in East\nTimor; those currently in West Timor should be speedily\nrepatriated. New Zealand has added its voice to those who\nbelieve that the people responsible for crimes against\nhumanity in East Timor should be brought to account.\nThe overriding objective must now be to ensure the\nrealization of the 30 August ballot outcome and East\nTimor's transition to independence. It is clear that in\nlaying the basis for East Timor's future, the United\nNations will be the indispensable organization.\nIt is inevitable that comparison will be made\nbetween East Timor and Kosovo. In Kosovo the world\nsaw a grave humanitarian crisis with the Security Council\nunable to act. In New Zealand's view, collective action to\ntry to put a stop to a humanitarian disaster involving\ngenocide and the most serious crimes against humanity\nshould never be held hostage to the veto. When it is, the\nSecurity Council loses its credibility and its relevance. I\nneed hardly reiterate New Zealand's continuing opposition\nto the veto, voiced since San Francisco in 1945. While it\nis understandable that national interests will influence\nhow members vote in the Security Council, we have\nnever accepted that some narrow interests of any one of\nfive countries should be able to override the will of a\nclear majority of members.\n\n\n\nThe adoption by the Security Council of its resolution\n1244 (1999) of 10 June, which provided the international\ncommunity's endorsement of a political solution to the\nKosovo conflict, was certainly greeted with much relief in\nmost quarters, including in New Zealand. The resolution\nwas proof, if any were needed, that the United Nations\nremains, as in East Timor, the indispensable organization.\nAnd as the Secretary-General observed at the time, it also\ngave strong legal underpinning to the task ahead, a task\nwhich, he noted, is daunting. The contribution of the\ndedicated United Nations and specialized agency staff who\nare now working with little fanfare in Kosovo certainly\ndeserves our recognition.\nBoth Kosovo and East Timor have put the Security\nCouncil to the test. In their own ways they have challenged\nthis Organization's capacity to take effective action in the\nface of severe difficulties. The world must never again\nwitness horrors such as those in Kosovo whilst the Security\nCouncil remains impotent. The case of East Timor shows\nthat the Security Council can react swiftly and effectively\nwhen the will exists. For this to be possible, the fullest\ncommitment to support those humanitarian ideals that are\nthe basis of the United Nations Charter remains essential.\nThe adoption of the Rome Statute of the International\nCriminal Court shows such a commitment. The\ninternational community must now deliver on its promise,\nwith signature and early ratification of that Statute.\nAs we know, the United Nations also has before it the\npressing demands of the various and sometimes interrelated\nconflicts throughout Africa with, of course, their appalling\nhumanitarian consequences. Who can put out of their minds\nthe images of atrocities we have seen from Sierra Leone,\nfor instance? Yet the Council's response has until very\nrecently been low-level. Once again, the credibility of the\nSecurity Council depends in large part on its being seen as\neven-handed in its attention to crises, wherever they may\noccur, and whether the Cable News Network (CNN) is\nthere or not.\nFor much of the past year we have seen the Council\nvirtually paralysed on the important question of\ndisarmaming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. In the\nmeantime, this potentially very serious threat to the security\nof the region remains unresolved. The reason again has\nbeen the very sharp divisions among the permanent\nmembers, which by virtue of the veto power can block any\naction. This situation remains unacceptable.\nNew Zealand's awareness of the importance of the\nrole of collective action has also been heightened by\nrecent events in our own immediate region. Here, the\nUnited Nations demonstrated its ability to respond to the\ndifferent demands of supporting the regionally inspired\npeace process on the island of Bougainville, part of Papua\nNew Guinea, and of assessing the needs created by\ndisruptions to the population on Guadalcanal in the\nSolomon Islands.\nThe United Nations must be capable of responding\neffectively. Small and vulnerable nations in particular\nneed confidence in the United Nations, as it may be their\nonly hope in times of trouble. I am very concerned\ntherefore by the apparent trend away from financing new\npeacekeeping operations by means of assessed\ncontributions and an increasing reliance instead on\nvoluntary funding. This, of course, poses a threat to the\ncollective responsibility that is at the heart of this\nOrganization. In practical terms it is likely to mean that\nthose regions which fail to attract donor support will not\nreceive the response they are entitled to as Members of\nthe United Nations. This trend must be urgently reversed;\nall operations must be put on an equal financial footing\nby means of assessed contributions.\nIn addition, as I noted here last year, the largest\ncontributor's arrears to the peacekeeping and regular\nbudgets continue to cast a long shadow over the\nOrganization. Outstanding dues and very slow payments\nto troop contributors affect us all, and can severely\nconstrain the ability of countries to contribute to pressing\npeacekeeping needs. We call again on those Member\nStates who are in dereliction of their obligations to make\npayment on time, in full and, of course, without\nconditions.\nReform of the Security Council remains one of the\nmost important items on our agenda. Further useful\nprogress has been made this year. While the issue of\nenlargement continues to be complex, we believe there\nhas existed for some time wide agreement on the equally\nimportant areas of reforming the Council's working\nmethods and the curtailing of the veto. The linkage\nbetween the veto and enlargement was also explicitly\nrecognized in this year's report to the General Assembly\nof the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\nRelated to the Security Council.\n12\n\n\nAs for the task of providing more equitable\nrepresentation, I am not convinced that we will be able to\nachieve this while the regional groups in the United Nations\ncontinue to reflect the political geography of the 1960s.\nQuite different and far more sensible arrangements have\nbeen adopted in other multilateral forums, as, for example,\nin the context of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT). The present system here in New York\nlocks in very great disparities in representation. Small\ncountries that can make an excellent contribution are often\nseverely disadvantaged, especially where a political bloc\ninside a regional group may coordinate closely on electoral\nmatters.\nI would, therefore, wish to add my voice to those of\nthe Prime Ministers of Fiji and Samoa and the Foreign\nMinisters of Papua New Guinea and Australia, who spoke\nearlier in this debate on the need for reconfiguration.\nReconfiguration of the regional groups may well hold one\nof the keys to an overall package on Security Council\nreform.\nNew Zealand still looks forward to the day when we\ncan join a regional group here in New York which includes\nour Asia-Pacific neighbours. In the meantime, we will\ncontinue to build linkages in our region and developing the\nmany areas of our common understanding.\nOne of the great strengths of the General Assembly is\nthe equal status ascribed to each Member. All Members,\nlarge or small, rich or poor, have a right to be heard here.\nEach has a single vote. While we must all from time to\ntime temper our own national ambitions in the interests of\nreaching a common understanding, we respect the point of\nview of each individual member. The special session on\nsmall island developing States over the last few days was\na very good opportunity to do just that. New Zealand is\nfirmly committed to assisting the small island developing\nStates SIDS in the spirit of common purpose and\npartnership envisaged at Barbados five years ago. We are\nvery pleased that all participants in the special session have\nreaffirmed their commitment to implement fully the\nBarbados Programme of Action.\nIn April New Zealand, represented by my colleague,\nthe Honourable Simon Upton, had the privilege of chairing\nthe seventh session of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment. We were pleased to be able to help\nreinvigorate debate and build consensus around the need for\na more coordinated approach to stewardship of the world's\noceans and the need to recognise, in an ongoing way, the\nspecial characteristics and needs of small island\ndeveloping States.\nThe Commission faces the great challenge of\npursuing the implementation of Agenda 21. Two other\ngreat challenges we as a world face on the environmental\nfront are the threat of global climate change, caused at\nleast in part by human-induced emissions of greenhouse\ngases, and the need to maintain an approach to\ninternational trade and environmental issues which is\nbased on sound scientific analysis and agreed rules and\nprocedures. It is vitally important that we should continue\nto act in concert to face these international challenges.\nInternational cooperation in addressing economic,\nsocial and humanitarian problems is, and always will be,\none of the cornerstones of the United Nations Charter.\nThe substantial decline in official development assistance\nflows over the last decade is of great concern to many\nMember States. In this connection, I am concerned to\nnote that the core resources of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) have been greatly\nreduced over the past five years, to the point where its\nuniversality is seriously threatened. I applaud the efforts\nthe new administrator is making to turn this situation\naround and to put UNDP on a more secure footing, with\nmore clearly defined priorities.\nPrivate capital flows to developing countries have\nshown major increases. There is a tendency, however, for\nsuch investment to be heavily concentrated on a few\ncountries where investment prospects seem brightest.\nMany developing countries remain vulnerable and can be\nall too easily marginalized. Official development\nassistance continues to be an essential tool to help build\nthe capacity of countries in sectors such as education so\nthat they can benefit from the unstoppable phenomenon\nof globalization. It is certainly a matter of particular pride\nfor me, as New Zealand's Foreign Minister, to have\noverseen increases in New Zealand's official development\nassistance funding effort \u2014 up by some 40 per cent since\nthe time of the Rio Summit in 1992.\nI welcome, also, the positive steps that are being\ntaken on the financing for development and debt-relief\ninitiatives. It is vital that we continue the dialogue among\nMember States and with the international financial\ninstitutions to ensure a sounder basis for meeting the\nchallenges of international development.\nLast year I referred to the important role the United\nNations has to play in shaping the moves towards\n13\n\n\nglobalization and the opening up of opportunities for world\ntrade. Later this year, in Seattle, we expect to launch a new\nround of multilateral trade negotiations. This will clearly\nprovide a forum in which to advance trade liberalization\nand the rules-based trading system. The role of these\nnegotiations in promoting the development prospects of all\ncountries and in fostering the integration of least developed\ncountries into the global system will be a particular focus.\nDeliberations in this Organization at many levels will help\nto advance our people's understanding of the value and\npurpose of the global trade agenda and their ability to\nbenefit from it. However, I would emphasise the\nimportance of major trading partners in continuing to play\na leadership role. The adoption of trade restrictions and\ndistortions by wealthy economies does much to erode their\nmoral authority in the broader debate.\nNew Zealand continues to attach the utmost\nimportance to seeing all countries work together to bring\nabout a world free of nuclear weapons. For this reason we\nwere a cosponsor last year of the so-called New Agenda\nresolution, which called for faster progress towards the\nelimination of nuclear weapons. The cosponsors will be\npresenting this moderate resolution again this year, and we\nurge all countries to look carefully at it.\nThe Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty will meet in\nVienna in a week's time. I would urge all those countries\nwhich have not ratified the Treaty to do so, so that it can\nenter into force without further delay.\nStrengthening the United Nations remains an important\ngoal for New Zealand. I take this opportunity to commend\nthe forward-looking management reforms introduced by the\nSecretary-General. They have greatly improved policy\ncoordination among senior management and have produced\npositive, tangible effects throughout the Secretariat.\nImproving the way the Organization plans its programmes\nand expenditures is a critical next step, where work is\nalready under way. There must be a greater focus on results\nwhen budgets are prepared in order to promote the best use\nof the resources of the Organization, and in turn the best\nreturn for Member States.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva\nConventions, and last year we commemorated the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nEvents over the past 12 months have shown that challenges\nto the values and principles embodied in the Universal\nDeclaration remain as daunting as ever. In this\ninterdependent world in which we live, New Zealand\ncontinues to see the United Nations as central to\ninternational efforts to work together to protect and\npromote, for all our people, those fundamental human\nrights and freedoms to which we are committed under the\nUniversal Declaration.\nNext year the United Nations will host the\nmillennium summit. This symbolic event will provide an\nexcellent opportunity for Member States to reaffirm their\ncommitment to the ideals of this great Organization.\nRecognizing the frailties of our collective performance to\ndate, and the critical importance of finding workable\nsolutions for the future, I call on all Member States to\ntake the opportunities offered by the millennium summit\nto enter into open and constructive dialogue and step into\nthe next millennium with an unequivocal recommitment\nto the visionary principles enshrined in the Charter.\nIt is nine years since I first addressed this body in\n1991 as the Foreign Minister of New Zealand. For the\nUnited Nations, and particularly the Security Council, it\nhas been a tumultuous period. After the cold war the\nnumber of problems multiplied; the world's expectations\nof what the United Nations could deliver were raised\nabove the possible; and the solutions demanded required\ndetermination, resolve, tact, understanding and\nimagination. The demands on the United Nations will not\nlessen, but each year must see a better performance than\nin the past. However, as this may well be the last\nstatement I make to this body, I want to thank all United\nNations officials and peacekeepers everywhere: those I\nhave met here in New York; in Cambodia and in\nSomalia; in Mozambique; in Bosnia, Croatia and Albania;\nin Papua New Guinea and, of course, now in East Timor.\nI thank them for their continuing, often unsung and heroic\nefforts. They are much appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset,\nit gives me great pleasure to extend to you, Sir, and to your\nfriendly country my sincere congratulations upon your\nelection as President of the General Assembly. I am fully\nconfident that you will steer the work of this important\nsession ably and effectively. I would also like to express\nmy appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, the\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session, for his wise\nconduct of the business of that session.\nIt also gives me pleasure on this occasion to salute the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his efforts to\nmaintain the role of the international Organization, improve\nits performance, increase its efficiency and restore its\ncredibility and effectiveness. My pleasure is all the greater\nin welcoming the Republics of Kiribati and Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga to membership of the United Nations.\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is\nbeing held at a historic juncture that comes only once every\n100 \u2014 indeed, every 1,000 \u2014 years. This is the last\nsession of the General Assembly before the end of the\ntwentieth century and of the second millennium since the\nbirth of Christ. That century and that millennium have\nembodied a combination of mankind's greatest\nachievements as well as catastrophic tragedies.\nYes, the second millennium has witnessed momentous\nevents. During the last century of this millennium, these\nevents have taken place at a pace faster than any recorded\nhistory of humanity. The outgoing century has become a\ncatalogue of contradictions, some of which bear testimony\nto mankind's genius and others to its ignominies and\nimmoralities. All our diverse civilizations, without\nexception, have produced warmongers and destructive\ntyrants. They have also produced great leaders, advocates\nof peace, inventors, creative artists, scientists, explorers and\nstatesmen who provided good leadership and gave wise\ncounsel.\nAccording to the Gregorian calendar, we are at the\nclose of a century and a millennium. By the Hijri calendar,\nwe are in the fifteenth century after the migration of the\nProphet Muhammad, who revealed to the world a noble\nreligion and gave it an enlightened civilization. We in\nEgypt are approaching the end of the seventh millennium\nin the life of an ancient country; a country that is as old as\nhistory itself; a country that contributed to the making and\nrecording of history. Humanity's attainments at this time\nand in this age are not the fruit of the achievements of the\ntwentieth century alone; rather, they are the result of the\naccumulated achievements made since the beginning of\ntime. The Egyptians excelled at science and engineering\nand were the first to profess monotheism. The\nBabylonians gave the world the alphabet. The Phoenicians\nmastered navigation. The Arab civilization flourished in\nal-Andalus, preserved Greek philosophy and added to it.\nThe Islamic civilization in Syria, Iraq, Egypt and Turkey\nmade great contributions to all aspects of life. The\nRenaissance in the Italian city-States followed. Then came\nthe French Revolution, advocating the ideals of liberty,\nequality, and fraternity. The industrial revolution started\nin Britain. America ushered in the computer, information\nand communication revolutions and the age of space\nexploration and atomic energy. I would also refer here to\nthe profound philosophies and great civilizations that\nflourished in China, India, Japan and elsewhere.\nThis is a necessary statement of fact as we bid\nfarewell to this century and this millennium. Everyone\nmust be aware that we are all partners in the creation of\nthe contemporary genius. Yet the future is our real\nconcern. The future brings with it new challenges in the\nfields of science and information; economic and monetary\nmatters; culture, politics and security; and the conduct of\nrelations between peoples and societies. These are some\nof the challenges of the coming century. To this list must\nbe added the legacy of the unresolved problems of the\ntwentieth century.\nThe end of a century or a millennium does not mean\nthe end or solution of existing problems. Indeed, it is a\nhistorical juncture and will undoubtedly mark new\nchallenges. Problems, like progress, are characterized by\ncontinuity. This makes it necessary to agree on a new\nforward-looking agenda that anticipates the future, its\nexpectations and risks \u2014 an agenda that will prepare us\nto solve existing and persistent problems.\nHere, I hasten to add that new breaths of fresh air\nhave begun to blow in various parts of the world. They,\ntoo, will accompany us into the coming century. Africa\ncontinues to suffer from armed and ethnic conflicts and\nthe disruption of development efforts. Yet a serious\nAfrican policy is being developed to put an end to these\nconflicts and to achieve settlements on the basis of\ndialogue, national reconciliation and conciliation between\nneighbours. We also note that the African Summit held\nlast June in Algiers decided that the countries whose\n19\n\n\nGovernments had taken power by unconstitutional means\nmust restore constitutional legitimacy before the convening\nof the next African Summit in the year 2000. The Fourth\nExtraordinary Summit of the Organization of African Unity,\nheld in Syrte earlier this month, reaffirmed the continent's\nresolve to proceed on the path of unity through the speedy\nimplementation of a treaty establishing the African\nEconomic Community.\nOn the Asian continent, the situation in the Korean\npeninsula and the question of Kashmir are still sources of\ntension and confrontation. Afghanistan remains a source of\ninstability and tension and a haven for terrorism. Yet the\nAsian economies are showing signs of recovery and are\npreparing to compensate for the sacrifices that were made\nand the development efforts that were lost as a result of the\nfinancial crisis of 1997.\nAs for East Timor, the popular consultation held last\nAugust reflected, in the words of the Secretary General, the\nwill of the people of East Timor for self-determination\nwithout representing victory or defeat for any of the parties.\nThis process could not have been successful without the\nbold initiative of President Habibie. While calling for a\npeaceful and orderly transition of power, Egypt pays tribute\nto the wise decision of the Indonesian Government to\naccept the deployment of an international force in the\nterritory. This is a responsible and wise course of action\nthat will restore calm and order there.\nEurope was the origin and theatre of the two World\nWars that were bitterly experienced by humanity in its long\nhistory. There, the hateful practices of ethnic cleansing are\nagain looming on the horizon. Yet, we have seen the\ninternational community take a clear and firm stand against\nsuch practices and against attacks on the identity of peoples\nand nations. We have also witnessed some progress in the\nconstitutional dialogue that aims at resolving the question\nof Northern Ireland, the oldest contemporary crisis on the\nEuropean continent.\nIn the Middle East, the peace process is now heading\ntowards a new and positive stage. It is our hope that this\nwill lead to a comprehensive, just, and peaceful settlement\nthat will establish the Palestinian State, put an end to the\noccupation of the Syrian and Lebanese territories and\nensure security for all. Thus, an end will be put to this\nconflict and its files will hopefully be closed.\nDespite its centrality, the Arab-Israeli conflict is not\nthe only problem in that vast region. Other problems\ninclude that of Western Sahara in northern Africa, the\nislands of the United Arab Emirates in the Gulf and the\nquestion of Sudan. The latter is high on the list of\npriorities of Egyptian diplomacy. For two years now, we\nhave been making intensive efforts and establishing\ncontacts with both the Sudanese Government and the\nopposition in order to achieve comprehensive national\nreconciliation and to preserve the unity, identity and\nterritorial integrity of that brotherly country. We have\nbeen coordinating with Libya, the members of\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and\nthe forum of the partners of IGAD to ensure that all the\nefforts undertaken in this regard are made in a concerted\nmanner.\nThe situation of Iraq raises numerous questions. The\nmatter does not have a bearing on the Government of Iraq\nalone. Rather, it pertains to the Iraqi people, their plight\nand the suffering of their children. An objective and\npositive review of the status of this important brotherly\ncountry has become necessary. This review should\nproceed from the premise that there are no eternal\nsanctions and that people have the right to resume normal\nlife and to surpass the errors of the past and move to the\nbright horizons of the future. In so doing, they must fully\nabide by the accepted rules of international legality like\nall other people.\nIndeed, Iraqi policy was erroneous in its invasion of\nKuwait. A mistake, however, cannot be corrected by a\npolicy which will lead to the collapse of an entire society\nor cause a whole country to implode. Therefore, Egypt is\nclosely following the current efforts aimed at the\nsuspension by the Security Council of the sanctions\nwithin the context of an understanding with the Iraqi\nGovernment and under the Council's supervision. This\nshould be the first step towards the lifting of the sanctions\nin accordance with paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991),\nall of whose paragraphs ought to be implemented in full.\nI stated earlier that despite the high hopes and great\nexpectations pinned on the new century, this historical\njuncture does not in and of itself bring the existing\nproblems to an end. I am duty-bound to put before you\nEgypt's belief that certain major questions must be given\ntop priority on the world agenda. These are: international\npeace and security, the question of the elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear\nweapons, eradication of poverty, integration of the\ndeveloping countries into the world economy on an\nequitable basis, dialogue between and complementarity of\ncivilizations, and the question of terrorism. These\nquestions transcend time and space in our contemporary\n20\n\n\nworld. Their agreed solutions must be the result of our\ncollective thinking and collective action.\nIf democracy has become a necessary pillar in the\nformation of the political framework of the societies of the\nfuture, it must equally constitute the framework of\ninternational relations. Thus, it is necessary that the future\nworld order be based on consensus, on the convergence of\ninterests, on the acceptance of the right of others to make\ninitiatives, and on appreciation for the premises from which\nthey proceed. All this must be debated in a democratic\nspirit here in the General Assembly, within its new and\nevolving role.\nWhat is indeed necessary is for us to arrive at a\nconsensus on the regulation of international life. This\ndesired consensus must respect the values, norms and\nprinciples that are deeply rooted in humanity's conscience.\nThis consensus must achieve the necessary harmony\nbetween individual freedoms, on the one hand, and the\ncollective rights to security, stability and development, on\nthe other hand. It must foster a creative dialogue and a\npositive interaction between policies, cultures and\ncivilizations, as it must refute the theory of \u201cThe Clash of\nCivilizations\u201d and minimize the possibility of the clash of\ninterests.\nWe believe that the world, particularly at this\npromising stage, can ill afford a new conflict or a new cold\nwar. Those who propagate the theory that Islam could\nbecome the main threat to the West following the collapse\nof Communism ignore the fact that Islam is a philosophy\nand a way of life. It is not an artificial concoction that\ncarries within it the seeds of its demise, as Communism\ndid. They wilfully disregard history's greatest lesson:\ninteraction among diverse cultures enriches all cultures,\nelevates all civilizations and adds to their vitality and\nprosperity.\nIt is only logical for most societies in our world today\nnot to accept the imposition of a single view on world\nproblems. It is also logical for them to reject the view that\nthe interests of a sole society should be given precedence\nover all others or that the considerations, capabilities and\ninterests of a certain civilization should be forced on all\nother world civilizations. Therefore, Egypt supports the\nresolution adopted by the General Assembly last year, at\nIran's initiative, proclaiming the year 2001 the United\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. Egypt also\nwelcomes the Secretary-General's appointment of a special\nrepresentative for this important subject.\nAddressing the question of dialogue among\ncivilizations is not separate from addressing the question\nof terrorism. Some thinkers have attempted to brand a\ncertain civilization and culture with that affront.\nThe phenomenon of international terrorism is not\nlinked to any particular civilization, culture or religion. It\nrecognizes no boundaries and threatens all societies\nequally. It has become a grave danger that we must\nurgently combat and eradicate. We have seen acts of\nterrorism in all parts of the world with diverse cultures\nand civilizations, but the challenge is one and the same.\nThe United Nations and many States have gone quite\nfar in facing this phenomenon. However, the few\nscattered and isolated international conventions and\nresolutions that deal with it need an integrated framework\nto turn them into a binding legal code. This code should\nreflect the concerted efforts of the international\ncommunity to combat and contain terrorism and to\ndeprive it of any haven or financing.\nIn this regard, Egypt renews the call of President\nHosni Mubarak to convene an international summit under\nUnited Nations auspices. The summit, whose objective\nframework and timing must be agreed upon by consensus,\nwould be mandated to codify the collective and organized\nwill of the international community in dealing with\nterrorism and in providing the necessary action to combat\nand deter it.\nI would like to move to other, equally important,\nissues, among which are disarmament and the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In doing\nso, I must recall the need to observe the priorities\nestablished by the international community in 1978.\nForemost among these priorities are nuclear disarmament\nand the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction.\nIn this regard, there is a clear need to accelerate the\nprocess of nuclear disarmament at the unilateral and\nbilateral levels as well as within the Conference on\nDisarmament. There is also a need to speedily achieve the\nuniversality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT).\nThese considerations impelled the States of the\nAlliance of the New Agenda: South Africa, Brazil,\nMexico, Ireland, Sweden, New Zealand and my country,\nEgypt, to adopt a joint declaration in June 1998. The\nAlliance tabled a resolution, which was adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly last year by a large majority, calling\nfor the adoption of serious and concrete steps in this\n21\n\n\nregard. The members of the Alliance will continue their\nefforts during this session.\nOn the regional level, I have repeatedly stated that the\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction, which is the\noptimum way to ensure the security of the Middle East\nregion as a whole, can be achieved only within a\ncomprehensive framework applicable to all without\nexception. Peace cannot endure with an imbalance of power\nor a discrepancy in rights and obligations in matters\npertaining to national security.\nIn this regard, all the States of the Middle East, with\nthe sole exception of Israel, have acceded to the NPT and\nthe international regime for the inspection of nuclear\nfacilities. This constitutes a source of constant tension. It\nnegates to a large extent the effectiveness of the\ninternational instruments on non-proliferation and arms\ncontrol. It will lead to an arms race. It is illogical to give\na special privilege or a certain exception to only one State\nin as vast and sensitive a region as the Middle East, and\nunder unacceptable pretexts.\nSound logic necessitates an end to this exception and\ncalls firmly for Israel's accession to the NPT. This subject\nwill force itself on the 2000 NPT Review Conference. The\nStates parties to the Treaty agreed in 1995 on an integrated\nand comprehensive package to enhance the non-\nproliferation regime and achieve its universality. The\nextension of the Treaty was but one of the elements of that\npackage. I would like to stress here the importance of\ngiving top priority at the next Review Conference to\ncrystallizing the serious steps for achieving the universality\nof the Treaty. The States parties to the Treaty must honour\nall the obligations and commitments made in 1995 without\nselectivity or discrimination. Egypt and many other States\ninsist on that. Otherwise, we will reach a state, which has\nactually begun, of suspicion and lack of confidence.\nThis will have a grave effect on the credibility of the\nNPT regime. It will weaken that regime considerably,\nmaking it possible to deviate from its provisions or make\nthem subject to exceptions.\nTalking of regional security in the Middle East leads\nme to address the peace process. Egypt maintains, as it\nalways has, that a comprehensive peace based on justice is\nthe only durable and stable peace. This means Israel\u2019s\nwithdrawal from all Arab territories occupied in 1967, the\nestablishment of a State of Palestine with Jerusalem as its\ncapital, restoring the legitimate human and national rights\nof the Palestinian people and the achievement of security\nfor all. The peace process must deal with all the problems\nin good faith and with courage. It must not postpone\ndealing with or negotiating any item or problem. The\npostponement or abandonment of problems is a\npostponement and abandonment of peace. This is\ndangerous and unacceptable and runs counter to the\nframework and spirit of peace. It might even postpone the\nestablishment of normal relations between the Arab States\nand Israel.\nWe had hoped that the Arab-Israeli conflict would\ncome to an end before the end of the twentieth century.\nThis hope is still alive, since the year 2000 is the last\nyear of this century.\nThis year we witnessed a human tragedy, the likes\nof which we thought was impossible given the progress\nthat mankind has achieved before the advent of the\ntwenty-first century. Here I refer to the tragedy of\nKosovo. While welcoming the adoption by the Security\nCouncil of a resolution on the establishment of a\nTransitional Administration in Kosovo, we stress the need\nfor learning from this tragedy so that succeeding\ngenerations will never witness its likes again.\nAllow me to address one aspect of this\nproblem which pertains to our present discussion \u2014 the\ndegree to which the rules of international legality, as\nrepresented by the United Nations, were observed in a\nsituation that pertains to the maintenance of international\npeace and security. Here we find that the question of\nKosovo was a unique case of international consensus and\ndisagreement at one and the same time. There was a\nconsensus on the need for immediate action to stop the\ngrave crime of ethnic cleansing. At the same time there\nwas disagreement on who had the right to act. There were\ndifferent approaches, among which is the one we believe\nin \u2014 namely, that any international action must stem\nfrom the Security Council as the competent organ\nprimarily responsible for the maintenance of international\npeace and security. If the Council were unable to do so,\nthen the General Assembly would be the organ that must\ndeal with any threats to international peace and security,\nas it represents the common interest of all its members.\nOur insistence, and that of many others on the\nessential role of the United Nations, has been reflected in\nthe following significant message; that regardless of how\nthe international order is described, as old or new,\ninternational participation in it must take place through\nthe United Nations, particularly when the matter concerns\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\n22\n\n\nIn this context, I would like to refer to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report on the work of the Organization and to his\nstatement made last Monday, in which he reaffirmed the\nimportance of strengthening the collective security system\nin a manner that would enable the international community\nto deal with crises before they spin out of control, and the\nprimary role of the Security Council in this regard. The\nSecretary-General has put forward a number of innovative\nconcepts to develop a \u201cculture of prevention\u201d of crises,\namong which is the concept of preventive diplomacy. Thus\nfar, no agreement has been reached on the scope of the\napplication of this concept since it was first dealt with in\n1992 in \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d. They also include the\nconcept of the preventive deployment of forces, which will\nraise numerous questions in view of its connection to the\nsovereignty of States. Also included is the call for\nhumanitarian intervention and its scope, a suggested role for\ntransnational corporations and the concept of the assessment\nof the security impact of development policies, which could\nopen the door for new conditionalities if these ideas are not\ndeveloped democratically, objectively and non-selectively.\nThese ideas and suggestions deal with concepts that are not\nyet established. This makes it necessary to debate them in\nan international format characterized by the highest degree\nof openness and transparency. Their formulation and terms\nshould be agreed upon by all. We propose officially \u2013 and\nwe call upon the President of the General Assembly and the\nSecretary-General to take the necessary actions in this\nregard \u2013 to have the General Assembly, or a committee of\nthe whole within it, debate these ideas and give them\nsubstance. They must be adopted by a consensus of all\nStates, and the Secretary-General would be asked to present\na report on the results of this debate to the General\nAssembly at its next session, in the light of which the\nAssembly would take a decision on his suggestions.\nThe World Summit for Social Development held in\nCopenhagen made the eradication of poverty a top priority\nfor international action, because it pertains to the stability\nof the international order and its credibility. Yet the\nincreasing marginalization of the developing countries,\nparticularly that of the least developed countries, most of\nwhich are in Africa, threatens to create new lines of\nconfrontation between the North and the South. This\nconfrontation would be fuelled by unjust economic, social\nand development considerations and standards, and it could\nnegatively affect international stability.\nEgypt, the current Chair of the Group of 15, presented\na paper to the eighty-seventh session of the International\nLabour Organization reflecting the views of the Group\nregarding the negative effects of globalization, the crisis of\ninternational markets and the concomitant increase in\nunemployment. All these matters must be taken into\naccount in the implementation of the Copenhagen\nProgramme of Action and the programmes of action of\nother major conferences.\nWe also note that some developed countries have\nadopted protectionist measures under the pretext of\nprotection of the environment, respect for human rights\nand labour standards. These policies deepen the\nimbalances in the international trading system. Here I\nmust reaffirm the need for the developed countries to\nhonour all their obligations under the Uruguay Round and\nthe full implementation of the agreements and resolutions\nof that Round before engaging in any new negotiations to\nfurther liberalize international trade.\nI further reaffirm the importance of strengthening the\nrole of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) at its tenth session, to be held\nin Bangkok, to achieve a balance between the interests of\nthe developed and the developing countries. Here I must\nrefer to the role of the international financial institutions.\nThis question needs a conscientious review in the light of\nthe current changes in the international economic arena.\nThe review should make these institutions more\nresponsive to the needs of comprehensive development.\nIt should ensure the full participation of the developing\ncountries in the making of decisions on the reform of the\ninternational financial system.\nIn conclusion, we look forward to the new century\nwith hope; yet the questions surrounding it abound,\nforemost of which is that two thirds of the people of the\nworld live in a state of underdevelopment and suffering.\nHow could we face the challenges of the wars that\ncontinue to rage, the continued flows of refugees, war\ncrimes that continue to be perpetrated and the dire\npoverty of those who cannot have their daily bread or\nafford a school to educate their children or a hospital to\ntreat them? Any talk about globalization must take all that\ninto account.\nThese were the challenges of the past. They are also\nthe challenges of the present, and will be the challenges\nof the future. We will be able to face them only with a\nstronger will and a stronger commitment, with a more\nobjective way of thinking and more effective mechanisms\nfor action. In this way we will arrive at a new social\ncontract, usher in a new economic era and forge a new\nsecurity consensus for the world of tomorrow.\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of President\nAhmad Tejan Kabbah, the Government and people of\nSierra Leone, and on my own personal behalf, I would\nlike to congratulate Mr. Gurirab most heartily on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-fourth session. This is the last session before the end\nof this century and today we have only 92 days until the\nbeginning of a new millennium.\nWe welcome Mr. Gurirab\u2019s unanimous election to\npreside over this body. With his long experience, both in\nthe public service of his country and in the international\narena, I have no doubt that he will be able to steer the\ndeliberations of the fifty-fourth session to a successful\nconclusion. I want to assure him of my delegation\u2019s full\nsupport and cooperation during his tenure of office.\nThe affairs that confront us as a country continue to\ncause problems all over the globe. We are faced with\nsituations that we cannot completely handle. Permit me to\nconvey the thanks and appreciation of my Government to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to his staff\nfor their dedicated service to the United Nations in the\nnever-ending quest to attain international peace and\nsecurity. Mr. Annan has spared no efforts in drawing the\nattention of the international community, as well as that\nof the Security Council, to the tragic situation in Sierra\nLeone, stressing the urgent need for resources to sustain\nthe Lom\u00e9 Peace Agreement, recently signed between the\nGovernment of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary\nUnited Front (RUF), and the need to send an appreciable\ncontingent of peacekeepers and United Nations military\nobservers to my country.\nThe rebel war has gone on for a long time. Its\nintensification culminated in the invasion of the capital,\nFreetown, by the RUF/Armed Forces Revolutionary\nCouncil junta on 6 January 1999. I have no doubt that\nmany members must have watched, heard or read of the\nensuing mayhem, even though those ghastly events were\noverlooked because of the focus of the international\nmedia and, indeed, of the international community on\n37\n\n\nKosovo. There was a time when we felt that the\ninternational community had abandoned us to our fate.\nOur people have gone through a very difficult and\ndevastating period, covering more than eight years. We are\nnow ready to put that nightmare behind us, to move\nforward and to do so quickly. The most important element\nin this is the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration\nprogramme, under the supervision of United Nations\npeacekeepers and observers and the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG).\nMy Government therefore welcomes the eighth report\nof the Secretary-General on Sierra Leone to the Security\nCouncil. Among other things, the report recommends the\ndeployment of sufficient numbers of peacekeepers and\nobservers, as well as support staff. The Secretary-General\nstresses the urgent need for the mobilization of adequate\nresources into a special trust fund for this purpose. My\ndelegation welcomes with gratitude the contributions of the\nGovernments of the United Kingdom and Canada and the\nWorld Bank to the trust fund, and the recent\nrecommendation of the Secretary- General to the Security\nCouncil to deploy up to 6,000 peacekeepers and observers.\nThe need for an early decision on this cannot be\noveremphasized.\nA special conference is to take place shortly in\nWashington, D.C., for pledges to the fund and for other\npost-conflict programmes, including humanitarian\nassistance, the welfare of refugees and the welfare of\nchildren associated with the war. I would like to thank all\nour friends in the donor community who will be\nparticipating in that meeting and to plead with them to\ndonate generously.\nSince the signing of the Lom\u00e9 Agreement, the peace\nhas been generally holding. There have been a few severe\nhiccups, but because of the determination of all to move\nforward, we have been able to contain the situation. The\nwar went on for a long time; the rebels were used to\nobtaining everything they needed by the use of force. Since\nthe Agreement, they have simply been waiting for the\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme\nto commence. The delay in implementing this could be a\nfactor in the restlessness observed in some elements from\ntime to time. It is a dangerous void.\nThe programme itself is under the chairmanship of our\nPresident, and because of the importance that our people\nattach to it, the civilian population has established a fund\nthat is receiving modest donations from an already\ntraumatized and war-weary people. Unfortunately, the\nanxiety and enthusiasm of our people have yet to be\nmatched by those of the international community.\nThe speed and the extent of interventions in Bosnia\nand in Kosovo, and more recently in East Timor, clearly\ndemonstrate the capacity of the international community\nto stop human suffering when it is willing to do so. Our\npeople have been baffled at the delay in implementing the\nSierra Leone programme.\nAlthough the heinous atrocities committed in Sierra\nLeone by the RUF and its collaborators barely received\nattention from the international community, various\nhuman rights groups denounced the United Nations for\nsigning the Lom\u00e9 Peace Agreement with a reservation on\namnesty provision. May I at this stage appeal to the\ninternational community not to do anything that would\nadversely affect the implementation of the Peace\nAgreement.\nFor the average Sierra Leonean, the Peace\nAgreement was a bitter pill to swallow, but an essential\npill to end the atrocities in the country. However, in order\nto ensure accountability, a truth and reconciliation\ncommission was provided for in the agreement. It may\nneed to be backed by an international inquiry body, such\nas has been proposed by the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\nOnce again I would like to put on record my\ncountry\u2019s indebtedness and gratitude to the member States\nof the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), and four countries in particular \u2014 Nigeria,\nGuinea, Ghana and Mali \u2014 which contributed troops to\nthe ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG).\nAs a new millennium dawns, the problems facing\nmy country \u2014 and indeed many developing countries \u2014\nare multiple; not least is the problem of finding a\nconsistent set of policies and institutions that will enable\nus to have sustainable economic growth. Coupled with\nthis is the fact that newly elected democratic\nGovernments like ours are facing the paradox of how to\nsustain democracy in an environment where hard\neconomic decisions are needed. In an increasingly\nshrinking world, the problems of developing countries,\nincluding those of Sierra Leone, ought to be seen as\nglobal problems.\n38\n\n\nThe impact of these problems is felt by all in the form\nof environmental devastation, global warming, economic\nmigrations and conflict, both local and regional. These\nproblems affect the developed world in the form of\nincreased immigration, greater welfare bills, slower\neconomic growth and increased defence budgets, due to\ngreater instability in the third world and the increased need\nfor conflict resolution and prevention.\nIn these circumstances, the continuing decline in the\nlevels of development assistance has not helped the African\nsituation. Globalization cannot be effected as a \u201cone-way\nstreet\u201d where all the vehicles travel North, leaving only\nexhaust fumes in the South. A level playing field is\nrequired, and this cannot be achieved with Africa\u2019s heavy\ndebt burden. Sierra Leone welcomes the 1999 Cologne\nDebt Initiative, which enhances the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt Initiative framework for debt relief. We\nagree that further efforts are needed for greater focus on the\npriority objective of poverty reduction. At the same time,\nmy delegation hopes that agreement will soon be reached\nto shorten the period during which countries can qualify to\nbe part of the HIPC Debt Initiative framework.\nWith the cold war over, mankind had looked forward\nto a period of peace and universal development. But, as the\nBritish Foreign Secretary Robin Cook observed at the\nrecent Security Council meeting on trafficking in small\narms, small arms have caused more death and destruction\nin recent times than weapons of mass destruction. Indeed,\nmy delegation agrees with the general view that the illegal\narms trade is as dangerous as drugs, both serving as\ninstruments of destruction of civilian lives and of socio-\neconomic structures.\nThe proliferation of trade in light weapons, financed\nby cash from the sale of precious minerals, such as\ndiamonds and gold, is at the core of Africa\u2019s conflicts and\ntheir prolongation. My delegation therefore welcomes the\nrecent decision of the Security Council on this nefarious\ntrade. We call on the international community to support\nthe Security Council decision so as to effectively prevent\nthe availability and flow of arms to conflict areas. The\ndecision should not be left to the merchants of death, whose\nonly interest is money, by whatever means.\nThe United Nations, despite its occasional\nimperfectability, remains an essential institution for moving\ninternational relations towards cooperative security. Its\noperational and procedural capabilities need to be\nstrengthened for the next century. My Government fully\nsupports the Declaration of Algiers, adopted by the\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the\nOrganization of African Unity, meeting in Algeria from\n12-14 July 1999. The Declaration called, inter alia, for\nthe democratization of international relations, the\ndemocratization of the United Nations and the Security\nCouncil and the recognition of Africa\u2019s legitimate position\nin this Organization.\nMy Government also reinforces its belief in the\nHarare Declaration, calling for the unconditional\nallocation of two permanent Security Council seats to\nAfrica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We hope that,\nas a result of his great experience, our work during this\nsession will be successful.\nAt the threshold of the third millennium a most\npressing issue is facing humanity: the establishment of the\nnew world order, which will affect the nature of the\nworld in the future. The issue concerns all members of\nthe international community, regardless of their place or\nthe role they play in international relations.\nThe continuing threat of the proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction; problems involving the protection of\nthe environment; technological and natural disasters;\nunresolved conflicts, terrorism and all forms of\nextremism, illegal trafficking in narcotics; the arms\ntrade \u2014 these are serious sources of tension throughout\nthe world. Recent events related to the settlement of the\nproblem of Kosovo are another reminder of the huge\nprice that continues to be paid in human suffering.\nKyrgyzstan is striving to make a positive\ncontribution to the achievement of the global goal of\nestablishing a new world order founded on security,\nstability and prosperity. We wish to demonstrate to the\ninternational community our commitment to such\nuniversal principles as democracy, respect for human\nrights, support for market economies, the pursuit of good-\nneighbourly relations, stability and security \u2014 not only in\nour region but throughout the world.\nThe years since our independence have convinced us\nthat for Kyrgyzstan there is no more rational foreign\npolicy than a balanced, multipolar approach focusing on\nthe development of friendly, consistent relations both with\nStates that play an important role in regional and world\naffairs and with those in which our country shares\npragmatic interests.\n29\n\n\nAmong the major international events for the Kyrgyz\nRepublic in recent years I wish to mention the admission of\nour country into the World Trade Organization; the\nadoption, at the fifty-third session of the General Assembly,\nof a resolution \u2014 resolution 53/24 \u2014 proclaiming the year\n2002 as the International Year of Mountains; and the\nelaboration by Askar Akayev, President of the Kyrgyz\nRepublic, of the Silk Road diplomacy doctrine.\nPresident Akayev's Silk Road foreign policy is based\non the ideas of global interdependence and of reviving the\nSilk Road as a bridge joining countries and civilizations so\nas to develop in the third millennium an intensive,\nmultilevel, multifaceted system of communication between\ncivilizations. It is no accident that the philosophy behind\nthe Silk Road diplomacy doctrine carries over to the\nRepublic's other foreign policy initiatives of recent years.\nThese include the holding in Kyrgyzstan, under the auspices\nof the United Nations, of an international conference on\nAfghanistan; the proclamation of the year 2002 as the\nInternational Year of Mountains; and the active\nparticipation of Kyrgyzstan in the establishment of a\nCentral Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nIn particular, enshrined in the doctrine is the idea that,\ngiven the current situation, reliable and dynamic political\nand commercial relations cannot be established without the\nstrengthening of multilateral relations of mutual cooperation\nand trust between all the States of the region. The Silk\nRoad policy requires Kyrgyzstan to establish and develop\nas fully as possible such relations with the countries of\nCentral Asia in all sectors and cooperative areas, including\nthe maintenance of regional and global security.\nThe mutual cooperation of China, Kazakhstan,\nKyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan within the framework of\nwhat is called the Shanghai Five is one of the most positive\nfactors for the maintenance of security in Central Asia, and\nfor Central Asia's development, and for its transformation\ninto a region of peace, good-neighbourly relations and\nprosperity. Since the first meeting of the heads of State of\nthe Shanghai Five and the signing of the agreement on\nconfidence-building in connection with military activities in\nthe border areas, the countries involved have, through\nfriendly consultations, been able to generally settle border\nissues and reduce the armed forces present in the border\nareas. We have established and strengthened cooperation\nand with it increased security, peace and calm along the\nborders.\nFrom 24 to 25 August 1999, in Bishkek, the fourth\nsummit of the heads of State of the Shanghai Five took\nplace. As participants pointed out, we are now seeing a\ntransformation among the Shanghai Five. Whereas in the\npast the group focused on military and political\ncooperation, now it is defining major directions for trade\nand economic cooperation. The role of the Bishkek\nsummit in this context was to transform these\nunderstandings into practical actions.\nIt is necessary specifically to point out the unique\nformat of the five in the context of which countries of\nvarying size, with different state systems, levels of\neconomic development and military strength are\ncooperating. A concrete demonstration of this was the\nsigning in Bishkek of an additional border agreement\nbetween China and Kyrgyzstan, which effectively\nremoved from the agenda the question of inter-State\ndemarcation and established a real basis for the\ntransformation of the Kyrgyzstan-China border into a\nborder of peace and mutual cooperation in the twenty-first\ncentury.\nKyrgyzstan continues to participate actively in the\nprocess of creating a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central\nAsia. An important role in the successful implementation\nof this initiative is being played by the consultative\nmeeting of experts of regional countries, held under\nUnited Nations auspices. We feel that the rapid\nconversion of Central Asia into a nuclear-weapon-free\nzone is becoming a multidimensional issue, since the\nachievement of this goal will favour profound positive\nprogress on the global, regional and subregional levels, as\nwell as in the area of bilateral relations between the\ncountries of our region. It will also be in harmony with\nthe world community's aspirations to establish a safe\nnuclear-free future.\nAs is well known, dramatic events have recently\ntaken place in southern Kyrgyzstan in connection with the\nincursion into Kyrgyz territory of well-armed bandit\ngroups of international terrorists with many years of\nexperience fighting in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. As a\nresult of the illegal actions of these terrorists, who are\nmembers of the implacable radical wing of Islamic\nextremism, a tense situation has emerged in the Batken\nand Chon-Alai areas of Osh Province. International\nterrorists have behaved barbarically, taking foreign\nhostages and murdering peaceful citizens. The bandits and\nthe forces behind them have made brazen, arrogant and\nfar-reaching attempts to impose their extremist views on\nthe country and have decisively and irrevocably chosen\nthe path of attacking peaceful democratic States and\neconomic and social reforms. They have threatened the\n30\n\n\nsecurity and destroyed the tranquility of each and every\nState of Central Asia.\nWe are deeply concerned at having to confront such\nphenomena as the internationalization of Islamic extremism.\nAmong the terrorists invading our country, we have\nobserved not only representatives of States of Central Asia,\nbut also foreign mercenaries. Events in southern Kyrgyzstan\nand in Dagestan, Russia, are links in the same chain, forged\nby international Islamic extremists seeking their own\ncriminal objectives. These international bandits seek refuge\nbehind the noble values of Islam, which they roughly flout,\nsowing death and suffering among peaceful populations.\nI wish to stress in particular the staunch and\ncommitted support of our friendly neighbours \u2014 including\nKazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Russia \u2014 for\nKyrgyzstan's efforts to eradicate these bandit groups. The\nStates of the region have shown the international\ncommunity their firm desire to work together and to\ncoordinate their efforts in confronting international\nterrorism.\nIn turn, Kyrgyzstan expresses its deep-seated hope for\nreciprocal support from the world community in its struggle\nagainst international terrorism, which is a worldwide threat.\nIn this context, Kyrgyzstan highly commends the support\nand solidarity of the States members of the Conference on\nInteraction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia,\nmeeting at the level of Foreign Ministers in Almaty on 14\nSeptember. The Conference adopted a joint declaration on\nthe situation in Kyrgyzstan in which it condemned the\ncriminal activities of terrorists and expressed solidarity and\nsupport for my Government's fight against terrorism.\nThe criminal acts of international terrorists in southern\nKyrgyzstan have reinforced the need for a speedy\nsettlement of the armed conflict in Afghanistan. It is\nbecoming ever more apparent that the designs of the\nIslamic extremists based in Afghanistan and of the forces\nbehind them are spreading their destabilizing influence\nthroughout Central Asia through terror, murder, hostage-\ntaking and drug and weapons trafficking. In this connection,\nI wish particularly to point out that the ongoing illegal\ntransshipment of narcotics from Afghanistan across the\nterritories of the Central Asian countries is a primary source\nof financing for the criminal activities of the Islamic\nextremists. We feel that the world community must take the\nmost decisive measures to prevent these Islamic extremists\nfrom sowing violence, chaos and triumphal obscurantism in\nCentral Asia.\nKyrgyzstan intends broadly to support the efforts of\nthe international community in the context of the \u201csix\nplus two\u201d group. In turn, striving to make our own\ncontribution to the early settlement of the internal\nAfghanistan conflict, which has become a breeding\nground for Islamic extremism in the region, our country\nis ready to provide facilities for the convening, under\nUnited Nations auspices, of a conference on peace in\nAfghanistan.\nHighly appreciating the importance to the\ninternational community of the United Nations as a\nuniversal Organization, Kyrgyzstan is profoundly\ninterested in the successful reform of its work. We\nsupport comprehensive reform, which should encompass\nall the organs of the United Nations, including the\nSecurity Council, which must vigorously address all\naspects of human development. The Kyrgyz Republic\nconfirms its view of the need to expand Security Council\nmembership and is also in favour of equitable\ngeographical representation in both categories.\nThere is no doubt that the process of reforming the\nUnited Nations should reflect upon the work of all its\nagencies. In our country today, we are seeing the\nsuccessful work of such United Nations specialized\nagencies as the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund, the United\nNations Population Fund, the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and others. We feel that\neffectiveness and results are the main criteria in assessing\ntheir work. It is necessary to give heightened attention to\nthe work of those agencies from which we can obtain\nmaximum output. In this connection, there needs to be\nmore active efforts to enhance the quality of work to\nimplement concrete measures designed to resolve socio-\neconomic, cultural, humanitarian and legal issues.\nIn this respect, I wish to highlight the important role\nplayed by UNDP, as the Organization's basic financing\nand coordination agency, to strengthen United Nations\ndevelopment efforts in such countries as Kyrgyzstan. In\n1998, Kyrgyzstan became a pilot country in UNDP's new\nresult-based approach. The results of the work of this\nsystem, which have been mainstreamed in all UNDP\noffices and headquarters, are being planned for use in a\nmulti-year funding framework. We hope that this system\nwill become an effective means of attracting additional\nfunding. In this connection, we cannot fail to be\nconcerned by the reduction in and unpredictability of\nUNDP core resources. We wish to appeal from this\nrostrum to the Governments of donor countries to\n31\n\n\nundertake to study closely the possibility of increasing,\nthrough UNDP, their assistance to States with economies in\ntransition.\nIn this difficult period for countries such as my own,\nassistance rendered through UNDP and other specialized\nagencies is an important factor in the strengthening of our\nindependence, stability and progress.\nIn conclusion, I wish to stress Kyrgyzstan's readiness\nto cooperate with all Members of the United Nations in\nachieving progress on a broad number of issues on the\nagenda of this final session of the millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure, Mr. President, to congratulate you on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-fourth session. We are confident that your efforts and\nexpertise will ensure the success of this session.\nI should also like to thank your predecessor,\nMr. Didier Opertti, for having successfully conducted the\nwork of the fifty-third session. Furthermore, I would be\nremiss if I failed to express our thanks and appreciation to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his dedication\nto the pursuit of world peace and stability and for his\ncontinuous efforts to enhance the credibility of the\nOrganization through the settlement of disputes, old and\nnew.\nThis session is unique not only because it is the last\nGeneral Assembly session of the century that witnessed the\nbirth of the United Nations, but also because it coincides\nwith the emergence of serious trends that call for by-\npassing some of the basic principles on which the United\nNations was built. They advocate the establishment of a\nnew world order, one to whose requirements the United\nNations must conform rather than being part of the wider\nand more comprehensive United Nations framework.\nA case in point is the call to acknowledge the\nprinciple of relative sovereignty or the obligation to\ninterfere where necessary in the internal affairs of States, or\nto marginalize the role of the Security Council, which is the\nmain tool for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nSome States believe that the establishment of a new\nworld order is a result of decisive, historic developments in\nvision and concept. Others, however, feel that it is no more\nthan a mere desire on the part of some to impose ideas\ncommensurate with the drastic change that has taken place\nin the balance of power on the international scene. In our\nopinion, this issue requires further deliberations and\ndiscussions.\nThrough dialogue we, the peoples and countries of the\nworld, can arrive at a unanimous understanding of the\nquestions at hand, and in this way secure the necessary\nassurance in our pursuit of the common good and security\nof humanity. History has shown that no regime or system\ncan endure and prevail unless it is built on justice and\nequality. It cannot be selective, nor can it pursue a policy\nof double standards. It cannot assert its authority over\nsome and remain indifferent to injustices done to others.\nIt cannot give generously to some and persistently deprive\nothers. Any system that seeks to maintain international\npeace and security must depend on preventive diplomacy\nto preempt problems long before their onset and\nexacerbation.\nFurthermore, it should create an effective mechanism\nfor peacemaking, one that contributes seriously to\nbuilding and safeguarding peace. It is essential that we\ntackle the root causes of problems, not merely their\nviolent manifestations.\nWe must also persevere in our pursuit of world\neconomic and social justice. We should not be content\nwith defending stability from a restrictively political\nperspective.\nIn any event, no world order, whether old or new,\ncan condone, for example, the occupation of the lands of\nothers by force. It cannot allow acts of aggression to be\ncommitted against people and property, nor should it\nsubject civilians to various forms of arbitrary practices.\nIn March 1978, Israel undertook a unilateral act of\naggression against Lebanon. It occupied one tenth of\nLebanese territory. In the face of this aggression, the\nSecurity Council adopted resolution 425 (1978) and called\nupon Israel to withdraw its forces from all Lebanese\nterritories immediately and unconditionally.\nEven though more than 21 years have passed since\nthe adoption of that resolution by the Security Council, it\nhas not been enforced. Israel continues to occupy\ncherished parts of southern Lebanon and the Western\nBekaa valley. Throughout those years, Israel has\ncontinued its almost daily acts of aggression against\nLebanon and its people.\nIn 1982, Israel's hostility peaked when its forces\ninvaded Lebanese territory, reaching the capital, Beirut,\nafter a long siege. After a partial withdrawal from\nLebanon, Israel resorted to the current scorched-earth\npolicy. Throughout the month of July 1993, Israel\nbombed dozens of Lebanese villages and towns from\nland, air and sea positions. It inflicted heavy property\ndamage, killed and wounded more than 250 civilians and\n9\n\n\nforced more than 300,000 Lebanese out of their homes and\nvillages.\nIn April 1996, continuing its policy of comprehensive\ndestruction and bombardment, Israel intentionally massacred\n102 civilians in the village of Qana, using incendiary\nbombs. Most of our fallen martyrs were women, children\nand elderly men who sadly thought they could find a safe\nhaven in the premises of the United Nations forces in\nsouthern Lebanon, but alas, Israel did not hesitate to violate\nthe sanctity of those premises.\nSoon after, an understanding was reached for a\nceasefire and for protecting civilians. This became known\nlater as the April Understanding of 1996. A group was\nestablished to monitor the implementation of that\nagreement, with the membership of Lebanon, Syria and\nIsrael and under the co-chairmanship of France and the\nUnited States of America.\nAllow me, on this occasion, to express our\nappreciation to the group for the useful and restraining role\nit has played pending the realization of the full and\nunconditional Israeli withdrawal from the Lebanese\nterritories.\nUnfortunately, this has not prevented Israel from\nrepeatedly and seriously violating the terms of the April\nUnderstanding. Israel has lately launched yet another attack\nagainst Lebanese civilians and infrastructure. On 24 and 25\nJune 1999, Israeli warplanes destroyed two power plants\nand three bridges, causing a total blackout in Lebanon.\nCommunications were jeopardized, extensive property\ndamage was incurred and many people were killed. This\nIsraeli act of aggression has had direct and indirect negative\neffects on the social and economic life of Lebanon until\nthis very moment.\nIsrael persists in its oppressive arbitrary practices\nagainst civilians in the territories that are still under its\noccupation. Civilians are kidnapped, detained, tortured or\nkilled, displaced or expelled.\nWe in Lebanon are tirelessly working with the United\nNations and other humanitarian forums to put an end to\nthese acts and to prevent their recurrence, the most recent\nof which was the imposition of siege on the village of Aita\nal-Sha b and other villages in the south. Agricultural crops\nwere destroyed and many of the residents were kidnapped,\nexpelled or detained.\nOn 14 July 1999, Lebanon celebrated Lebanese\nprisoners' day. From this rostrum, we again call for the\nredoubling of efforts and for bringing more pressure to\nbear on Israel to release all the Lebanese detainees\nlanguishing in Israeli prisons as hostages.\nIsrael's Supreme Court has acknowledged and\ncondoned holding these prisoners. Some of these people\nare incarcerated in al-Khiyam detention camp inside\nLebanese occupied territories. There are many elderly and\nsick among them who are often denied visits and the\nhumanitarian care usually provided by the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross. This is a breach of the\nFourth Geneva Convention concerning the protection of\ncivilians in time of war.\nOn this occasion, Lebanon emphasizes once again its\nright to be compensated for the loss of life and for the\nproperty damage that has been inflicted upon it for many\nyears as a result of Israel's acts of aggression and\narbitrary practices against its civilians.\nLebanon recalls the need for the unconditional\nimplementation of resolution 425 (1978). Pending the\nenforcement of that resolution, it is only natural that the\nLebanese people stand united in resisting Israeli\noccupation. It is also just and natural that they uphold the\nlegitimacy of the Lebanese resistance, which is after all\nan embodiment of the faith in one's homeland and a\nhighly evolved form of struggle for freedom. Moreover,\nthe Lebanese resistance constitutes a consecration of the\nlegitimate right of self-defense included in the terms of\nreference of the April Understanding of 1996.\nIsrael repeatedly circumvents the mandate of the\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). For\nour part, we highly value the positive and constructive\nrole that UNIFIL plays. On this occasion, we would like\nto express once again our appreciation and gratitude to\nthe Force for the noble sacrifices it has made in fulfilling\nits mandate under the most arduous circumstances.\nLebanon is certainly committed to the Middle East\npeace process. Lebanon stands ready, given the\ninseparability of the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, to\nresume the negotiations from the point where they left off\nin 1996 and in accordance with the terms of reference of\nthe 1991 Madrid Conference. Our ultimate objective is to\nreach a just, comprehensive and permanent peace in the\nMiddle East on the basis of the resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy. Lebanon reiterates here its\ncommitment to resolution 425 (1978), which does not call\n10\n\n\non the parties concerned to negotiate but does\nunequivocally call upon Israel to withdraw immediately and\nunconditionally from all Lebanese territories.\nAt a time when serious prospects have appeared on the\nhorizon for the resumption of the peace negotiations, and\ndespite what might be said about the art of negotiation, the\nrecent declarations by senior Israeli officials do not auger\nwell for the peace process. Nor do they expressly indicate\nthe presence of presumably good intentions. They do not\nleave room for us to conclude that there is a genuine desire\non the part of the Israeli side to establish peace based on\njustice. All of this prompts us to view with caution the\nconditions set out for the resumption of the peace process\nat the present stage, to say the least.\nIsrael's intransigence becomes all the more apparent in\nthe light of the statements made by its Prime Minister\nBarak. In those statements, Mr. Barak stressed several no's,\nnamely, no to a return to the 1967 borders, no to the\npartition of Jerusalem, no to dismantling the settlements,\nand no to the return of Palestinian refugees. Mr. Barak\nrepeated his position when he declared at his recent meeting\nwith President Clinton that the Palestinian refugees shall not\nreturn to their homeland and that they should stay in the\ncountries where they presently reside. The natural\nprerequisites of peace cannot be reconciled with\nMr. Barak's no's. Those prerequisites are based on justice\nand have been endorsed by international legitimacy. They\nrequire the following elements.\nIsrael should withdraw unconditionally from Lebanon,\nin accordance with the provisions of Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978).\nAll of the Golan Heights should be returned to Syria,\nto the borders of 4 June 1967, as has already been\ndiscussed and agreed upon.\nThe Palestinian people should be able to regain their\ninalienable rights. Those rights include their right to self-\ndetermination, to the establishment of their State on their\nnational soil, with Jerusalem as its capital, and their right to\nreturn to the lands in Palestine from which they were\nuprooted.\nOn this occasion Lebanon would like to draw the\nattention of the international community to the fact that it\nis impossible for a peaceful settlement to be achieved and\nfor the long-awaited peace to endure and prevail unless the\nPalestinian refugees, particularly the hundreds of thousands\nwhom Lebanon has hosted on its soil, are allowed to return\nto their homeland. From this international rostrum,\nLebanon resonates its people's unanimous and\nunequivocal rejection of settling Palestinian refugees on\nits territories. This unanimity was consecrated in the\nLebanese Constitution, which is the cornerstone of the\nnational covenant. We see it as necessary to draw\nattention to the danger of approaching this question from\na merely economic and social perspective while ignoring\nits political dimension. That political dimension is, in\nessence, the core of the injustice that befell the\nPalestinians who were displaced from their homeland.\nThis unanimous position is shared by both the Lebanese\nand the Palestinians in Lebanon.\nLebanon therefore renews its call for the\ninternational community to shoulder its responsibility in\nfull. It must come up with a just and equitable settlement\nthat addresses the issue of the final status of the\nPalestinian refugees, in accordance with the\ninternationally agreed principles that govern similar\nsituations. Those principles, it should be recalled, were\nrecently applied in Kosovo. Settling Palestinian refugees\nin Lebanon, which is equally rejected by the Palestinians\nand the Lebanese, would create, if carried out, a potential\nhotbed of tension that would jeopardize the security of the\nMiddle East region and its stability as well.\nWe view positively the opportunity for progress in\nthe peace process. The recent visit by United States\nSecretary of State Madame Madeleine Albright to some\ncountries in the region was an acknowledgment of the\nresponsibilities of her country and the influence that that\nvisit can bring to bear on the parties to the conflict. For\nour part, we are keen on the role that the United States\nand the Russian Federation can play in the pursuit of a\njust and comprehensive peace. We believe that they can\nboth provide the necessary guarantees for the successful\nimplementation of the prospective agreement.\nWe equally count on an active European role in both\nthe political process and the development of the region as\nwell. This applies to the negotiations for the settlement of\nthe conflict and to the subsequent stage. We particularly\napplaud the supportive role of France, on which we can\nalways rely.\nWe would like on this occasion to thank the\nPresidency of the European Union, currently held by\nFinland. Our thanks go in particular to Ms. Tarja\nHalonen, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland, who\nrecently visited Lebanon as part of her visit to the region.\nMs. Halonen expressed the European Union's readiness to\n\n\n\ncontribute to the search for a just, peaceful and\ncomprehensive solution to the Middle East question.\nLebanon was among the first countries to condemn the\nIraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. It supported all\nthe Security Council resolutions adopted in this regard. We\nexpress our solidarity with sisterly Kuwait on the question\nof the release of Kuwaiti detainees and prisoners of war.\nWe also support Kuwait's claim of sovereignty over all of\nits territories and resources. Releasing the Kuwaiti prisoners\ncan contribute to the improvement of inter-Arab relations.\nAt the same time, Lebanon hopes that the embargo imposed\non the brotherly people of Iraq be lifted. They, too, are\nentitled to live in dignity and to enjoy prosperity and\nsecurity.\nLebanon attaches special importance to the question of\nconsolidating the security and stability of the Arab Gulf\nregion. We applaud the efforts made by Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil to eliminate the causes of tension and to settle\nexisting disputes by peaceful means in the context of good\nfaith and good neighbourly relations. Those efforts were\nundertaken to settle, among other things, the dispute\nbetween the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic\nof Iran over three islands.\nThe United Nations is the sum total of the collective\nwill of its Member States. It has been unable to discharge\nall of its obligations in the context of the settlement of\nprotracted and new disputes. It has also been unable to\nrestore peace to many of the tension-ridden regions of the\nworld. It is appropriate to proceed with the reform\nprogramme envisaged for the international Organization, as\noutlined by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 1997. This\nwill enable the United Nations to respond to the accelerated\npace of international relations in the political, economic and\nsocial fields.\nBut despite all the risks and pitfalls, our international\nOrganization is still a unique international authority. It is\nthe proper forum in which to engage in a balanced and\nobjective discussion that will lead to at least some\nnecessary solutions. It is heartening indeed to recall that the\nOrganization has had some outstanding and promising\nachievements in several fields of human endeavour. These\ninclude achievements in the fields of human rights, the\nrights of the child and women's rights, as well as\nenvironment and development. They also include the\nprogressive development of international law and the\nenriching of the body of international law by the\nestablishment of new institutions such as the International\nCriminal Court.\nIt is pertinent to mention in this respect that Lebanon\nhas a time-honoured culture that is deeply rooted in\nhistory. Our country has been an integral part of the\ninternational scene, acting and reacting to it positively,\nsince it joined the Organization as a founding Member.\nBecause of its openness and intellectual wealth, it has\nalways taken the lead in responding to the requirements\nof progress at various levels.\nLebanon is seeking to join the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO). It has been working steadily to\ndevelop its economy and rationalize its financial policies.\nBy so doing, it will be able to bring these policies in line\nwith the standards and regulations drawn up by WTO.\nThis will ultimately pave the way for a world economic\npartnership in trade and development on the basis of\nmutual benefit and equality among States.\nLebanon attaches great importance to environmental\nissues and has created a ministry for this specific purpose.\nLebanon joins in the international efforts currently under\nway to resolve these problems. It calls upon powerful\nStates to honour the commitments they entered into under\nthe international conventions concluded for this purpose.\nLebanon also believes that the phenomenon of\nglobalization has become a reality that is imbued with\nboth positive and negative elements, which in turn\ninfluence the cultures and economies of Member States.\nIn our opinion, the United Nations is the proper forum to\naddress and check the repercussions of this phenomenon.\nIt is in fact the mature offspring of the 1940s version of\nglobalization.\nLebanon has always been firm in its commitment to\nthe principles of democracy and freedom and faithful to\nits obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. It\nhas always honoured the decisions and resolutions of the\ninternational Organization and its various bodies and\nconferences. We have built in our capital, Beirut, a\nbeautiful headquarters building for its subsidiary bodies.\nWe believe in its mission and are committed to its\npurposes.\nLebanon is currently devoting every effort to\ncomplete the process of reconstruction and to consolidate\nand rationalize its institutions. We are steadily working on\nestablishing the rule of law. Our unique experience with\ncoexistence, built on moderation, tolerance and unity in a\nsound national environment, is an example to be\nfollowed. Lebanon is determined to regain the\ndistinguished position it once held in the region and the\n12\n\n\nworld. It will remain true to its Arab identity, with all the\nconsequences and dimensions that this entails.\nLebanon is a small country on the east coast of the\nMediterranean. For 5,000 years, it has hosted successive\ncivilizations. Lebanon influenced these civilizations and was\ninfluenced by them. We shall take the lead in giving, once\nwe have recovered our national soil thanks to the struggle\nof our sons and with the effective support of the\ninternational community.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "May I begin by adding my\ncongratulations to those of my colleagues on your election,\nSir, as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-fourth session. You are no stranger to these halls \u2014\nyou were here first as an observer and later as a\nrepresentative. You bring a wealth of experience to your\nposition, and we are pleased to see Namibia taking\nleadership roles in both the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council.\nBefore I move to the main substance of my remarks\ntoday, I want to take this opportunity to mention two\nmatters.\nFirst, I welcome the three new members of the\nUnited Nations: Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga. Having\nworked closely with these three countries in our own\nAsia-Pacific community, it is a particular pleasure for me,\nas the Foreign Minister of Australia, now to have the\nopportunity to take that cooperation into this larger family\nof nations.\nThe second matter is one that seized the attention of\nthe entire Australian population earlier this year: the fate\nof two CARE Australia workers, Steve Pratt and Peter\nWallace, who were imprisoned by the Federal Republic\nof Yugoslavia. Thanks in no small measure to the support\nof the international community, Steve and Peter were\nreleased from prison on 1 September. The efforts of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, the High Commissioner\nfor Refugees, Mrs. Ogata and the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, Mrs. Robinson, and the continued support\nof the United Nations Office for the Coordination of\nHumanitarian Affairs, were invaluable in gaining the\nmen\u2019s release.\nI would also like to thank President Ahtisaari of\nFinland, the Greek Government, Nelson Mandela, Pope\nJohn Paul and the many other individuals who generously\nlent their support to this cause. The international\ncommunity\u2019s cooperation in this case demonstrates the\nstrong commitment we share to protecting our\nhumanitarian workers from persecution, and to ensuring\ntheir capacity to carry out their important work in safety.\nAustralia will continue to support international efforts to\nsecure the release of Branko Jelen, a Yugoslav national\nand an employee of CARE Australia, who continues to\nserve time in a Yugoslav prison.\nYou, Mr. President, take up your responsibilities at\na most auspicious time, as the nations of the world enter\na new millennium. As they do so, it is appropriate for us\nto reflect on the past and the future of the United Nations,\nwhat it has achieved and what tasks remain unfulfilled.\n8\n\n\nOf course, the various aspects of this subject are as\nnumerous and diverse as the operations of the United\nNations itself, which has evolved from a modest operation\nin the early days after the end of the Second World War to\nbecome an Organization that touches on just about every\nfacet of human existence.\nToday I want to concentrate on just two matters. The\nfirst is perhaps the most fundamental task before this\nOrganization: the maintenance of global peace and security\nthrough humanitarian intervention. This is a subject that has\nbeen at the centre of my own thinking, especially over\nrecent weeks because of the role Australia has played in the\nresolution of the conflict in East Timor. I believe that the\nactivities of the United Nations in that Territory stand as an\nexample of the kind of work to which this Organization can\nreally add value.\nThe other matter \u2014 the reform of the United\nNations \u2014 is on the face of it a rather prosaic matter. But,\nin truth, reform is the key to every single function of this\nOrganization, for without it we cannot hope to equip the\nUnited Nations to face the demands of our ever-changing\ninternational environment. The United Nations must change\nand adapt, or become increasingly irrelevant.\nI turn now to the question of the future of East Timor.\nIt is now just over a week since the first elements of the\nInternational Force in East Timor (INTERFET) began\narriving in Dili to commence the task set for it under\nSecurity Council resolution 1264 (1999) of 15 September\nto restore peace and security in East Timor, to protect and\nsupport the United Nations Mission in East Timor in\ncarrying out its tasks and, within force capabilities, to\nfacilitate humanitarian assistance programmes.\nI am pleased to report that INTERFET\u2019s deployment\nhas been smooth and peaceful, and that elements of the\nforce are now spreading across the territory of East Timor.\nIt has begun the vital work of bringing peace back to the\ntroubled island, and of assisting in creating the right climate\nfor the provision of the food, shelter and medical assistance\nthat the East Timorese desperately require. This is the latest\nchapter in the long association of the United Nations with\nEast Timor, an association that has lasted for more than a\nquarter of a century. The process that has brought us here\nhas been long and difficult, but at last we may be\napproaching a peaceful resolution of the tragedy that has\nbeset the East Timorese people for so long.\nThe fact that we have arrived at this point owes much\nto President Habibie of Indonesia. It was President Habibie\nwho led his country down the path of democracy after the\ndeparture of former President Soeharto. Under President\nHabibie\u2019s guidance, Indonesia held its first democratic\nelections in more than four decades, and it now awaits the\nelection of its next President. It was also President\nHabibie who decided to allow the people of East Timor\nto choose between greater autonomy within Indonesia and\nindependence. Those were momentous decisions \u2014\ndecisions that reflect the massive strides that Indonesian\nsociety has made in just a few short months. Australia\nstood by the Indonesian people as they began their\ntransition to democracy, and we will continue to do so in\nthe years ahead.\nRegardless of the problems that have beset the\ntransition process in East Timor, President Habibie and\nhis administration deserve full credit for actually initiating\nthat process. I also want to make special mention of the\nrole played by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in\nseeking a peaceful resolution of East Timor's status.\nThe conclusion on 5 May this year of the tripartite\nAgreement among Portugal, Indonesia and the United\nNations owed much to the hard work and perseverance of\nthe Secretary-General, who helped guide the parties\ntowards a settlement that provided for a credible and\norderly ballot on East Timor's future. In doing so, he\nmaintained the honourable tradition of his predecessors as\nSecretary-General, who since 1983 had been working with\nPortugal and Indonesia towards a comprehensive and just\nsolution to the region's difficulties.\nIt would be remiss of me if I did not also mention\nthe sterling work done both before and after the\nconclusion of the Agreement by the Secretary-General's\nPersonal Representative, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker,\nand his deputy, Francesc Vendrell. The work of those two\nmen was crucial to the successful outcome of the\nnegotiations and to the holding of the ballot in East\nTimor.\nOf course, the conclusion of the tripartite Agreement\nwas just the beginning of the process to allow the East\nTimorese to decide their own fate. With the establishment\nby the Security Council on 11 June of the United Nations\nMission in East Timor (UNAMET), the practical work of\nholding the popular consultation got under way. Under the\nleadership of Ian Martin, UNAMET began the difficult\nand often dangerous task of organizing a vote in only 12\nshort weeks. Thanks to the enthusiasm and application of\nIan Martin and his team, that task was accomplished with\nresults that few could have ever dreamed of. The fact that\n9\n\n\nmore than 450,000 people were able to register to vote and\nthat 98.6 per cent of them actually did so is a remarkable\ntribute to the courage and the thirst for democracy of the\nEast Timorese people.\nBut it is also a tribute to the effectiveness of\nUNAMET and its staff, and a fine example of how\neffective the United Nations can be in situations of conflict\nand transition. The work done by UNAMET staff in the\ndays before the ballot and in the tragic days following it\ndeserves our highest praise. Unarmed, in a tense and\nemotionally charged atmosphere, they carried out their\nduties magnificently. In particular, the military liaison and\ncivilian police components of UNAMET, led respectively\nby Brigadier General Rezaqul Haider of Bangladesh and\nCommissioner Alan Mills of Australia, played crucial roles\nas the interface between UNAMET and the Indonesian\npolice and military authorities.\nUNAMET carried out its work at great risk to the staff\ninvolved, and, tragically, several locally engaged employees\npaid for their dedication with their lives. That fact is a stark\nreminder of the great personal cost that is often associated\nwith United Nations operations, and a reminder to us all of\nthe need to make the security and personal safety of United\nNations staff one of our most urgent priorities. The United\nNations must rely on its staff to carry out its various\nmandates. A threat to the person of a United Nations staff\nmember must be treated as a threat against the United\nNations itself.\nIt is a matter of unfortunate record that the upsurge of\nviolence in East Timor after the ballot on 30 August swept\nup not just United Nations staff members, but hundreds and\nmaybe thousands of East Timorese. The world has\nwitnessed the most horrible cruelty visited on the island's\npopulation by people who were unwilling to accept the\noutcome of the vote. To the great credit again of President\nHabibie, he sought military assistance through the Security\nCouncil. In response, the Security Council delivered a\nstrong resolution and a positive mandate for peacekeeping\noperations, a mandate that will ensure that the will of the\nEast Timorese people, as expressed in the 30 August vote,\nwill be carried out.\nWe in Australia have been very heartened by the\npositive international response to the call for military forces\nto make up the international force in East Timor and its\nsuccessor peacekeeping force. As I have mentioned, the\ninternational forces under the command of Major-General\nPeter Cosgrove, have begun to restore order in East Timor.\nThere are currently some 3,200 personnel on the ground,\ndrawn from a range of countries, with strong\nrepresentation from our own Asia-Pacific region. The\nlarge number of countries participating in the force, and\ntheir wide geographical representation, is evidence of the\nwidespread international determination to see a peaceful\nand orderly transition in East Timor's status.\nI am also very pleased to note that UNAMET\npersonnel have now returned to the island, and will be\nable to continue their important work.\nIn discussing the activities of the United Nations in\nEast Timor, I must also mention the humanitarian work\ndone by United Nations agencies. Mrs. Sadako Ogata, the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has\ntravelled to West Timor to examine the plight of East\nTimorese refugees in that territory, and Australia fully\nsupports her efforts.\nAustralia is also the staging point for humanitarian\nassistance operations being carried out by agencies such\nas the World Food Programme and the United Nations\nChildren's Fund. Additional relief efforts are also planned\nby the World Health Organization and the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations. Australia\nhas already pledged $7 million towards the humanitarian\nefforts of United Nations agencies and other\norganizations.\nThe United Nations is also seeking to address the\nhuman rights violations that have been widespread in East\nTimor. Security Council resolution 1264 (1999) called on\nthose responsible for violence in East Timor to be brought\nto justice. Australia supports efforts by the Indonesian\nGovernment and the United Nations to bring to account\nthose responsible for the grievous acts of criminal\nviolence visited upon the East Timorese people, and will\noffer all appropriate assistance in this regard.\nMore generally, there is now an urgent need to move\nas soon as possible to the third phase of the United\nNations plan for East Timor. This will require all parties,\nmost especially Indonesia and Portugal, to work closely\nwith the Secretariat. Australia will do what it can to assist\nin this process, which will build the foundation for the\ntransition in the territory's status.\nIn its activities in East Timor, the United Nations\nhas demonstrated some of its fundamental strengths as an\norganization. It is helping to bring about the resolution of\nan international problem that had been festering for a\nquarter of a century. It provided the infrastructure that\n10\n\n\nallowed a free and fair expression of the will of the East\nTimorese people. And when the security situation could not\nbe controlled, it facilitated the creation of an international\nforce to put the transition process back on track and end\ngross violations of human rights.\nI have been struck by the deep historical resonances of\nthis process, for when the United Nations was established\nat the end of the Second World War, part of its rationale as\nan organization was to have been the impartial and\nobjective resolution of international problems, free of the\nold cycles of retribution through resort to aggression. The\nancient resort to armed force and the notion that might was\nright were to have been overturned, and in their place the\ncommunity of nations was to cooperate to settle\ninternational disputes and solve global problems. The world,\nhaving won a victory over nazism, was determined that\nsimilar evils would never again prevail.\nWell, we have seen plenty of occasions in the past 50\nyears where practice has not measured up to the ideals. But\nevery now and then, the process works, and I believe that\nmany elements of the work of the United Nations in East\nTimor are evidence of that. Of course, that is not to say\nthat the process cannot be improved; of course it can. But\nif we can identify and build upon the positive elements of\nour East Timor experience, I believe that we can not only\nimprove the situation of the people of that territory, but\nmay also be able to provide a speedier and more thorough\nresolution of other international crises in the future.\nWe need also to draw lessons from the negative\naspects of events in East Timor. Through our efforts there,\nwe have shown what the United Nations can do well. Let\nus build on that effectiveness, and strive for an organization\nthat is even more relevant to global peace and security in\nthe next millennium.\nI now turn to another aspect of increased\neffectiveness: the question of United Nations reform. In a\nrecent report on preparations for the Millennium Assembly\nand the millennium summit, the Secretary-General\ndescribed the United Nations as a unique institution. No\none could disagree that the contribution of the United\nNations to the pursuit of peace and security, to the\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples and to the\npromotion of human rights over the last 50 years or so has\nbeen not just of enormous value, but also truly unique in\nworld history.\nThe twenty-first century, however, will bring with it\nnew challenges and, I hope, new opportunities.\nUnder the direction of Kofi Annan, this Organization\nhas begun the important and necessary steps to equip\nitself to face these challenges through genuine\nadministrative and management reform. This has included\npromising changes in financial and personnel practices,\nsignificant economies, improving coordination between\nUnited Nations bodies, significant rationalization of\nSecretariat structures and more efficient use of\ntechnology. Such reforms make the work of the United\nNations more efficient and provide real savings for the\nOrganization. Those savings can then be used for other\nprogrammes that benefit all Member States, but\nparticularly the developing Members of the United\nNations.\nThe challenge for the United Nations \u2014 and, let us\nall recognize its Member States \u2014 is to ensure that this\nmomentum is sustained and taken forward. A former\nAustralian Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, said over\n40 years ago that \u201cwhen we talk of the United Nations,\nwe should remember what it is in fact, and not be led off\nby dreams of what we would like it to be in another kind\nof world.\u201d\nWe need to accept that the United Nations exists in\na real world and be realistic about what it can achieve.\nWe need to ensure that the Organization's structures and\nprocesses better reflect the realities of the twenty-first\ncentury. We need an expanded, more representative and\nmore transparent Security Council, and an electoral group\nsystem which reflects the geo-political and economic\nrealities of today rather than the early nineteen sixties. To\nachieve real reforms on these and other subjects, Member\nStates must work together in a sustained and cooperative\nmanner. And they must also demonstrate their\ncommitment to the Organization by paying their\ncontributions on time and in full.\nReform of the United Nations means building a\nstronger and more effective Organization that can deliver\non its commitments to the world's people. It means less\nwaste and more practical activities. It means developing\nan Organization that is equipped to meet whatever\nchallenges the new century may bring.\nUltimately, it means creating a United Nations that can\nmaintain its relevance when many national and\ninternational institutions are falling by the wayside, made\nobsolete by the rapid pace of change.\nI want to conclude my remarks with a call for the\nUnited Nations to concentrate on building on its strengths.\nI have mentioned the need to stick with a programme of\n\n\n\nthorough and fundamental reform, for that is a basic\nprerequisite for the continued effectiveness of the\nOrganization. But I have also mentioned the United Nations\nwork in East Timor as an example of how the Organization\ncan, and does, make a real difference in the resolution of\ncomplex and challenging foreign policy and humanitarian\nproblems. Not only was the United Nations able to\nadminister a ballot in circumstances in which many\nobservers thought the task impossible, but it was also able\nto provide for the insertion of a peacekeeping force when\nlaw and order broke down. Those who wished to\nexterminate an entire community were foiled.\nThose are great strengths. But we need to be able to\nconsolidate them to make the United Nations a more\neffective Organization. We must, for example, be able to\nensure that the United Nations can intervene quickly when\nrapidly deteriorating conditions threaten entire nations. That\nwas the lesson of Rwanda. I was struck by the comments\nmade by the Secretary-General on this subject when he\naddressed the Assembly last week. As the Secretary-\nGeneral suggests, changing international circumstances \u2014\nincluding the spread of notions of individual rights and the\nidea that the international community has a responsibility to\nrespond effectively to humanitarian crises \u2014 are\nchallenging traditional notions of national sovereignty. The\nUnited Nations needs to focus on these challenges and\nbegin the process of defining when and how the\nOrganization should act in the face of humanitarian crises.\nIt may be an old clich\u00e9 to say that the world is\ngrowing ever smaller, but it is true just the same. In days\ngone by, the nations of the world may have been forgiven\nif they acted too slowly in the face of a humanitarian crisis.\nTales of atrocities, famine and natural disaster took weeks\nor months to filter out from the more inaccessible areas of\nthe globe. Today, those same stories are likely to be on\ntelevision screens within hours, or even minutes.\nIn the face of such indisputable evidence,\nGovernments will be forced to act. Those that resist will\nhave to face a domestic and international audience as well\ninformed as they. That is the kind of environment in which\nthe United Nations will increasingly have to function,\nwhere the results of inaction will be seen instantly and the\nconsequences of failure subject to instant and very telling\nscrutiny.\nSome will be concerned about interference in national\nsovereignty, and obviously that is an important and\nlegitimate concern. Others will say that the greater principle\nis that of natural human solidarity. But whatever view is\ncorrect, this environment is a fact we now have to deal\nwith, whether we like it or whether we don't. When we\nall gather here in New York each year, it is easy to get\ncaught up in the daily business of the United Nations, in\nthe resolutions, the committee meetings, the briefings and\nthe caucusing.\nHow often do we stop, and remind ourselves of the\npurposes for which we meet? If we genuinely wish to\nuphold the Charter, if we really do want to maintain\ninternational peace and security, help develop our\neconomic and social strengths and promote respect for\nhuman rights and fundamental reforms, surely we can\nstart by upholding the most basic right of all, that of life.\nIn the face of acts of genocide, or of human rights\nabuses on a horrendous scale, the nations of the world\nmust act. I am a firm realist when it comes to foreign\npolicy, but am also a great believer in the value of\nidealism. More than 50 years ago, our predecessors\ncreated the United Nations in the firm hope that there\ncould be a new international order to replace the old, a\nspirit of cooperative international action that could avoid\nthe competition and aggression that caused two world\nwars.\nAs we approach the end of this century, it is true\nthat the United Nations has not lived up to all the hopes\nof its founders. But the great promise of the Organization\nremains. The United Nations response to developments in\nEast Timor has shown just what positive action on the\npart of this Organization can accomplish. We know the\ngreat things this body can achieve. Let us all try to build\non those achievements, so that we may create an\nOrganization that can truly address the most pressing\nproblems of the international community. We can build an\nactive and practical United Nations to meet both the\naspirations of its Member nations and, also, the legitimate\nneeds of all humanity.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Speaking to the\nAssembly one year ago, I demonstrated that the Kingdom\nof the Netherlands qualified for membership on the Security\nCouncil. During the elections two weeks later a\nsubstantial majority of this body supported us, and we are\ngrateful to them. As the Netherlands has served on the\nCouncil now for more than eight months and is currently\nits President, I think it is only fair for me to report to all\nthe Assembly members who showed confidence in us. I\nwish to speak on Africa, on the Council, and on shifting\nour attention from the State to the people.\nMost of today's armed conflicts are in Africa. From\nSierra Leone to Eritrea and from the Sudan to the Congo\nand Angola, Africans are fighting Africans. Fighting\naccompanies all the plights and pains that are known to\nhumankind, from poverty and pestilence to famine, fear\nand flight.\nAfrica is not a land of troubles alone but also of\nhappiness, not a continent only of catastrophe but also\none of hope. The sheer mass of Africa's problems\nobscures our view of its promise and its potential. In the\npublic mind, an unbalanced view of Africa prevails. That\nview, I feel, needs to be corrected: we need to rid\nourselves of prejudice and think positively. Instead of\ndejection, we need a deepening commitment. Africa,\ndespite the odds, has come a long way already.\nPersonally, I was struck, at the opening of the general\ndebate, by the sight of an African President of South\nAfrica, speaking in front of an African President of the\nGeneral Assembly, seated next to an African Secretary-\nGeneral. It is hard to miss the symbolism of that image.\nIt is one image the founding fathers of this Organization\nmight not have had, one image that by itself already holds\na promise for the future: the next century may well be the\ncentury of Africa.\nThe Secretary-General, in his report on Africa, has\nmade a link between conflict and prosperity. For this\nreason, my delegation felt that members of the Council\nwould be well advised to consider this question in some\ndepth, and, in our presidential capacity, we have therefore\norganized an open-ended public debate, to be held next\nweek, in which the Secretary-General will brief us on the\nstate of Africa.\nLet me now turn to the question of how to improve\nthe effectiveness of the United Nations, and the Security\nCouncil in particular, in coping with crisis situations. On\nmany occasions in its lifetime, I have admired the United\nNations for the way it intervened in emergencies. In\nparticular, the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United\nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food\n21\n\n\nProgramme have enjoyed a long tradition of being in the\nforefront. Many non-governmental organizations, such as\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the International Committee\nof the Red Cross (ICRC), have stood there right beside\nthem.\nLet me pose a number of questions on how the\nSecurity Council performs in emergencies. First, do we not\nsee a crisis coming before it breaks? Do we not have early\nwarning systems? Of course we do. The call for\nestablishing early warning systems has been around for\ndecades; it has become a buzzword used whenever the\ninadequacies of the United Nations response machinery are\nbeing discussed. But in fact, given the level of\ncommunications in modern times, policy planners have\nplenty of information to be forward-looking. It is not the\nfailing of an early warning system that can be put to blame,\nnor the lack of data. It is, instead, the failure of decision-\nmakers to react adequately.\nSecond question: Why, then, does the United Nations\nreact inadequately? Do we not have preventive diplomacy?\nWe do, not only in terms of bilateral efforts of major\nnations or of the good offices of the Secretary-General; the\nCouncil itself can be proactive. The recent mission it\ndispatched to East Timor is a good example of how the\nCouncil can be more assertive. Missions are an existing\ninstrument that is, in my opinion, in need of an upgrade. In\naddition, the open debate on East Timor in the Council, at\nwhich everybody spoke plain language, fuelled the\nmounting international pressure on Indonesia.\nThird question: Is the problem, perhaps, the veto? I\nknow this is a popular view, but it is also a tenuous one.\nTrue, we cannot ignore the veto as a factor in the Council's\nperformance record. True again, in our discussions on\nreform of the Council, the veto is a core element we will\none day have to come to grips with. Yet, the problem is an\nintractable one. Tampering with the veto may itself create\nthe risk of dissolution for the United Nations as a whole.\nThe very fact that a single Member State can hold the\nentire world community in limbo in the face of harrowing\nbrutalities is affecting the stature and moral force of the\nOrganization. That, too, may be spawning dissolution. It\nmay be argued that, without the veto, the United Nations\nwould not have survived its first 50 years. It may also be\nargued that, with the veto, the United Nations will not\nsurvive the next 50 years. In the first 50 years, the\nOrganization might have fallen apart if the veto had not\nbeen there as a buffer against the push and pull of a bipolar\nworld. In the second 50 years, in a multipolar world,\nrepeated inaction by the Security Council would result in\nparallel actions outside the United Nations framework,\npushing the Organization, as a custodian of world peace,\nmore and more into the margins.\nNo matter when or how the debate on the veto will\nend, this Assembly should meanwhile call on those who\npossess it to exercise maximum restraint, particularly in\nhumanitarian emergencies. I concur with my German\ncolleague that the permanent five are duty-bound to\nexplain to the world why they are blocking action by the\nCouncil. Moreover, we might consider a situation in\nwhich a negative vote by a permanent member does not\nin itself block action.\nFourth question: Does the problem lie in the political\nwill, perhaps? To simply say that the political will has\nbeen lacking is not only a platitude, but also a very partial\nview of reality. For part of that reality is that images of\nall the conflicts on the globe travel around the world with\nthe speed of light. The media broadcasts live images of\nhuman suffering. Understandably, such images rouse\nindignation and horror among millions of viewers. They\nexpect instant action. As people are being better informed\nabout current events, their level of expectation rises. The\ngap between what is expected and what is possible\nbecomes more visible and more acute. By contrast,\ndiplomacy comes with tools that may be old and\nrespectable, but are also solid and slow. And so, while in\na globalizing world human misery is disseminated along\nthe electronic highway, diplomacy today still proceeds\nalong a footpath.\nThis leaves me with the central question: Why is the\nCouncil often running behind reality? How can we make\nit catch up with developments?\nAs I look back at the general debate this week, I\nthink that we are getting very close to identifying the\nmain obstacle. I know that many interventions share a\ncommon element \u2014 they compare the notion of\nsovereignty to that of human rights and territorial integrity\nto humanitarian intervention. To be sure, the question per\nse is as old as the Charter itself. What is new is the\nvenue. I cannot recall that Foreign Ministers at the\nGeneral Assembly have talked about this question at any\nlength before. I strongly believe that this issue was bound\nto surface at this level at some point or another.\nIn 1945, the architects of this Organization included\ntwo contradictory premises: respect for territorial integrity\nand political independence, on the one hand; and respect\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms, on the other.\n22\n\n\nThe world in those days was ruled by Governments alone,\nand so the United Nations was made up of States. At the\ntime, the notion of human rights, although grafted onto the\nCharter with much conviction, was essentially at odds with\nclassical legal thinking. In a way, the tension became even\nmore pronounced at the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration. After all, for half a millennium the notion of\nsovereignty had served as the basis of our global political\narchitecture. As the idea was enshrined in the Charter, the\nfounding fathers believed it would stand the test of time.\nBy contrast, the idea of human rights in international\nrelations was, for the most part, a post-war novelty. Indeed,\nthe Charter is much more specific on respect for\nsovereignty than on respect for human rights.\nSince 1945, the world has witnessed a gradual shift in\nthat balance, making respect for human rights more and\nmore mandatory and respect for sovereignty less and less\nstringent. An elaborate body of international human rights\nlaw has come to counterbalance the dictates of paragraphs\n4 and 7 of Article 2. Today, human rights have come to\noutrank sovereignty. Increasingly, the prevailing\ninterpretation of the Charter is that it aims to protect\nindividual human beings, not to protect those who abuse\nthem. Today, we regard it as a generally accepted rule of\ninternational law that no sovereign State has the right to\nterrorize its own citizens. Indeed, if the Charter were to be\nwritten today, there would be an Article 2.8 saying that\nnothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize\nMember States to terrorize their own people.\nLet me go one step further. The blurring of the\nboundaries of sovereignty does not stop at human rights. In\nthe future, the notion of sovereignty is going to be tested\nbeyond that. Think of decrepit nuclear installations, massive\ndamage to the environment, lack of water or mass\nmarketing of narcotic drugs. Can responsible statesmen\nafford to wait until the damage is actually done? Or do they\nin fact have a duty to prevent it? These are questions\nwhich, at some point, the Security Council will have to be\ninvolved in.\nIt is not the lack of early warning, not the absence of\npreventive diplomacy, not the veto per se. I call on every\npolitician and every diplomat in this room to accept that the\ntraditional balance between sovereignty and human rights,\nbetween the State and the people is shifting. I am\nconvinced this is one of the paramount issues of our time.\nMomentum is building, and we should seize it. Let us put\nthe issue squarely on the agenda: the agenda of the\nUnited Nations, of the Council and of our parliaments at\nhome. I ask the legal community to keep a keen eye on\nthe groundswell that is developing and to be innovative in\nits thinking. We politicians have a vast responsibility\nhere. We should steer the discussion towards the people\ninstead of the State.\nThe Security Council should be stronger, not weaker.\nIt should be a credible leader in the maintenance of\npeace. In order to be credible, it must be consistent, swift\nand proactive. It must show courage, drive and vision. It\nmust keep changing with the times. It must put people\nover politics. That is a tall order. Its decision on East\nTimor gave us hope for the Council's potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This\nchoice reflects the great esteem in which the international\ncommunity holds his country, Namibia, as well as being a\ntribute to his past as a freedom fighter and to his qualities\nas a statesman. I assure him of the wholehearted support of\nmy delegation as he carries out his duties.\nI would also like to extend my most sincere\ncongratulations to President Gurirab\u2019s predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Uruguay, for the skill with which he conducted\nthe work of the fifty-third session of the Assembly.\nTo Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\nI would like to express the utmost appreciation of the\nGovernment of Togo for the perspicacity and tenacity he\nhas shown in seeking solutions to the many problems facing\nthe Organization.\nFinally, I would like to take advantage of this\nopportunity to warmly congratulate the Republic of Kiribati,\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on their\nadmission into this great family, the United Nations.\nWe have met once again this year to take stock of\nactions carried out in pursuit of our common objectives\nand to coordinate our views on what actions to take in\norder to address today\u2019s challenges. Given the current\nstate of the world, we must acknowledge that, despite the\nsignificant progress that has been made, the world is still\nmarked, unfortunately, by instability, raging wars and\ntensions that are most often due to widespread poverty\nand to the uneven distribution of resources, as well as to\nthe legitimate aspiration of peoples for greater freedom,\njustice and well-being.\nIndeed, at a time when mankind is getting ready to\nembark on the third millennium, our world offers one of\nthe bleakest pictures in its history from an economic and\nsocial point of view. All kinds of problems linked to\nunderdevelopment, poverty and inequalities between\ndeveloped and disadvantaged countries \u2014 problems long\ndenounced in this and other forums \u2014 have worsened in\nrecent years as a result of the globalization of the\neconomy. Although developed countries have benefited\nfrom this phenomenon, especially in the areas of trade\nand investment, developing countries are suffering the\nnegative impact of globalization on their economies,\nwhich have already been rendered fragile by their\nunbearable debt burden, the plummeting of prices for raw\nmaterials and the steady decline in official development\nassistance.\nAs regards the external-debt problem in particular,\nwe can never stress enough how the accumulation of this\ndebt hampers development efforts. The awareness of the\nextent of this problem and of its impact on development\nis such that the most industrialized countries and the\nBretton Woods institutions and those of the United\nNations system now acknowledge that most of the\ndeveloping countries\u2019 debt can never be repaid. They also\nacknowledge quite openly that the debt burden is the\nmajor obstacle to the development of poor countries and\nthat the mechanisms that have been established to resolve\nthe debt crisis have not been very effective.\nWithin this context we can only welcome the\ncommitment of the G-8 summit, held last June in\nCologne, to cancel a portion of the debt of world\u2019s\npoorest countries. My delegation encourages the\ninternational community to continue to take bold steps\naimed at resolving the debt problem in an effective and\nlasting manner. These steps might include the cancellation\nof all of the bilateral debt of the poorest countries, a\nsignificant reduction of the debt burden of middle-income\nand low-income countries, and increasing the flexibility\n20\n\n\nof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative so\nas to make its benefits more generally available. However,\nwe should point out that the implementation of such\nmeasures should not be carried out to the detriment of\nofficial development assistance, which, unfortunately,\ncontinues to decline.\nAs regards trade, it is generally acknowledged that the\nexpansion of international trade is a true engine for growth\nand development. We would like to see the international\ncommunity take appropriate measures to integrate\ndeveloping countries into the international-trade regime,\nthrough increasing access for their exports to the markets\nof developed countries, by supporting the diversification\nand strengthening of developing countries\u2019 production\ncapacities, and by improving terms of trade.\nWe sincerely hope that the forthcoming negotiations\nat the World Trade Organization, the tenth United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development and between the\nEuropean Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific\ncountries will take into account the interests of the weakest\npartners.\nIn recent years, many initiatives have been taken on\nthe bilateral and multilateral levels to try to address the\nchallenges faced by the African continent. In this respect,\nI would cite the United States initiative for a Partnership\nfor Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa and the\nTokyo International Conferences on African Development.\nWhile this may be satisfying, there is still reason, in the\nname of efficiency, to call for some degree of coordination\nbetween these initiatives and those of the United Nations\nsystem.\nEfforts to promote development and eradicate poverty\nin Africa cannot be dissociated from our daily struggle to\nsafeguard peace and security. For our countries again this\nyear, preserving and consolidating a climate of peace and\nstability have been the major imperative, given the many\nreal dangers.\nThus, the Government of Togo, traditionally inclined\nto search for peace and stability, has spared no effort to try\nto reconcile points of view whenever discord arises,\nconvinced that dialogue and cooperation should be\nemphasized in the settlement of disputes and that any\nconflict that may arise in any country of a subregion\nrepresents a tragedy for the entire subregion, and perhaps\nAfrica as a whole.\nInspired by the spirit of subregional solidarity that,\nunder the President of our Republic, Mr. Gnassingb\u00e9\nEyad\u00e9ma, current Chairman of the Authority of Heads of\nState and Government of the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS), we have carried out\nactions and taken appropriate initiatives to find negotiated\nsolutions to the crisis in Guinea-Bissau, the conflict in\nSierra Leone and the border dispute between Guinea and\nLiberia.\nFollowing the crisis that erupted in Guinea-Bissau in\nJune 1998, the efforts of the ECOWAS and the\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries led to the\nsigning of a ceasefire and a peace Agreement in\nNovember 1998. The subsequent deployment of an\nECOWAS Monitoring Group contingent with woefully\ninadequate means did not allow us effectively to\nimplement the provisions of the Abuja Agreement and the\nLom\u00e9 Protocol, nor did it entirely allay tensions. Despite\nthe brutal upheaval of the peace process on 7 May 1999,\nthe Security Council ratified the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposal to maintain the United Nations office in Guinea-\nBissau with a new mandate. We hope that the\nOrganization and the international community will\ncontinue to provide the necessary assistance to the people\nof Guinea-Bissau, who so desperately need it. We\nwelcome the commitments undertaken that will ensure\nrespect for the elections of November 1997. We expect\nthat tranquility and security will return to Guinea-Bissau.\nIn Sierra Leone, thanks to the initiative and\ndetermination of the ECOWAS heads of State and to the\nsupport of the international community, the Government\nof Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front\nsigned, in our capital city of Lom\u00e9 on 7 July 1999, a\nPeace Agreement whose implementation will, we hope,\nallow the people of Sierra Leone to embark decisively on\nthe path of national reconciliation, stability and\nreconstruction. Thus, as I pointed out yesterday\nbefore the Security Council in the context of the open\ndebate on the situation in Africa, the restoration is closely\nlinked to the implementation of the Lom\u00e9 Peace\nAgreement.\nThat is why I am pleased by the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposal in his latest report on Sierra Leone to create a\nUnited Nations force of 6,000 in that country, in keeping\nwith this Agreement. I am convinced that the Security\nCouncil, which has already begun to consider the matter,\nwill authorize as soon as possible the deployment of that\nforce, which, in compliance with its mandate, will help\n21\n\n\nthe Government of Sierra Leone to implement the stalled\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme.\nWe also wish particularly to thank the Government of\nthe United Kingdom, which chairs the international contact\ngroup on Sierra Leone; the international organizations and\nhumanitarian agencies; and all those who have variously\ncontributed to restoring peace in that country. I recall the\nfine spirit of solidarity that was manifest during the\nnegotiations on the Lom\u00e9 Peace Agreement, which allowed\nthe representatives of the United States of America, the\nUnited Kingdom, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the\nSecretary-General of the Organization of African Unity, as\nwell as the permanent representatives of the United Nations\nand the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative in Sierra\nLeone to pool their efforts around the seven-member\nECOWAS contact group, which worked tirelessly day and\nnight for success in Sierra Leone. That is why we feel that\nthe decision to embark as soon as possible on the\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme\nwith the dispatch of 6,000 United Nations blue helmets\nwould put an end to this war.\nAs for Liberia, the Ad Hoc Committee of the\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of ECOWAS met on 26\nAugust 1999 in Lom\u00e9 to study the destabilization of that\nbrotherly country. My delegation makes an urgent appeal to\nthe parties involved to respect the relevant provisions of the\nECOWAS Treaty and the non-aggression protocol signed in\nLagos on 22 April 1998 in order to allow the immediate\nrestoration of a climate of peace, security and confidence in\nthe subregion. In this respect, we were pleased by the\nrecent signing in Abuja, on 16 September, of the\nunderstanding between the heads of State of Guinea and\nLiberia during the ECOWAS mini-summit, held in the\ncapital of Nigeria. We also appeal to the international\ncommunity to provide the necessary support to countries of\nthe subregion that have borne the burden of refugees,\nGuinea-Bissau in particular, so that they may address that\nproblem.\nElsewhere, the perpetuation of armed conflicts, with\ntheir humanitarian consequences of all kinds, deeply\nconcerns my delegation. In this respect, we welcome the\nsigning in Lusaka on 12 July of the Ceasefire Agreement\nbetween the main parties to the conflict in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and ardently call for a stronger\ncommitment of the Security Council to assist the Southern\nAfrican Development Community countries.\nIn Angola, we hope that the joint efforts of the United\nNations and the Organization of African Unity will allow\nthe people of that country to achieve reconciliation and\nwill encourage the restoration of peace and stability in\nthat country. In any case, Togo is determined to apply the\ndecisions of our United Nations with respect to the steps\ntaken against the belligerent parties in Angola.\nAs to the border dispute between Ethiopia and\nEritrea, my delegation sincerely hopes that these two\nbrotherly countries will truly embark on the path towards\na peaceful solution of their dispute.\nIt is comforting to note that real progress has been\nmade with regard to the crisis stemming from the\nLockerbie affair after many years of procrastination which\npenalized the fraternal people of the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya. The Government of Togo believes that in\nplacing the two Lockerbie bombing suspects at the\ndisposal of the United Nations, Libya has met its\nobligations under Security Council resolutions and that\nthe Security Council must immediately lift the sanctions\nimposed on that country. This will contribute to ending\nthe suffering of our Libyan brothers, which has lasted too\nlong.\nWith regard to the Middle East, we reaffirm our\nstrong conviction that an era of lasting peace, stability and\nsecurity for all can come about only through the\ncontinuation of the peace process and the most resolute\npolitical will on all sides, based on Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and\nthe principle of \u201cland for peace\u201d. In this context, the\nGovernment of Togo welcomes developments in that\nregion, through steps recently taken by President Yasser\nArafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak. We urge the\nparties concerned to continue to work tirelessly to find\nways and means to allow the harmonious continuation of\nthe peace process.\nOne of the most important events that will have\nmost deeply marked this fading century is undeniably the\nend of the cold war. Among other things, it resulted in\naverting the spectre of a nuclear holocaust; at least, we\nhope so.\nDeeply attached to the principle of general and\ncomplete disarmament under effective international\ncontrol, Togo is still concerned about nuclear\ndisarmament and the elimination of other weapons of\nmass destruction. This is why we appeal for continued\nefforts to put an end to the proliferation of nuclear arms\nand the threats they entail.\n22\n\n\nThe same applies to proliferation of and illicit\ntrafficking in light weapons and small arms in Africa. My\ncountry welcomes United Nations initiatives to curtail and\ncontain this phenomenon, and hopes that the international\nconference decided upon by the General Assembly in\nresolution 53/77 E of 4 December 1998, and scheduled to\ntake place in Geneva in 2001, will make it possible to find\neffective solutions to this problem.\nI would also like to stress the role played in this\ncontext by the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace\nand Disarmament in Africa, which organized in Lom\u00e9, from\n2 to 4 August 1999, a workshop on illicit trafficking in\nlight weapons. I am pleased to take this opportunity to pay\na well deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization, who has just provided this Centre with a\nDirector, whose main task it is to revitalize its activities and\nmobilize the necessary funds to finance its operational\nexpenses. Because of its important role in implementing the\nProgramme for Coordination and Assistance for Security\nand Development, as well as in the destruction of arms\ncollected during the peace process in Liberia, we feel that\nsupport for its work is urgently needed. In this connection,\nwe thank the Italian, Japanese, Norwegian and Swedish\nGovernments for their generous voluntary contributions and\nreiterate our appeal to the international community to\nprovide financial and logistical support.\nI turn to the functioning of our Organization. Here I\nstress the fundamental role of the Security Council in\nmaintaining international peace and security. My delegation\nreaffirms its support for all reforms to strengthen the\neffectiveness of the Council and provide representation for\nAfrica, in the form of a permanent Member, in keeping\nwith the will of the heads of State and Government of the\nOrganization of African Unity.\nThroughout its long history, my country has never\nstrayed from the purposes of our Organization. We have\noften expressed and shown our dedication to the ideals of\npeace and justice, as well as the principles of democracy\nand the protection of human rights. Going beyond the social\nand political crises that we have known in recent years, the\npeople of Togo are resolutely engaged in a new process of\nnational understanding and harmony, something I wish to\nemphasize. On 19 July 1999, on the initiative of General\nEyadema, President of the Republic, an internal dialogue\nbringing together all of the political actors of the country\nwas organized following preliminary meetings held at Paris\nand Lom\u00e9 between March and June 1999.\nThe opportunity was given to representatives of the\npresidential leadership and of the Togolese opposition to\nfreely express themselves on the major issues of political\nlife in our country, under the arbitration of international\nfacilitators. In this regard, I would like to renew our\ndeepest gratitude to France, the Federal Republic of\nGermany, the European Union and the International\nOrganization of La Francophonie for the important role\nthey played during these negotiations, which led to the\nsigning of a framework agreement on 29 July 1999. For\nthe implementation of the agreement, the Government has\nshown itself ready to make all necessary concessions that\nare in the national interest, it being understood that\nnational reconciliation is vital to the continuation of the\nprocess of democratization and the consolidation of the\nrule of law in Togo, as elsewhere.\nWe are sure that reason and the national interest will\nprevail, so that the hopes of the people of Togo and the\ninternational community are not disappointed.\nThe Government regards the signing of the\nagreement as an important step in our resolute march\ntowards building a democratic society and bringing about\ndevelopment. We therefore solemnly appeal to the\ninternational community to resume effective cooperation\nwith Togo, in order to allow its population to enjoy the\nfruits of democratization. Poverty is the enemy of\ndemocracy.\nThe complexity of the issues and the many\nchallenges to be taken up at the dawn of the third\nmillennium call for a strengthening of international\ncooperation and, above all, greater solidarity with Africa.\nNo nation, no country, whatever its resources and\nabilities, can tackle these challenges alone. Cooperation\nbetween the peoples of the United Nations is vital to us.\nWe must therefore act together, consolidating our\nsolidarity within the framework of our Organization,\nwhich, after half a century of existence, has proved that\nit is an irreplaceable tool at the service of mankind.\nTogo, which once again proclaims its faith in the\nUnited Nations, would encourage it to relentlessly pursue\nin the century to come the achievement of its Charter\npurposes.\nMay this session strengthen us in our common\nstruggle to consolidate peace, justice, freedom and\nprogress in the world and foster more understanding\nbetween nations. Togo is ready to contribute to this effort."

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin, Mr.\nPresident, by extending to you the warmest congratulations\nof the delegation of the Union of Myanmar on your\nunanimous election as President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-fourth session. Heavy and onerous indeed are the\nduties and responsibilities that fall upon you at this\nparticular session. The task before the President of the\nGeneral Assembly in any year is by no means easy. It is\neven less so this year, as this session has the additional task\nof undertaking the preparatory work for the millennium\nsession of next year. However, we are fully confident that\nyour great wealth of experience and outstanding diplomatic\nskills will stand you in good stead in the discharge of your\nresponsibilities and that you will bring this session to a\nsuccessful conclusion. I pledge my delegation's fullest\ncooperation for the advancement of the work of the\nAssembly under your able leadership.\nI also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr.\nOpertti, for his invaluable contribution to the successful\nconclusion of the previous session of the General\nAssembly. Our tribute also goes to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his untiring efforts in leading the\nworld Organization so effectively through these extremely\nchallenging and difficult years.\nMyanmar consistently supports the principle of the\nuniversality of membership of this world Organization. We\nare therefore most delighted to see in our midst three new\nMembers this year. On behalf of the delegation of the\nUnion of Myanmar, I should like to extend our warmest\ncongratulations to the delegations of the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga,\nwhich have taken their rightful places in the Assembly.\nWe live in a rapidly changing world. With the end of\nthe cold war, the old era of the bipolar world has become\na thing of the past. The world is in transition from the old\nto the new world order, which has not fully taken shape. At\nthis critical juncture, the world is faced with uncertainties\nand unsettling situations. Sometimes, the world has even\nfallen victim to this turbulence and chaos.\nIn dealing with such situations, it is our view that any\nsolutions sought or measures taken, even with the best of\nintentions, should be in strict conformity with the purposes\nand principles of the United Nations Charter. Furthermore,\nuniversally recognized principles governing international\nrelations and the principle of respect for State sovereignty\nshould be taken into account before resorting to measures\nof an extreme nature in connection with a particular\nsituation.\nOne outstanding question relating to the reform of\nthe United Nations is the reform of the structure and\nworking methods of the Security Council. We are\nencouraged to see that the General Assembly has taken a\nsignificant procedural step by adopting a resolution on the\nrequirement of a two-thirds majority in taking decisions\nand adopting resolutions on this question.\nWith regard to the core issue of enlargement of the\nSecurity Council, there are various proposals on the table\nregarding the possible size of the Council. As a member\nState of the Non-Aligned Movement, our preference is for\nenlargement of the Security Council up to 26 members.\nWe favour the expansion of the membership of the\nCouncil in both categories, permanent and non-permanent.\nIn order to overcome the current impasse on the\nquestion of permanent seats in the Security Council, a\ncompromise formula, acceptable to all parties, should be\nworked out through enhanced consultations and\ndiscussions among the Member States. We are of the\nview that in the event other options fail to command\nenough support, the idea of rotating permanent seats\nshould also be considered as one of the options in the\npermanent membership category.\nIn the coming year, we are going to convene a\nlandmark Assembly, the Millennium Assembly, and the\nmillennium summit. It is crucially important that the\nMillennium Assembly and summit should not be mere\nceremonial events, but should come up with concrete\nideas and results. As it is clearly evident that the greatest\nchallenge facing mankind well into the next millennium\nwill be economic development and poverty eradication for\nthe vast majority of people in the world, it is our view\nthat particular attention should be given to these issues.\nGlobalization can cut both positively and negatively.\nIt can bring us new opportunities as well as additional\nproblems. It is true that the process of globalization can\nfacilitate economic development and enhance the living\nstandards of people. But at the same time, it can make\nsmaller and less developed States vulnerable to the\nundesirable negative effects of this process. One such\nproblem caused by the process of globalization, is\ntransnational crime, including illicit trafficking in narcotic\ndrugs, money-laundering, trafficking in persons, arms-\nsmuggling, piracy and terrorism. These crimes pose\nserious threats to the peace and stability of mankind at\nboth national and regional levels. The nature of this\nproblem is such that it requires national, regional and\nglobal responses.\n36\n\n\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that in a bid to\nstrengthen cooperation in the regional grouping, Myanmar\nhosted the second Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) ministerial meeting on transnational crime in\nJune this year. The meeting was a success, and it\nconstituted a significant step in advancing regional\ncooperation in combating this menace in the South-East\nAsian region.\nLet me also address the fight against narcotic drugs in\nMyanmar. My Government is greatly concerned about the\ndrug menace, and the fight against narcotic drugs is\nregarded as a national task and the top priority. A master\nplan had been adopted to totally eradicate poppy cultivation\nwithin 15 years, in cooperation with ethnic leaders who\nsigned peace agreements with the Government. In accord\nwith the master plan, many areas have been declared\nopium-free zones and farmers are now turning to alternative\ncrops. Law enforcement has been stepped up in the border\nareas, resulting in increased seizures of narcotic drugs.\nWhile we are quite successful in the suppression of\nopium and heroin production, though only scanty\ninternational assistance has been received, another tide of\ndanger has emerged in the form of new synthetic drugs,\nsuch as methamphetamine. The new drugs are produced\naround our porous borders with precursor chemicals such\nas ephedrine, unavailable locally, and drug-making\nequipment illegally smuggled in from neighbouring\ncountries. We are redirecting our efforts to deal with the\nnew problem with the cooperation of the countries\nconcerned.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to apprise the\nAssembly briefly of the recent developments and trends\ntaking place in my country. My Government is against\nneither democracy nor human rights. As a matter of fact,\nwe are taking necessary steps towards the establishment of\na democratic nation.\nWe have a vision of establishing a modern, peaceful\nand developed democratic State. In order to bring this\nvision into reality, we are reconsolidating national unity as\nthe number one priority. Necessary foundations are being\nlaid for the emergence of a nation where a disciplined and\nmulti-party democratic system fully functions and justice,\nliberty and equality prevail.\nWe fully subscribe to the human rights norms\nenshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nHere, I wish to underscore that the Government does not\ncondone any violations of human rights, and the type of\ndemocracy we envision will guarantee the protection and\npromotion of human rights, particularly the right to the\nsatisfaction of basic human needs such as clothing, food\nand shelter. If there is an imperative need for\nimprovement in areas of human rights, we are willing and\nready to receive sensible suggestions and take whatever\naction we possibly can.\nFor instance, in the middle of this year, we received\na delegation from the International Committee of the Red\nCross (ICRC) and made detailed arrangements for them\nto visit the prisons in Myanmar, as a confidence-building\nmeasure and to enable them to interview the inmates in\naccordance with ICRC standard procedures. As a result of\nthe full cooperation we extended to the ICRC delegation,\nthose visits were successful and productive, enabling both\nsides to build mutual trust and goodwill. I consider it\npertinent to state here that the ICRC delegation expressed\ntheir satisfaction with the overall situation regarding the\nrelationship between the prison authorities and the\ninmates.\nAlso, in August this year, Mr. Chris Sidoti, the\nAustralian Human Rights Commissioner, visited Myanmar\nand held discussions with the authorities concerned,\nincluding myself, on the possibility of establishing a\nnational human rights institution in Myanmar exchanges\nof views on cooperation between the two countries on\nhuman rights matters. As a result of this visit, we were\nable to identify certain areas of cooperation between the\ntwo countries.\nIn conformity with our consistent policy of\nestablishing friendly and amicable relations with all\ncountries, we accepted the proposal for the visit of the\nTroika mission from the European Union to Myanmar in\nJuly this year. The mission was a fact-finding one, and\nboth sides expressed their satisfaction with the result. It\nis our hope that this mission will further strengthen our\nrelations with the European Union and pave the way for\nenhancing our contacts and dialogue with it towards a\nmore meaningful and substantive level in the future.\nSimilarly, we would also like to seek better relations with\nthe United States of America. Furthermore, I would like\nto confirm our willingness to receive Mr. Alvaro de Soto,\nthe Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral for Myanmar, to visit my country in the near\nfuture.\nMyanmar is a multi-ethnic society where many\nnational races with different and diverse cultural and\nsocial backgrounds reside together. In addition, primarily\n37\n\n\nbecause of the \u201cdivide and rule\u201d policy under colonial rule,\nunity between the national races broke down and, as a\nresult, armed insurrections broke out all over the country.\nFor these reasons, the present Government came to the\nconclusion that racial harmony was imperative and that, in\nits absence, various issues would continue to hamper\nnational development endeavours. This rationale led the\nGovernment to make peace overtures to the armed groups\nand establish peace with them.\nIn order to restore trust and confidence between the\nnational races, the Government has even allowed the ethnic\narmed groups to hold on to their weapons until a\ndemocratic government is formally established under the\nnew constitution we are drafting now. This is a reflection\nof our trust in our national brethren. At the same time, the\nGovernment has launched an ambitious plan for the\ndevelopment of border areas and the national races there.\nDespite its meagre financial resources, the Government has\nspent over 15 billion kyats on the plan. At present, the\nnational races are actively working together with the\nGovernment in their regional development efforts. This\nconscious and willing involvement in national development\ntasks as equal partners has nurtured the Union spirit and\nsense of togetherness. With 17 armed groups in the legal\nfold, peace is holding the entire length and breadth of the\ncountry.\nAs far as the question of national unity is concerned,\nthis is the first ever concrete result achieved, and it is\nunprecedented in the number of armed groups involved and\nthe extent of peace established. This is a result we achieved\nthrough sincere, genuine and open dialogue between the\nGovernment and ethnic armed groups where we first built\nconfidence and then convinced each other of our respective\nobjectives. The Government is open to such a dialogue with\nany remaining groups, including the Karen National Union\n(KNU), where we could build confidence and identify\ncommon ground in the sole interest of the country and its\npeople. In this regard, I wish to reiterate that the\nGovernment's offer of peace to the KNU still stands.\nAs a matter of fact, the same dialogue is going on in\nthe national convention process, where representatives of\nnational races, political parties and delegates representing\nall strata of life are actively involved in drafting a new\nconstitution to lay a solid foundation for a new democratic\npolitical system. The national convention has been a\nsuccessful process whereby we have agreed on the basic\nprinciples that will govern the future life of the country and\nwill allow self-administered zones for certain national\ngroups.\nAt this juncture, we are in the painful and arduous\nprocess of building a consensus on power-sharing, which\nis an extremely sensitive issue for all parties concerned.\nIn view of the delicate nature of this sensitive question,\nit is vitally important for us to proceed systematically,\nand with the greatest caution possible, to safeguard the\ninterests of all the national races and not to repeat the\nshortcomings of the previous two constitutions.\nWe firmly believe that there is no better alternative\nto the current national convention process if we genuinely\nwish to transform the country into a peaceful, modern,\ndeveloped, and democratic State. It is therefore essential\nfor us to complete the national convention process.\nIn this connection, it is our ardent hope that the\ninternational community will be supportive of our sincere\nefforts and appreciative of the positive achievements we\nhave made thus far for the development of the country.\nMyanmar is very often portrayed from outside as if\nvast violations of human rights are taking place, forced\nlabour is rampant, a free flow of narcotics exists and\neconomic and social conditions are in chaos. These\nportrayals are in contradiction to the true situation. Let\nme cite here a widely known teaching of the Lord\nBuddha called \u201cKalama Sutta\u201d. The Sutta says:\n\u201cOh, Ye Kalamas, do not be led by whatever\nyou are told; do not be led by whatever has been\nhanded down from the past generation; do not be led\nby hearsay or common opinion; do not be led by\nwhatever the scriptures say; do not be led by mere\nlogic; do not be led by mere deduction or inference;\ndo not be led by considering outward appearance; do\nnot be led by theory reflected as approval; do not be\nled by whatever a believable one says; and do not be\nled by what your teacher tells you is so\u201d.\nIn short, Lord Buddha taught us to accept and practice\nonly when we ourselves know which is wrong and which\nis right.\nEveryone who visits Myanmar can see the greenness\nof the country, peace and tranquillity prevailing\nthroughout the nation, people leading their normal daily\nlives with happiness and pleasure and building their\nnation with zest and zeal. The people have full knowledge\nthat they are on the right path to peace and prosperity. I\nwould like to invite all of you to come and see for\nyourselves. Seeing is believing!\n38\n\n\nOur nation is still in the process of building; solid\nfoundations are being laid, and infrastructure is being\nimproved throughout the country. The Government and the\npeople fully understand where we were, where we are now\nand in which direction we are moving. We think of\nourselves as builders, carpenters and plumbers building a\nhouse not to enjoy ourselves, but for all the people, who\nare its rightful owners. When the building is finished,\nfurnished, furbished and fine-touched, it will be handed\nover to them. The people will decide who will manage the\nhouse.\nThere are some Myanmar youths who abandoned our\nland and took refuge elsewhere. I should like to take this\nopportunity to send them a message from this podium that\nthey will be welcomed with open arms if they return home,\nand I would like to invite them to join us in building the\nnation. Our future is in our hands. If we work together, we\nwill reach our goal sooner rather than later.\nReligious harmony and freedom are our shared\ntradition. Our previous two Constitutions provided for\nsafeguards against religious discrimination and religious\nintolerance. Similarly, the fundamental principles we have\nagreed on in the national convention process guarantee\nreligious indiscrimination and religious tolerance. Although\nMyanmar is a predominantly Buddhist country, with nearly\n90 per cent of the population professing Buddhism, the\nGovernment attaches great importance to harmonious\nrelations among the major religions existing in the country.\nAccordingly, the Government has taken all necessary steps\nto encourage the prevailing harmony among the religions\nthrough continuous contacts with the respective religious\nleaderships and the provision of necessary assistance in\nboth financial and material terms to enable them to promote\ntheir faiths effectively. I want to state here that there is\nfreedom of religion for all faiths in the country. It is also\nworth recalling here that a few years ago Madam Ogata, the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, remarked\nin her capacity as Independent Expert of the Commission\non Human Rights, that Myanmar was a model society as far\nas religious tolerance was concerned. Though these remarks\nwere made some time ago, I wish to stress that they remain\nvalid and true to this day, and that the Government is\ndetermined to safeguard to the best of its ability all the\nreligions of the country against intolerance, and to help\nthem in all possible ways to coexist harmoniously with each\nother.\nI cannot conclude without mentioning what my\ncountry is achieving on the economic front. Despite some\nslowdown in economic growth due to the Asian financial\ncrisis, Myanmar has enjoyed considerable economic\ngrowth in recent years. The emphasis of the Government\nis to promote private sector development and\nprivatization. At the same time, the Government is\nfocusing its endeavours on the development of the\ninfrastructure as a precondition for sustained development.\nMoreover, the Government is carrying out an extensive\nprogramme of land reclamation in wet and virgin lands by\ngranting large land holdings to the private companies. The\nprivate sector has been able to reclaim and develop 1.1\nmillion acres of fallow land and wetlands for agricultural\nproduction, which will not only help domestic food\nsupply but will also contribute to regional food security.\nWe have a vision for the new millennium, a vision\nof building a peaceful, modern, developed and democratic\nsociety. We will endeavour to realize our vision with\nwhatever resources we have at our disposal. The\nrealization of this goal could be accelerated if we receive\nthe support of the international community. We are\noptimistic that we will be able to achieve our vision, and\nthat the international community will demonstrate\nunderstanding and appreciation of our sincere efforts to\nuplift the economic and social well-being of the people of\nMyanmar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "We are fortunate that the great\nskills and integrity displayed by His Excellency Mr. Theo-\nBen Gurirab, both as freedom fighter and as Foreign\nMinister of Namibia, will now be at the disposal of the\nGeneral Assembly. We desperately need those qualities as\nwe wrestle with the challenges that now face our\nOrganization.\nWe are enriched by the presence of our three new\nMembers, the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru\nand the Kingdom of Tonga.\nWe look forward to the coming millennium with\ngreat expectations born out of the many great\naccomplishments of this century, not least of which has\nbeen the creation and preservation of the United Nations.\nBut we would be deceiving ourselves if we did not\nrecognize that the world of peace and security envisioned\nby the drafters of the Charter is as far from achievement\nas it was at the beginning of this tormented century.\nThis has indeed been a century of extremes. We\nhave witnessed marvelous scientific and technological\nadvances that could liberate humankind from the drudgery\nand misery that have always been its lot. At the same\ntime, we have seen more billions spent on means of\ndestruction than on the construction of a better life for the\nbillions who still live in poverty.\nWe have witnessed the spread of democracy around\nthe globe, even as inequality between and within nations\ngrows unabated and countless millions of lives are\nwasted. All too apparent are the tragic victims of the\ninvisible hand of the market.\nHow much has inequality grown during this century?\nThe 1999 Human Development Report of the United\n\n\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) tells us that the\nincome gap between the fifth of the world's people living\nin the richest countries and the fifth living in the poorest\nwas 11 to 1 in 1913. This had grown to 30 to 1 by 1960,\n60 to 1 in 1990, and 74 to 1 in 1997. The report concludes\nin its \u201cOverview\u201d, at page 2, that\n\u201cWhen the market goes too far in dominating\nsocial and political outcomes, the opportunities and\nrewards of globalization spread unequally and\ninequitably \u2014 concentrating power and wealth in a\nselect group of people, nations and corporations,\nmarginalizing the others.\u201d\nThe solution, it posits, is not to stop the expansion of\nglobal markets, but to create and enforce the rules for\nstronger governance, both national and global, to ensure\nthat globalization works for people, not just for profits. This\ncrying need for good global governance is not being\nanswered, and it is one of the most important and\nfundamental tasks facing the United Nations today.\nDuring this century there have been two concerted\nattempts to collectively provide the framework for a new\nworld order, following periods of catastrophic human\nbehaviour. After the First World War the Versailles Treaty\nand the Paris Conference created the League of Nations, the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) and certain\neconomic arrangements. After the Second World War we\nhad the United Nations and the Bretton Woods agreements,\nwhich again created new institutional arrangements for\nregulating a new world order. One of the results of that\nreordering was the ushering in of the era of decolonization,\nwhereby dozens of countries have emerged and formed part\nof the family of nations, bringing our number in the United\nNations up to 188.\nToday we have witnessed a real change in the world\norder no less far-reaching and momentous than the first\ntwo, with the end of the cold war, the creation of a unipolar\nworld and the phenomena of globalization and trade\nliberalization. And still we have not been able to sit\ntogether and negotiate universally accepted rules and\ninstitutions that are workable and fair for regulating this\nnew order. How can we speak of the victory of democracy\nin this situation?\nThe institutions that, more than national governments,\ngovern the real lives of billions today \u2014 the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the G-7, the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO) \u2014 are\ndominated by a few rich and powerful countries, and\nthere is no transparency, no accountability, no effective\nmechanism for civil society participation. In short, there\nis no good governance.\nWe, the developing countries, are constantly being\nurged by the international organizations, by the European\nUnion and others, to practise good governance, and are\nthreatened with sanctions if we do not. For our part, we\nin Belize and other developing countries accept the need\nfor good governance and are doing our utmost to achieve\nit. It is time we ensured that these all-powerful\norganizations themselves practise good governance, abide\nby a global code of ethics that puts people before profits,\nrespect the diversity of our countries and be fully\naccountable and transparent.\nWhile we have made important advances in\nenlarging democracy at the national level, we have failed\nto do so at the global level. Our only hope lies with a\nreformed United Nations that will ensure that the global\ninstitutions that determine the quality of our lives are\nmade democratic and just.\nSmall countries like Belize are understandably\nconcerned about the way in which globalization and trade\nliberalization are being mismanaged. Yes, we believe in\nthe potential benefits of globalization. Yes, we want to be\ninvolved, but as partners, not as victims of larger, more\npowerful economic interests.\nBelize became independent just 18 years ago. It has\nbeen said that we became independent just when\nindependence ceased to be meaningful as a result of the\npower of international organizations and transnational\ncompanies to determine not just international, but also\nnational economic and social policies.\nLet me say this clearly: do not expect any of us who\nwon our independence after years of struggle \u2014 some\ninvolving armed conflict and the sacrifice of many\nlives \u2014 to simply give it up and accept a new form of\ndomination. But what does it mean, especially for small\ndeveloping countries, to be independent in today's world?\nIt means that we must find a way to make\ninterdependence make independence meaningful.\nThis can best be done through effective regional\norganizations. In our own region, our vision is to work\ntowards a real integration of the Central American and\nCaribbean countries, to make the Association of\nCaribbean States the means of inserting our countries into\n2\n\n\nthe world economy with a stronger voice to secure fair\nterms of trade, greater market access and more beneficial\ninvestments.\nThe much vaunted new financial architecture that we\nseek to construct must be designed to enhance the\nindependence of sovereign States. We can only do this\nthrough negotiated agreements that are fair, transparent and\nconsensual and in which developing countries are given a\nreal voice.\nWe are heartened by the words of Mike Moore,\nDirector-General of the WTO, who told us, members of the\nGroup of 77, at Marrakesh that he is totally committed to\nensuring that the WTO be a family in which every member\nhas an equal place at the table and that trade liberalization\nbring real benefits to all countries, but especially to\ndeveloping countries.\nWe, the smaller and developing countries, must be the\nbeneficiaries of unselfish actions on the part of our\ndeveloped partners. We are aware that free trade can be\nkind to the strong and deadly to the weak, and so our call\nis this: Give us time to adjust and move our economies\nforward. Help us to develop our capacities and technologies\nto make our people competitive. We are challenged to\nnarrow the gap between those who earn billions and those\nwho work for pennies.\nIf we are to be successful at this, everyone must be\nincluded. Our political ideologies and differences will have\nto be put aside in the interest of the elimination of poverty.\nBut none of this is possible if we do not face up to meeting\nthe first objective of our institution: the achievement of\nworld peace and security.\nTrue, since the inception of our Organization there has\nnot been another world war, but local and regional conflicts\nhave taken a more vicious toll than the two world wars\ncombined. If we are to prevent these human tragedies, we\nwill have to move, in the words of our Secretary-General,\nfrom a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention:\npreventive diplomacy, preventive disarmament, preventive\ndeployment.\nIf only we had followed these prescriptions in East\nTimor, we could have prevented the large-scale massacres\nand destruction that were visited on an entire people in the\npresence of our United Nations Mission, which had assured\nthem that they could exercise their right to\nself-determination in peace and security. None of us can\nfeel comfortable with the fact that although international\nagencies in the field had warned of the impending\nmassacre for months, nothing was done to prevent it. We\nstill have the task of ensuring that the people of East\nTimor can live in peace and enjoy the benefits of their\ncourageous decision to be independent, and Belize\npledges its unconditional support for any measures taken\nby our Organization to this end.\nWe do not fail to recognize and applaud the\ntremendous success of the United Nations in the\neradication of colonialism and occupation. How could we\nfail to do so, when the very existence of Belize as an\nindependent State is due in no small part to the support of\nthe United Nations? How could we fail to do so, when we\nrecall the role of the United Nations in the independence\nof Namibia, whose Foreign Minister presides over our\nAssembly, or when we recall the work of the Fourth\nCommittee in brokering the independence of so many of\nour present members? But the job is not over till it is\nover, not until all peoples of the world are guaranteed\ntheir right to self-determination and independence in\npeace and security. In this context, we look forward to\nwelcoming Palestine as a full Member of the United\nNations at the millennium summit and to achieving peace\nand security for all the peoples of that region.\nAs we leave this century of unparalleled suffering\nand violence, we look forward to creating a better world\nin the next. None of us can dare predict what awaits us.\nOn the other hand, we must all commit ourselves to try\nto shape the future in ways that redound to the benefit of\nall human beings regardless of race, colour, sex,\nnationality, class, religion or political opinions.\nWe will not succeed in this if we do not succeed in\neradicating poverty. Poverty, in the words of the President\nof the World Bank, is much more than a matter of\nincome alone: the poor seek the sense of well-being\nwhich comes from peace of mind, from good health,\ncommunity and safety, from choice and freedom as well\nas a steady source of income.\nA necessary condition for the elimination of all\nforms of poverty is the creation of fair rules for trade and\ninvestment. As my Deputy Prime Minister said at the\ntwenty-second special session, just recently concluded, the\nSeattle Round of negotiations must be characterized by a\nwillingness to implement the necessary reforms to\nameliorate the negative impact of the post-Uruguay\narrangements. We \u2014 the small, vulnerable, disadvantaged\nStates \u2014 must benefit from trade liberalization along with\nour developed partners.\n3\n\n\nThose partners, however, must live up to the\ncommitments they have made to the world over the past\ndecades: it is scandalous that not only has the promise of\ndedicating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to\ndevelopment assistance not been met, we are getting further\nfrom this goal every day, with barely 0.2 per cent of gross\ndomestic product now being so dedicated.\nEffective solidarity between the haves and the have\nnots is an essential part of the solution to the problems of\nmarginalization and poverty. That is why we commend the\nactions of the Republic of China on Taiwan, which has not\nbeen reluctant to help less well-endowed countries. Taiwan\nis a good friend of Belize, and I would like to express here\nour deep condolences to the people of Taiwan for the tragic\nconsequences of the earthquake that struck recently. It is\nour hope that the United Nations will be able to embrace\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan in the family of nations,\nas part of a peaceful and just solution to the China\nquestion, one that respects the aspirations and rights of all\nChinese people.\nI would like to endorse the support of our Secretary-\nGeneral for the concept of individual sovereignty in the\nsense of the right of every individual to control his or her\nown destiny. This, of course, presupposes a democratic\nworld, one in which people have the right to participate in\ndecisions that shape their lives. Indeed, such participation\ndefines the very existence of people; I participate, therefore\nI am. But it is tantamount to putting Descartes before the\nhorse if we do not recognize that people cannot participate\neffectively if they do not have access to education, to\nknowledge, to information. My Government has made the\nprovision of such access its number one priority, and I urge\nthe international community to focus its resources on\nassisting developing countries to empower their peoples\nthrough human-resource development programmes.\nWe have squandered billions of dollars and millions of\nlives in the real or imagined defence of State sovereignty;\nlet us now resolve to dedicate our resources to education,\nthe sine qua non for the realization of personal sovereignty.\nWe all want a better, more just, more peaceful and secure\nworld, and to achieve this we must have a world free of the\nculture of violence and instant gratification, from the\nscourge of drug-trafficking: we need a world of tolerance\nand solidarity. None of this is possible without education.\nPeople everywhere, but especially in the\nunderdeveloped countries, are asking what there is to\ncelebrate as we enter the new millennium. The least we can\ndo, the least we owe our people, is tell them the truth and\nface the reality together. Let us not pretend that the future\nis bright and untroubled, or that we have the answers to\nall the problems that plague humanity. Let us instead\nresolve to work together to harness the power of\ntechnology, of science, of the marketplace, so that they\nact for instead of against humanity.\nOther speakers before me have called for a new\ncentury of human development, for the creation of a new\nglobal human order. This dream can become reality when,\nat last, the powerful agree to sit down with the rest of us\nas equals and together design the political, economic and\nsocial architecture that will ensure global prosperity along\nwith global justice. Only then will the world live in peace\nand proclaim, in the words of the prophet Isaiah:\n\u201cAnd he shall judge among the nations, and\nshall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their\nswords into plowshares, and their spears into\npruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against\nnation, neither shall they learn war any more.\u201d (The\nHoly Bible, Isaiah 2:4)\nAmen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I extend my sincere and\nwarm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\n4\n\n\nsession. It is indeed gratifying to see a distinguished\nstatesman and son of Africa lead the Assembly, especially\none whose country was born out of the crusade of the\nUnited Nations for the freedom of colonial peoples. Your\npersonal devotion and commitment to the liberation struggle\nof the people of Namibia makes you eminently qualified to\nlead the United Nations in its search for peace. I am\nconfident that your experience, talent and energies will\nensure a successful outcome for the work of the session,\nand I assure you of my country's support in all your\nendeavours.\nI also pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Didier Opertti, for the excellent manner in which he\ndischarged his duties as President of the Assembly at its\nlast session.\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I extend my\ncountry's gratitude and support for his tireless efforts in the\ndaunting task of finding lasting solutions to problems that\nface our Organization. We particularly commend him for\nhis latest brave efforts in East Timor.\nPermit me also to express my delegation's profound\njoy at seeing three States join the ranks of the Members of\nthe United Nations. The addition of the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga\nto our Organization brings closer to fruition the hope of the\ninternational community to see the United Nations\ncomprising all the countries of the world. We say welcome\nto these new Members and extend to them a hand of\nfriendship.\nI also wish to express my satisfaction with the\nSecretary-General's trenchant report on the work of the\nOrganization. In particular, I concur with his analysis of the\nmoral dilemma that faces the United Nations when the\nSecurity Council is unable to act, because of a lack of\nconsensus, in the face of the most heinous human rights\nviolations. In those circumstances, and while conflicts\ncontinue unabated in different parts of the world, the\ncapacity of the international conflict-resolution machinery\nis put to a severe test. Perhaps no conflict has done this as\nintensely as the one in Kosovo.\nThe Kosovo crisis represented the very disturbing\ntrend towards the most serious violations of human rights\nin the form of ethnic cleansing and impunity. After the\nexperience of Bosnia, which is still so fresh in our minds,\nthe world could not be expected to sit back and take no\naction. It would indeed be a sad comment on the efficacy\nof the United Nations if the next millennium were to begin\nunder a cloud of tolerance of impunity in the face of\nacknowledged genocide and other gross violations of\nhuman rights. While it is recognized that the conflict was\nan internal matter of Serbia, the dilemma was whether the\nworld could sit idly by and watch a people being\nexterminated.\nThe more difficult question that Kosovo raises is the\none of the role of the Security Council in similar crises.\nThe Charter places responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security squarely in the hands of\nthe Security Council. That body must therefore discharge\nthis function with seriousness and firmness. It must resist\nthe temptation to view questions of international peace\nand security through the lenses of national fears and\npreoccupations. If it is paralyzed by parochial interests,\nthe temptation to take unilateral action increases. The\nbelated submission of the Kosovo issue to the jurisdiction\nof the Security Council is therefore very welcome, as is\nthe United Nations involvement through its civilian\nadministration.\nIn a similar vein is the tragedy that is East Timor,\nwhose denouement seems happily to be in sight. After\nmany years of inconclusive attempts to find a solution to\nthe problem of East Timor, the new Government in\nJakarta finally paved the way by allowing the people of\nthat sad country to exercise their right to choose. The\ncruel violence that was unleashed against them, however,\nwhen they did express their preference in unequivocal\nterms is a source of great dismay. We are grateful,\ntherefore, that an international peacekeeping force has\nnow entered the country and hope that it will bring the\nnightmare of the people of East Timor to an end. We call\non the Government of Indonesia to bring to book the\nperpetrators of violations of human rights. We look\nforward to welcoming East Timor in the councils of\nindependent States in accordance with the wishes of its\npeople.\nThe last decade of the twentieth century has been a\ntime of momentous changes in all parts of the world,\nparticularly in Africa, where for the first time\nunprecedented democratic changes and reforms have\ntransformed the political landscape across the continent.\nWe remain concerned, however, that the proliferation of\nconflicts in Africa has had a serious negative impact on\nour development capacities, as these conflicts have\nundermined efforts to improve the living conditions of our\npeoples and retarded progress towards Africa's economic,\nsocial and political transformation.\n5\n\n\nThe situation in Angola continues to be a source of\nconcern for the people of Africa in general and the\ncountries of southern Africa in particular. As UNITA\ncontinues to perfect its war machine and effort, the\nprospects for peace have become more elusive. The people\nof Angola have endured hardship for more than 40 years,\nwhen the years of the civil war are added to those of a very\nbrutal colonial war. There are millions of adults in that\ncountry who have never lived in a state of peace. Their\ncountry is richly endowed with resources, and yet these\nhave not been harnessed for combating the many evils\nfacing the country, but have, on the contrary, been used for\nprosecuting a war that has impoverished the people beyond\nmeasure.\nThe States of southern Africa will continue to search\nfor a solution to the Angolan crisis. In this regard, they\nexpect to receive the support of the international community\nin the form of intensified sanctions against UNITA and its\nleader, Mr. Savimbi, and increased humanitarian assistance\nfor the victims of the conflict.\nThe crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nhas equally been a source of concern for the countries of\nsouthern Africa since its inception, in view of its\nimplications for the security of the region as a whole.\nVarious efforts made under the auspices of the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), coordinated by\nPresident Chiluba of Zambia, in collaboration with the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the United Nations\nand other interested parties, have started to bear fruit with\nthe signing of a Ceasefire Agreement in Lusaka on 10 July\n1999 by the heads of State of Angola, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda and\nZimbabwe. The signing, finally, of this Agreement by the\nrepresentatives of the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy\nshould help to pave the way for a permanent and peaceful\nsolution.\nOn the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, we wish\nto commend the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nSecretary-General for his untiring efforts to find a durable\nsolution to the problem. We believe that the OAU\nFramework Agreement remains the only viable option for\nthe resolution of that unfortunate conflict. We, therefore,\nappeal to the two parties to the conflict to implement, as\nsoon as possible, the technical arrangements worked out by\nthe OAU, the United Nations, Algeria and the United\nStates.\nWe continue to support the United Nations efforts to\nhold a referendum to determine the true wishes of the\npeople of Western Sahara and once more appeal to the\nGovernment of Morocco to assist the process and ensure\nits success in accordance with the will of the Saharawi\npeople.\nIn Sierra Leone we welcome the ceasefire that has\nbeen arranged under the auspices of the President of\nTogo. However, the settlement raises some troubling\nquestions. It is difficult to accept that those who hold\ngrievances against a legitimately elected Government can\nshoot their way into power-sharing, especially when they\nhave been accused of the most chilling atrocities, as\noccurred in Sierra Leone. Certainly those who are\naggrieved have a right to challenge the governance of\ntheir Government, but this should be done within the\nlimits of constitutional order and propriety. In spite of\nthese reservations, we wish the people of Sierra Leone\nwell and will continue to support their efforts to establish\nlasting peace in their country.\nWe also wish to congratulate the countries of West\nAfrica under the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) for the\nsacrifices they have made to bring about peace in their\nneighbourhood.\nRegarding Palestine, all peace-loving people dream\nof the day when the permanent status negotiations will\ncommence and soon be followed by a permanent peace\nand a permanent State for the Palestinians. We therefore\nencourage the parties to the Middle East conflict to\npersevere in their quest for the attainment of the goal\nwhich has eluded them for so long.\nThe need to secure our global neighbourhood has\nnever been greater. Unfortunately, the threat of weapons\nof mass destruction continues to bedevil our hopes for a\npeaceful world, and there does not seem to be a global\ndetermination to eliminate these weapons. This is so\ndespite the fact that over the years this Assembly has\nadopted numerous resolutions on the issue of arms control\nand disarmament and in particular on the establishment of\nnuclear-weapon-free zones in different regions of the\nworld. Unless the United Nations of the future is able to\nmake significant progress in nuclear disarmament, it runs\nthe risk of losing credibility as an institution dedicated to\nthe pursuit of peace. The United Nations of the twenty-\nfirst century, therefore, should be one which can give\nhumankind hope for a world of diminished poverty and\nno threat of a nuclear war.\n6\n\n\nTomorrow, 24 September, marks the third anniversary\nof the opening for signature of the Comprehensive Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT). It has long been accepted that the future\ncredibility of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) will depend on the effective\nimplementation of the CTBT. Convinced of the need to\nenhance the institutional fabric of the CTBT, Lesotho\ndeposited its instrument of ratification of the CTBT with\nthe Secretary-General earlier this month, thus joining the\nsteadily increasing number of States that have so far ratified\nthe Convention. Lesotho supports the holding of the special\nconference on the CTBT, as envisaged under article 14 of\nthat Treaty, with a view to accelerating its ratification.\nIn the midst of all these conflict situations is the\ndramatic and unacceptable deterioration in the level of\nadherence to the norms of humanitarian law as opposite\nsides to a conflict indiscriminately and ruthlessly employ\nany and all means that might advance their ends. Civilian\npopulations have become the main targets and direct\nvictims of fighting between hostile armies, with women and\nchildren suffering disproportionately from atrocities that\ninclude rape, sexual exploitation, murder and the mutilation\nof civilians.\nThe plight of the victims of these heinous crimes\nunderscores the imperative for the creation of a new\njudicial body that would extend the rule of law in its\nbroadest conception. Following the overwhelming\nendorsement by 120 nations in Rome last summer of the\nidea to set up an International Criminal Court, the early\nestablishment of the Court is now a top priority. It is\ngratifying to see that just over a year since the conclusion\nof the Rome Treaty 86 States have reaffirmed their\ncommitment to the Court by signing the Treaty, while four\nhave already ratified it. My Government remains committed\nto the early establishment of the International Criminal\nCourt and has every intention to abide by the terms of the\nInternational Criminal Court Treaty and will ratify it soon.\nIn his report \u201cRenewing the United Nations: A\nProgramme for Reform\u201d, of 14 July 1997, the Secretary-\nGeneral proposed the holding of a Millennium Assembly\nwith a summit segment in the year 2000, at which heads of\nState and Government could \u201ccome together to articulate\ntheir vision of prospects and challenges for the new\nmillennium and agree on a process for fundamental review\nof the role of the United Nations.\u201d (A/51/950, para. 91)\nFor us in the developing world, the most crucial\nquestion facing the international community is how to\nbridge the huge gap between the haves and the have nots of\nthis world. Unless we redouble our efforts in this regard,\nour endeavours to curb such social ills as crime will be in\nvain. By the same token, illegal immigration in search of\nbetter living conditions elsewhere, which is the direct\nconsequence of economic inequalities, will continue to\nincrease. It behooves us all, therefore, to treat the problem\nof poverty with all the seriousness it deserves, and this\nfact must be reflected in the deliberations during the\nmillennium summit.\nThe Economic and Social Council deserves our\ncongratulations for highlighting the problem during both\nits high-level and operational activity segments this year.\nOf course, the problem of poverty has received United\nNations attention on several occasions, most prominently\nduring the social summit of 1995 in Copenhagen, when\nthe target of halving absolute poverty by the year 2015\nwas agreed. Nevertheless, the problem is still with us and\nthere are no signs that it is abating; hence the need to re-\ndedicate ourselves to that noble goal.\nAs is well known, Lesotho is one of the least-\ndeveloped countries. It is in recognition of that fact that\nwe are committing a considerable proportion of our\nmeagre resources to the war against poverty. Among\nother measures, we have decided to tackle educational\ndeficiency in the country, which is one of the main\ncontributors to poverty. In this regard, Government has\nbeen increasing the annual budget for education by 4 per\ncent in real terms, and this increase has had a significant\nimpact on the delivery of education and the attainment of\nan adult literacy rate of 70.5 per cent. Furthermore, the\nGovernment has recently announced its intention to\nintroduce free primary education beginning in the year\n2000.\nWhat we, however, find puzzling is the scepticism\nof some of our development partners regarding the\nsustainability of the programme. If its viability were a\ncause for concern, we would have expected expressions\nof support to ensure the success of such a worthy\ninitiative, which is in keeping with so many goals of\nglobal conferences for poverty eradication.\nThe rampant HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan\nAfrica is putting an unbearable strain on already fragile\nhealth systems, eroding the gains made in child survival\nand the achievement of better health. The combination of\nHIV/AIDS and malaria is closely associated with\nincreases in maternal mortality and the significant\nreduction in life expectancy in many African countries.\nWe commend the work of the United Nations system in\n7\n\n\nthis regard, and in particular the indication that the response\nof the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, in\npartnership with various bodies, including the private sector,\nis commensurate with the gravity of the situation. The\nassistance of the international community is required to\ncontinue these efforts.\nThe problem of external debt, which continues to be\na developmental problem for Africa, received considerable\nattention at the recent Cologne Summit of the G-8, and\npromising decisions were taken to relieve the debt of the\nhighly indebted poor countries. Lesotho appreciates the\nvarious initiatives to ameliorate the problem and in general\nsupports them, including the effort to find appropriate\nfinancing mechanisms for the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt Initiative. While Lesotho has successfully\nendeavoured to meet its international financial obligations\nand commitments, my Government is now faced with a\nheavy and unbearable burden of debt-servicing, which is\nconstraining our national development efforts. We therefore\ncall for a review of the Initiative, with a view to\nsubstantially relaxing the eligibility criteria so that debt-\nstressed countries like Lesotho may also benefit from it.\nThe recent sale of gold reserves by some countries has\nalready resulted in a substantial drop in the price of gold\nand the consequential closure of marginal gold mines in\nSouth Africa. The overall impact has been reduced\nemployment opportunities, not only in South Africa but also\nin neighbouring countries, such as Lesotho, which have\ntraditionally depended on employment in South African\ngold mines. Let us take care not to create an African\nemployment crisis so soon after the Asian financial crisis.\nIt is incumbent upon the international community to work\nwith affected countries to develop strategies for mitigating\nthe negative effects of whatever mechanisms are agreed for\nfinancing the HIPC Initiative.\nThe General Assembly decided at its fifty-second\nsession to hold an event in the year 2001 for the purpose of\naddressing, in a holistic manner, the question of financing\nfor development in both its national and international\naspects and in the context of globalization and\ninterdependence. We must face up to the fact that\ndevelopment is in crisis and that, unless we take bold\nmeasures to find resources for financing it, the future of\nmankind is bleak indeed. My delegation fully shares the\nview that through this process, which will also address\ndevelopment through the perspective of finance, the\ninternational community will be afforded a unique\nopportunity to start the new millennium with a momentous\npolitical gesture that demonstrates global solidarity for,\ninter alia, poverty eradication and the attainment of\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\nIt is in the interest of all countries to pursue\ndevelopment cooperation on the basis of genuine\npartnership and mutually beneficial arrangements. We\nremain convinced that the contemporary realities of\nglobalization and liberalization make it clear that capital\nflows from developed countries not only benefit\ndeveloping countries, but also combine in a dynamic\nprocess with the resources of developing countries in a\nmanner that brings benefits to both developing and\ndeveloped countries.\nWe also want to stress that every effort should be\nmade to narrow the gap between developing countries \u2014\nin particular, the least developed countries, such as\nLesotho \u2014 and the developed countries. In this regard,\nwe await with anticipation the outcome of the review next\nyear of the Plan of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries.\nIt is worth repeating that when we adopted the\nProgramme of Action at the United Nations International\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo in\nSeptember 1994, we were committing ourselves to the\nsupport of strategies aimed at enhancing the quality of life\nfor families and individuals through recognition of their\nrights to quality services. The Conference was indeed a\nturning point that marked a departure from the notion of\npopulation control to a human-rights-based approach in\naddressing our demographic concerns.\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\nrededicate itself to the principles of democracy, good\ngovernance, observance of human rights and the rule of\nlaw as the only way in which all of us can ensure a\nprosperous and lasting future for all our peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to address the\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session, and its President, Mr.\nTheo-Ben Gurirab. You may be assured, Sir, of my\nhighest respect, and may I extend to you my best wishes\nfor success in your efforts.\nThis fifty-fourth Assembly, the last before the year\n2000, inevitably gives us food for thought. On the one\nhand, it urges us to turn to the achievements and the\nmajor successes of which the United Nations can rightly\nbe proud. On the other hand, it urges us to rise to all the\nchallenges which the new millennium will not fail to put\nbefore us. May our debates here help establish peace and\nsecurity throughout the world, settle conflicts and develop\ninnovative solutions to the problems we will have to face.\nThe noble ideals which have guided the United\nNations over the years have neither become outdated nor\nlost their relevance. Peace in the world, combating\npoverty, defending human rights \u2014 this is a programme\nwhich is still in force and whose goals could not be more\nclear-cut. It is rather like the struggle of the mythical hero\nagainst the Hydra: he cuts off one head and nine more\ngrow in its place. Nevertheless, we cannot possibly give\nup the fight and we must not drop our guard, not if the\nworld we wish to build is a civilized one.\n8\n\n\n(spoke in English)\nThe fifty-fourth General Assembly of the United\nNations is being held at a time when the United Nations\nsystem has experienced a certain amount of strain and is\nfaced with important challenges. These have given rise to\nquestions about the effectiveness and the very relevance of\nthis body within the contemporary international system.\nThis scepticism ranges from concerns about the capability\nof the Organization to address regional conflicts and the\nneeds of the developing world, to concerns about budgetary\nmanagement problems. No doubt there is some basis for\neach of those concerns. Nevertheless, they should not\nundermine the fundamental importance of a truly global\nOrganization which over a period of decades has earned\nrespect around the world. Our ranks are constantly growing,\nand the United Nations continues to approach the goal of\ntruly worldwide representation.\nLet me take this opportunity to congratulate the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga upon their admission to United Nations\nmembership.\nThe reform process of the United Nations is under\nway, and my country, Latvia, fully supports it. After all,\nMember States are the ones that set the agenda of the\nOrganization, and it will be the quality and commitment of\neach State that will ultimately determine the success or\nfailure of our common efforts.\nSome of the negative feelings about the United\nNations stem from excessive expectations. One cannot view\nthe United Nations as a panacea, particularly where\ndecisions on long-lasting regional problems are concerned\nor when preventive actions on a regional level are long\noverdue. Yet even in those situations a modern United\nNations system is expected to seek earlier and more\neffective involvement than was the case in South-East\nEurope, East Timor or the Middle East. It must be stressed\nthat the painful refugee crisis of Kosovo could not possibly\nbe resolved without the direct involvement of the United\nNations and its institutions. But, sadly, the maximum\npotential of the United Nations cannot always be utilized\nbecause of prejudice, lack of political will or perceived\npolitical ambitions. Let us not forget that the costs of our\nreluctance to take action are extremely high: too often our\nreluctance results in the deaths of innocent people and is\nthe cause of wholesale destruction which may take years\nand decades to remedy.\nThe topical issues of cooperation, conflict\nprevention, non-proliferation, arms control and\ndisarmament, humanitarian questions, environmental\nprotection, poverty eradication and gender equality need\nto be addressed on a global scale. Without a doubt, the\nUnited Nations and its institutions must play an\nincreasingly important role in resolving these issues.\nSince the mandate of the United Nations is to serve\nhumanity, the United Nations should observe the principle\nof universality. The United Nations capacity for conflict\nprevention and preventive diplomacy is by no means\nexhausted and further attention should be paid to fostering\nthe observance of these preventive principles throughout\nthe world.\nEven as we speak here today, many people in this\nworld are suffering at the hands of terrorists or live under\nterrorist threat. Any instances of terrorism should be\nuniversally condemned, and steps must be taken to\nstrengthen the international response to this problem.\nFor the United Nations to become a truly modern\nOrganization, it must reflect the new realities of a\nchanged international context. Reform of the Security\nCouncil remains central to the revitalization programme\nof the United Nations and should reflect both the needs of\nthe international community and present-day realities. The\nacquisition or possession of nuclear weapons must no\nlonger be the basis for super-Power status, and the future\nmodel of the Council will have to reflect this reality. That\nmodel should also make the Council more open to the\nviews and contributions of smaller States and non-\npermanent members.\nHow does Latvia see its contribution to the new\nUnited Nations? My country is one of those nations that\ncould not be a part of the United Nations at its inception;\nbecause freedom of choice was forbidden our people\nwhen Latvia lost its independence in 1940, we have\nspecial respect for this principle today. We also reserve a\nspecial place in our hearts for the United Nations because\nit was the first international Organization which we joined\nafter the restoration of independence in 1991. It was a\nmoment of celebration, pride and even euphoria as justice\nprevailed and a long struggle to join the community of\nnations finally came to an end.\nBut our people quickly realized that we were now\nsetting out along a new road. After a 50-year delay,\nLatvia was faced with the task of becoming an equal,\nresponsible and contributing member of a new Europe\nand a new, globalized international community.\n9\n\n\nMembership in the United Nations was just the first\nstep along that road towards reasserting our national and\nour human rights. More importantly, we recognized our\nresponsibility to help other nations setting out on this path.\nYet, even at the very end of this century, we still\nencounter thinking which a priori denies the right of nations\nto choose their own destiny. Thankfully, such views are\nbecoming less and less acceptable as the years go by. For\nLatvia, as a free and sovereign nation, the last few years\nhave been a remarkably successful period of active\nintegration into the international community, of internal\nrestructuring, of wide-ranging reforms and societal\nregeneration. Fifty years of occupation have left us with a\nheavy social, economic and psychological legacy, but we\nhave made tremendous efforts to overcome this in every\nway. The support offered by the United Nations in this\nonerous task has been of enormous significance and I\nshould like to take this opportunity to reiterate the heartfelt\nappreciation of Latvia for the invaluable assistance provided\nby the United Nations.\nDuring this century Latvia has made a remarkable\nturnaround. It has gone from the depths of tragedy to the\nheights of success. In a few short years, Latvia has grown\ninto a politically stable State with strong democratic\ninstitutions and practices. Latvia has restored a thriving\nmarket economy and a deep respect for individual rights\nand freedoms. Over the past few years and with the help of\nthe international community, Latvia has attached particular\nimportance to the process of forming a fully integrated,\nharmonious society. It is a challenging but critically\nimportant task for my country, the more so because of the\nburdens imposed by our historical legacy. We perceive it as\nan ongoing process that involves many cultural and\neducational aspects and includes the important element of\nthe individual\u2019s right to choose. Our goal is to give each\nresident of our country an equal opportunity to contribute\nto a civic identity that shares common goals and values\nwith all Europe. As part of this programme, my country\nwill continue to attach particular importance to\nstrengthening the role of the Latvian language and\nincorporating minorities into the everyday affairs of the\ncountry.\nLatvia believes in complementarity between regional\nand global efforts. For Latvia, integration into Europe\nremains a high priority but it is not the end of the road.\nIntegration into the transatlantic security alliance would be\na prudent step but not a sufficient one. For Latvia to\nsucceed, and for the people of Latvia to have the full\nopportunity they deserve to live secure, healthy and\nprosperous lives, Latvia must be integrated into the\npolitical, business and intellectual exchange of the global\ncommunity.\nWe are very proud that on 10 February 1999 Latvia\nbecame the first Baltic State to join the World Trade\nOrganization as a full-fledged member.\nWithin the range of its capabilities, Latvia has\nparticipated in peace operations in the Balkans and has\ncontributed to relieving the suffering of Kosovo refugees.\nLatvia has been an active contributor to United\nNations revitalization through its membership in the\nEconomic and Social Council and the Commission on\nHuman Rights.\nLatvia has put forward its candidature for the\nSecurity Council elections in 2005. This spring my\ncountry signed the Statute of the International Criminal\nCourt and is currently planning the ratification process.\nA very visible indication of our appreciation of the\nwork of the United Nations and a concrete manifestation\nof Latvia\u2019s support for the Secretary General\u2019s\nprogramme for United Nations reform is our donation of\na historic, fully renovated building in the centre of our\ncapital as a shared home for all United Nations agencies\nin Latvia. On 16 July this year, and as one of my first\nofficial functions as President, I had the pleasure of\nparticipating in the official inauguration of the United\nNations House in Riga, one of the first United Nations\nHouses in Europe and the very first in our region.\nI should like to express my country\u2019s full support for\nthe proposed Millennium Assembly of 2000 and trust that\nit will become a landmark in setting our sights for the\ntwenty-first century.\nMay the results of the fifty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly advance our common cause at the\ndawn of the new millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of\nthe Chad delegation, and on my own behalf, I would like\nto extend warm congratulations to you, Mr. President, on\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-fourth session. This is both a tribute to your\ncountry, Namibia, for its contribution in defending the\nideals of our Organization and a recognition of your\nconsiderable ability. The delegation of Chad is firmly\nconvinced that your experience, talents and wisdom will\ncontribute to the success of our deliberations. We assure\nyou of our full support and cooperation in the\naccomplishment of your noble mission.\nI would also like to express our gratitude to your\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, who tactfully\nand adroitly led the work of the fifty-third session.\nAllow me also to praise the merits of our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the foresight, wisdom and,\nabove all, patience with which he is guiding the\nOrganization, as well as for his sustained efforts in\nseeking international peace and security, despite all kinds\nof difficulties and the immensity of his tasks.\nIn a few months we will enter the third millennium,\na millennium filled with uncertainties, fears and\nunknowns, but also one of hope. That millennium will be\ncharacterized by globalization and, above all, the\ndomination of human intelligence over nature. It will be\nan era of communications in which our planet will shrink\nto a tiny area. It will also mean the disappearance of\nbarriers to the circulation of ideas, knowledge, culture and\nscience. But it will also be an era of competition and\ncomplementarity.\nDuring this century, the aspirations of most peoples\nwas to be fed, clothed, cared for, educated, trained,\nhoused and gainfully employed. It is legitimate to hope\nthat with the arrival of the coming century these essential,\nbasic human needs will be met, so that we can avoid a\nfurther widening of the gap between wealthy and poor\ncountries.\nOn the eve of the third millennium, we must\nacknowledge that the lofty objectives of the United\nNations, primarily the maintenance of international peace\nand security and the reduction of poverty among Member\nStates, are far from being attained, although we have been\nfocusing on them for half a century.\nHow can we not ask ourselves these kinds of\nquestions at this great annual gathering, where the scope\nand urgency of political and economic problems are made\nso clear? It is time to contemplate solutions that include\n21\n\n\nnew kinds of relationships, based on solidarity and\npartnership, that go beyond the traditional relations of\ncooperation, which have proved their limitations.\nTurning more specifically to Chad, our major concern\nis to create conditions of peace and security through a fully\nparticipatory political process that involves the various\npolitical parties in the management of public affairs and in\nthe national reconciliation policy for all the people of Chad.\nThe involvement in this approach of all segments of society\nhas enabled our country to restore political stability and\ncivil peace and to establish constitutional and democratic\ninstitutions.\nWe are firmly convinced that a democracy can be\neffective only when it is based on certain republican\nconcepts, primarily justice, the primacy of human rights and\nthe participation of local communities in the management\nof their own affairs. The recent establishment of the\nSupreme Court and the Constitutional Council speak to this\nmajor concern, as does that of the National Commission on\nHuman Rights, in operation since 1994. These efforts were\nacknowledged and led the United Nations Commission on\nHuman Rights last April to end its consideration of the\nhuman rights situation in Chad and consequently remove\nour country from the confidential procedural situation it had\nbeen in since March 1991.\nFinally, our Government has undertaken a\ndecentralization policy aimed at implementing the choice\nmade by the people of Chad, as reflected in the\nConstitution of 11 April 1996, through the establishment of\ndecentralized territorial communities and the gradual\ntransfer of authority.\nIn an effort to consolidate peace and reinforce social\ncohesion, the Government of Chad has focused on two\nquestions: the army and anti-personnel mines. With respect\nto the thorny problems relating to the army and security,\nour Government has undertaken to ensure professional\ntraining for demobilized former combatants in order to\nredeploy them to new jobs, to provide them support in\ndeveloping income-generating skills and to see to it that\ntheir basic needs are met.\nWith respect to security issues, we have set up a\ndemining programme that should contribute to increasing\nthe safety of the national territory, where approximately a\nmillion mines and an indeterminate amount of ammunition\nof all calibres remain buried, thereby helping to open up\nChad, especially the northern part of the country. The\npresence of these dangerous devices seriously impedes the\nmovement of goods and people and hence the\ndevelopment of the regions concerned.\nIn this regard, my country has signed and ratified the\nOttawa Convention and has set up national structures\nsupervised by the National High Commissioner for\nDemining in order effectively to combat these lethal\ndevices. The objectives of that programme focus, inter\nalia, on reducing the number of victims, making the main\nroads safer, promoting economic and social development\nand facilitating the return of displaced persons.\nThe implementation of this ambitious demining\nprogramme, whose dimensions extend beyond the borders\nof our country, cannot be done without the assistance of\nour partners and friends. That is why we wish to appeal\nonce again from this lofty rostrum to the solidarity of\nMember States of our Organization and to ask them to\nprovide us with assistance and cooperation.\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, the welfare of\nthe country's citizens remains the motivating force for\ngovernmental action in Chad. That action is based on the\nambitious reforms undertaken since 1995 and focuses\nprimarily on a modern and dynamic economy. In point of\nfact, following devaluation in 1994, Chad rejoined the\nBretton Woods institutions and on 23 April 1995 adopted\na structural adjustment programme for the medium term,\nwith resources provided by the International Monetary\nFund in the framework of its Enhanced Structural\nAdjustment Facility and by the World Bank in terms of\nstructural-adjustment credit, and with financial assistance\nfrom our usual partners \u2014 France, the European Union\nand the African Development Bank. Bold reforms have\nbeen undertaken that focus primarily on stabilizing public\nfinance, correcting external imbalances and ensuring\nsustainable growth. To this end we instituted an effective\npolicy to combat poverty.\nOur Government has drafted and adopted a new\nsustainable development programme focusing on three\nmajor challenges: economic and financial, social, and\npolitical and institutional. The goal is to create a climate\nof social stability through sustained structural reform and\nthrough fiscal, monetary and budgetary policies that will\ncontribute to a macro-economic consolidation and to\ncontrolling inflation.\nThis fight against poverty focuses on four strategic\npriority elements in the areas of health, education,\ninfrastructure and rural development. In this undertaking\nwe have received support from the international\n22\n\n\ncommunity at the fourth round table on Chad, held in\nGeneva on 21 and 22 October 1998, where some $1.12\nbillion was pledged.\nIn this regard, I wish to express our deepest gratitude\nto friendly countries and international financial\norganizations and institutions for their strong response to\nour appeal for international solidarity. The people of Chad\nwill never forget those commendable efforts. Following that\nround table, we organized two sectoral meetings, on health\nand on rural development. Meetings on infrastructure and\neducation will take place in the near future. We reiterate\nour appeal to all interested parties to participate actively in\nthese meetings, which will be held in N'Djamena in\nNovember and December 1999, respectively.\nOne cannot speak of Chad's economy today without\nreferring to the question of the exploitation of its oil\nresources. This is a key political, diplomatic and socio-\neconomic issue that has fueled heated discussions both\ninside and outside the country. In addition to its undeniable\neconomic importance, this project will contribute\nsignificantly to subregional integration because it establishes\na partnership between two brotherly countries, namely\nCameroon and Chad.\nIn this respect, we have taken into account the\ndevelopment difficulties that Chad is facing, and we are\nconsidering our future in terms of petroleum-related issues\nwith a great deal of caution. The Government and the\nParliament of Chad have already set up management and\ndistribution mechanisms for the anticipated oil income. For\nthe first time ever in the history of the exploitation of oil\ndeposits, legislation has been enacted to guarantee\ntransparency in the management of oil revenue and also to\nset aside some of that income for territorial communities in\nthe oil-producing regions and for future generations. The oil\nactivity is an exceptional opportunity, which should\ncontribute to the gradual rebalancing of our budget and give\nus room for manoeuvre to establish a true policy for\ndevelopment. This project has rightly raised hopes\nthroughout the country.\nWe are all firmly convinced that new efforts and many\nsacrifices are required to ensure the gradual implementation\nof the purposes and principles enshrined in the United\nNations Charter as they relate to disputes between a\nconsiderable number of Member States as well as to other\nequally challenging evils that continue to trouble the human\nconscience. How can we remain indifferent when\nconfronted with the scourges of poverty, illiteracy, foreign\naggression, conflict, various pandemics and transnational\nproblems associated with the degradation of the\nenvironment and drug trafficking? Unfortunately, these\nchallenges will further increase with globalization, which\nis now inevitable. Africa is the continent that has been\nmost exposed to those evils, and the growing number of\ncrises is causing our efforts to be spread too thinly and\nreducing the meagre resources available and dividing our\ncountries.\nThe interdependence of peace and socio-economic\ndevelopment needs no further proof, especially in Chad,\nwhich has experienced the torments of war, its disastrous\neffects on the population and its repercussions on social\nand economic life. Out of a sense of duty and\ninternational obligation, my country has made and will\ncontinue to make enormous sacrifices for other African\ncountries that have fallen victim to the problems inherent\nin coexistence. That is why we have participated in\nvarious peacekeeping operations in the subregion of\nCentral Africa. In this context, I am pleased to recall\nOperation Turquoise, in which Chad participated to save\nlives in Rwanda. Chad also contributed to the Inter-\nAfrican Mission to Monitor the Implementation of the\nBangui Agreements and the United Nations Mission in\nthe Central African Republic, which sought a negotiated\nsolution between the Government of the Central African\nRepublic and a part of the rebel army, and which resulted\nin bringing together different viewpoints opinions and\nestablishing conditions required for the organization of\nmulti-party elections.\nIn that same spirit, my country intervened in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Our involvement,\ntogether with that of other countries, enabled the situation\nto be stabilized and promoted dialogue between the\nwarring parties. With the signing of the Syrte accords on\n18 April 1999, Chad withdrew its troops from the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The signing of the\nLusaka ceasefire agreement by all the parties in conflict\nhas opened up new prospects for that brotherly people.\nChad hopes that that agreement, which the Security\nCouncil has endorsed, will lead to a definitive peace in\nthat country and the entire Great Lakes region. Chad will\nsupport that process.\nThe tragedy in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo has not made us lose sight of the situation in the\nRepublic of the Congo, which was recently on the verge\nof breaking up. Now passion seems to be giving way to\nreason. We welcome the will shown by both the\nGovernment of Congo and the opposition parties, who\nhave taken the wise decision to negotiate to restore peace\n23\n\n\nto their country. Chad welcomes and encourages this\npositive development.\nTo this rather sombre picture we must add the fragile\nsituation in Angola, where the civil war has resumed\nthroughout the national territory. This is of great concern\nfor all of Africa, particularly since the resumption of\nhostilities will undoubtedly mean the failure of the\nconsiderable efforts made on all sides to bring peace to that\ncountry, which has been ravaged by a long war, thus\nprolonging the suffering of the Angolan people. We appeal\nto the Security Council to assist in restoring peace to that\nwounded country.\nWe welcome the tireless efforts of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States to bring peace and\nsecurity to West Africa. Those efforts have led to the\nsigning of the ceasefire agreements in Sierra Leone and\nGuinea-Bissau. All the parties involved in those crises\nshould show restraint and work towards reconciliation in\nthe higher interests of their peoples.\nWith regard to the Horn of Africa, we note that there\nhas been no obvious progress in the willingness of the\nparties involved in the conflict in Somalia to find a political\nsolution leading to national unity. While we welcome the\nefforts of Mr. Hosni Mubarak aimed at a negotiated\nresolution of the crisis, we also appeal to the Somali leaders\nto assist in restoring peace to their country. We regret the\nresumption of hostilities between the Ethiopians and\nEritreans, which has led to a considerable loss of life and\nmaterial damage. We urge all those who have mediated\nbetween the warring parties to persevere so as to put an end\nto those hostilities, which have further exacerbated an\nalready disturbing situation.\nCloser to home, Chad welcomes the decision of the\nSecurity Council to suspend the embargo against the Great\nSocialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We urge that the\nsanctions be lifted once and for all; they have seriously\ndamaged the interests of the brotherly people of that\nneighbouring country.\nOf all the continents, Africa seems to have suffered\nthe most from the economic crisis and from wars and other\nconflict situations. But we have not forgotten the major\nproblems that other peoples are facing.\nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, it has\nalready been established that the question of Palestine is at\nthe heart of the conflict. Its resolution lies in the\nimplementation of the Oslo accords and, in particular, in\nfull respect by all the parties for United Nations\nresolutions. The credibility of the Security Council is at\nstake. With the arrival of a new Israeli Government, there\nis new hope for the future. Chad encourages all the\nparties to work together in the same direction.\nElsewhere, the effects of the conflicts between Iraq\nand Kuwait and between Iraq and Iran persist, hampering\nthe final return to peace. We appeal to the sense of\nresponsibility of the former warring parties to work\ntirelessly to restore full peace.\nIn the Balkans, Chad encourages the efforts of the\ninternational community to restore peace to the region,\nand in particular to Kosovo. As for East Timor, we urge\nall the parties involved to complete the process begun\nunder the auspices of the United Nations so as to end the\nsuffering of the people there.\nIn Asia, Chad is concerned about the fate of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan and its 22 million\ninhabitants. The Republic of China on Taiwan, which\nplays a major role in world trade, is a peace-loving\ncountry that fulfils the obligations in the United Nations\nCharter, as it has shown on many occasions. Chad\nsupports the admission of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan to the United Nations as a means of correcting an\ninjustice.\nIt is well known that a number of conflicts stem\nfrom the unbridled arms race. In this regard, the\ncirculation, proliferation of and illicit trafficking in small\narms in Africa is of concern to us, particularly since this\nphenomenon, the result of the end of the cold war and\nnumerous conflicts in the continent, has taken a disturbing\nturn. If appropriate solutions are not found soon, peace,\nsecurity and stability in our countries will be constantly\nthreatened.\nTo address this situation, a conference on small arms\nand drug trafficking will take place in Chad under the\nauspices of the United Nations Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa; it\nwill be followed immediately by the twelfth ministerial\nmeeting of that Committee. Those two important meetings\nwill be held at Ndjamena from 25 to 30 October 1999.\nChad is honoured to act as host to the Committee and\nwill do everything in its power to ensure the success of\nits work.\nThe United Nations was founded in a historical\ncontext with which we are all familiar. It has been and\n24\n\n\nremains a place for bringing people and ideas closer\ntogether, and its very existence has helped avert more than\none catastrophe. But the international political and\neconomic environment has changed, and the great rivalry of\nthe cold war has disappeared, giving way to an international\nsystem that is still finding itself. We now see an increased\ndesire by Member States to participate in the management\nof international affairs in addition to the management of\ntheir own. United Nations structures must therefore be\nadapted to the new scope of today\u2019s problems, which\nrequires an equal sharing of international responsibilities;\nthese must no longer be the monopoly of a few States,\nhowever powerful they may be.\nTo respond to these concerns, the Security Council\nmust be reformed. Here, Chad wholeheartedly supports the\nposition of the Organization of African Unity that, inter\nalia, there must be equitable and legitimate representation\non the Security Council for the African continent.\nWith respect to the global economy and world trade,\nappropriate steps must be taken to ensure that the all States\nwill share equally in the benefits of globalization.\nGlobalization of the economy certainly can have the\nadvantage of eliminating all discriminatory and unfair\npractices in world trade, but it must be recognized that the\nlack of competitive power of the economies of the countries\nof the South does not enable them to benefit fully from\nthis. Moreover, the unbridled liberalization of markets and\nthe lack of measures to consolidate certain gains are\nweakening their economies and marginalizing them in the\nworld arena.\nSimilarly, the indebtedness of those countries places\na heavy burden on their meagre budgetary resources, and\nwipes out all their development efforts. I welcome the\nrecent decision taken by the Group of Seven at its summit\nheld at Cologne, Germany, to ease the debt of heavily\nindebted poor countries. Such initiatives are praiseworthy,\nbut they remain insufficient. Chad urges the wealthy\ncountries to make a greater effort to enable poor countries\nfinally to address the external-debt burden, which is a true\nobstacle to economic and social development.\n\n\n\n"

I am confident that your experience, diplomatic\nskills and political ability will contribute effectively and\npositively to the success of the session\u2019s proceedings.\nI should also like to express my thanks to your\npredecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay,\nMr. Didier Opertti, for the prudent manner in which he\ndirected the work of the previous session.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to express our\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\nhis efforts in strengthening the role of the United Nations\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\nWe welcome the admission of the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga to membership in the United Nations, which\nstrengthens its universality.\nAs this session convenes on the eve of the third\nmillennium, the international environment remains\nplagued by a multitude of problems and challenges, the\nmost salient of which are manifest in the ever-increasing\ngrowth of the phenomena of poverty, environmental\npollution, armed conflicts, ethnic and religious cleansing,\nthe race to acquire proscribed weapons, organized crime,\n34\n\n\ndrugs and international terrorism in its various forms and\nmanifestations.\nDealing with such global problems and phenomena\nrequires that all States adhere to the Charter of the United\nNations, respect international law and work on\nstrengthening the mechanisms for cooperation among\nnations, including the completion of the structural reforms\nin the United Nations, particularly in the Security Council\nand the Economic and Social Council.\nIn this connection, we express our appreciation for the\npositive role played by the specialized agencies and\norganizations of the United Nations in providing emergency\nhumanitarian and development assistance to the many\npeoples affected by the consequences of conflicts and by\nnatural and other disasters.\nThe course of political events and the wars that raged\nin the Arab Gulf region in the past two decades, as well as\ntheir political, economic and social implications, have more\nthan ever before reinforced the conviction of the members\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council of the importance of\nconsolidating the bonds of bilateral and multilateral\ncooperation between the States of the region and the other\nmembers of the international community. This must be\nbased on the principles of good neighbourliness,\nconfidence-building measures, peaceful coexistence, non-\nintervention in the internal affairs of countries, mutual\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States,\nrenunciation of the threat or use of force and the settlement\nof existing disputes through dialogue and peaceful means.\nIn addition regional and international cooperation and the\nstrengthening of national capabilities must be reinforced and\nencouraged, particularly in the fields of social, economic,\ncultural and human development.\nIt is this conviction that underlies the position of the\nmembers of the Gulf Cooperation Council in providing\nvarious forms of humanitarian and development assistance\nto the many countries of the third world that have been\naffected by wars, conflicts and natural disasters, the most\nrecent of which was the allocation of $400 million for\nfinancing reconstruction and development in the earthquake-\nstricken areas of Turkey.\nThe continued occupation by the Islamic Republic of\nIran of three United Arab Emirates islands, Greater Tunb,\nLesser Tunb and Abu Musa, for almost 29 years stands out\nin stark contrast not only to the clearly peaceful attitudes\nadopted by the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, but\nalso reveals the true intentions of Iran, which persists in\nviolating the territorial integrity of the United Arab\nEmirates. We had hoped that the Iranian political\ndiscourse on this issue would be translated into practical\nand positive steps in response to the peaceful initiatives\nof our Head of State, His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin\nSultan Al-Nahyan. Those initiatives, which had met with\nthe support and backing of all friendly and fraternal\nStates, called for either entering into serious bilateral\nnegotiations, with transparent intentions, or accepting the\nsubmission of the dispute to the International Court of\nJustice.\nWe had also welcomed the establishment of a three-\nmember ministerial committee by the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil to be charged with developing a mechanism for\nthe start of serious negotiations between the United Arab\nEmirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The underlying\nhope is that a peaceful, just and lasting settlement be\nreached, one that would bring to an end the Iranian\noccupation of our three islands.\nIt is truly regrettable that the consecutive Iranian\nGovernments, rather than dealing with our peaceful\ninitiatives in a spirit of responsibility and political will,\nhave deliberately resorted to a policy of escalation and\nprovocation. They have done so by carrying out naval and\naerial military manoeuvres, by establishing civilian and\nmilitary installations on our occupied islands, and by\nrelentlessly seeking to change their demographic, legal\nand historical characteristics. The aim is to consolidate\nthe Iranian occupation of these islands and to establish a\nfait accompli by force.\nSuch actions represent a direct threat to regional and\ninternational security and stability. We consider these\nIranian excesses null and void, with no legal validity or\nbasis in the rules of international law or in the Charter of\nthe United Nations or that of the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference. They are also inconsistent with the\ndocumented fact that, historically and legally, these three\nislands are an integral part of the territorial sovereignty of\nthe United Arab Emirates, regardless of the duration of\ntheir occupation.\nThe security of the Arab Gulf is the collective and\njoint responsibility of the States of the region. Therefore\nwe stress the importance of promoting a political and\ndiplomatic dialogue as well as cooperation between those\nStates and of channelling their wealth and human and\nnatural resources towards achieving the desired economic\nand social development for their peoples.\n35\n\n\nIn this context, we call upon the Iraqi Government to\ncomplete its implementation of the relevant resolutions of\nthe Security Council, in particular those relating to the fate,\nwhereabouts and release of Kuwaiti nationals and citizens\nof other countries who are detained or held as prisoners of\nwar by Iraq. This is in addition to the return of Kuwaiti\nproperty, documents and archives, an act that would\ncontribute to Iraq's resuming its natural role at the regional\nand international levels.\nThe inhumane conditions visited upon the Iraqi people\nmake it incumbent upon all of us to seek an early end to\ntheir suffering. We therefore call upon the Security Council,\nand in particular its permanent members, to reach consensus\non the draft projects before it that would lead to the full\nimplementation of all its resolutions and to lifting the\ninternational economic sanctions imposed on Iraq while\nemphasizing the importance of respect for its sovereignty\nand territorial integrity.\nProceeding from its belief in the need to achieve a just\nand comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on the\nprinciple of land for peace and on the relevant resolutions\nof the Security Council, the United Arab Emirates\nwelcomes the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum and the\npreliminary contacts between the Palestinian and Israeli\nsides regarding the final status negotiations, which are to\ndeal with the issues of Jerusalem, settlements, refugees and\nborders.\nWe attach great importance to the political\ndevelopments that will lead to the realization of the\nobjectives and aspirations on which the peace process is\nbased \u2014 namely, the achievement of a peaceful, just and\nlasting settlement of the question of Palestine and of the\nMiddle East problem. We call upon the Israeli Government\nto implement fully and scrupulously, and without further\ndelay or obstructions, all of the obligations and\ncommitments it has assumed within the framework of these\nagreements. I refer in particular to those relating to halting\nsettlement activities and policies in various parts of\noccupied Palestinian land and other occupied Arab\nterritories, including Jerusalem, and to the return of\nPalestinian refugees in accordance with the relevant\nresolutions of the international community and the Fourth\nGeneva Convention.\nIn applauding the positive role played by the United\nStates of America in reviving the peace process, we express\nthe hope that further efforts will be made by the co-\nsponsors of the process and by the members of the\nEuropean Union and other influential States to persuade the\nIsraeli Government to fulfil its historical, political and\nlegal obligations that are based on the principles of\ninternational law and the principle of land for peace. This\nwould restore to the Palestinian people their legitimate\nrights and would enable them to exercise self-\ndetermination and establish their own independent state in\nPalestine, with Jerusalem as its capital.\nWe also reiterate our full and unqualified support for\nthe position of Lebanon and demand that the Government\nof Israel implement Security Council resolution 425\n(1978). That resolution calls for the Israeli forces to\nwithdraw, without any preconditions, from southern\nLebanon and from the West Bekaa Valley, and to resume\nnegotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks at the\npoint where they were cut off. The aim is to ensure a\ncomplete Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Arab Golan\nHeights to the line of 4 June 1967, in accordance with\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nThe acquisition and possession of weapons of mass\ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons, are contrary to\nthe objectives and recommendations unanimously adopted\nby members of the international community at the 1995\nReview and Extension Conference of the Parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT). This not only contributes to the escalation of the\nproscribed arms race and the heightening of tensions, but\nalso disrupts the security balance at the regional and\ninternational levels.\nConsonant with its position that favours the\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones throughout\nthe world, the United Arab Emirates emphasizes the\nimportance and necessity of establishing a zone free from\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons,\nin the region of the Middle East and the Arabian Gulf. It\nrenews its call to the international community to exert\ngreater efforts, demanding that Israel accede to the NPT\nand place all of its nuclear facilities under the safeguards\nregime of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in\norder to ensure peace and security in the region and the\nattainment of the desired economic and social\ndevelopment.\nThe member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council\nfollowed with keen interest the recent developments in\nEast Timor and the pressures placed on the Republic of\nIndonesia despite its acceptance of the results of the\nreferendum in that territory. In this connection, we\nwelcome the positive stance of the Indonesian\nGovernment, especially its readiness to provide necessary\n36\n\n\nsupport for the peaceful transfer of authority in that\nterritory, in cooperation with the United Nations. We\ntherefore stress the importance of respecting the territorial\nintegrity of the Republic of Indonesia in order to restore\nsecurity and stability in that region.\nThe continuing state of conflict between our two\nfriends, India and Pakistan, over the question of Kashmir,\nis a source of profound concern to us because it constitutes\na direct threat to regional and global security and stability.\nWe therefore invite both Governments to exercise a policy\nof self-restraint and to resort to dialogue and peaceful\nnegotiations in settling their differences, in accordance with\nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the rules\nand regulations of international law and the provisions of\nthe recent Lahore accord. We also support all efforts\ndesigned to bring about peaceful resolutions of the conflicts\nin South-East Asia and the Korean peninsula.\nThe international community recently followed the\ndevelopments of the deplorable events to which the people\nof Kosovo, particularly the Muslims, were subjected. These\nevents included ethnic and religious cleansing, population\ndisplacements and other heinous crimes by Yugoslav and\nSerbian forces, in blatant violation of international\nhumanitarian law.\nThe United Arab Emirates, acting on high-level\ninstructions from an informed leadership, was one of the\nfirst countries to participate in the international relief\noperation. Our armed forces, together with the Red\nCrescent Society and other humanitarian organizations,\nprovided humanitarian, medical, food and development\nassistance to the people of Kosovo. In addition, military\ntroops from the Emirates participated in the United Nations\npeacekeeping operation in Kosovo, helping to ensure the\nreturn of the refugees to their homes and land, maintain\ninternal security and initiate and develop vital projects such\nas schools, roads and hospitals. It is essential for\ninternational efforts to continue in order to provide the\npeople of Kosovo with security and humanitarian\nguarantees and enable them to achieve their legitimate\naspirations. It is also in the interest of establishing peace\nand security in the Balkans.\nDespite the positive initiatives by the United Nations,\nparticularly the Security Council, and by the Organization\nof African Unity to contain conflicts, resolve the internal\nand regional security problems which plague certain States\nin Africa and promote national reconciliation between the\nvarious political factions, conditions there remain,\nregrettably unstable. We therefore call upon the States\nconcerned to assume their historic and political\nresponsibilities and resolve their problems by peaceful\nmeans so as to enable the peoples of Africa to achieve\ntheir aspirations for peace and sustainable development.\nIn this context, we should like to reiterate that the\nsanctions imposed on Libya must be lifted now that it has\nimplemented the Security Council resolutions in respect\nof the Lockerbie issue.\nNotwithstanding the relatively positive changes in\ninternational economic relations, the liberalization of\nworld trade and multilateral cooperation in the fields of\ndevelopment, finance and trade, the economic and social\ngap between developed and developing countries is still\nwidening. The consequences of the financial crises in the\ncountries of South-East Asia and elsewhere continue to be\nfelt: they have contributed to the decline in economic\ngrowth in many States. Dealing with these and other\nsimilar dysequilibria will require a comprehensive and\nobjective assessment of financial, investment, customs\ntariff and trade arrangements with a view to initiating\nNorth-South and South-South dialogue to promote\nmutually beneficial cooperation and coordination.\nIn this connection, the relevant international and\nregional development institutions have an important role\nto play in ensuring the stability of the world economic\nand financial order, a continued flow of development\nassistance from developed to developing countries and\ncancellation of the poorest countries debts. Cooperation at\nthe bilateral, regional and subregional levels is also a\npositive step towards stabilizing international economic\nrelations and, if carried out on the basis of\ncomplementarity, equality and justice, should enable the\ndeveloping countries to become effective participants and\nshould ensure regional and international security and\nstability.\nIn conclusion, we express the hope that the\npreparatory meetings for the Millennium Assembly in\n2000 will have a positive outcome, leading to the\nfulfilment of our countries\u2019 and peoples\u2019 aspirations for\npeace, security and sustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly; it is a sure\nguarantee of success for the fifty-fourth session. I also wish\nto thank your predecessor, Didier Opertti, the Foreign\nMinister of Uruguay, for his exemplary management of the\nAssembly's work during the past year.\nOn the many issues facing the General Assembly in\nthe year to come, Italy shares and supports the statement\nmade yesterday by the Foreign Minister of Finland\nspeaking on behalf of the European Union.\nThe last few years of this century have disproved the\nnotion that people and human freedoms take second place\nto State sovereignty. In Kosovo and East Timor a\ncoalition of States resorted to the use of force, but not for\nself-seeking national interests, not to defend their borders,\nnot to impose new hegemonies.\nThe end of the nuclear nightmare has coincided with\na rampant proliferation of local conflicts, terrorist acts and\ntraumatic economic and financial crises. Can the end of\ncommunism have given peace to former cold-war enemies\nand conflict to the rest of the world? The cold war\nbrought a precarious, imperfect peace. Was that preferable\nto the tragic series of conflicts that have embroiled\nhumanity over the past 10 years? The division of Europe\nhelped neutralize tensions throughout the planet. Does this\nmean that nuclear weapons brought about a period of\nunprecedented stability, and \u2014 as some have suggested,\nparadoxically \u2014 that we should award the Nobel Peace\nPrize to the bomb? The breakdown of the former\ninternational order has created a plethora of new States.\nDoes this mean that dividing the world in two was the\nonly way to grant common citizenship to peoples and\nreligious groups that have never learned the art of\npeaceful coexistence? The international community now\ntakes military action to deal with tragedies that only a few\nyears ago would have left us indifferent, and yet we are\nstill influenced by military assessments, strategic interests,\nregional solidarity, public opinion and the magnitude of\nany human rights violations. How can we act according\nto more precise rules, based primarily on the duty of\nStates to protect the rights of individuals?\nThe crises that have broken out in recent years have\nraised agonizing dilemmas and difficult questions that\ndemand answers. It would be wrong to use the\nimperfections of the international system as an excuse for\ninaction. But it would also be wrong to ignore the new\ndemands for certainty and the rule of law: the greatest\nchallenge is how to relate authority to law and lay down\ncodes of conduct and political discipline that reconcile\npower with legitimacy.\nAllow me to articulate a set of principles that could\nguide our action in the new century. First, we should\nenhance crisis prevention rather than conflict suppression.\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has rightly observed that\n19\n\n\nwe must eradicate the cultural and economic causes of\nconflicts and that a culture of conflict prevention must\nprevail over the culture of conflict suppression. We know\nwhat these causes of conflict are: the huge gap between the\nliving standards and incomes of different classes and\nnations; the exponential increase in mass migration from\npoor to rich countries; cultural difference and the conflicts\nand fanaticism it triggers; criminal acts for the sake of\nglorifying or even creating a nation. These are the four\nhorsemen of the contemporary Apocalypse.\nSecondly, we should use force only as a last resort.\nArms should be used to stop criminal behaviour only when\neconomic and political instruments are inapplicable or have\nfailed. Ten years ago, these same instruments brought down\ntotalitarian communism, which was a more formidable\nenemy than today's tyrants. In the Balkans and in East\nTimor, peacekeeping operations were launched to address\nserious, massive and systematic violations of human rights.\nThe decisions to intervene were made after repeated\ndemands that the culprits end a state of illegality; after an\nexhaustive and fruitless search for a diplomatic solution;\nand by a group of States rather than by a single Power.\nWe are living in an age of unfinished wars. In Iraq as\nin Serbia, authoritarian rulers have been seriously\nweakened, but they are still in power. How and how much\ncan sanctions be used to replace or complement the use of\nforce? Perhaps we need clearer international strategies and\nrules that pay heed to the most vulnerable members of\nsociety, to the political opposition and to the risk of\nstrengthening despots through sanctions. Our focus should\nbe more on incentives than on sanctions.\nThirdly, we need to define rules. No one knows the\nsize or shape of the next challenge. But our response must\nbe dictated by respect for universal principles rather than by\na balance of power. We must beware of conjuring up the\nspectre of international law as the law of the strongest. We\nmust beware of making some countries more equal than\nothers. To do so would run counter to our best political and\ncultural traditions, in which the law is meant to protect the\nweak.\nThe Western world and the Euro-Atlantic institutions\nare no threat to anyone's integrity, prosperity and freedom.\nBut we must perfect the instruments that uphold the\ninternational rule of law. We must spell out the duties of\nStates. We must create a fully fledged corpus of case law\non universal human rights. We must work out rules and\nprocedures that will justify the erosion of sovereignty in the\nname of global responsibility. This is why every country\nmust make it a priority to ratify the international\ninstruments for safeguarding human rights. I am thinking\nin particular of the International Criminal Court, which\nwas instituted in Rome in June of last year. These\ninstruments should be reflected in our national legislation\nand practice. Finally, we should encourage the\ninvolvement of our own institutions. It is in this spirit that\nwe have invited the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, to address the\nItalian Parliament.\nUntil human rights are firmly institutionalized,\ndoubts will remain over the relationship between\nlegitimacy and effectiveness. The gradual construction of\nuniversal citizenship is a learning process to which we all\nshould contribute. Otherwise we shall be racing towards\nfragmentation, seeking forms of independence that are not\neconomically viable and that are vulnerable to others'\ndesire for hegemony.\nFourthly, we must learn to appreciate the judgement\nof others. I would like to quote, in this respect, one of the\nfounding fathers of American democracy, James Madison.\nHe said:\n\u201cAn attention to the judgement of other nations\nis important to every government for two reasons.\nThe first one is that, independently of the merits of\nany particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on\nvarious accounts, that it should appear to other\nnations as the offspring of a wise and honourable\npolicy. The second is that, in doubtful cases,\nparticularly where the national councils may be\nwarped by some strong passion or momentary\ninterests, the presumed or known opinion of the\nimpartial world may be the best guides that can be\nfollowed.\u201d\nToday's world has acquired a new sensitivity. It will\nno longer tolerate the oppression of the weak. This\nimplies a rethinking of the principles of national\nsovereignty and non-interference that have governed the\ncommunity of nations for over three centuries, beginning\nin Europe. But we must avoid double standards, applying\none yardstick to friendly countries and another to those\nthat are not. This is what makes the ultimate sanction of\nthe United Nations so indispensable, since an international\nlegal standard cannot \u2014 except in exceptional temporary\nsituations \u2014 be the prerogative of any single group of\nStates.\n20\n\n\nWhen we defend the rights of others, we cannot\npretend that the lives of our own people are not also at risk.\nBy the same token, it would be inconsistent not to place the\nsame value on other human lives as we do on our own.\nEvery culture and tradition must be involved in the\ndefence of liberties and freedom. We cannot ignore the\nregional dimension of human rights, whose inviolable\nuniversal character can be enriched by the varieties of\nhistoric experiences. But stalemates and the paralysis of\nintersecting vetoes must be avoided by anchoring even the\nstrongest States to a system of rules and principles,\nbalancing their power against the effectiveness and strength\nof the international institutions.\nFifthly, we should strengthen the institutions. The\naftermath of the cold war has proved that large political and\neconomic groupings can more easily guarantee ethnic\ncoexistence, religious tolerance and economic advancement.\nThis should be kept in mind whenever pressure builds to\nrelease the genie of self-determination from the bottle of\nState sovereignty.\nOnly the great institutions, whether regional \u2014 such\nas the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance \u2014 or\nuniversal \u2014 such as the United Nations \u2014 can close the\ngap between democratic codification of laws and their\neffective enforcement. Unless we have a strong institutional\nnetwork, every peacekeeping operation could end up\nlooking as if we were taking the law into our own hands.\nEveryone would feel as if he should look out only for his\nown security, leading to a proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Therefore, let us resume the disarmament talks,\nas President Clinton proposed in his statement yesterday,\nand place our common security on more solid foundations.\nThere is one lesson to be learned from these years of\nturmoil: actions to prevent and repress the most serious\nviolations of human rights may take precedence over\nrespect for national sovereignty. No Government can hide\nbehind the shield of its own borders. Legitimacy demands\nthe redefinition of relations between States and the\ninternational community. It demands the reformulation of\nthe principle of non-interference, which has sometimes\nallowed States to neglect their duties towards their citizens.\nAlthough the United Nations is an organization of States,\nthe rights and the ideals it protects are those of individuals.\nI have listed some rules that will help redefine\ncoexistence among peoples through the work of the United\nNations. We live in a world in which threats against one\ngroup immediately affect every other group and impel them\nto take responsibility, a world in which the concept of\nnon-interference can no longer be invoked to obstruct\naction in the face of serious violations of fundamental\nrights. We must ask ourselves how to address all these\nchanges, for the sake of closer and more equitable\ninternational cooperation.\nOf course, States will continue to have different\nperceptions of national interests, and there will be a\ncontinued need to reconcile them peacefully. But for the\nUnited Nations to meet the challenges of the new century,\nour codes of conduct must be placed within a more solid\ninstitutional framework. The United Nations Security\nCouncil should be made more representative and\ndemocratic in composition, in line with proposals of a\nnumber of Member States. All the citizens of the world\nshould be able to identify themselves with the United\nNations and feel a part of its decision-making and law-\nmaking processes; this for the sake of universal\nsovereignty, which is not the prerogative of a few, but the\nright of all.\nThe cold war represented an international order\ndominated by two super-Powers and held in check by\nnuclear weapons. Today\u2019s world is economically more\nunited, but politically more divided. The watchword of\nthe economy is deregulation. But politics requires rules if\nwe do not want anarchy to prevail. Unlike the market, in\npolitics no invisible hand can generate peace and\nprosperity. What we need is a visible hand that enacts\nrules and regulations, and obliges States to respect them,\nboth beyond their borders and in the treatment of their\ncitizens. Let us make the United Nations the visible hand\nof peace and prosperity. This may be the greatest\nchallenge awaiting us. We must face it together, here in\nthis forum, and place it at the centre of the upcoming\ndebate on the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\nfirst century.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, to begin, Sir,\nby congratulating you on behalf of the Government of the\nRepublic of Angola, and on my own behalf, on your\nelection as president of the General Assembly at this fifty-\nfourth session. Your election to such an important post is\nrecognition of your experience, ability and diplomatic\ncapacity, as well as of Namibia\u2019s role internationally.\nAngola and Namibia not only share a long common border,\nbut also have close political, economic, cultural and\nhistorical links. We sincerely hope that your mandate will\nbe crowned with success.\nOur congratulations also go to the outgoing President,\nMr. Didier Opertti, for the excellent work carried out\nduring his mandate.\nTo the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr.\nKofi Annan, we would like also to express our thanks for\nthe wise and transparent manner in which he has led our\nOrganization.\nIt is also a pleasure for us to welcome the new\nmembers of the United Nations, the Republic of Kiribati,\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Their\naccession reflects the universal nature of the principles\nand rules of the United Nations Charter. Angola is\nconvinced that these States will be able to successfully\ntake up their responsibilities, thereby contributing to the\nstrengthening of our Organization and the stability and\ndevelopment of the South Pacific region and the world as\na whole.\nFor half a century, the Organization has carried out\nactivities to promote the ideals contained in its Charter.\nWith the end of the cold war we thought that large-scale\nfratricidal wars would be things of the past; that the world\nwould no longer experience tension and insecurity; that\nby now we would be in a position to welcome a\nnarrowing of the gap between the rich and poor countries;\nthat a significant part of humanity would be free from the\ndanger of dying of poverty and misery. However, these\nthings have not happened. The world is hostage to itself.\nThere is a plethora of new armed conflicts as a result of\nhatred and racial, ethnic and religious intolerance; of the\ndenial of people\u2019s right to self-determination; and even of\nthe unfathomable ambition of certain politicians to take\npower by force or to attempt to thwart peoples\u2019 sovereign\nwill to choose their own destinies.\nThe proliferation of armed conflicts is, to some\nextent, a reflection of the absence of an international\nsecurity system under the aegis of the United Nations that\nwould be able to respond immediately and correctly to\npotential conflicts. Despite instability in various areas of\nthe world, there has been a weak commitment to\nestablishing such a security system because of a lack of\npolitical will on the part of certain members of the\ninternational community. This indicates that the world is\nstill very far from achieving the long-desired peace and\ndevelopment. Worse yet is the fact that certain entities of\ninternational law approach the need for peace in the world\nfrom a perspective of material and global strategic\ninterests \u2014 and at the expense of the universal human\nvalues.\nIt weighs on our conscience to see that we still have\na long way to go to find solutions to situations of this\nnature, and that the international community\u2019s reactions\nto similar situations of human suffering are not consistent.\nThese facts might lead us to believe that we are\ndealing with a double standard and with measured\npolicies that are at variance with the spirit and letter of\n32\n\n\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The United Nations and\nthe international community as a whole have the political,\nlegal and moral duty to work a little harder, so that peoples\nfacing the scourge of the war will be able to achieve lasting\npeace. The main objective of the United Nations can be\nachieved worldwide, provided that there is coherence and\ndetermination in the application of principles and decisions.\nThe global tolerance of impunity has been encouraging\nthe leaders of the rebel groups proliferating throughout the\nworld to carry out their terrorist and destructive campaigns,\nthe main victim of which is civil society. The differential\ntreatment accorded to identical situations of systematic and\nmassive violations of human rights and the war crimes that\nare occurring in some areas of the world makes it\nimpossible for the international justice system to act with\nthe required effectiveness in dealing with some of the most\nbarbaric and bloodthirsty criminals that Africa has seen this\ncentury. We are convinced that if the political and moral\npower of the United Nations were exerted against all the\nperpetrators of serious crimes, it would dishearten all those\nwho might be willing to resort to subversion and terrorism.\nThus the international community would be preventing the\nemergence of new conflicts.\nWe are fully aware that States have the primary\nresponsibility for paving the way for the prevention of\nconflicts. The implementation of democracy, which may\npromote respect for human rights and the establishment of\nneighbourly relations, may be able to contribute to\npreventing the occurrence of conflicts. Indeed, many of the\ncurrent crises would not have lasted long if the States\ninvolved in them had, in good faith, fully complied with\ntheir international obligations as set forth in the Charter of\nthe United Nations and as established by regional\norganizations. I refer in particular to the principle of\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States. For\nthis reason, the mechanisms for the fulfilment of such\ninternational obligations by States should be further\nreinforced.\nThe Government of the Republic of Angola commends\nthe work undertaken by the Secretary-General regarding the\nreinforcement of the preventive diplomacy mechanisms.\nHowever, the increase in the number of wars, particularly\nsince 1998, leads us to conclude that the efforts in this\nregard still fall short of reaching the objectives. It is thus\nnecessary for us to strive to create the institutional capacity\nfor conflict prevention, including regional early-warning\nmechanisms.\nRegarding conflict resolution, Angola\u2019s experiences\nforce us to stress that there is an urgent need to re-define\nmethods and strategies, mainly in the field of\npeacekeeping operations. Other factors underlying the\nlimited success of some peacekeeping missions carried\nout under the aegis of the United Nations are: the obvious\nfrailty of the verification systems of peace agreements;\nthe tendency to treat similarly the violator and the fulfiller\nof these agreements; the overlooking of early signs that\nsuggest a lack of political will and ill-faith by one of the\nsides; and the subsequent delayed application of coercive\nmeasures.\nAs a member State of the international community\nwe need to rely on and have recourse to the United\nNations in its important role regarding the issues of\npeacekeeping and security in the world. Angola will\ncontinue to believe that, in order to establish peace in the\nworld, the United Nations role is of paramount\nimportance. We simply want to suggest that, given the\ncurrent international situation, this role should be played\nin a more realistic and effective way, with a view to\nliving up to the expectations of people eager for peace\nand to ensuring the credibility of our Organization.\nI would like now to refer to the situation in Angola,\nwhere five years have passed since the Lusaka Protocol\nwas signed between the Government and UNITA.\nHowever, the main tasks involved in attaining a lasting\npeace have not yet been achieved. In particular, UNITA\nhas not been completely disarmed and State authority has\nnot been restored in the illegally occupied areas. Rather,\nthe persistent refusal of the rebels to fully honour their\nobligations and their preference for taking power by force\nhave plunged the country into a new era of violence.\nFollowing this rejection of the people\u2019s will, as\nexpressed at the polls during the 1992 general elections,\nand the non-fulfilment of the provisions of the three peace\naccords entered into with the Government \u2014 in 1989 in\nGbadolite, in the former Zaire; in 1991 in Portugal and in\n1994 in Lusaka \u2014 Mr. Savimbi is still interested in\ncontinuing his destabilization campaign. This includes\npreventing the smooth running of the democratic\ninstitutions; destroying cities, towns, villages,\ninfrastructure and public and private assets; and\nmercilessly killing civilians. In this way he has been\ncondemning to misery, disease and famine all of the\npeople in Angola.\nAs a result of these actions, in addition to the\nthousands of civilians who have already been killed,\n33\n\n\nalmost 3 million others have left their homes in search of\nrefuge in the Government-controlled areas. Those\ncommunities require humanitarian assistance from the\ninternational community. In the framework of the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol, the Government\nhas, in good faith, undertaken all the tasks provided for it\nin the peace accords, in spite of the fact that Savimbi and\nhis military wing have resumed the war. The Government\ncontinues to ensure the functioning of the democratic\ninstitutions resulting from the general elections, and UNITA\nmembers are represented in the Government and the\nparliament.\nIn the national armed forces, military troops, officials\nand soldiers appointed by UNITA remain faithful to the\nideals of democracy and national accord. Only Mr. Savimbi\nand a fairly reduced number of qualified personnel who\nremain faithful to him are still interested in making war\nwith a view to taking power. All of Savimbi\u2019s propaganda\nof recent years has merely been playing for time and\nanticipating that developments on the international scene\nmight come out in his favour. His false messages on\nnegotiations, allowing him time to prepare the ground for\nnew military adventures, are elements of that strategy.\nIndeed, what remains to be done in the Angolan peace\nprocess is to enforce what was negotiated in-depth at\nLusaka over an entire year, particularly the disarming of all\nof Mr. Jonas Savimbi\u2019s military forces and the restoration\nof state administration throughout the national territory. The\nAngolan Government has long waited for Savimbi to decide\nto opt for peace. Angola is currently facing other political\nand economic challenges that cannot be indefinitely\npostponed as a result of the actions of a single power-\nhungry individual who considers war to be the only way to\nfulfil his personal plans. Furthermore, in rejecting\nSavimbi\u2019s posture, many UNITA militants and leaders have\ndistanced him from the party. These women and men are\nworking in good faith to consolidate the Angolan\ndemocratic process.\nGiven Savimbi\u2019s obstructionist behaviour, the Security\nCouncil decided to impose global mandatory sanctions\nagainst UNITA, including the prohibition of international\ntravel for top UNITA officials directly involved in the\nAngola war project. In the same vein, and as a result of the\ncrimes that Savimbi has been committing against the\ncivilian population, the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) and the Southern African Development Community\n(SADC) declared him a war criminal and thus an unreliable\nstakeholder in the implementation of peace in Angola. The\nNon-Aligned Movement, in its ministerial meeting of 23\nSeptember 1999 held here in New York, expressed its\nstrong support for the resolution adopted at the recent\nOAU Summit, which deems Mr. Savimbi a war criminal\nand requires that he be treated as such by the entire\ninternational community. We trust that there is no further\ndoubt about the criminal nature of Mr. Savimbi or the\nneed for him to be held responsible internationally for his\ncrimes and actions.\nThe Angolan Government reiterates its ongoing\ncommitment to paving the way for a lasting peace and, to\nthat end, to making use of all the means at its disposal,\nand undertakes to proceed with the process of national\nreconciliation and social democratization. A clear\ndemonstration of its commitment is the fact that, despite\nthe war climate pervading the country, at no time\nwhatsoever has the Government denied the rights and\nindividual liberties of citizens or of national legal political\nforces.\nIn the framework of the political reforms initiated in\n1991, a new constitution is being prepared in a process in\nwhich all political parties are participating. The new\nconstitutional text will reinforce the rule of law and\nconsolidate the type of society that we intend to establish\nin Angola: an economically prosperous one under\ndemocratic rule of law and a State of social justice. In the\neconomic context, the reforms will follow their course\nwith a view to reinforcing the creation of other conditions\nfor an effective market economy and of a more\nfavourable environment for foreign investment.\nIn order to meet these challenges, we call for the\nsupport and solidarity of the international community,\nparticularly regarding the implementation of sanctions\nimposed by the Security Council against UNITA, so that\nAngola can more rapidly achieve peace and consolidate\nand accelerate the economic reform process.\nIt is our sincere hope that the new initiatives of the\nSecurity Council, proposed by Ambassador Robert\nFowler, Chairman of the Committee on Sanctions, as well\nas the support already expressed by some Governments\nand international institutions, may contribute significantly\nto reinforcing sanctions, dismantling the illegal diamond-\ntrafficking network, which is subsidizing the war carried\nout by Savimbi, and bringing its perpetrators before the\ncourt.\nIn tandem with its efforts to implement peace, the\nAngolan Government is also committed to implementing\nsocial-impact economic programmes and to relaunching\n34\n\n\nthe basis for the resettlement of communities with a view\nto economically rehabilitating the country. In this regard,\nwe wish to call upon all United Nations Member States to\nsupport the draft resolution that Angola will submit to the\nGeneral Assembly on economic rehabilitation. In addition\nto lending their support to the draft resolution, we call on\nour partners particularly to participate in the economic\nrehabilitation of Angola.\nThe disarming of anti-personal landmines is another\ntask that requires the ongoing involvement and support of\nthe international community. The Angolan Government will\nremain engaged at the national, regional and international\nlevels in order to overcome that scourge. A clear\ndemonstration of this determination is the fact that we were\none of the first State parties to the Ottawa Convention on\nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.\nThe security, stability and territorial integrity of\nAngola and its neighbours depend on the stability of the\nregion. We are currently facing a dangerous increase of\ndestabilization which, if not controlled, may seriously affect\nthe development of that part of the continent. Angola will\ncontinue to lend its support, under SADC, to the\nimplementation of peace in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. The Ceasefire Agreement signed in Lusaka and its\ncomplete fulfilment will pave the way for the return of\nrefugees and the initiation of dialogue between the\nCongolese political forces, to which falls the responsibility\nof deciding the destiny of their country. The United Nations\nand the OAU are also called upon to play a crucial role in\nthe establishment of a lasting peace. It would be reasonable\nfor the invading countries to make a gesture by\nwithdrawing from Congolese territory and ceasing to\nexpand their occupation.\nIn the African Horn, Angola welcomes the acceptance\nby the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea of the\nFramework Agreement prepared by the OAU with a view\nto settling the dispute between the two countries. We wish\nto call upon both countries to demonstrate flexibility in\norder to ensure that a peace agreement, taking into account\nthe interests of their peoples, can be celebrated.\nWith respect to Somalia, we call upon the international\ncommunity to support the efforts of the OAU to reconcile\nthe political and military factions and to establish an elected\nGovernment so that the country can resume its place in the\ncommunity of nations.\nIn Western Sahara, the fulfilment of the Ceasefire\nAgreement enabled the further development of the joint\nefforts of the United Nations and the OAU leading to the\nholding of a referendum. Angola expects the process to\nbe transparent and fair and that both parties shall accept\nthe verdict of the Sahraoui people.\nConcerning East Timor, whose people is connected\nto Angola by a shared language and a historical past of\nstruggle against Portuguese colonization, we were\ndisturbed by the acts of violence that followed the\nannouncement of the results of the popular consultation.\nThe decision of East Timor\u2019s people in favour of self-\ndetermination and independence should be respected. It is\nnow the United Nations responsibility to prepare an\nenabling environment. In this regard, we strongly support\nthe dispatch of a United Nations international peace force.\nAs to the Middle East, Angola welcomes the\ncelebration of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements between\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority that have enabled the\npeace process to be relaunched. It is our view that the\nnew agreements conform to the aspirations of the\nrespective peoples to living in peace and security.\nThe Government of the Republic of Angola and its\npeople are concerned about the difficult political,\neconomic and social situation of the Cuban people, which\nhas worsened under the ongoing economic embargo\nimposed on their country. We hope that the matter will be\nresolved through a constructive bilateral dialogue.\nThe latest international developments and the\nchallenges of the next millennium require that the United\nNations and its main bodies, particularly those dealing\nwith peace and security, economic development and the\nadministration of international justice, be adjusted to the\nnew situation.\nReform and an increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council will be crucial to making the\ndecision-making process more transparent. In this respect,\nit is essential that all the regions of the world be\nrepresented equally. Angola reaffirms the position of the\nnon-aligned countries on the reform of the Security\nCouncil, as well as the common African position adopted\nby the OAU.\nDespite the progress achieved in some economies\nand the disappearance of the signs of a new world\ndepression, the international economic situation continues\nto be characterized by serious imbalances. The root\n35\n\n\ncauses of the difficult situation faced by some developing\ncountries include the unfair system governing international\neconomic, monetary and financial relations; the adoption of\nprotectionist measures; the unilateral nature of world trade;\nand the worsening of the external debt, which has become\na heavy burden for the developing countries.\nIt is necessary to take concrete measures which may\nlead to structural changes in international economic\nrelations and may contribute to the balance of the world\neconomy. To this end, there should be a serious and\ntransparent will in the North-South dialogue.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to express\nmy sincere congratulations, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession and to extend my best wishes for a successful\nconduct of the deliberations and work of this body.\nI wish also to thank your predecessor, Mr. Didier\nOpertti, for his leadership and his personal contribution to\nthe achievements of the fifty-third session.\nThe United Nations was created over 50 years ago\nin specific political circumstances marked by enthusiasm\nbrought about by the end of the Second World War. Its\nestablishment was a very important step towards a new\nglobal order, although the political situation dominated by\nsuper-Power rivalry over next several decades prevented\nit from using its potential to the full. The current\ninternational political situation is much more propitious\nfor pursuing the original purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter. Following the end of the bipolar\ndivision of the world, we have witnessed new political\nprocesses that have profoundly changed the political\nlandscape. An ever- growing number of countries are\nembracing democratic principles and implementing them\nin practice. This should be emphasized, especially in a\nforum such as the General Assembly, because the spread\nof democracy gives momentum to the work of the United\nNations and stimulates the expansion of its activities\nthroughout the world.\nA growing number of countries are acknowledging\ntheir share of the global responsibility for a better life on\nour planet and for the wise exploitation of its resources.\nIn this era of globalization and interdependence, the\n6\n\n\nUnited Nations plays a unique and irreplaceable role. Its\nfundamental and key tasks \u2014 safeguarding peace and\nsecurity; promoting economic cooperation and social\ndevelopment, including poverty eradication; strengthening\nthe role of international law; and protecting human\nrights \u2014 are even more relevant today than they were 54\nyears ago. The Slovak Republic is very much aware of this\nfact.\nOne of the crucial issues in reforming the Organization\nand preparing it for the challenges that lie ahead is the\nreform of the Security Council. The Security Council is the\nsymbol and pillar of the concept of collective security,\ndesigned in the aftermath of the most tragic conflict of this\ncentury in order to prevent its repetition.\nThe fundamental political changes that have taken\nplace in the world in the last 50 years represent a challenge\nto the future role of the Security Council and its legitimacy.\nWe must draw lessons from past setbacks. Caused mostly\nby the divergent interests of major actors or by a lack of\npolitical will, they paralysed the Security Council, which\nremained inactive instead of taking effective action on\nbehalf of the Member States. Otherwise, we risk the erosion\nof the authority of the Security Council and consequently\nof its central role in the maintenance of international peace\nand security. The United Nations cannot afford to let that\nhappen, because there is no alternative to the concept of\ncollective security as embodied in the United Nations\nCharter. The modern world needs a supreme security\nauthority with unquestioned credibility.\nThe key tasks of Security Council reform are to\nstrengthen its representative character, improve the\neffectiveness and transparency of its decision-making\nprocess and working methods and, ultimately, enhance its\nlegitimacy. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to reach the\nwidest possible agreement on enlarging its membership and\non the veto right, which plays a pivotal role in the overall\nreform of the Council. Unless the scope of application of\nthe veto and its relationship to potential new members of\nthe Security Council are clarified, it will be very difficult\nto proceed to the enlargement of the category of permanent\nmembers.\nSlovakia recognizes as legitimate the efforts of some\ncountries, which, being capable of assuming a share of the\ngobal responsibility for the maintenance of international\npeace and security, desire a position in an enlarged Security\nCouncil. At the same time, however, it is necessary to\nensure the appropriate representation of the developing\ncountries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean\nregion, since those countries represent a significant\nmajority of the United Nations membership.\nRegrettably, as the past six years of discussions in\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council have shown, a\nfundamental divergence of views continues to exist with\nregard to enlarging the category of permanent members,\nthus making it very unlikely that concrete results will be\nachieved in the near future.\nWe believe that in order to move ahead, we should\nproceed gradually rather than running in place in order to\nprevent the United Nations from \u201cmissing the boat\u201d in our\nrapidly changing world. If there is no agreement on other\ncategories of membership, Slovakia is ready, at this stage,\nto support expanding only the non-permanent category.\nThe overall number of seats in the enlarged Security\nCouncil would then depend on the scenario eventually\nagreed on by Member States. Nevertheless, it should not\nexceed the range of 23 to 25 in order to preserve its\ncapability to act promptly. I would like to point out that\nSlovakia is flexible in this regard. The expansion of the\nSecurity Council should also take into account an\nappropriate increase in the representation of the Eastern\nEuropean regional Group, whose membership has more\nthan doubled in recent years.\nPeacekeeping operations continue to be one of the\nkey instruments available to the United Nations in the\ndischarge of its primary responsibility for the maintenance\nof international peace and security. Nevertheless, in the\nlight of the tragic experience of recent and still-raging\nconflicts, it is necessary to reinforce those mechanisms,\nwhich would allow the United Nations to more actively\nconcentrate on preventing conflicts and addressing their\ncauses rather than their consequences. An early- warning\nsystem should be further enhanced, and preventive\ndiplomacy should play a more active role in potential\nconflict situations.\nToday\u2019s conflicts have many dimensions, which\nmust be addressed comprehensively. An integrated,\nmultidimensional approach to peacekeeping and post-\nconflict peace-building must be taken if a conflict is to be\nresolved in a durable manner. It is important to ensure an\neffective coordination among the military, civilian and\nhumanitarian components of multidisciplinary operations,\nwhich should be given adequate mandates and resources.\n7\n\n\nAs time is a crucial factor in most cases of\ndeployment of peacekeeping forces, Slovakia supports the\nefforts to enhance United Nations rapid-deployment\ncapabilities through the United Nations standby\narrangements system. Regional initiatives play an important\nrole in this respect, and Slovakia has therefore joined the\nCentral European Nations Cooperation in Peace Support,\naimed at closer cooperation among several Central\nEuropean States in the field of the preparation, training and\nparticipation of their armed forces in peacekeeping\noperations.\nSince its admission to the United Nations Slovakia has\nbeen contributing to a number of United Nations\npeacekeeping operations in Africa, Asia and Europe,\nincluding those in Angola, Rwanda, the border region of\nUganda and Rwanda, Liberia, Sierra Leone, the Syrian\nGolan Heights, Jerusalem, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia\nand Eastern Slavonia. The Slovak Government has also\nrecently decided to contribute an engineering unit to the\nUnited Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western\nSahara (MINURSO). Slovakia thus ranks among the leading\ntroop contributors in terms of the number of troops per\ncapita. I would like to take this opportunity to assure the\nAssembly that Slovakia is determined to continue to support\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities in all the main\nareas: troops, logistics and training.\nThe active participation of the Slovak Republic in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities has proved that it\nhas a responsible approach to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, and has logically led to the\nsubmission of its candidature for the non-permanent seat in\nthe Security Council for the term 2000-2001. Through\nmembership in the Security Council, Slovakia would like to\nprove that small countries, too, can make an important\ncontribution to the resolution of conflicts and crises in the\nworld.\nKosovo is the most recent example of the tragic reality\nof the present-day Balkans, driven by violence and ethnic\nhatred, which is not only a product of the region\u2019s\ncomplicated historical circumstances, but, above all, the\nresult of human rights violations and of the misuse of\nethnic differences to reach short-sighted political goals.\nSlovakia attaches great importance to the political resolution\nof the Kosovo conflict, and appreciates the efforts of the\nUnited Nations, the Secretary-General, the Contact Group\ndealing with the former Yugoslavia and regional\norganizations to this end. We welcomed with great hope the\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), aimed\nat creating conditions for building a democratic Kosovo\nbased on respect for the human rights of all citizens,\nregardless of their ethnic origin and religion, and for all\nthe principles enshrined in Article 2 of the United Nations\nCharter.\nPost-conflict peace-building in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina has proved that reconstruction of a\nconflict-torn society on a multi-ethnic basis is in no way\nan easy task. However, if new tragedies are to be\nprevented, the international community must give a hand\nto the people in that part of Europe in their quest for\nreconciliation and for building mutual trust. An important\nrole in these efforts is to be played by the economic\nreconstruction and development of the entire Balkan\nregion.\nIn this connection, Slovakia welcomes and fully\nsupports the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. I\nbelieve it will open a new stage in the history of the\nregion. The proof of the importance which the Slovak\nRepublic attaches to securing stability in this part of\nEurope is the appointment of the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Slovakia, Mr. Eduard Kukan, as the Special\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General for the Balkans. A\nconference was held under his auspices in Bratislava, the\ncapital of Slovakia, on the post-war reconstruction of the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. The conference clearly\nshowed the direction which the international community\nand Yugoslav society should take if the country is to\nbecome a firm part of the community of nations in the\nBalkans, built on new foundations.\nThe Slovak Republic considers a just peace in the\nMiddle East to be an important component of global\nstability. For this reason, we welcomed the signing, on 4\nSeptember 1999, of a new agreement between Israel and\nthe Palestinian Authority on the implementation of\nindividual steps of the Wye Memorandum. At the same\ntime, we hope that Israel, Syria and Lebanon will also\nrenew their dialogues. Although certain issues remain to\nbe resolved among the parties, we believe that a final\nagreement will eventually be reached and a permanent\npeace will be secured for the Middle East region.\nThe continent of Africa is suffering from far too\nmany conflicts, often fed by poverty and\nunderdevelopment. Clearly, cooperation between the\ninternational community and African States is greatly\nneeded in order to prevent and to address conflicts and to\nhelp Africa to create conditions for sustainable\ndevelopment. Slovakia shares the Secretary-General\u2019s\nview, expressed in his report on Africa last year, that\n8\n\n\nAfricans themselves must demonstrate the political will to\nrespond to problems by peaceful means and to adhere to\nthe rules of good governance through ensuring respect for\nhuman rights and the rule of law, strengthening\ndemocratization and promoting transparency in public\nadministration. In the meantime, the assistance of the\ninternational community is important not only for the\neconomic development of African States, but also to enable\nthem to build their own capacity for conflict prevention and\nresolution.\nThe African regional and subregional organizations,\nsuch as the Organization of African Unity, the Economic\nCommunity of West African States and the Southern\nAfrican Development Community, should be given credit\nfor the role they have played in the implementation of\npeace operations in several African countries, and should be\nprovided with the necessary financial and material\nassistance. Slovakia is ready to contribute its share \u2014 for\ninstance, by offering its Training Centre for Peacekeeping\nOperations, which has specific facilities for training\nengineering units.\nAnother pressing problem is the prevention of the\nillicit flow of arms and military material into zones of\nconflict, and the enforcement of an effective\nimplementation of the Security Council arms embargoes.\nThe most disturbing fact is that the Security Council\u2019s\nsanctions are violated mostly by non-African countries\nwhich have turned Africa into a store for all kinds of\nweapons. Slovakia firmly adheres to all Security Council\ndecisions, including sanctions. We believe that Security\nCouncil sanctions committees should be actively engaged\nin ensuring the concerted efforts of all the actors concerned\n\u2014 Governments, international governmental and\nnon-governmental organizations, private companies and\nleaders of opinion \u2014 in order to identify the sources of\narms flows into zones of conflict and cut off military forces\nand rebel groups from their resources, thus eliminating their\nability to wage war.\nI realize that the United Nations is not only a\npeacekeeper; it also has a role to play in the everyday lives\nof many people suffering from hunger, poverty, disease,\nilliteracy and backwardness. All of us are obligated to\npromote sustainable development and to protect the global\nenvironment and human rights. The best way to prevent and\neliminate conflicts is to create conditions for a worthy life\nfor every individual on this planet as well as friendly\nrelations among nations based on the principles of equal\nrights, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human\nrights.\nBeing a small country, the Slovak Republic does not\nalways have means to resolve global issues comparable to\nthose that some big countries have. But it compensates\nfor this disadvantage with its determined and active\napproach to all the major problems that mankind is\nfacing. As experience has shown, small and medium-sized\ncountries can contribute significantly to the resolution of\ncrises and conflicts. This may be due to the fact that these\ncountries are not burdened with power interests and are\ncapable of presenting and advocating solutions acceptable\nto all. Slovakia has already demonstrated its ability to be\nan active player in international relations. The United\nNations and its Security Council are the forums in which\nwe can put this valuable experience to the best use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Please accept\nour warmest congratulations, Sir, on your well-deserved\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. We\nwish you every success, which we are convinced will be\nforthcoming in your leadership and in the outcome of\nthese proceedings.\nWe also wish to convey heartfelt recognition to the\nForeign Minister of Uruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, who so\nbrilliantly presided over the last session, a matter of\nlegitimate pride for Latin America.\nI should also like to convey a message of warm\nsupport and tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for the fruitful work that he has been pursuing\nwith commendable energy and great vision, to reform,\nstrengthen and invigorate the complex and sensitive\nUnited Nations system within a comprehensive context\nwhile looking towards a new century and a new\nmillennium that will require all kinds of revisions,\nadjustments and adaptations.\n5\n\n\nWe share and support the initiatives that, among their\nother objectives, are designed to make it easier for countries\nthat are relatively underdeveloped and engaged in the tasks\nof economic and social development and combating poverty\nto achieve the very difficult and painful transition to a new\nglobalized world with a market economy devoid of barriers,\nwhere rapidly developing patterns are being imposed with\nregard to competitiveness, advanced technology, models of\nculture and consumption, social and computer\ncommunications, sophisticated systems of financing and a\nvast array of other tools and processes. All of this\nhighlights with stark reality the great differences and\nimbalances that exist at the international level.\nThose are the major challenges that we must confront\ntogether, using political will, hard work, education, training,\nthe transfer of science and technology, investment,\nopenness, production, trade, superior skills and active\npolicies of participation to ensure that shared benefits will\nflow out to profit all, fairly and equitably, at every layer of\nthe social fabric of our peoples.\nIt would be unfortunate and very dangerous if these\ngreat opportunities offered by globalization were not\ntranslated into positive, innovative and tangible changes to\neffectively promote, in the shortest time possible, a\nsubstantive improvement in standards of living, expectations\nand opportunities for the vast majority, within the\nframework of sustainable development.\nOn occasions, at certain stages in these transitional\nprocesses, disturbances have occurred as a result of\ntroubling inequalities between various sectors and social\nactors. Such differences exist and are growing both in\nadvanced countries and in developing countries, which are\nin the majority.\nWe should anticipate, reverse, mitigate or, at least,\ntemper with realism and sensitivity such negative effects,\nwhich owe their origins and characteristics to specific\ncircumstances and considerations that were assumed to be\ntemporary. A failure to take adequate measures could put\nat risk budding democracies, which are precariously\nbuilding stability and the institutional structures of law and\ngovernance.\nIn this primordial task, the participation of citizens and\nof civil society, in its various forms, is vital. We must make\nuse of a constant, open and pluralist dialogue to facilitate\nchanges of course, reform and consensus, which will\ncontribute to the strengthening of democratic systems and\nmake it possible for people to live together in peace.\nIn this context, this year the two main political\nforces in Nicaragua, which together won a little more\nthan 90 per cent of the vote in the most recent elections,\nhave produced an agenda that will be submitted to the\nNational Assembly for consideration, so that it can be\ndebated with complete transparency in the nation's\nprincipal forum.\nFurthermore, beginning in 1997, my country began\na difficult reorganization and structural adjustment\nprocess, taking the decision to deal responsibly with the\nhigh political and social costs of laying down the stable\nfoundations for dynamic national reconstruction and\ntransformation.\nWe must put behind us once and for all the painful\nperiod in our history, which lasted more than a decade\nand was characterized by destruction and violence in a\ncycle of fratricidal confrontation and which, fortunately,\nhas now been overcome. That historical interval left us in\na very weakened state that was reflected in the\ndeterioration of all human development indicators, the\ngeneral collapse of economic activities and a gigantic\nexternal debt whose unbearable and overwhelming weight\nwas borne on the impoverished shoulders of the long-\nsuffering people of Nicaragua.\nThis situation of extreme fragility made it necessary,\nfrom the beginning of my Government, to formulate an\neconomic policy that would gain the support and\ncredibility of the international community and the\nmultilateral organizations. This led to an agreement with\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new\nenhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF)\nprogramme which, after its projected completion within\na period of three years, would have made it possible for\nus to qualify for the concessionary plan of the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.\nWhile we were occupied with the many sacrifices\nthat we had to make during that tough process of healing,\nreorganization and reconstruction, a little less than a year\nago we suffered the ill-timed and devastating effects of\nHurricane Mitch, which severely affected our efforts,\nwork and plans. However, generous international\ncooperation mitigated to some extent the suffering, the\nirreparable loss of thousands of lives of our compatriots\nand the widespread destruction of basic infrastructures,\nproperty, natural resources and the environment.\nThe damage inflicted by the tragedy also created\nnew challenges and opportunities, encouraging us to\n6\n\n\nredouble our efforts and to seek the necessary unity, joining\ntogether without distinction, in efforts to move forward. In\nMay this year, therefore, the Consultative Group for the\nReconstruction and Transformation of Central America,\nconvened initially by the Inter-American Development Bank\nin Washington in December 1998 as a result of Hurricane\nMitch, met in Stockholm and offered Nicaragua phased\nglobal support amounting to $2.5 billion for a period of\nthree to four years. This significant support will enable us\nto give urgent attention to social programmes and\ninfrastructure projects, with priority being given to the\nsensitive areas of health, education and housing, as well as\nto plans for assistance to small producers and agricultural\nworkers affected by Hurricane Mitch.\nThe disciplined implementation of the ESAF\nprogramme and the new set of circumstances ushered in by\nthe hurricane, led last week to an event that happily\ncoincided with the celebration of our national\nindependence \u2014 a resolution of the International Monetary\nFund by which it associated itself with the resolution\npreviously adopted by the World Bank, thereby opening the\ndoor to Nicaragua for its inclusion in the HIPC initiative.\nThis extraordinary event, which will mean a substantial\npardoning of our external debt, was a historical watershed,\nopening up a fresh chapter in our new independence, which\nwill transform the economic and social reality of our\npeople, making it possible for them to enter the new\ncentury relieved of an unbearable burden inherited from the\npast, with renewed vigour, great potential and realistic\noptimism for a substantially improved quality of life for\nNicaraguans.\nWe should like to reiterate our eternal gratitude to the\ninternational community and to the multilateral\norganizations that have smoothed our path, enabling us to\nmarch together, shoulder to shoulder, towards a promising\nfuture.\nNicaragua appreciates the sustained efforts of the\nUnited Nations system. Those efforts have been expanded\nduring this decade to incorporate the great challenges and\nmain issues confronting the country, including issues\nconcerning governance and local development, the\npromotion of a healthy environment, the reduction of\nextreme poverty, greater access by disadvantaged\npopulations to public services, the modernization of\ndemocratic institutions, the promotion of population\npolicies, the process of demobilization of ex-combatants\nand the search for solutions to property conflicts through\ndialogue. Likewise, we acknowledge the special efforts\nmade by the United Nations with regard to strengthening\nthe administration of justice and the penal system, and to\nthe creation of the Inter-American Court of Human\nRights. It is also appropriate to emphasize its support for\nthe prevention of natural disasters through overcoming\nsocio-economic and environmental vulnerabilities.\nWorking together with the United Nations, we have\ngradually been fulfilling the commitments of the Earth\nSummit of 1992 during my term of office in order to\ncreate the National Council on Sustainable Development\n(CONADES). We have also been making strides\nconcerning the Conventions on Biodiversity and Climate\nChange, as well as participating in the major projects of\nthe Meso-American Biological Corridor and the\nBiological Corridor of the Atlantic.\nAt the same time, we have been making a consistent\neffort in the demining of the border zone with Honduras,\nwhere the last war left more than one 100 thousand anti-\npersonnel landmines in the ground. We thank the\ninternational community, and especially the Organization\nof American States and the United Nations, for the\nsignificant resources they placed at our disposal to\nundertake this delicate task.\nAs signatory to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, we\nunreservedly support initiatives aimed at establishing an\ninternational mechanism for the total elimination of\nnuclear weapons. We are also conscious of the grave\nmenace to the security of our nations and to peace posed\nby arms trafficking, including trafficking in small arms,\nwhich cause the greatest suffering and loss of human life.\nWe join in the world crusade to combat poverty,\nwhether that poverty is generalized, focused or in diverse\nstrata of our societies. We are pleased that the last year of\nthis century has been designated the International Year of\nOlder Persons, who seem increasingly to suffer from\npoverty and neglect. We likewise reaffirm our\ncommitment to ensure social protection, along with the\nredoubling of efforts to make more effective both the\npersonal security of citizens and the security of their\nproperty.\nI would not want to end without inviting the\nAssembly to reflect on the hopes of the 22 million\npersons who, at the threshold of the twenty-first century,\ncontinue to lack representation at the United Nations \u2014\nthe Organization of universal vocation, where the most\nimportant decisions having to do with international policy\nare taken. The Republic of China \u2014 founded in 1912 and\nwhich has been an independent sovereign nation that\n7\n\n\nmaintains official diplomatic relations with Nicaragua and\nthe other republics of Central America and other\ncountries \u2014 continues, lamentably and unjustly, to be\nunrepresented in the Organization. This prevents it from\nparticipating in the work of the Organization and from\nmaking its valuable contribution in the various areas of\ninternational cooperation, despite the fact that it has\ncomplied fully with the provisions of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, which was signed at San Francisco.\nMy Government has supported and will continue to\nsupport, with firm and fraternal solidarity, the\nunquestionable right of the Republic of China \u2014 whose\nexercise of full sovereignty over Taiwan for half a century\nis an unquestionable reality \u2014 to be incorporated as a full\nmember of the United Nations. We therefore call anew on\nthe international community not to deny that friendly,\nprogressive and exemplary people the right to be recognized\nand allowed effective participation in this great forum,\nthereby affording it the well deserved opportunity of\nsharing with us its vocation for peace and its generous\nspirit of international cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the people and the Government of Papua New\nGuinea, I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating\nHis Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly. His unanimous\nelection shows the esteem in which the international\ncommunity holds him personally, and his country,\nNamibia. The Papua New Guinea delegation is confident\nthat he will guide the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly to a successful conclusion. My congratulations\ngo also to the other Assembly officers.\nMay I also take this opportunity to express my\ndelegation's sincere appreciation to his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti, for his outstanding\nstewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-third\nsession.\nWe would also like to place on record our\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his diplomatic\nskill and for the leadership he has provided on major\nissues of international concern. I must also congratulate\nthe Secretariat staff for the tremendous work they put into\nthe discharge of their functions and duties, at times under\nvery difficult and dangerous circumstances.\nLike others who have spoken before me, I too\ncongratulate on behalf of the people and the Government\n17\n\n\nof Papua New Guinea the three new Member States, all\nfrom the South Pacific Forum region \u2014 the Republic of\nNauru, the Republic of Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga\n\u2014 and welcome them into the United Nations family. I\nwould also like to pay tribute to all Member States which\nmade their admission possible. This is an Organization in\nwhich smallness in terms of population or size should not\nbe a handicap. I am confident that the work of the United\nNations will only be enhanced through the sharing of the\nparticular experiences and knowledge that these three new\nMembers will bring.\nIt has only been a little over two months since the new\nGovernment, of which I am a part, was elected to office in\nmy country. But this time has been hectic and very\nchallenging. The Government has been confronted with\nproblems inherited from previous Governments over the last\n23 years of our independence and especially over the last\ntwo years. These have been compounded by other problems\nassociated with the recent downturn in the global economy,\nwith the economic crisis in the Asia-Pacific region and with\nnatural disasters, all of which we have little control over.\nThis experience, together with my country's location\nand its close relations with other countries in the region,\ndefines my Government's foreign policy focus on\npartnerships in the Asia-Pacific region. This point has been\nbrought home by a series of natural disasters which have\naffected Papua New Guinea over the last 10 years. There\nhave been 30 of them in that decade. The droughts, floods,\nbush fires, cyclones, frosts, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,\ntsunamis and landslides have shown that peoples and States\nthroughout the world have to be partners in dealing with the\ncauses and consequences of such disasters, and must\nmanifest preparedness to take responsive and remedial\nmeasures. There must be a global partnership in developing\nappropriate mechanisms for disaster prevention and disaster\nreduction.\nWhen my Government came into office on 14 July\nthis year, it had five main priorities. These are: restoring\nintegrity to the institutions of the State; stabilizing the\nexchange rate of our currency, the kina, and containing\ninflation and reestablishing constructive dialogue with\nPapua New Guinea's development partners; restoring\nstability to the national budget, focusing on fewer and more\nimportant priority areas and advancing the privatization of\nsome of our public institutions for a fair run; creating better\nconditions for the private sector by removing barriers to\ninvestment growth; and continuing the Bougainville peace\nprocess.\nMy Government has addressed these challenges,\nincluding a comprehensive programme of structural\nadjustment through the mini-budget recently adopted by\nParliament. In doing so, we are working hard to make\nsure that a strong and efficient private sector can\ncontribute to public welfare and national development. By\nthe same token we are also reviewing the size and\neffectiveness of the public sector to make it more\nresponsive to the desires and aspirations of our people.\nThe results, together with other measures we have\nadopted, will, we hope, stabilize the economy, thereby\nstimulating economic growth. The signs are very\nencouraging.\nI know that as a small open economy, my country's\ndevelopment is directly influenced by global factors,\nincluding world market prices for our products. Currently,\nmy country is suffering from the economic crisis\nexperienced by our major trading partners in Asia, and we\nare forced to undertake significant reform programmes to\nprotect our economy and our people. In this regard, we\nturn to international financial institutions to help us\nrestructure our economy. The World Bank, the\nInternational Monetary Fund and the Asian Development\nBank have been very positive in their responses to our\npolicies, especially my Government's recent mini-budget\nlast month.\nI held bilateral discussions with friends such as\nAustralia, China, Japan and New Zealand two weeks ago\nduring the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\nministerial meeting in Auckland, New Zealand. They\nindicated their support for the current structural\nadjustment programmes my Government has introduced.\nFor Papua New Guinea to realize and sustain its current\nreform programmes, it has to secure external financial\nsupport.\nI see my Government's foreign policy of partnership\nin the Asia-Pacific region as a building block for the\nglobal partnership on which the future of my people\ndepends. There is really no other alternative.\nOn peacemaking and peacekeeping, the Bougainville\nconflict involves substantial commitments of personnel\nand funds by the Government of Papua New Guinea, by\nneighbouring countries and by the United Nations. My\nGovernment acknowledges and is deeply grateful for the\nconstructive role played by Australia, Fiji, New Zealand,\nthe Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as well as by the\nUnited Nations Development Programme and a number of\nnon-governmental organizations including churches and\n18\n\n\nthe Red Cross. We are also grateful that the Security\nCouncil found it possible to answer our request to send an\nobserver mission to ensure that the parties involved in the\npeace process continue to honour the Lincoln Agreement.\nWe note the reference to Bougainville in the Secretary-\nGeneral's report on the work of the Organization.\nAs peace continues to be consolidated on the ground,\nso the role and size of the neutral regional Peace\nMonitoring Group can be expected to change. Re-\nestablishment of police, courts and correctional services will\nprovide important supports and benchmarks for progress\ntowards lasting peace on the island. In the event that the\nBougainville parties are unable to resolve the constitutional\narrangements before the end of this year, we hope that at\nthe appropriate time the Security Council will agree to an\nextension of the mandate of the United Nations mission on\nBougainville.\nI pay tribute to all United Nations Member States, and\nespecially to those current and immediate past members of\nthe Security Council, for responding positively and for their\ncontinued support for a peaceful resolution of our\nBougainville crisis.\nConsistent with our commitment to peaceful dialogue\nbetween nations, Papua New Guinea condemns those who\nemploy terrorism against innocent people and who finance,\nrecruit, train and deploy terrorists and mercenaries.\nIn 1975, when I addressed this forum from this\npodium at the time of our admission to the United Nations,\nI committed Papua New Guinea to the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations Charter. Now, some 24\nyears later, we recognize that like any other institution, the\nUnited Nations has limitations. We believe that after 50\nyears the time is right to review the Charter, taking into\naccount today's realities.\nThe Charter should be a document that puts the people\nof the world on centre stage, and at the same time it must\nrecognize that the Governments are here to represent them\nas well as to serve them. In this respect, there cannot be\nany distinction as to colour, creed, race, sex or religious\npersuasion.\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General's\ncurrent and ongoing reform programme. As a member of\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, my delegation reaffirms the\nposition that the Security Council should be reformed and\nexpanded in both categories, taking into account today's\nrealities. My delegation believes the numbers in the Council\nshould reflect the increased United Nations membership,\nand therefore I concur with the majority of Member\nStates who have advocated a Security Council of the new\nmillennium consisting of 26 or more members.\nPapua New Guinea believes that all permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, including new\npermanent members, should have similar privileges and\nrights. The use of the veto power should be done away\nwith, or curtailed and applied only to Chapter VII issues.\nThe working methods of the Council should be more\ntransparent.\nThe reforms of the Organization would not be\ncomplete without the reconfiguration of the regional\ngroupings within the United Nations structure. My\nGovernment believes that an effective Security Council\nshould be composed of a representative from each\nsubregion of the world. In this regard, due consideration\nshould be given to current realities, especially to the\ngeographical location of each Member State. For example,\nin the reformulation Australia and New Zealand should be\nconsidered as part of the South Pacific subregion of the\nAsian group. The reforms in the Security Council should\ntherefore take account of this change.\nChanging the world, through decolonization, from a\nsystem of relations between imperial powers and the\ncolonized to a partnership between sovereign States is\namong the United Nations greatest achievements. The\nprocess, however, will not be complete until the\nremaining 17 non-self-governing territories have exercised\ntheir inalienable right to self-determination and/or\nachieved self-government and, where appropriate,\nindependence. Neither small size nor remoteness should\nbe allowed to qualify or limit this inalienable right.\nOn the regional front, Papua New Guinea is pleased\nto note the progress made in implementing the Matignon\nAccords, culminating in the recent agreement contained\nin the Noumea Accord, which confirms the way forward\nfor the exercise of the right of self-determination by the\npeople of New Caledonia, especially the indigenous\nKanak people. The Noumea Accord will, we believe,\nprovide a sound basis for the future fulfilment of all\nlegitimate political aspirations. We urge all parties to\nhonour both its letter and spirit.\nWe acknowledge that the United Nations Decade for\nDecolonization will come to an end next year. We urge\nthe administering Powers and the members of the Special\n19\n\n\nCommittee to work together to develop a new programme\nof action for the year 2000 and beyond.\nOn East Timor, my Government welcomed the\nagreement between the Republic of Indonesia, the\nPortuguese Republic and the United Nations on 5 May\n1999, which enabled the United Nations to organize the\nballot on 30 August. The overwhelming 98.6 per cent\nturnout at the ballot and the 78.2 per cent vote in favour of\nindependence are very clear.\nMy Government calls on all parties to respect the\nresults of the United Nations-supervised ballot and the\nwishes of the East Timorese people. Although since the\nballot there have been deaths, massive destruction of\nproperty and the undemocratic and forced displacement of\npeople by the militias and certain members of the\nIndonesian military who did not accept the results, we are\npleased that this has changed after the recent announcement\nby the President of the Republic of Indonesia, B. J.\nHabibie, reaffirmed by Foreign Minister Alatas yesterday.\nDemocracy is all about the will of the majority. It is not\nabout unanimity, nor is it about enforced application of\nrules by a minority.\nWe are also pleased that the Government of Indonesia\nwas able to recognise its obligations \u2014 not only as a party\nto the 5 May Agreement, but also as a Member of the\nUnited Nations \u2014 to permit the deployment of a Security\nCouncil-sanctioned multinational peacekeeping force in East\nTimor.\nAt the same time, however, it is our fervent hope that\nin the interests of the long-term security and stability of the\nregion, the leaders and the people of East Timor will also\nmake peace with their neighbours. It is important for them\nto acknowledge the fact that it was the Government of\nIndonesia that made it possible for the people to exercise\ntheir right to self-determination.\nWe are firmly committed to the Barbados Programme\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States, including issues of climate change and\nthe consequent effects of rising sea levels. We strongly urge\nits full implementation. My Government will continue to\nfollow and support the future work on these issues,\nincluding the special session of the General Assembly on\nsmall island developing States to be held on 27 and 28\nSeptember 1999. The world's leading scientists have\nconcluded that the rise in global temperatures poses serious\nthreats, including sea-level rise and an increase in natural\ncatastrophes such as the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a phenomena.\nThe greatest challenge for the United Nations is to\nstrengthen the global community's capacity to respond\npromptly and effectively to natural disasters. The\ndevastation caused by the recent earthquakes in Taiwan\nand Turkey and by the floods in the United States and in\nthe Bahamas resulting from hurricane Floyd makes it all\nthe more imperative for the international community to\ntake positive action.\nOn the question of the management of the oceans\nand seas, Papua New Guinea joins others in calling on\nMember States at this session of the General Assembly to\nwork together on a resolution to establish a consultative\nprocess to improve coordination and management of the\nprogrammes for the protection of the oceans and seas. At\nthis Assembly session we should formalize this process.\nWe are concerned that at the recent meeting of the\nCouncil of the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica,\na number of States appeared to be more preoccupied with\nreducing our potential to prosper from prospecting,\nexploring and exploiting the deep seabed. The debate in\nJamaica clearly reflected that the States with stringent\nenvironmental guidelines no longer endorse the principle\nof a global commons. They now find themselves caught\nup in a conflict of interest in which their role as guardians\nof the global commons is now being overshadowed by\ntheir desire to grab the benefits for themselves, with little\nor no sense of obligation to the world community at\nlarge.\nWe have also noted a tendency by countries that\nhave co-sponsored pioneer investors in deep-sea mining\nto try to avoid their international obligations towards the\nenvironment. We are particularly concerned that they have\nplaced the interests of investors above the interests of the\nglobal community. We make particular mention of the\ntrend to withhold information from the International\nSeabed Authority under the guise of \u201cconfidentiality\u201d,\n\u201cproprietary interests\u201d, and \u201cinformation of a scientifically\nsensitive nature\u201d: these are merely codes for denying\nglobal communities access to information that might\nallow them to prepare better for disaster prevention and\nother actions needed to protect the environment.\nRegarding nuclear issues, Papua New Guinea,\nconsistent with our shared commitment to a stable,\npeaceful and environmentally safe world, supports the\nobjectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty. Together with our partners in the South\nPacific Forum, we continue to reaffirm our commitment\n20\n\n\nto maintaining the South Pacific region as a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone. We also express our support for the\nother regional nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa, South-\nEast Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, and also\nfor the proposed new initiatives for Central and South Asia.\nWe call on all nuclear-weapon and threshold States to\nstop all testing, manufacturing and stockpiling of these\nweapons and to take steps towards the destruction of all\nnuclear weapons. Indeed, the same principle should apply\nto all weapons of mass destruction.\nThe South Pacific Forum members have always\nmaintained that we have a right to ban transboundary\nmovements of radioactive and other hazardous wastes,\nwithin and through the region. We also continue to share\nthe position that appropriate compensatory mechanisms\nshould be established to compensate victims of past nuclear\ntests and provide compensation for damage resulting from\nany accidents.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm that Papua New\nGuinea is firmly committed to the United Nations Charter;\nto the reforms initiated by the Secretary-General, especially\nthose relating to the Security Council and the\nreconfiguration of the regional groups within the United\nNations system; and to the United Nations decolonization\nprocess and the Noum\u00e9a Accord for the Kanak people of\nNew Caledonia. We support the determination of the United\nNations to work towards a global mechanism for natural-\ndisaster preparedness and prevention; the special session of\nthe General Assembly for the review and appraisal of the\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates; and the management of the oceans and seas.\nPartnership in promoting change is the key to\naddressing the challenges that the world will face in the\ntwenty-first century. I believe that the challenge for all\nMember States is to join together to bring about\ntransparency, accountability and good governance as the\nbasic tenets of this Organization, its organs and subsidiary\nbodies. If this is achieved, the \u201cpeople first\u201d sentiment of\nthe United Nations Charter will be truly embraced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by congratulating\nyou, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on your election as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. This is\nan expression of delegations\u2019 confidence in and high esteem\nfor your diplomatic skills, and reflects also the\ndistinguished role which your country has played in\nfurthering the goals of this Assembly. I assure you of the\nfull support and cooperation of the Tanzanian delegation as\nyou guide the deliberations during this session.\nI wish also to commend your predecessor, Mr. Didier\nOpertti, for ably presiding over the Assembly at its fifty-\nthird session. I congratulate very specially the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\nable and distinguished manner in which he has continued\nto manage and guide the affairs of our Organization in the\nface of many daunting challenges.\nThis last General Assembly session of the century\nand millennium, provides an opportunity to review the\npast and draw lessons from it. We must build on the\npositive, even as we mobilize the individual and collective\nwill to avoid carrying the baggage of poverty, conflict and\nhuman rights violations into the next century. The role of\nthe United Nations system must also be re-examined in\naccordance with the new vision we have for the future.\nThe twentieth century witnessed tremendous\nadvances in science and technology. But the benefits were\nnot shared widely, let alone equally. Unprecedented\neconomic development and prosperity has been attained,\nwith world consumption topping $24 trillion in 1998,\ntwice the level of 1975 and six times that of 1950. But,\non a world scale, the 20 per cent of the world\u2019s people in\nthe highest income countries consumed 86 per cent of the\nworld\u2019s goods and services, producing a corresponding\ndegree of pollution and environmental damage. And a\nwhole fifth of humanity has been left completely out of\nthis prosperity.\nThis century has also experienced major international\nconflicts, particularly the two world wars. The existence\nof a bipolar system driven by ideological differences, and\nthe resultant arms race that led to the abuse of science\nwhich was the development of weapons of mass\n\n\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, exacerbated the\nsecurity situation in the world. To its credit, the United\nNations Organization has laid the foundation and\nframework for the attainment of peace, security,\ndevelopment and human rights. The United Nations actively\nsupported liberation struggles all over the world, and we are\nentering the new millennium having accomplished the\nmission of political decolonization in most countries. Of\nparticular gratification to Africa is the end of apartheid.\nWe have also witnessed the end of the cold war, even\nthough the peace dividend has yet to reach all corners of\nthe globe and include the innocent victims of the cold war.\nFor, as the African proverb has it, when two elephants\nfight, it is the grass that suffers.\nAfrica has unfortunately been left behind in\ndevelopment. Despite the positive macroeconomic\nachievements in recent years, the average African\nhousehold today consumes 20 per cent less than it did 25\nyears ago. Other new, critical challenges facing Africa\ninclude conflicts and the urgent need to consolidate the rule\nof law, human rights and democratic governance.\nThe United Nations in the coming century will be\nmeasured, among other things, by the degree to which these\nissues, particularly the development dimension, are\naddressed. The United Nations, by virtue of its global\nreach, its universal membership and its impartiality, has a\nvital role to play to ensure there is equity between the\nresponse to the challenges facing Africa and those facing\nother parts of the world.\nThe United Nations should also continue its role of\ncoordinating the United Nations system, including the\nBretton Woods institutions, the World Trade Organization\nand regional economic commissions. We reiterate the need\nfor broadening and strengthening the participation of\ndeveloping countries in international decision-making.\nDemocracy and good governance between nations is as\nimportant to humanity as democracy and good governance\nwithin nations.\nProcesses of liberalization and globalization of the\nworld economy have profound implications for Africa and\nother least developed countries in terms of their position in\nthe world economy, their development prospects, the nature\nof their economic policies and their impact on economic\nsovereignty.\nThe community of nations, at the dawn of a new\nmillennium, should rethink the mechanisms and policies\nthat underpin the functioning of the global economy to\ncreate a conducive international environment that ensures\nthe rapid economic development of the least developed\ncountries. We need a system whose pillars are growth,\nstability and social equity, and which should facilitate the\nintegration of least developed countries into the world\neconomy in a beneficial way.\nThese countries, particularly those in Africa, remain\nconstrained by weak supply capabilities, which, when\ncompounded by an unfavourable international economic\nenvironment, limit their ability to benefit from\nglobalization. The trend of the last few years does not\ngive us much comfort. From 1990 to 1996, African\nexports of goods grew by only 2 per cent on average.\nThe long-term objective of our development efforts\nis to improve production of quality goods and services\nthat can meet local needs and be exported. We see trade\nas a dynamic force for accelerating growth and\ndevelopment. We are, however, aware of our limitations\nin producing such products for the international market.\nOur economies still largely rely on the production of\ncommodities, in respect of which terms of trade continue\nto worsen. The issue of commodities should thus continue\nto be central to the international development agenda. In\nparticular, we urge the international community to provide\nresources and technical assistance to countries that depend\non commodities to build the capacity for vertical and\nhorizontal diversification of commodities.\nFurthermore, developed countries and funding\ninstitutions should increase their support to the Common\nFund for Commodities, including fulfilment of their\npledges. The United Nations should also reconsider the\nproposal for the establishment of a special fund to\npromote commodity diversification in Africa.\nWe hope that the Seattle ministerial meeting of the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) will give further\nimpetus to the implementation of measures to assist least\ndeveloped countries to become integrated into the\ninternational trading system in a meaningful way. We call\nupon the donor community to extend financial and\ntechnical assistance towards the implementation of\nintegration frameworks prepared by the least developed\ncountries.\nThe burden of debt is one of the main obstacles to\nthe achievement of the economic and social development\nobjectives of African and other least developed countries.\nThese countries devote a high proportion, in some cases\n2\n\n\nexceeding 30 per cent, of government revenue to debt\nservice payment, with the consequent risk of social and\npolitical instability. We welcome the various debt relief\ninitiatives undertaken by the donor community. They\nprovide some relief, but more far-reaching measures,\nincluding debt forgiveness, need to be taken urgently to\nhave an impact on poverty.\nTanzania welcomes the revisions made to the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative at the\nCologne summit of the Group of Seven. However, if\ngrowth is to be sustained, adequate levels of external\nfunding must complement our economic reform efforts. Nor\nshould debt relief under the HIPC Initiative be a substitute\nfor increased bilateral non-debt-creating aid, and neither\nshould it be financed through reallocation of committed aid.\nTanzania has established a multilateral-debt-relief fund\nto help it service multilateral debt so as to direct the\nsavings to poverty-reducing activities in the social sector,\nsuch as education, health and water services. We have\nshown that it is possible to link debt relief directly to\npoverty eradication initiatives in a transparent and\naccountable manner that involves government, civil society\nand donor countries. The debt relief we have received\nthrough the fund has gone straight to cushioning the social\nsector budget. I want to thank the Governments of\nDenmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway,\nSweden and the United Kingdom, which have contributed\nto our war on poverty by contributing to our multilateral-\ndebt-relief fund account.\nMy delegation is deeply disturbed by the drastic\ndecline in official development assistance to less than one\nthird of the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of\nthe gross national product of donor countries. For five years\ncontinuously, from 1992 to 1997, aid as a percentage of\ngross national product in countries of the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) fell, from\na combined average of 0.33 per cent to an all-time low of\n0.22 per cent. This trend needs to be reversed as a matter\nof urgency.\nBut what is needed is aid that increasingly enhances\nour capacity for ownership of the development agenda and\nprocess, and our capacity to be self-developing. We do not\nwant the kind of aid that takes from us the initiative for\ndevelopment in dignity, and increases rather than reduces\ndependency on aid. Among other things, we need aid that\nwill help us develop an attractive environment for private-\nsector investment, domestic and foreign.\nTechnology is a key factor in the development\nprocess. The recent great strides in technology present\ntremendous opportunities for human development.\nHowever, this technological revolution has largely\nbypassed African and other least developed countries. The\nUnited Nations, and the international community at large,\nshould facilitate and finance access to and transfer of\ntechnology, including new and environmentally sound\ntechnologies, for developing countries on favourable,\nincluding consessional, or grant terms.\nTanzania is working closely with other countries to\nfind a peaceful resolution to conflicts in the Great Lakes\nregion, particularly in Burundi and in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. The Burundi peace process, under\nthe facilitation of Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, is going\nwell in Arusha. The main sticking point is security\narrangements that would instil confidence and trust for\nall, as well as a democratic process involving all\nstakeholders. We hope that these problems will be\nresolved in the coming rounds of talks, so that a peace\nagreement can be reached as soon as possible. The\ninternational community should therefore continue urging\nfull participation by all the key players in the Arusha\npeace process. All attempts to wreck the negotiations,\nunder any pretext, should be discouraged.\nConcerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nit is very encouraging that all the parties involved in the\nconflict have finally signed the Lusaka ceasefire\nAgreement. The challenge ahead is to not let the\nmomentum ebb, but to move expeditiously to implement\nthe truce, including sending and empowering Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) observers and a United Nations\npeacekeeping force, as envisaged.\nAngola continues to experience a fratricidal war\nwaged by rebel UNITA forces against the legal\nGovernment of Angola. Clearly, Jonas Savimbi has\nviolated the Lusaka Peace Agreement and has shown\ncontempt for international opinion. It is counterproductive\nfor the United Nations to remove its observer team from\nAngola, as this would send a negative signal that the\ninternational community is abandoning Angola in its hour\nof need.\nThe most recent summit of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC), held in Maputo,\nexpressed solidarity with the Government of President\nDos Santos and pledged to give him moral and material\nsupport. The international community should likewise be\nforthright in its support for the Angolan Government and\n3\n\n\nin condemning Jonas Savimbi as the war criminal that he\nis. Action commensurate with the gravity of his insolence\nand his human rights abuses should likewise be taken\nagainst him.\nOn Western Sahara, Tanzania is following closely the\npeace process under the United Nations Mission for the\nReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). We hope that\na solution to the crisis will be found through a referendum\nas provided for in the United-Nations-brokered peace\nprocess without any further unnecessary delays.\nMy delegation commends the truces and negotiated\nsettlements reached in the conflicts in Guinea-Bissau, Sierra\nLeone and Liberia, even as we urge practical commitment\nto peace and reconciliation in the Ethiopia-Eritrea war.\nI wish also to commend and encourage the positive\ndevelopments unfolding in Middle East. I urge Chairman\nArafat and Prime Minister Barak to remain committed to\nthe peace process and to move with courage and vision to\nthe next stages that will ensure the durable and shared\npeace and security that has eluded the Palestinian and\nIsraeli people for so long.\nFrom this podium, I denounce the merchants of war\nfuelling conflicts on the African continent. Arms dealers\nshould stop supplying weapons to conflict areas. Countries\nshould adhere to the relevant international conventions\nprohibiting the arms trade, especially between non-state\nentities. It is immoral and unacceptable that natural\nresources such as gold, diamonds, oil and timber, which\nshould be exploited to build a better future for African\nchildren, are being used instead to buy weapons from rich\ncountries and arms dealers, with which to kill and maim\nthose very children and their parents.\nAssociated with conflicts in the Great Lakes region is\nthe problem of refugees. Tanzania has received refugees for\nover 40 years now. As I speak, we still host over 800,000\nrefugees, some in refugee camps and many others in\nsettlement camps and elsewhere in society. We have always\nreceived refugees out of humanitarian concerns in the\nAfrican way and in fulfilment of our international\nobligations. We have never turned away those fleeing to\nsave their lives, and we have never negotiated refugee\nquotas with other countries. Yet even for us, the time\ncomes when we must appeal for more help to give us the\ncapacity to provide succour and refuge to these people. I\npay tribute to the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, Mrs. Ogata, and her colleagues for the efforts\nthey are making to draw international attention to African\nrefugees and displaced persons.\nThe Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has done much,\nbut it can only do as much as the international community\ngives it resources to do. I urge greater support to UNHCR\nand other relief agencies working in Tanzania, and greater\nsupport to my Government.\nA lasting solution to the refugee problem, however,\nlies in resolving the root causes in the refugee-generating\ncountries. This would enable UNHCR to begin the\nrepatriation process, as was done successfully in the case\nof Rwanda three years ago.\nFour years ago, the United Nations established the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha.\nApart from the Tribunal\u2019s early teething problems, the\nGovernment of Tanzania lauds its many precedent-setting\nachievements in the emerging area of international\ncriminal justice. We commend the improvements in the\nefficiency of the Tribunal\u2019s operations and management\nunder its Registrar.\nAs we pledge to continue fully supporting the\nTribunal in accordance with our obligations as the host\ncountry, we call upon the United Nations and the entire\ninternational community to continue providing all\nnecessary support, including resources and manpower,\nuntil the task of prosecuting all culprits in the Rwanda\ngenocide episode is successfully accomplished. A strong\nand clear message must come out of this Assembly that\nno war criminal will ever escape the long arm of\ninternational law.\nTanzania adds its voice to the denunciation of the\nviolent attempts to thwart the fulfilment of the desire of\nthe people of East Timor to be free and sovereign, clearly\nand preponderantly expressed in a free and fair\nreferendum. The results of the referendum must be\nrespected and the Timorese people\u2019s aspirations realized.\nThe international community must assume its\nresponsibility to see this process to a successful\nconclusion. No effort and no sacrifice is too big to be\nmade in that regard. We commend and encourage the\ndecision of the Government of Indonesia to invite and\ncooperate with international efforts under the United\nNations to stop the massacres and mayhem and to ensure\nthat the wishes of the majority of the people of East\nTimor are unequivocally met.\n4\n\n\nWe in Tanzania believe that no national or global\nefforts to eradicate poverty can succeed unless and until\nthey address the specific problems related to the poverty of\nwomen. We urge the United Nations to continue promoting\ngender equality issues, including the provision of resources\nand technical assistance to enhance women\u2019s education,\nhealth and other projects aimed at their empowerment.\nMy Government is striving to make sure that women\nare given opportunity to fully participate in all levels of\ndecision-making and that they get equal access to education\nand access to credits on a preferential basis. We have also\ntaken measures to protect women, girls and children from\nsexual harassment and abuse. Tanzania has most stringent\nlegislation on sexual offences that provides for punishment\nup to life imprisonment. There is also a new Land Law\nproviding for complete gender equality in the ownership,\nuse and disposal of land and which supersedes customary\nland law. There are also laws to protect the rights of\nwomen in marriage, child custody and inheritance, which\nare being reviewed to address all the concerns of women.\nSpecial efforts are also being made to increase the\nenrolment of girls and women at all levels of education.\nThese are challenging times, especially for developing\ncountries. Yet, I believe there is a ray hope for building the\nfoundations of a more equitable and dynamic system of\ninternational development cooperation through the smart\npartnership approach of a \u201cwin-win\u201d outcome for all\nplayers. As we enter the new millennium, I wish to reiterate\nour firm commitment to cooperating with others in\nachieving the goals of the United Nations Charter,\nparticularly those relating to the promotion of economic\ndevelopment and prosperity, peace and security and a better\nworld for present and future generations.\nAs we enter the century of globalization, let all\nGovernments ask the question: Are we globalizing\nprosperity or are we globalizing poverty? Are we striving\nfor the kind of political correctness that eschews affluence\namid poverty or for that which manufactures euphemisms\nfor poverty, pretending it will go away? In a vivid cartoon\nin 1965, Jules Feiffer portrayed the plight of the poor in\nthese words:\n\u201cI used to think I was poor. Then they told me I\nwasn\u2019t poor; I was needy. Then they told me it was\nself-defeating to think of myself as needy; I was\ndeprived. Then they told me that underprivileged was\noverused; I was disadvantaged. I still don\u2019t have a\ndime. But I have a great vocabulary.\u201d\nThat plight of the poor persists equally poignantly to\nthis day. We have spoken much; perhaps too much. The\narchives of this Organization are bursting with studies and\nideas and reviews. Let us strive to do more and talk less\nin the new century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is my honour today to\nconvey to the Assembly the warm greetings and best\nwishes of the Government and people of the friendly\nislands of Fiji.\nOn their behalf, I congratulate the President on his\nelection. He will be interested to know that his great\ncountry, Namibia, is grouped together with my country in\nthe same pool at the Rugby World Cup, which begins in\nWales next month. While we are friendly rivals on the\nrugby football field, we are absolutely confident here that,\nwith his extensive experience, and impressive credentials,\nwe can all look forward to another successful session of\nthe General Assembly.\nWe also express our deep appreciation and gratitude\nto our outstanding Secretary-General and to the members\nof the Security Council for their wise and able\nstewardship of the United Nations over the past year.\nThe priority challenge for the international\ncommunity continues to be to help ensure that there is\n26\n\n\nfreedom and justice and peace and prosperity in every part\nof our common habitat \u2014 the good planet Earth.\nI trust that this session of the General Assembly will\nfocus particular attention on specific issues that bear\ndirectly on our collective responsibility, as Member States\nof the United Nations, in promoting peace, security and\ndevelopment to make our good planet Earth a better and\nsafer place for all its citizens.\nIn this regard, I wish to acknowledge the Government\nof the Republic of Indonesia for its foresight in giving the\npeople of East Timor the freedom to choose their political\nfuture. Now that they have freely made their choice, we in\nFiji join other States Members of the United Nations in\nappealing to the Government of Indonesia to facilitate the\npeaceful and orderly transition of East Timor to full\nnationhood and independence.\nTo enable this, it is crucially important that every\neffort is made to restore law and order and ensure the\nprovision and maintenance of effective security measures to\nallow the people of East Timor to return to their homes.\nThe tragic situation which has arisen there, with the loss of\nhundreds of lives, need not have occurred had the\nIndonesian Government and the military properly exercised\ntheir responsibility to deal decisively with the unlawful\narmed elements.\nAs a member of the United Nations family, Fiji stands\nready to participate alongside other Member States in the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force in East Timor in laying\nthe foundation for lasting peace in that new nation. Also,\nwe call on the international community to provide tangible\nassistance to enable East Timor to put an effective\nGovernment in place and rebuild its shattered economy.\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm Fiji\u2019s continuing\ncommitment to United Nations peacekeeping operations in\nLebanon, Sinai, Bosnia and Kosovo. Within our own\nPacific island region, we remain ready to support and assist\nPapua New Guinea in bringing permanent peace to\nBougainville, as part of a South Pacific Forum regional\npeace mission. In the Solomon Islands, we are ready and\nprepared to cooperate with the Government, at the\ninvitation and under the aegis of the Commonwealth of\nNations, in restoring peace and promoting goodwill and\nunderstanding among the people of this very important\nneighbouring State. In all this, the guiding principle of\nFiji\u2019s participation is respect for the sovereign rights of the\ncountries concerned and maintenance of the democratic\nrights and freedoms of their peoples.\nMaking sacrifices in serving our common interests\nis nothing foreign to us in Fiji, for it is through the\nwillingness of the various constituent communities in our\nmulti-ethnic and multicultural society to make sacrifices\nin order to safeguard our collective future that we have\nsucceeded in constructing an agreed constitutional\nframework for peace and prosperity in our country. We\nunanimously adopted a new Constitution in July 1997 to\nreplace the racially weighted Constitution imposed on our\npeople following the military coups of 1987. Under the\nnew Constitution, general elections were held in May this\nyear. In those free and democratic elections, my\nGovernment was elected into office with a clear,\noverwhelming majority. We decisively won the elections\nbecause our People\u2019s Coalition Party promised policies on\ndevelopment that were focused specifically on addressing\nthe basic needs of the people \u2014 the need for regular\nincome through jobs or business opportunity; the need for\nbetter education and health services; a safe and clean\nwater supply; electricity; good standard of housing at\naffordable prices; safe streets and neighbourhoods; and a\nclean and healthy environment. But above all these was\nthe emphasis we placed on the critical need to bring relief\nand assistance to the poor, to those on low incomes and\nto the growing number of those who, through no fault of\ntheir own, live in dire poverty.\nUnemployment and poverty can be countered\neffectively only when people have the opportunity,\nthrough development, to apply their God-given talents and\nability fully. To promote development we need sustained\neconomic growth, but growth that creates employment\nand opportunities for a wide cross-section of society:\ngrowth that creates wealth for only a few and does not\nreach the masses that live in grinding poverty cannot be\nregarded as being for the national good. We therefore\nneed to promote economic growth for human\ndevelopment: it must be regarded as the right of every\ncitizen in any society to share in the benefits of growth,\ndevelopment and progress \u2014 benefits not just in the form\nof material well-being, but also in the improved quality of\nlife through self-fulfilment and the contentment that\ncomes from service to others and love of one\u2019s\nneighbours and fellow citizens.\nAnd so it is with the global community. The\npromotion of freer international trade for greater growth\nand prosperity must be pursued with a strong sense of\neconomic and social justice. At international gatherings\nsuch as this, we hear high-sounding platitudes and\npromises of international arrangements that would favour\nall nations. Such are the kinds of promises about gains\n27\n\n\nfrom free trade that we hear from the World Trade\nOrganization. In reality, however, opportunities are never\nthe same, let alone equal, given that conditions and\ncircumstances are different, varying from country to\ncountry. It is not surprising, therefore, that international\nagreements genuinely aimed at facilitating freer and\nincreased mutually beneficial international trade have often\nbeen undermined and frustrated by unilateral decisions and\nactions taken to protect vested national economic and\npolitical interests.\nGlobalization and our growing interdependence must\nbe accompanied by a strong and genuine international\ncommitment \u2014 especially by those economies that\ndominate world trade, international finance, technology and\nindustrial production \u2014 to consider special arrangements\nfor the developing economies. The specific aim must be to\ncreate new opportunities for developing countries to earn\nhigher incomes through their own efforts as participants in\nthe global trading system.\nThis is why my country, along with others in the\nPacific, African and Caribbean regions, are deeply grateful\nto the European Union for the special trading and other\narrangements under the Lom\u00e9 Convention. For us in Fiji,\n300,000 of our total population of 800,000 are dependent\nfor their livelihoods, directly and indirectly, on the sugar\nindustry. But it is the sugar protocol of the Lom\u00e9\nConvention with the European Union which is helping to\nsustain the continuing viability of this very important\nindustry, while enabling us to attain the internal efficiencies\nnecessary to enhance our international competitiveness.\nSimilarly, it is the special South Pacific Regional\nTrade and Economic Cooperation Agreement, or\nSPARTECA, which Australia and New Zealand maintain\nwith Pacific island nations, that has been a positive factor\nin increasing Pacific island exports to these two countries.\nThis Agreement has stimulated new industries in the\nmanufacturing sector in our country, has substantially\nincreased our export earnings and has helped create new\nemployment for thousands of our people.\nWe are, of course, grateful for the development\nassistance we are receiving from both bilateral and\nmultilateral donors. I recognize in particular our traditional\ndonors such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the United\nKingdom, the European Union, the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina and many others, along with the various United\nNations development agencies. This development assistance\nhas been of immense value both in our economic and in\nour social development efforts.\nWhile we deeply appreciate all this assistance, we\nalso believe that helping us with increased opportunities\nin trade and investment is the best form of aid \u2014 aid to\nassist us in achieving higher rates of growth and progress\nthrough our own self-reliant capability. We would\ntherefore welcome increased and stronger United Nations\nsupport for global policies that contribute specifically to\nincreased foreign capital investment and assistance to\ndeveloping countries.\nWe have been very disappointed by what we\nperceive to be the lack of genuine commitment by the\ninternational community, especially by bilateral and\nmultilateral donor agencies and the large developed\nmarkets, to respond positively to the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States. This Barbados\nProgramme commitment was made five years ago. I very\nmuch hope, therefore, that the coming special session on\nsmall island developing States will readily agree on a\ncommon regime of international support to assist them in\ntheir efforts to achieve sustainable development.\nIn that regard, my Government welcomes the new\nemphasis by multilateral agencies such as the World\nBank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the\nAsian Development Bank to assist developing economies\nin the eradication of poverty, in enhancing human-\nresource development through better education and health\nfacilities and services and in the improvement and\nexpansion of infrastructure to support increased\ninvestment in the economy by both foreign and local\ninvestors.\nMay I take this opportunity to congratulate the\nKingdom of Tonga, the Republic of Nauru and the\nRepublic of Kiribati on their admission to the United\nNations. Their membership will no doubt add strength and\nresonance to the voice of Pacific Island nations in this\nvery important international forum. But like them, we in\nthe Republic of the Fiji Islands recognize that, in the\nultimate, the United Nations draws its strength from the\nquality of the commitment of every Member State to its\nbasic purpose and mission, as set out in the United\nNations Charter and other related documents.\nArticle 56 of the Charter reminds us all of our\ncollective responsibility. All Member States are to pledge\nthemselves to take joint and separate actions in\ncooperation with the United Nations for the achievement\nof its purposes.\n28\n\n\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights states that we are all endowed with reason and\nconscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of\nbrotherhood. In my country, the Republic of the Fiji\nIslands, we have, in our new Constitution, adopted a\nnumber of very important fundamental principles as the\nbasis for consolidating peace, unity and stability in our\nmultiethnic and multicultural society. In Fiji we believe in\nthe kind of multiculturalism that recognizes the value and\ncontribution of each community and also that cultural\ndiversity serves to enrich our society. But we temper this\nby drawing in and uniting all our citizens through focusing\non our common needs as human beings.\nWe believe deeply and sincerely that it is the duty of\ngovernment \u2014 indeed, of every government \u2014 to give\nequal care and attention to the development needs and\nconcerns of all citizens, irrespective of race, religion,\ngender or economic and social status. These principles and\nthis approach are working for us in Fiji, and I have no\ndoubt that their universal application will also contribute to\ngreater international peace, goodwill and understanding.\nIndeed, as we direct our attention to the beginning of the\nnew millennium, and in particular the proposed millennium\nsummit of the General Assembly in September of next year,\nlet us look to it both with seriousness of purpose and with\na new determination as a unique opportunity to rebuild the\nfoundation for international cooperation.\nMy delegation fully supports the efforts of our\nSecretary-General to reform the Organization. The United\nNations was established fifty-four years ago. To be\nmeaningful, this reform must include a revision of the\nUnited Nations Charter to reflect the realities of today.\nOn the Security Council, this must include an increase\nin both the permanent and non-permanent membership,\nbased on a more equitable representation of the different\ngeographical regions. We also urge that the existing\nregional groupings in the United Nations for the purpose of\nrepresentation in the various organs and specialized\nagencies should be reviewed with a view to reconfiguring\nthem. This is, again, to ensure fair and equitable\nrepresentation of the various geographical regions.\nThe countries from the South Pacific region, for\nexample, are currently split between the Asian Group and\nthe Western European Group. Australia and New Zealand\nare part of the Western European Group. On the other\nhand, Fiji and other island States from the South Pacific are\nmembers of the Asian Group. Such a configuration is not\nonly discriminatory on ethnic lines, it is also, in these\ndays, artificial and irrelevant.\nI believe, therefore, that it is time Member States\nfrom the South Pacific should be allowed to have their\nown distinctive regional grouping in the United Nations.\nIn proposing this, we are not asking for something that is\ntotally new. In fact, this is already the accepted\narrangement in such United Nations agencies as the\nWorld Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization.\nWith regard to its development agenda, the United\nNations, we believe, must give greater attention to its\nresponsibility, under Article 55 of the United Nations\nCharter, on the promotion of international cooperation in\neconomic and social development, with particular\nreference to the needs of developing countries.\nThe World Summit for Social Development at\nCopenhagen in 1995 agreed on 10 main commitments to\nbe part of an international Programme of Action to\nenhance social development, including the eradication of\npoverty in the world through decisive national actions and\ninternational cooperation. We look forward to next year\u2019s\nreview by the United Nations of this very important\nProgramme of Action. As we begin the new millennium,\nlet it be a challenge to the United Nations to recommit\nitself to the very important goal of promoting social\njustice and equity as a top priority in economic\ndevelopment, both within and between nations.\nIt is incumbent on all of us \u2014 the Member States,\nmultilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the\nIMF, and the various United Nations development\nagencies \u2014 to cooperate in taking all appropriate actions\nto create conditions of stability and well-being, which are\nnecessary for peaceful and friendly relations among\nnations.\nAs I have said, our membership of the United\nNations and our attendance here at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly reflect our commitment to the United\nNations Charter on the maintenance of international peace\nand security. I urge all Member States to work together\nto encourage the resolution of disputes and conflicts\nthrough dialogue and the pursuit of consensus. And we\nmust do this always with recognition and respect for\nnational sovereignty and independence.\nAs men and women of goodwill, we have gathered\nhere at the United Nations to reaffirm our common\n29\n\n\ncommitment to promoting a more peaceful world. But let\nus remind ourselves that peace is more than the absence of\nwar or conflict. Peace can be real and enduring only when\nwe all cooperate closely to create conditions for life to be\nlived in freedom and security, and with justice and dignity.\nWe must therefore collaborate and cooperate in\npromoting international trade in goods and services,\nfinancial and technology transfers and development that\nbenefits all countries, big and small, developed and\ndeveloping. And let us act in concert, and with\nresponsibility, in safeguarding and protecting our precious\nnational and global environment.\nIn concluding, I pray to the Almighty to bless us all,\nas children of His divine creation, with His wisdom and\nlove, so that we may live together and relate to each other\nas brothers and sisters, bound together by mutual care and\nconcern for one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to speak\non behalf of the European Union.\nMr. President, I would like to congratulate you upon\nyour election as President of the General Assembly. The\nEuropean Union gives you its full support and\ncooperation throughout this session. Your predecessor,\nMinister Opertti, also deserves our appreciation. I would\nalso commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\nthe skill with which he has steered this Organization. The\nEuropean Union pledges its support also to him, as well\nas its full commitment to the United Nations.\n20\n\n\nI should like to welcome the three new members of\nthe United Nations, the Republics of Kiribati and Nauru\nand the Kingdom of Tonga, into our global family.\nIn overall terms substantial progress has been made in\nhuman development. However, its speed and extent have\nbeen uneven. The United Nations has a primary role in the\nadvancement of human development. Implementation can\nbe carried out only through close cooperation among\ndifferent actors: the United Nations, its Member States, its\nspecialized agencies, international financial institutions,\nregional organizations and civil society.\nWe need an efficient and effective United Nations\nwhich has a stable financial basis and a full commitment\nfrom all its Member States. This also means the full,\nprompt and unconditional payment of contributions to the\nUnited Nations by all. Unilateral decisions and actions to\nthe contrary are not allowed.\nThe globalization of the world economy is an\nunavoidable process. We see the need to put the\nglobalization process and macroeconomic policies in closer\ntouch with the lives of ordinary people. We consider this to\nbe one of the challenges facing the world community on the\nthreshold of the new millennium. The United Nations is\nuniquely positioned to provide intellectual leadership to\nensure that the advantages of economic globalization are\nequally shared by the world\u2019s population. Increasing\ninterdependence must work for people.\nThe nature of crises has also changed. Most of today\u2019s\nconflicts take place within and not between States. We face\nsituations where there are serious democracy deficiencies\nand where human rights are strongly violated, in particular\nthe rights of the minorities. In the worst cases, States with\ntheir traditional institutions have ceased to exist, as\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan described so well in his\nopening statement.\nAt the threshold of a new millennium, we should\nintensify our efforts to prevent these situations. We should\nstart to consider how to elaborate some criteria and rules\naimed at the prevention of humanitarian catastrophes or\nalleviation of profound human suffering.\nThe international community needs to develop\nsolutions and responses to these new and unexpected\nchallenges. The international community must play a\nproactive role in conflict prevention. There are several\nforms of action that have a useful effect in preventing\nconflicts. These include strengthening democracy and\nrespect for human rights, as well as progress in economic\nand social development through good governance. The\nmost important factor in conflict prevention is, however,\na democratic society which is on a steady foundation and\nwhich guarantees human security in its widest possible\nsense. Democratic societies do not go to war with each\nother, and they are also internally more stable.\nEvery human being is entitled to enjoy his or her\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Human rights\nare essential in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, economic development and social equality. The\nUnited Nations has a primary role in the promotion of\nuniversal respect for human rights. These must be further\nintegrated in all United Nations activities. The promotion\nof universal respect for human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms is central also to the activities of the European\nUnion.\nThe tenth anniversary of the adoption of the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child reminds us of the\nneed to advance the rights of the most vulnerable:\nchildren. The European Union welcomes the recent\nadoption of the International Labour Organization (ILO)\nConvention on the prohibition and elimination of the\nworst forms of child labour. All States should ratify the\nConvention as soon as possible and implement it\neffectively. The protection of children affected by armed\nconflicts also requires constant attention. It is imperative\nto adopt without delay the optional protocol to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, on involvement of\nchildren in armed conflict.\nThe European Union is concerned about\ndiscrimination against women. We underline the\nimportance of the international human rights instruments\ndesigned to protect and promote the human rights and\nfundamental freedoms of women. The adoption of the\noptional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of\nAll Forms of Discrimination against Women will be a\nhistoric event in this session. The European Union calls\non all States to give serious consideration to ratifying it.\nTrafficking in human beings violates many of the\nmost basic human rights. Most victims of this practice are\nwomen and children. Concerted international action is\nrequired in the fight against trafficking. The European\nUnion supports the work done to develop international\nstandards to prevent these crimes and to punish the\nperpetrators. Measures must also be taken to help the\nvictims of this type of exploitation.\n21\n\n\nRacism is a universal problem. Thus, the elimination\nof all forms of racial intolerance should be the\nresponsibility of every State. We also want to underline the\ninput by civil society and non-governmental organizations\nin this field.\nThe European Union is committed to opposing the\ndeath penalty. We call on all States that still impose the\ndeath penalty to progressively restrict the offences for\nwhich it may be used, and we insist that it be carried out\naccording to minimum standards. As a first step, a\nmoratorium on executions should be established. The final\naim must remain the complete abolition of the death\npenalty. The European Union will actively pursue this\nmatter in this session.\nNo doubt, sustainable development in all areas\nenhances crisis prevention. People are at the centre of our\nconcerns in sustainable development.\nThe Buenos Aires Plan of Action sets out an ambitious\nand precise timetable to follow in future negotiations on the\nthreat of climate change. However, there are still important\noutstanding questions, such as the Kyoto mechanisms and\ncapacity-building of developing countries, as well as the\ntransfer of technology. In the Intergovernmental Forum on\nForests, our common goal is to promote sustainable forest\nmanagement worldwide. The European Union also notes the\nneed for international coordination on oceans and seas.\nThe European Union is fully committed to reducing\nextreme poverty in developing countries. We support them\nin their efforts to implement the international commitments\nfor sustainable development. International cooperation, as\nwell as ownership by partner countries, is needed to achieve\nthe common goals.\nRelieving the unsustainable debt burden of the poorest\ncountries requires faster relief through the programme for\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. The European Union\nconfirms its full commitment to the high-level discussion\non financing for development. We expect this process to\nincrease the political will to implement internationally\nagreed strategies for sustainable development.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) remains a cornerstone of global security.\nIt is imperative that the four States that have not yet done\nso join the NPT. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT) is a key instrument in the field of nuclear\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. As we are approaching\nthe Conference on the CTBT to be held in October, the\nEuropean Union calls upon all States to sign and ratify\nthe Treaty.\nThe European Union welcomes the entry into force\nof the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction. As the international\ncommunity moves towards the total elimination of anti-\npersonnel landmines worldwide, the recent use of these\nweapons is highly deplorable. We must voice concern\nabout the misery that anti-personnel mines continue to\ncause to the civilian population. The European Union\ncontinues to be the main contributor to demining\nprogrammes worldwide.\nWe are deeply concerned about the impact,\naccumulation and spread of small arms and light\nweapons, and we have intensified our efforts to address\nthis problem. The United Nations conference on the illicit\narms trade in all its aspects should establish a strong\nprogramme of action for international cooperation.\nTerrorism constitutes a threat to internal and\ninternational security. Therefore, the European Union\nreaffirms its unreserved condemnation of terrorism in all\nits forms and continues to support initiatives to suppress\nit. We call upon all countries to sign and to ratify the\ninternational anti-terrorism conventions. We hope that the\nconventions on the suppression of terrorist financing and\non the acts of nuclear terrorism can be adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly by the end of this year. The European\nUnion will look carefully into the proposal of Egypt and\nothers to develop further the idea of a United Nations\nconference on terrorism.\nAs the Secretary-General has said, it would be the\nultimate crime to miss the chance for peace and condemn\npeople to the misery of war. Even the best plans for\nprevention can fail, and the international community has\nto address armed conflicts. These conflicts have human,\nsocial and environmental consequences which cannot be\nrepaired.\nThe international community has a long tradition of\nsolving crises by peacekeeping operations. Now that the\nnature of crises has changed, additional means are needed.\nPeacekeeping operations cannot meet all the requirements\nwithout increased efforts for civilian crisis management.\nIn most crises, societies and their structures are\ncompletely destroyed.\n22\n\n\nThe international community has called for repair and\nrehabilitation. Humanitarian assistance alone is not enough.\nReconstruction of societies requires the presence of civilian\npolice and other administrators from all fields of civil\nactivity. In most cases it is difficult to find the right tools\nto cope with conflicts.\nThe European Union strongly emphasizes civilian\ncrisis management. We hope that it will be more often\nresorted to as the principal means to manage and solve\ncrises. We will work actively to develop further this\nconcept. The European Union is in the process of\nimproving its crisis management capabilities, keeping in\nmind that the primary responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security lies with the United Nations\nand the Security Council.\nRegional organizations have a key role in international\nsecurity. For their success, cooperation with the United\nNations is essential. The European Union thanks the\nSecretary-General for his efforts to strengthen this\ncooperation and urges him to continue this work.\nThe crisis in Kosovo requires concerted efforts. The\nEuropean Union supports the full implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999). With the adoption\nof this resolution, the United Nations regained its relevance\nas far as Kosovo is concerned. We also support the United\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\n(UNMIK) and KFOR in their efforts to ensure peace,\ndemocracy and security in Kosovo. The United Nations\nneeds the means and cooperation of all to fulfil its mandate.\nAt the height of the Kosovo crisis the European Union\nlaunched the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. Its\naim is to address the questions of democracy, human rights,\neconomic reconstruction and security in a comprehensive\nand durable manner. We would welcome the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia joining the Stability Pact as a full\nand equal participant and beneficiary. The current regime\nof Mr. Milosevic is responsible for its present isolation, and\nwe look forward to welcoming democratic change inside\nSerbia. Meanwhile, we are searching for ways in which\nKosovo and the Republic of Montenegro could be made\nbeneficiaries of the Pact.\nIn Kosovo there is an urgent need to put an end to\nhuman suffering. We are concerned about the violence\ntowards minorities, which has resulted in a large number of\nSerbs and Roma people leaving Kosovo. Urgent restoration\nof the rule of law is extremely important.\nThe Middle East remains a top priority for the\ncommon foreign and security policy of the European\nUnion. We find it encouraging that the Middle East peace\nprocess has regained momentum and that the negotiations\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians have started again.\nNegotiations are the only way to find a just and lasting\nsolution to this conflict. We welcome the signing of the\nmemorandum on the implementation of the Wye River\nAgreement. The European Union has consistently assured\nthe parties of its readiness to assist them in their search\nfor peace.\nAll tracks of the peace process should now be\nactivated. We urge the Syrian, Lebanese and Israeli\nGovernments to engage in direct talks. The relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions form an internationally\naccepted basis for peace.\nIt is also important to make progress on the\nmultilateral track. Peace can, and must be, rooted in close\nregional cooperation. The multilateral track and the\nBarcelona process provide good opportunities in this\nregard.\nThe European Union warmly welcomes the result of\nthe popular consultation of the East Timorese people on\n30 August 1999. Indonesia\u2019s commitment to the full\nimplementation of the relevant Agreements is imperative.\nWe are committed to seeing the people of East Timor\nenjoy the independence which they have freely chosen.\nThe European Union pays tribute to the United Nations\nfor the organization of the popular consultation and lauds\nthe courage and extraordinary work of the personnel of\nthe United Nations Mission in East Timor.\nWe condemn in the strongest terms the atrocities in\nEast Timor. The Government of Indonesia retains a\nresponsibility for security in the Territory.\nWe fully support Security Council resolution 1264\n(1999) and welcome the early deployment of the\nmultinational force. We also welcome the participation of\nAsian States in this force. Order, security and the rule of\nlaw must be restored immediately. The attitude of the\nEuropean Union towards Indonesia will depend on the\nimplementation of the undertakings given by the President\nof Indonesia. They should be implemented without delay\nand without conditions.\nWe have agreed, for a period of four months, on an\nembargo on the export of military equipment and other\nequipment which might be used for internal repression or\n23\n\nterrorism. The European Union has also suspended its\nbilateral military cooperation with Indonesia.\nThe European Union stresses the urgent priority to\nremedy the grave humanitarian situation. We will provide\nfurther humanitarian assistance to those in need.\nWe also support the call of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights to convene a special\nsession of the Commission on Human Rights. We call for\nan investigative mission by the Commission.\nEast Timor\u2019s independence must proceed without\ndelay, as provided for in the 5 May Agreements. The\nMember States of the European Union look forward to\nrecognizing East Timor once the process towards\nindependence is completed.\nWe also emphasize our desire to see a strong,\ndemocratic and united Indonesia.\nThe European Union continues to fully support the\nefforts of the Secretary-General towards a negotiated\npolitical settlement of the question of Cyprus. We urge the\ntwo leaders concerned to accept the invitation to\nnegotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General.\nThe Secretary-General has said that the United Nations\ncannot rest until all of Africa is at peace. One third of\nsub-Saharan Africa is presently involved in armed conflicts.\nThe victims of these conflicts are overwhelmingly civilians.\nThe European Union strongly appeals to the parties in these\nand other ongoing conflicts to respect human rights and to\ncooperate with the humanitarian organizations. We will\ncontinue to make all efforts to provide assistance to the\nvictims.\nConcrete measures have been taken to strengthen\nAfrican ownership and capacity to focus on conflict\nprevention and resolution. The European Union is\nsupporting, in close cooperation with the United Nations,\nthe capacity of African organizations in the field of conflict\nresolution and peacekeeping.\nA stable and democratic political environment is\nindispensable for sustainable development. The EU\nwelcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s report on the causes of\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\ndevelopment in Africa, and we look forward to its effective\nfollow-up.\nThe first EU-Africa summit is scheduled to take\nplace in April 2000. This summit is a clear signal of the\nclose cooperation between the EU and the African\ncountries aimed at addressing various, even delicate,\npolitical and socio-economic issues.\nOne of the principal objectives of the Amsterdam\nTreaty is to strengthen the EU\u2019s Common Foreign and\nSecurity Policy. To achieve this we have created new\nunits and instruments to deal with the increasing\nchallenges in the field of foreign policy. In accordance\nwith the Amsterdam Treaty, we are going to consistently\nimprove our capacity for conflict prevention and crisis\nmanagement. The EU will increase its ability to contribute\nto international peace and security, in accordance with the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\nFinally, I should like to say a few words about the\nnext millennium. The Millennium Assembly should give\nnew direction to the renewal of the United Nations. The\nEU supports the overall theme \u201cThe United Nations in the\ntwenty-first century\u201d, proposed by the Secretary-General.\nIn the view of the EU, the focus should be on poverty\neradication in the context of globalization.\nPoverty eradication is a major challenge for the\ninternational community now that the world\u2019s population\nis reaching six billion, with nearly a quarter of that\nnumber still living in poverty. It is one of the greatest\nchallenges left pending at the end of the twentieth\ncentury.\n24\n\n\nWith the new millennium, we should also recognize\nthe increased importance of civil society in the search for\nsolutions. This is one of the cornerstones of the new era in\ninternational cooperation."

        "file_text": "It is\nmy pleasure to express my sincere congratulations to\nMr. Gurirab on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. His election\nto this eminent position reflects the appreciation of the\ninternational community for him personally and for the\npositive role played by country, Namibia, in the\ninternational arena. I am confident that his presidency at\nthis session will be an effective factor in achieving the\nobjectives to which the international community aspires\nunder the present critical circumstances.\nI would like to take this opportunity to convey to\nMr. Didier Opertti, Foreign Minister of Uruguay and\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession, our appreciation, esteem and praise for his\neffective, wise and objective conduct of the Assembly\u2019s\nwork. I am also pleased to express my appreciation and\nesteem to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, who manages the affairs of this\ninternational Organization with great competence born of\nexperience and who makes continuous efforts and\npersistent endeavours to achieve peace, security and\nstability in our modern world.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is also pleased to\nwelcome the admission of the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to the\nmembership of the United Nations and hopes that their\nadmission will further enhance the effectiveness of the\nOrganization in achieving the noble goals it was created\nfor.\nSome years have passed since we celebrated the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. That\ncelebration was a glorious occasion on which we\nreviewed the purposes and principles of this international\nOrganization and the opportunities and challenges it had\nfaced over the previous decades. We also reviewed its\nachievements in maintaining world peace and security and\nthe difficulties and obstacles that it managed to deal with\nand overcome through the belief of its Members and the\nnobility of its ideals and objectives. The existence of this\nOrganization, and its ability to find solutions to many of\n32\n\n\nthe problems that have rocked our turbulent world, despite\nall the challenges it has faced, makes us all the more\nconvinced of the vitality of its role, a role that has become\nmore pressing and urgent due to recent developments in the\nworld.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as a founding Member\nof this Organization, continues to hold the same ideals and\nvalues that motivated it to join this universal effort with the\nother founding Members. The founders called for the\nrejection of war and the establishment of peace and for\nconstructive cooperation among all peoples of this world.\nThis was after a series of disasters and catastrophes had\noverwhelmed the human race during two destructive world\nwars that claimed millions of lives and left behind\ndevastation and ruin.\nWars and military confrontations are no longer thought\nof as politics or diplomacy by other means. Violence and\nwarfare with modern lethal weapons can never be an\neffective means to attain political ends, nor a viable\napproach to achieving diplomatic gains. In today\u2019s world\nthere is no victor in any military confrontation.\nOur Organization\u2019s objective of achieving cooperation\nin social and economic areas among peoples of the world\nis no longer a mere wish or luxury; in fact, it has become\nan unavoidable necessity as a result of recent political and\neconomic developments, as well as of major advances and\nrevolutions, unprecedented in human history, in technology\nand communications. As a result of these changes and\ndevelopments, the world has been transformed from a vast\ncollection of entities and multilateral trends and patterns\ninto a village in which every part is affected by what ails\nthe other part. These parts are interdependent as regards\nmany of their vital needs and environmental conditions. The\nconcept of globalization, which has become an integral part\nof our daily discourse, is nothing more than a condensed\nformula for the intellectual and existential changes that have\novertaken the lives of our people and the work of States in\nthe last two decades. If we are going to deal with this\nphenomenon in a way that emphasizes the positives and\ndiscards the negatives, we must adjust to it by developing\nour institutions and procedures.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia confirms, as it always\nhas in the past, its steady commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and would\nlike to reiterate the need for supporting this Organization\nand its specialized agencies. They provide a viable\nframework for cooperation between countries and peoples\nfor facing the tidal wave of globalization. The Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia also emphasizes once again that the ability\nof this international Organization to resolve global\nproblems and to fulfil its basic responsibilities depends\nvery much on the political will of the Member States to\nimplement the principles, ideals, visions and expectations\nembodied in the Organization\u2019s Charter. What is meant\nby political will here is the degree to which each Member\nState is ready to carry out its commitment, adhere to the\nletter of the Charter of the United Nations and submit its\nconduct to the rules of the Charter. In this regard, my\nGovernment is quite cognizant of the importance of\nmodernizing the agencies of our Organization in a manner\nthat enables the Organization to play its required role and\nto deal with the new developments that are taking place\nin contemporary international relations.\nThe Security Council, being responsible for\npreserving international peace and security, remains the\npivot around which different kinds of ideas for reform are\nbeing expressed. In this regard, my country\u2019s point of\nview continues to be based on a deep conviction that any\nrestructuring of the Security Council must endeavour to\nimprove its capabilities to perform effectively its role\nunder the Charter and to be more active in implementing\nits own resolutions and in dealing with international\ncrises. In addition, the policies of the Council should\nharmonize with the will of the General Assembly in a\nmanner that achieves the required balance and the desired\nobjectivity.\nThe General Assembly resolution declaring 2001 the\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations\nmanifests the desire of the international community to\nenter the third millennium firmly resolved to see\nharmony, justice and equality prevail among nations. It\nalso shows the Assembly\u2019s desire for everyone to\nparticipate in building a world that is balanced in terms of\ninterests and mutual benefits in which people enjoy\nequitable living conditions free from fear, terror, hunger\nand poverty; a world in which the principles of justice,\ntriumph and peace and prosperity are available to all. The\ndialogue among civilizations is the ideal alternative to\ntheories of conflict and of the inevitable clash of\ncivilizations. This compels us to affirm the importance of\ndialogue and harmony among nations and the need to\nobserve differences in the nature of societies and in their\nbeliefs, and to respect peoples\u2019 and nations\u2019 freedom of\nchoice, as well as the need to abide by the rules of\ninternational law.\nThis Organization, in both the Security Council and\nthe General Assembly, has been preoccupied throughout\n33\n\n\nits history with the Middle East question and the\nachievement of a permanent and comprehensive solution to\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict. When, in Madrid at the end of\nOctober 1991, the peace process was launched \u2014 with all\nits bilateral and multilateral tracks and on the basis of\nprinciples accepted by all parties to the conflict \u2014 everyone\nbelieved that a new era of peace, stability and growth was\nlooming and that this era would put an end to the phase of\nwars and conflicts that had exhausted the energies and\ncapabilities of the peoples of the region. In fact, the peace\nprocess in all its aspects did move forward and some\nprogress has been achieved, especially on the Palestinian\nand Jordanian tracks. The multilateral talks relating to\nregional cooperation also gained some ground. The peace\nprocess then suffered from paralysis and reached an\nimpasse due to the policies and practices of the former\nIsraeli Government, and in spite of the fact that the Arabs\nhad declared peace an irrevocable strategic choice.\nHowever, this did not change the practices of the former\nIsraeli Government and its disregard for the principles of\nthe peace process, nor remedy its failure to fulfil its\nobligations under the agreements signed with the\nPalestinians, including the Wye River Memorandum.\nAt present there is an attempt to revive the peace\nprocess. Assurances issued by the new Israeli Prime\nMinister indicate that he intends to activate the peace\nprocess on all tracks. The Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum,\nsigned on 4 September of this year, could be a good step if\nfollowed by similar steps to move the process towards the\nbases and principles that were established at the Madrid\nConference \u2014 the principle of land for peace, first and\nforemost.\nOn the Palestinian track, peace requires withdrawal\nfrom the occupied territories and the restoration of all the\nlegitimate national rights of the Palestinians, including their\nright to establish their own independent State with\nJerusalem as its capital. The final status issue of Jerusalem\nshould be addressed in accordance with Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 252 (1968). Jerusalem is part of\nthe occupied territories, and Israel should refrain from\nundertaking any unilateral measures that prejudice the status\nof that sacred city. It is imperative and natural that any\ncomprehensive and permanent settlement address the issue\nof the return of the Palestinian refugees, in accordance with\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III). It should also\naddress the issues of the release of prisoners, settlements\nand water resources, among others.\nAs for the Syrian track, negotiations should resume at\nthe point where they left off because of a decision of the\nprevious Israeli Government. It is well known that Syria\nremains willing and prepared to reach a comprehensive\nand permanent solution based on the principle of land for\npeace.\nThe Lebanese track is subject to Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978), which calls for the immediate and\nunconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces from\nsouthern Lebanon and western Bekaa.\nMore than nine years after Iraq\u2019s aggression against\nthe State of Kuwait, it is still procrastinating on the\nimplementation of crucial parts of the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions. The Iraqi people are still paying the\nprice for crimes committed by their regime and for its\ncontinual challenges to international legality. In spite of\nall Arab and international initiatives and proposals aimed\nat finding an effective mechanism and process to lift the\neconomic sanctions imposed on Iraq and to end the\nsuffering of the Iraqi people, the Iraqi Government has\nnot responded in a manner that might help move matters\nin the right direction.\nWhat encourages the Iraqi Government to continue\nmanoeuvring and procrastinating is the fact that the\nSecurity Council itself is unable to take action due to the\ninability of its permanent members to agree on a common\napproach and on the proposals under discussion. These\nproposals are aimed at finding a way out of the current\ncrisis by reviving the inspection and monitoring of banned\nIraqi weapons and at regulating the present and future\nrelations between Iraq and the United Nations. No matter\nwhat the circumstances, Iraq should be required to fully\nimplement all international resolutions relating to its\naggression against Kuwait and to cooperate seriously with\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross to achieve\nthe release of all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners and\ndetainees, as well as the restitution of Kuwaiti property.\nIt should also refrain from all provocative or\naggressive acts against the State of Kuwait and other\nneighbouring countries, in compliance with Security\nCouncil resolution 949 (1994), and prove its peaceful\nintentions towards its neighbours in word and deed. This\nis the proper way to put an end to the human suffering\nfor which the Iraqi regime bears sole responsibility. The\npain which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its sisterly\ncountries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) feel\ntowards such human suffering is commensurate only with\ntheir keenness to preserve the independence, unity and\nterritorial integrity of Iraq.\n34\n\n\nRelations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the\nGulf Cooperation Council member States have lately been\nbuoyed by the positive attitude of the Iranian Government.\nYet, there remain outstanding issues to be resolved,\nparticularly that of the three United Arab Emirates islands\nof Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. The GCC\nForeign Ministers, with the approval and blessing of the\nUnited Arab Emirates Government, decided to refer the\nmatter to a tripartite committee entrusted with creating a\nclimate conducive to direct negotiations between the United\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. This trend\nreflects the desire of the United Arab Emirates to resolve\nthe outstanding issues in a positive spirit. We feel\noptimistic about this issue in the light of the demonstrated\ndesire of President Mohammad Khatami to open a new\nchapter in Iran's relations with the Gulf countries,\ncharacterized by good-neighbourliness, non-interference in\ninternal affairs and constructive cooperation to the benefit\nand interest of both sides.\nJust when it seemed that the problem of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina was resolved in accordance with the provisions\nof the Dayton Accords \u2014 which laid the ground for\nBosnian independence and sovereignty, paved the way for\nthe return of refugees, provided for the pursuit and arrest of\nofficials responsible for the crimes of ethnic cleansing and\ngenocide, and the establishment of domestic peace \u2014 the\nBalkan region witnessed a crisis in Kosovo no less\ndevastating in its human dimensions than that in Bosnia.\nLike the Bosnians, the Kosovars were exposed to ethnic\ncleansing, genocide, repression, intimidation and forced\ndeportation at the hands of Serbian forces as the world\nwatched. Once again, the United Nations faced the problem\nof dealing with a dangerous situation that threatened the\nentire Balkan region. This situation was reversed only by\nthe intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nforces after Serbia refused to accept the provisions of the\nRambouillet agreement.\nResort to military force without a United Nations\nmandate to resolve such problems might not be the ideal\nway to settle international crises, but it becomes an\nunavoidable necessity whenever the Security Council, due\nto disunity and disagreements between its permanent\nMembers, fails to fulfil its role in maintaining world peace\nand security. We hope that this pattern will not be repeated,\nso that the United Nations may preserve its dignity and\nintegrity.\nMany regions of the world remain plagued by wars,\nregional and ethnic conflicts, border disputes and national\nand tribal conflicts. Fighting between the Afghan factions\nstill rages, denying Afghanistan and its people the fruits\nof liberation from foreign occupation. It is regrettable to\nsee that some have exploited the current situation in\nAfghanistan to turn the country into a terrorist haven and\ntraining base, thereby contributing to the country's\ninsecurity and instability and exposing the Afghan people\nto more suffering. My country supports the efforts of the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of Islamic\nConference to re-establish peace and security throughout\nAfghanistan.\nThe Pakistani-Indian conflict over Jammu and\nKashmir remains a source of tension and instability\nbetween the two neighbourly countries, especially after\nthe recent military escalation between them. We call on\nboth sides to exercise utmost restraint and to settle the\nconflict through negotiations in compliance with United\nNations resolutions, which recognize the right of the\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir to self-determination.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been following\nwith great concern the latest developments in East Timor.\nWhile it welcomes the positive stand taken by the\nIndonesian Government, especially its cooperation with\nthe United Nations, it wishes to affirm the need to respect\nthe regional sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia and\nthe importance of peace and security throughout the\nregion.\nThe scenes of fighting and armed conflict between\nbrothers in Africa, especially in the Horn, are a source of\npain to us. These conflicts will only deepen wounds and\nenlarge the circle of poverty and distress. In this regard,\nwe still have high expectations in the wisdom of the\nleaders of that great continent to consider the ultimate\ninterests of their nations and to resolve conflicts through\npeaceful means.\nThe international community was pleased to put an\nend to the Lockerbie issue, which caused much suffering\nfor Libya and its people. We look forward to a Security\nCouncil resolution that would lead to a final lifting of all\nsanctions imposed on Libya by virtue of its positive\nreaction to international appeals and its adherence to all\nconditions related to this issue.\nI would also like to praise the people of Algeria for\nthe great mandate they gave their new leadership to move\nforward with the suggested reconciliation plan that aims\nat ending the era of differences and violence, which was\nextremely painful for the fraternal people of Algeria.\n35\n\n\nThe Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy\nMosques is keenly interested in the ongoing efforts to\neliminate weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East,\nincluding the Arabian Gulf region. This is demonstrated\nthrough its support for the efforts of the Arab League at its\n101st session, which called for making that sensitive part of\nthe world a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction,\nbe they nuclear, chemical or biological. In this respect, we\nare greatly concerned about Israel's continued refusal to\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT), thus keeping its nuclear programmes\noutside the range of international inspections and\nconstituting a serious threat to the region's security.\nWe believe in the urgent need to increase the\neffectiveness of the NPT through the activation and\nuniversalization of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency's safeguards system. We also find it extremely\nimportant to establish the necessary controls and measures\nthat would assist in achieving progress in all areas of the\ncomprehensive disarmament of all weapons of mass\ndestruction, in conformity with General Assembly\nresolution 1 (I) of 1946.\nThe scourge of terrorism, which strikes\nindiscriminately throughout the world, has become an\ninternational phenomenon with grave consequences,\nrequiring systematic international efforts to contain and\ncombat it. The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia has regularly condemned terrorism in all its forms,\nlending its voice to international efforts aimed at combating\nthis dangerous phenomenon. What needs to be emphasized\nhere is that violence and terrorism are universal phenomena\nnot restricted to a certain people, race or religion. Precisely\nbecause of the comprehensiveness and universality of\nterrorism, the only way to combat it effectively is through\nunified and collective international action within the\nframework of the United Nations, which alone can put an\nend to terrorism, save the lives of innocent people and\npreserve the independence and sovereignty of the countries\nof the world. Fighting terrorism calls for international\ncooperation against sheltering terrorist groups and\nindividuals, thereby preventing them from exploiting the\nterritories and laws of the States where they live to pursue\ntheir destructive activities, regardless of their pretexts and\narguments.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considers environmental\nissues and environmental protection of key importance, as\nevidenced by their prominent place in our domestic and\nforeign policies. This is because we believe that a safe\ndecent life for mankind is directly connected to the\nenvironment. That is why the Kingdom has actively\nparticipated in all relevant conferences and international\ngatherings, symposiums and arrangements. We have also\nbecome party to several regional and international\nagreements that are geared towards this cause. We only\nhope that international efforts related to the problems of\nthe environment will be formulated in a balanced and\nobjective manner based on serious scientific facts and\nstudies that take into account development needs in the\ndeveloping world. We call upon all States to abide by\nAgenda 21. We also urge the industrialized States in\nparticular to live up to their obligations regarding the\ntransfer of environment-friendly technology to the\ndeveloping nations.\nThe emerging phenomenon of globalization, which\nis forcing geographic borders to recede and sovereignty\nand political barriers to disappear, has become an issue to\nwhich all nations must adjust. We are required now, more\nthan ever before, to address this phenomenon in a way\nthat brings about a world of balanced interests, mutual\nbenefits and equal opportunities for all. If we are to\nachieve this goal, the developing nations must redouble\ntheir domestic environmental efforts in order to catch up\nwith the global economy. They are further called upon to\nintensify their efforts to remove the barriers that hinder\ntheir integration into the multifaceted world trade system.\nThey are also required to adjust their economic policies\nand to establish the infrastructures necessary for their\nmanufactured goods to meet the standard specifications of\nthe importing countries.\nIn return, industrial and economically developed\nnations should contribute to the fulfilment of the desired\ngoals in the following ways: first, by displaying greater\nflexibility in the conditions of admission to the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) by giving developing\ncountries longer interim periods that are in line with their\ndevelopment needs and to help them adjust their systems\nand laws to the requirements of membership; secondly, by\ngiving developing countries enhanced opportunities to\nbenefit from the system of general preferences, to expand\ndistribution of their products and to provide guarantees\nfor greater stability and transparency in the regimes\ngoverning those products; thirdly, by limiting the\nimposition of protective measures by industrialized\nnations on major imports from developing nations that\nhinder their integration into world markets and reduce\ntheir ability to compete, and removing the obstacles faced\nby developing countries; and fourthly, ensuring that\nindustrial nations carry out their obligations to developing\ncountries, as set forth in the Uruguay Round and in the\n36\n\n\nWTO agreements, by providing direct and indirect\nassistance and restructuring or forgiveness of debts. The\nindustrialized nations should also open their markets to the\ndeveloping nations\u2019 exports and refrain from adopting\nunjust procedures to limit the size and flow of such exports.\nIn this context, it is worth noting that the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia has been at the forefront of contributions to\nthe promotion and development of developing countries,\nwhether bilaterally or multilaterally. In the same vein, and\nin view of the Kingdom\u2019s desire to shape future trends in\nthe world economy, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has\napplied for admission to the WTO and hopes, God willing,\nto gain the support of friendly nations in order to finalize\nthe admission procedure as soon as possible.\nAs we prepare for the third millennium, we are\noverwhelmed by different feelings and emotions. In view of\nthe conflicts and the social, economic, cultural and\nenvironmental challenges that we currently face, optimism\nis mixed with pessimism about the future of our world in\nthe coming historical period. If the purpose of creating the\nUnited Nations was to convert the logic of war and\nconfrontation into the language of dialogue and cooperation,\nat a time when the cost of using military force has become\nexorbitant and the outcome uncertain, we now live in a new\nperiod full of signs that require us to work together as hard\nas possible and to cooperate not only in the face of political\nand military challenges, but also in confronting the new\nchallenges of contemporary life, with all its complexities\nand complications, which can only be solved or managed\nthrough organized collective efforts.\nOur firm belief that the United Nations can play a\nmajor role in dealing with current issues and enhancing\ninternational cooperation in order to resolve and contain\nthese issues makes us more determined than ever to support\nthis Organization and endorse its constructive role. One of\nthe valuable lessons we have learned from United Nations\nactivities is the need to enable our Organization to detect\ncrises and to move to contain them before they erupt by\napplying preventive diplomacy to the fullest extent. Moving\nto manage crises before they grow is the best way to avoid\ntheir harmful consequences and repercussions.\nIn conclusion, I must re-emphasize a basic fact: in\norder to solve today\u2019s problems it has become vitally\nnecessary for us to cooperate in a spirit of total disinterest,\nobjectivity and responsibility. The future of the United\nNations, which is also our future, depends on this.\nAllah says in the Holy Koran:\n\u201cHelp ye one another\nIn righteousness and piety,\nBut help ye not one another\nIn sin and rancour\u201d.\n(The Holy Koran, V:2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are\nconfident that under your able leadership we will be able to\naddress successfully the items on our agenda.\nPlease allow me also to convey our appreciation to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his considerable\ncontribution to the work of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session.\nWe pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his\nefforts to meet the unprecedented and complex challenges\nfacing the United Nations.\nOn the threshold of the third millennium \u2014 as at the\nbeginning of this century \u2014 the world community must\ndeal with substantive issues of war and peace. On the one\nhand, the process of globalization, which is unfolding\nbefore our eyes, has triggered a rich flow of ideas, capital,\ntechnologies, goods and services all around the world,\nhaving profoundly transformed our societies.\nPhilosophically, mankind has taken a big step forward\ntowards qualitatively new dimensions of existence.\nOn the other hand, the world continues to be rocked\nby conflicts rooted in causes that have become compounded\ndespite the advent of global technologies and\ncommunications. First among the causes of conflict is\nethnic, national and religious intolerance. It is absolutely\nunacceptable that this most dangerous virus is spreading\nrapidly throughout many regions of today's world, giving\nrise to terrorist acts and bloody conflicts. The danger is that\npeople affected by conflicts look for the sources of their\ntroubles among other nationalities and religions. As a result,\nwe face a vicious circle wherein death and desperation\nreign unchecked. We are confident that civilized society, by\npooling its resources, will eventually be able to break out\nof this vicious circle, having convinced people of the\nbenefits of a conflict-free existence. If we talk about the\nantagonism between war and peace, then we have every\nright to demand the use of means to enforcing a\nsustainable peace, including military means.\nAt the same time, it is impossible to ignore the fact\nthat the present world order is in desperate need of\nreliable measures to ensure balance between the essential\nelements of its support structures. Kazakhstan shares the\nview of those States which believe that in the next\ncentury the world should be multi-polar and free of\ncentres of power and dividing lines, confrontations and\nshowdowns, interference in the internal affairs of others\nand imposition of policy directives. Cooperation and\nmutual understanding, democracy and sustainable\ndevelopment will define the core of the coming world\norder.\nWe believe that the United Nations remains a unique\nintergovernmental institution that ensures a positive trend\nin the development of international relations. Kazakhstan\ncalls for a strengthening of the United Nations, the only\nforum that is universal both in terms of its composition\nand in terms of the comprehensiveness of its agenda.\nOnly the United Nations has the right to address\nfundamental issues of peace and security.\nThe Yugoslav crisis has clearly demonstrated how\nurgent the issue of strengthening the authority of the\nUnited Nations has become. We are becoming\nincreasingly convinced of the need to enhance the\nresponsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance\nof international peace and security and to make\nauthorization of certain actions its exclusive prerogative.\nThe nature of many conflicts makes this an\nespecially challenging task. That is why we believe that\nto be able to adapt to new political realities, the Security\nCouncil should enter the twenty-first century renewed and\nstrengthened through the admission of new permanent\nmembers, first of all Japan and Germany, as well as non-\npermanent members representing different regions of the\nworld.\nThe efforts to consolidate the international regime\nfor the non-proliferation of all weapons of mass\ndestruction and put in place effective controls over the\nproduction of fissile material remain at the centre of our\npolicy for achieving global security and stability.\nKazakhstan has made an important contribution to\nnon-proliferation and to putting an end to nuclear-weapon\ntesting. We consider the decision to admit Kazakhstan to\n21\n\n\nmembership of the Conference on Disarmament as adequate\nrecognition of our actions in this direction. Renunciation of\nnuclear weapons and accession to the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nhave become natural choices for our country, which has felt\nthe full brunt of the harmful effects of nuclear testing.\nKazakhstan vigorously advocates further consolidation of\nthe non-proliferation regime, and supports the initiative to\nestablish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia.\nOur country has consistently called for the creation of\nsecurity structures in Asia. As is well known, at the\nAssembly's forty-seventh session, the President of\nKazakhstan, Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev, put forward an\ninitiative to convene a Conference on Interaction and\nConfidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA). On 14\nSeptember, the opening day of the current General\nAssembly session, after seven years of negotiations and\ndiscussions, Almaty hosted the first meeting of the Foreign\nMinisters of the Asian States members of the Conference.\nGovernment officials responsible for foreign policy signed\na Declaration of Principles Guiding Relations between\nCICA Member States which confirmed the Asian States'\nstrong commitment to and goodwill towards efforts to\nensure security and stability in the region.\nThus, for the first time in history, a legal foundation\nfor an Asian security system has been laid. It is difficult to\noverestimate the significance of this development in the\ncontext of the international community's efforts to\nstrengthen international security. We are talking here about\na region that is home to more than 3.5 billion people and\nthat accounts for more than 40 per cent of world trade.\nWe are grateful to all the States participating in the\nCICA process for their support for our initiative and for\ntheir genuine willingness to work together to build a\nsecurity system for Asia. I take this opportunity to express\nour appreciation to Secretary-General Annan, for his close\nattention to and support for the initiative by Kazakhstan.\nRecent political developments attest to how urgent the\nneed is to create a security system in Asia. I refer here to\nterrorist incursions in southern Kyrgyzstan and to terrorist\nacts in the Northern Caucasus in Russia.\nFrom the point of view of security in our region, we\nbelieve that the outcome of the latest summit of the\n\u201cShanghai Five\u201d is very important. Its participants created\na mechanism of confidence providing for transparency in\nmilitary activity and reduction of those activities in border\nareas, settlement of border issues and a regular exchanges\nof information on military activities. The heads of the five\nStates believe that multipolarity reflects a general trend in\nthe development of the contemporary world and\ncontributes to the long-term stability of the international\nsituation.\nKazakhstan calls for a lasting and just peace in\nAfghanistan within the negotiation process, according to\nthe \u201csix plus two\u201d formula. At the same time, we believe\nthat the Afghan peace process should involve all the\nStates concerned. For this reason, Kazakhstan supports the\nproposal to convene a representative international\nconference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, on the settlement of\nthe conflict in Afghanistan.\nKazakhstan highly appreciates the United Nations\nefforts to promote the integration of the economies in\ntransition into the world economy. Our country counts on\ncontinued cooperation with the United Nations on the\nissues of consultative services and technical assistance.\nWe are firmly committed to the policy of deepening\nregional economic cooperation and actively using for this\npurpose the capacity of the United Nations. Our country\nis satisfied with its cooperation with the Economic\nCommission for Europe and the Economic and Social\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific in the elaboration\nand implementation of the Special Programme for the\nEconomies of Central Asia.\nWe support the revival of the Silk Road.\nGeographically, Kazakhstan, along with other Central\nAsian States, plays the role of a bridge connecting the\ntwo continents. During the era of the Roman Empire trade\nroutes between Rome and Shanghai passed through the\nregion. The revival of the Silk Road will boost the\neconomic development of the Central Asian region.\nIn current conditions it is envisioned that the Silk\nRoad will be revived by building on three pillars: energy,\na transcontinental transportation system and\ntelecommunications. The thrust of this project \u2014 which\nreflects global, regional and local interests \u2014 is to\ndevelop the natural resources of the region, first of all its\nlarge oil and gas fields. One has to bear in mind,\nhowever, that no large-scale pipeline project can be\nrealized without the hydrocarbon resources of Kazakhstan.\nIn view of the increased competition in the world\nenergy-carriers markets, Kazakhstan is giving priority\nattention to the construction of oil and gas pipelines. The\nnorthern Caspian pipeline consortium project, scheduled\nfor completion in 2001, is a top priority for our country,\n22\n\n\nbecause when it is operational Kazakhstan will be able to\ndouble, at a minimum, both its oil production and its export\ndeliveries to foreign markets.\nWe pin many of our hopes on the development of the\nhydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea shelf. For this\nreason we believe that the issue of the legal status of this\nsea is of fundamental importance. Kazakhstan commends a\nbreakthrough agreement with Russia on the delimitation of\nthe seabed in the northern part of the Caspian Sea on the\nbasis of a modified median line.\nThe issues of sustainable development, environmental\nprotection and rehabilitation of ecological disaster areas\nhave become especially pressing at the end of this century,\nand demand immediate action. Kazakhstan is interested in\nthe mobilization of the international community to solve\nenvironmental problems, because it has disaster areas, such\nas the region of the former Semipalatinsk nuclear testing\nground, the dying Aral Sea and other zones. Our country,\nwhich suffers from desertification and floods, is also\ndirectly affected by global climate changes.\nOn behalf of the Government of Kazakhstan, I would\nlike to express our great appreciation to the States\nconcerned for their support for the efforts to overcome the\nserious social, ecological and humanitarian problems of the\nSemipalatinsk region. The adoption of two General\nAssembly resolutions on international cooperation and\ncoordination for the human and ecological rehabilitation and\neconomic development of the Semipalatinsk region has\nundoubtedly contributed to an interest in and reflection on\nthe outstanding issues.\nSpecial words of appreciation are due to the\nGovernment of Japan and the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) for sponsoring an international\nconference convened at the beginning of September in\nTokyo. The outcome of this representative forum\nreverberated throughout our country. We consider this\nconference a practical contribution by the Government of\nJapan and the UNDP to the implementation of the relevant\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. In this regard, I cannot miss\nthis opportunity to recognize important work by the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations\nChildren's Fund, the United Nations Population Fund and\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization, as well as by the donor countries that acted\nas cosponsors of the conference.\nKazakhstan is taking concrete steps to democratize its\nsociety and to deepen its political reforms. Kazakhstan's\nhead of State has introduced a programme that covers\nsuch important areas as elections, political parties, the\nParliament, the judicial system, the status of women and\nthe mass media. Earlier this year the first open and\ncontested presidential elections were held in Kazakhstan.\nThe refinement of the election process continues.\nThe law on elections has been amended to reflect the\nrecommendations of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe. Its provisions will be used in the\nparliamentary elections scheduled for this October. The\nelection process is becoming more representative,\nencouraging active involvement of candidates and voters.\nA programme of phased transition to holding elections for\nlocal and regional governments is being developed. The\nrole of non-governmental organizations, an important\nelement of a civil society, is being enhanced. The judicial\nsystem and the mass media are steadily becoming more\nindependent.\nAchieving an open society, with a market economy,\nis the course for Kazakhstan's further development. The\nprocess of democratization in our country is gaining\nmomentum and has become irreversible.\nAlong with political reforms, Kazakhstan is taking\nvigorous actions to protect the long-term interests of\nforeign investors. Our objective is to ensure \u2014 through\nthe creation of a favourable investment climate in the\ncountry \u2014 its full integration into the world economic\nsystem of today.\nKazakhstan expresses support for the efforts of the\nSecretary-General to reform the Organization in order to\nenhance its effectiveness and capability to respond\nadequately to emerging problems and challenges. We\nbelieve that concrete results in the renewal of the\nOrganization can be achieved only through joint efforts of\nall Member States. That is why all States should continue\ntheir coordinated efforts to strengthen the role of the\nUnited Nations in the promotion of global stability and\nsecurity in the next century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first of all congratulate\nyou, Mr. President, on your unanimous election to preside\nover the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Only\na few years ago, the United Nations was actively involved\nin the decolonization of then South West Africa, now\nNamibia. Today, it is with a great sense of pride, therefore,\nthat we see not only an old freedom fighter but also a\nconsummate diplomat from Namibia presiding over the last\nsession of the General Assembly of the second millennium\nand ushering in the beginning of the third. I have no doubt\nwhatsoever that with your vast experience you will steer\nthis historic session to a successful conclusion. You can rest\nassured of the full support and cooperation of the Gambian\ndelegation in carrying out your important assignments.\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\noutgoing President, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for the\nbusiness like manner in which he conducted the fifty-third\nsession, an eventful period indeed, characterized by far-\nreaching decisions in areas of common concern to the\ninternational community.\nIn the same vein, I would like to commend our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the exemplary\nway in which he has been handling the affairs of our\nOrganization.\nToday, the membership of our Organization stands\nat the impressive figure of 188. In this connection, I\nwould like, on behalf of the Government and the people\nof the Gambia, and indeed on my own behalf, to\ncongratulate the Republic of Nauru, the Republic of\nKiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga on their admission to\nmembership in the United Nations. We are confident that\nthese new Member States will bring with them all the\ncharm and wisdom of island nations to enrich the work of\nthe United Nations.\nAll nations, big or small, have something to offer.\nThis is particularly true of small States that have no\nspheres of influence to preserve, but the honest desire to\nparticipate in and contribute to the betterment of our\nworld. Small States have the advantage of coming up\nwith refreshing ideas and offering new perspectives in the\nsearch for solutions to problems of common concern.\nMaking this world a better place for the human race\nto live in is the collective responsibility of all of us. All\nStates, big or small, should contribute to the collective\nendeavour to rid this world of wars, hunger, destitution,\ndisease, suffering, homelessness, despair, terror, tyranny\nand economic backwardness.\nMaking this world a better place to live is not a far-\nfetched dream. It is a goal we can achieve if all nations,\ncollectively as well as individually, sincerely commit\nthemselves to working towards achieving this goal. Our\nvery survival as the human race in the new millennium\ndepends on the achievement of this noble objective.\nHow do we achieve this noble objective? First of all,\nwe must commit ourselves to living and working for\npeace on earth. We must respect the sovereign rights of\nnations, big or small, rich or poor, to exist without fear of\nbeing marginalized, suppressed or intimidated by larger,\nricher or more populous nations. This is why, quite apart\nfrom the principle of universality, my Government\n4\n\n\nsincerely believes that this body should seriously reconsider\nits position on the readmission of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan to the United Nations. With a population of almost\n22 million and the nineteenth-largest economy in the world,\nand being the fifteenth-largest trading nation, the Republic\nof China \u2014 a highly responsible member of the\ninternational community, a free and democratic country that\nhas always promoted world trade and socio-economic\ndevelopment around the world and at the same time has\ncontributed to the eradication of poverty \u2014 has a lot to\noffer if readmitted to the United Nations. By allowing the\n22 million people in Taiwan to be represented in the United\nNations, we would be enforcing the principles enshrined in\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as\ncontributing to the promotion of international peace and\nsecurity.\nWhere this Assembly has recognized the then\nexistence of two Germanies and the present existence of the\ntwo Koreas, the logic of the readmission of the Republic of\nChina into this Assembly of nations is a matter of justice\nand equity. How can the United Nations sideline such an\nimportant country as if we were still living in the past?\nFor reasons that we all know too well, in 1971, the\nGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI), by\nwhich it conferred membership upon the People's Republic\nof China. But the same resolution failed miserably to\naddress the issue of representation in the United Nations for\nthe people of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The cold\nwar is over. The time has now come to correct this sad\nmistake, and there could not be a better time than now,\nwhen we are at the threshold of the twenty-first century, to\nrecognize the Republic of China and, by extension, the\nvoice of its 22 million people.\nHaving said that, I would now like to focus attention\ncloser to home for a few minutes. Five years ago, when I\nled the Gambia National Army to take over the reigns of\npower in the Gambia, I was motivated by the sole desire to\nrescue my people from the abyss of despair and destruction\nafter 30 years of rampant corruption and nepotism, to say\nthe least. There was a general laissez-faire attitude that was\nrapidly assuming alarming proportions and that could have\nspelt disaster for the country had we not stepped in to put\nto an end the excesses of a rotten and morally bankrupt\nregime. It would be hard for anyone to imagine that a\nGovernment elected by the people would deprive its\ncitizens of their basic needs for 30 long years. Not a single\nschool, not a single hospital was built by that Government.\nThat was why during the two-year transition to\nconstitutional democratic rule, my Government immediately\nembarked on an intensive socio-economic development\nprogramme, building schools, hospitals, roads and bridges\nand carrying out other infrastructural development\nprojects, such as building a new airport terminal and the\nextension of the port of Banjul.\nIt is now a thing of the past for any child to worry\nabout trekking miles and miles to school. There are\nenough schools in all the administrative areas in the\ncountry, including high schools, for our children,\nespecially the girls, to stay close to their homes and\nfamilies. In this way we encourage parents to send their\ngirls to school.\nIn addition to encouraging and increasing access to\nbasic education for all Gambian children, my Government\nhas identified a need to provide tertiary education and has\nestablished a university. The first batch of students will\nenrol in the University of The Gambia in October 1999.\nSimilarly, in the area of health, we have so far built\ntwo major hospitals, and a number of health centres\naround the country. Obviously we could not put right all\nthe neglect of 30 years in just two years, but the\ndifference is clear. Naturally the people of the Gambia\nwanted more progress. I was therefore persuaded by\npeople across the country to resign from the army and run\nfor office in a free and fair election under international\nsupervision. I accepted the challenge, strengthened in my\nconviction that a direct mandate from the people would\nenable me to work harder for them. We have since been\nmaking greater strides in the uphill task of nation-\nbuilding.\nThe very survival of the Gambia in this ever-\nchanging world is an issue of major concern as we step\ninto the next century, which will be fraught with many\ndaunting challenges. The Gambia, like many other\ndeveloping countries, has been forced to rethink its\ndevelopment agenda while looking for a more meaningful\nliving environment for its people.\nThe desire of both Government and people for a\ndeveloped nation is clearly expressed in the country's\ndevelopment blueprint, \u201cVision 2020, The Gambia\nIncorporated\u201d. Our macroeconomic policies and strategies\ncontinue to be spearheaded by Vision 2020, with an\noverall goal of achieving sustainable growth and\neradicating poverty.\nMy Government is working very closely with the\nWorld Bank, the European Union, the United Nations\n5\n\n\nDevelopment Programme and all the specialized agencies\nof the United Nations system in their fields of competence\nin order to eradicate poverty, illiteracy and disease so that\nas a healthy nation founded on solid, democratic principles\nof good governance, we can stride ahead to build a nation\nwith a strong economy in an atmosphere of social justice\nand political stability.\nRecognizing that improving the governance\nenvironment is a sine qua non for sustainable development,\nthe Government of the Gambia has incorporated good-\ngovernance strategies in all national development initiatives\nand plans. The Gambia National Governance Programme,\nwhich was recently launched, was developed through an\nextensive process of consultation and consensus-building.\nIn our bid to create an atmosphere of dignity and\nrespect for our citizenry we are fully committed to\ndemocratic constitutionality. We consider this the only\nfeasible political framework for good governance, which is\nan essential prerequisite for sustainable development. We\nalso believe that democracy cannot exist in a situation of\nabject poverty. Our national governance programme\nincludes provisions for constitutional review and reform of\nthe electoral system and process; reform of parliamentary\nstructures and processes; civic education; reform of the\nlegal and judicial process; public-sector management and\nadministrative reform; and decentralization and local\ngovernment reform.\nGiven the complexity and scope of the governance\npolicy framework, its effective implementation will require\ncareful planning and mobilization of resources. A round-\ntable conference, to be organized very soon, will seek to\nmobilize further support to cover part of the funding gap.\nIt is our hope that our partners in development will\ncontinue to support us in this endeavour.\nWe are mindful that meaningful socio-economic\ndevelopment can be brought about and be sustained only in\nan atmosphere of stability and security \u2014 not only in our\nown country, but also in its neighbouring countries. With\nthe world becoming more globalized, lack of security and\npeace in any one part of the world affects the rest of\nmankind, especially those of us in the developing countries.\nWe place a high premium on the maintenance of peace and\nstability both at home and abroad.\nThis is why, in our sister republic of Guinea-Bissau,\nwe all worked hard, encouraged by the rest of the\ninternational community, to put a definitive end to the\nconflict there. In our efforts to achieve this objective, we,\ntogether with other West African countries, participated\nin the Economic Community of West African States\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) peacekeeping operations\nin Guinea-Bissau, even though the whole mission itself\nwas short-lived. Now that peace and stability have been\nreturned to that country, we encourage the international\ncommunity to contribute to the country's reconciliation\nand reconstruction effort.\nThe Gambia, as coordinator of the work of the group\nof friends of Guinea-Bissau at the United Nations, will\ncontinue to play a leading role in this endeavour. In the\nsame vein, in our continuing search for peace and\nstability in our subregion we in the Gambia have\nspearheaded efforts to mediate in the Casamance question\nthrough dialogue. As a result, in June of this year we\ngathered together in Banjul all the stakeholders in the\nCasamance issue with a view to providing a forum for the\nMovement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC)\nfactions to articulate a common position for their\nimpending dialogue with the Government of Senegal. This\nhas been yielding positive results as it has already led to\na cessation of hostilities in the Casamance region of\nSenegal. The cessation of hostilities, which is a\nconsequence of the Banjul encounters, has been so\nencouraging that refugees have started to return home\neven before a final settlement is reached. At last we can\nsee light at the end of the tunnel.\nThe momentum created by the Banjul meetings\namong the MFDC factions should be maintained. A final\nMFDC meeting will soon be convened and is expected to\nherald formal consultations between the Government of\nSenegal and the MFDC. These, we hope, will lead to a\nlasting settlement that will put an end to the devastation\nand its attendant human suffering.\nMeanwhile, in our sister Republic of Sierra Leone,\nit is gratifying to note that a peace agreement has now\nbeen signed between the Government and the\nRevolutionary United Front after almost nine years of one\nof the most devastating, fratricidal and brutal wars of our\ntime, a war characterized by outrageous atrocities\ncommitted by the rebels. We commend the efforts of the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\nleaders, ECOMOG, the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General for Sierra Leone and all those who\ncontributed in one way or another to bringing about this\npeaceful resolution of the conflict.\nThe Lom\u00e9 Peace Agreement is not the ideal peace\nagreement, but most peace agreements come with a price.\n6\n\n\nThe Sierra Leonean people paid dearly. We hope that,\ndespite all the shortcomings of the Agreement, it will create\nhope and opportunity for the people of Sierra Leone and\nfree them from terror, violence, killings, amputations and\nthe many other atrocities that characterized this war.\nThe people of Sierra Leone have also welcomed this\nchance to make a fresh start. They should not be abandoned\nto fate. The international community has an obligation to\ncome in rapidly, and in a big way, to help in the\nimplementation of the Agreement.\nIt would be an understatement to say that Africa is\nmaking great strides in the peaceful resolution of conflicts\nthere. A good example is the complex conflict in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo: we are encouraged by\nthe signing of a Ceasefire Agreement in Lusaka. On behalf\nof the Government and people of the Gambia, I thank\nPresident Chiluba of Zambia and all other leaders in Africa\nwho contributed to finding a political settlement to this\ncomplex conflict.\nWe note that the Security Council has deployed\nmilitary liaison officers to the relevant States to lay the\ngroundwork for the deployment of military observers. We\nappreciate this move by the United Nations. We must,\nhowever, sound a note of caution: the situation is extremely\nvolatile. We must therefore move swiftly, before there is a\nrelapse into fighting. We must not let this opportunity slip\naway.\nLikewise, in the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict, we welcome\nthe calm that has prevailed for a while. Most importantly,\nwe welcome the agreement of the parties to the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Framework\nAgreement. We commend the leadership role of the OAU\nin its efforts to resolve this fratricidal conflict. We must,\nhowever, say that we are yet to see a ceasefire agreement.\nThe parties must therefore be encouraged to translate their\npronouncements into action by signing a ceasefire\nagreement immediately. We must emphasize that the United\nNations should be ready to come in as soon as it is\npropitious to contribute to the implementation of the\nagreement.\nAfter a long and difficult period of negotiations, some\ngood news is coming out of Western Sahara. We note with\nappreciation that the identification process has progressed\nconsiderably. Plans for the repatriation of the refugees have\nalso advanced. Finally, we are coming close to the\nreferendum. We praise the Kingdom of Morocco for its\nflexibility, understanding, cooperation and courage\nthroughout this period.\nElsewhere on the continent, the political landscape\nis still hazy.\nIn Angola, the peace process has broken down\ncompletely due to UNITA's intransigence and flat refusal\nto implement in good faith the Lusaka Protocol. It is very\nclear to all of us that there is no military solution to that\nconflict. After about 30 years of war, the people of\nAngola have suffered enormously, especially the women\nand children. The future of a whole generation has been\ncompromised. We urge the international community to\ntake decisive action to ensure a peaceful and speedy\nresolution of that conflict. To this end, we welcome the\nrecent re-establishment of a United Nations presence in\nAngola. Such a presence is vital, but clearly it must be\nbuttressed by a resolute commitment of the Security\nCouncil to producing the much-needed peace in Angola\nas soon as possible.\nIn the case of Somalia, it is a completely different\nscenario. The warlords are holding the international\ncommunity hostage because of their own insatiable\nappetite to assume power at all costs. We note that the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) is\ndoing all it can to resolve this long and complex conflict,\nbut without much success. If a resolution to this conflict\nis to be found, we should shake off the Somalia syndrome\nand re-engage the issue. The international community\nshould recommit itself to the resolution of the Somali\ncrisis by developing a strategy that would send clear\nsignals to the warlords that their behaviour and attitude\ncan no longer be tolerated by civilized society.\nIn the case of the Sudan, my delegation welcomes\nwholeheartedly the peace overtures of the Government.\nWe believe that they are a first step in the right direction.\nWe encourage the other side to respond, and to respond\npositively. The international community should also\nsupport the parties in finding a lasting solution.\nThis brief survey of the theatres of conflict in Africa\nreveals once again that our continent unfortunately\ncontinues to claim the lion's share of trials and\ntribulations. This is as embarrassing as it is unacceptable\nand we must redouble our efforts to reverse the situation.\nAway from the African continent, there are other\nconflict situations that continue to pose serious threats to\n7\n\n\ninternational peace and security and, therefore, are of\nserious concern to my delegation.\nWith regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict, my\nGovernment, whilst reiterating its full support for the\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the principle\nof land for peace, leading to an independent Palestinian\nhomeland, also supports fully the Middle East peace\nprocess and the remarkable leadership role that the United\nStates is playing to move the process forward. The solution\nto the problem lies both with Israel and in Palestine, as well\nas with the international community. This is why we\nbelieve that the implementation of the Wye River\nagreement, in letter and spirit, would usher in a new era of\nhope for the entire Middle East region.\nElsewhere in the Middle East, my delegation continues\nto follow very closely the consequences of the Iraqi\ninvasion of Kuwait \u2014 in particular, the unresolved\nproblems of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war, missing persons,\nthe Kuwaiti archives and stolen property. There is nothing\nmore painful than the mental torture that the families of the\nprisoners of war and missing persons have been going\nthrough all these years. To treat this matter lightly would be\ntantamount to adding insult to injury. We can imagine the\npain, the anguish, the uncertainty and the endless\nnightmares of over 600 Kuwaiti families still hoping to hear\nfrom their loved ones. This is why my Government will\nnever allow this aspect of the problem between Iraq and\nKuwait to be swept under the carpet. It is a humanitarian\nproblem that must not be politicized and must be given all\nthe attention that it deserves.\nIn the same vein, the restitution of the Kuwaiti\narchives and other property is something that cannot be\nrelegated to the category of secondary issues. Depriving a\nnation of its archives is like robbing it of its national\nidentity.\nAs for the question of the disarmament of Iraq, we\ndeplore the current stalemate. The status quo is\nunacceptable, yet the Security Council appears to be\ndivided on how to move forward. The Council should show\nunity and remain steadfast; otherwise it would be sending\nthe wrong signal: that any country can dictate the terms of\nits compliance with the wishes of the international\ncommunity and get away with it. If that is allowed to\nhappen, we would be setting a very dangerous precedent.\nCouncil members must make an effort to draw a line\nbetween their narrow national interests and the collective\ninterests of humankind.\nJust as we are unequivocal with regard to the\ndisarmament of Iraq, we are equally uncompromising\nwhen it comes to the alleviation of the unwarranted\nsuffering of the ordinary Iraqi people who, unfortunately,\nhave to bear the brunt of any sanctions. The oil-for-food\nprogramme is a laudable effort to mitigate the impact of\nsanctions, but that is just about it. We want to see the\nremoval, destruction or rendering harmless of all Iraqi\nweapons of mass destruction, but we do not subscribe to\nthe destruction of Iraq under any pretext whatsoever. It is\ndisheartening to see what sanctions have done to the\ninnocent women, children and elderly people of Iraq.\nThis, too, is unacceptable and was not the objective of the\nsanctions. A net distinction must henceforth be made\nbetween the regime and the people. As with all other\nexisting and future sanctions, they must be clearly\ntargeted at those responsible in order to avoid inflicting\nundue pain and suffering on innocent people.\nStill on the thorny issue of sanctions, my\nGovernment is pleased that sanctions imposed on the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya have been suspended, but we\ncannot wait to see them lifted completely because Libya\nhas fulfilled all its international obligations under the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We call for the\nimmediate and complete lifting of all the sanctions\nimposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\nCuba, too, has been reeling under unjust sanctions\nfor 38 years now. These sanctions should be scrapped\nbecause they are counterproductive and inhumane. We are\nof the opinion that the new millennium should usher in an\nera devoid of avoidable and man-made disasters and\nconflicts that wreak untold suffering on the innocent.\nToday, at the threshold of the new millennium, we should\nforgive and forget the past and reconcile in order to make\nthis world a better place for mankind. We therefore\nreiterate our call for the immediate lifting of the economic\nand financial blockade imposed on Cuba.\nWhilst it is important to uphold the principle of non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of States, when a State\nexceeds all bounds and engages in the heinous policy of\nethnic cleansing, as in Kosovo, the rest of the\ninternational community cannot remain silent. The timely\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)\nmarked a watershed in the history of the conflict, the full\nimplementation of which, we hope, will bring lasting\npeace to Kosovo.\nOn the issue of East Timor, I would like to\ncongratulate the East Timorese on the successful conduct\n8\n\n\nof the historic ballot. Nothing would have been possible,\nthough, without the courageous first step that was taken by\nthe Indonesian Government leading to the 5 May\nAgreement, which in turn set the whole process in motion.\nHowever, we are greatly appalled at and shocked by the\nlevel of violence that ensued immediately after the verdict\nof the East Timorese people was made known to the\ninternational community. In this context, we welcome the\ndeployment of the multinational force.\nWhile we rejoice with the people of Kosovo and East\nTimor for the timely international efforts to restore peace,\nwe cannot but express despair at the slow or sometimes\nlack of response to African conflicts. We insist that one life\nin Angola or elsewhere in Africa is no less important than\none life in Kosovo or East Timor. The Security Council\nmust therefore be evenhanded and establish principled\ncriteria for humanitarian intervention.\nIn the wake of the many conflicts the world over,\nthere should be a concerted international effort to address\nthe issue of impunity. We share the philosophy that there\ncan be no peace without justice, no justice without law and\nno meaningful law without a court to decide what is just\nand lawful under any given circumstances.\nBecause of this conviction, we support international\nefforts to establish an International Criminal Court (ICC)\nwhich would have jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide\nand crimes against humanity. We encourage all States to\nconsider ratifying the Statute of the ICC. The Gambia has\nalready signed the Statute and has since set the process in\nmotion for its ratification.\nThere is a phenomenon, though, that constitutes a\ncause for greater concern to my delegation, and that is the\nrecruitment and conscription of children as soldiers. This\nconstitutes a total breakdown of our fundamental value\nsystems. It must be stopped, as it is a blatant violation of\ninternational law and all norms of civilized behaviour.\nThe issue of the child soldier is a moral one, and it is\nthe collective responsibility of the international community\nto fight against a situation where the leaders of tomorrow\nare exposed to a life of violence, vengeance and hate, a\nsituation which breeds in their minds the dangerous notion\nthat he who wields the gun demands and deserves respect.\nThe plight of the children in the refugee camps does not\naugur well for a brighter future as they invariably grow up\nwith vengeful hearts towards those they deem to be\nresponsible for their plight. In a nutshell, an end to all\nconflicts is the only means to arrest this tragic trend.\nAnother social malaise of a deadlier threat to all\nsocieties, rich and poor alike, is the drug menace. This\nscourge threatens the very fabric of society and indeed the\nfixture of mankind, as it respects no national boundary. It\nis also a major cause of most crimes and violence in our\nurban centres, and it has grown to such proportions that\nit is beyond the capacity of any single State to eradicate\nit. Thus, we applaud the timely initiative of President\nErnesto Zedillo of Mexico for convening a special session\ndevoted to the drug problem. This special session no\ndoubt rekindled the interest that we all share in the fight\nagainst drugs. We all crave for a drug-free world. A\ndaunting task though it may be, we must take up the\nchallenge because the stakes are so high that we cannot\nafford to be complacent.\nThe issue of small arms and landmines is also a\nperennial problem which continues to fuel and exacerbate\nconflicts in Africa and elsewhere with devastating\nconsequences. We oppose the proliferation of small arms\nand the laying of landmines and call for international\npartnership to address this concern. In this context, we\nurge arms manufacturing countries to exercise restraint in\ntheir transfer of arms to regions of conflict. In this\ncontext, we welcome the entry into force of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction.\nEqually worrisome is the illicit trafficking in small\narms and sensitive technologies. On the wider question of\ndisarmament, whilst we recognize the efforts being made\ntowards the achievement of a fissile material cut-off treaty\nand the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, we\ncontinue to add our voice to the campaign for the total\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, we look\nforward to the Preparatory Committee for the 2000\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nBefore closing the chapter on the review of the\ninternational political scene, I would like to thank all the\npeople and organizations, as well as members of the\ninternational community, who have been working\nrelentlessly to devise peaceful and negotiated solutions to\nthe problems besetting mankind today. We, the younger\ngeneration, would want to live in a conflict-free and\ncrisis-free world in the third millennium. We would want\nto bequeath to the next generation a world devoid of\nwars, poverty, hunger, racism and deprivation; a world\nwhere the whole of humankind would live like a single\nfamily; a world where meaningful socio-economic\n9\n\n\ndevelopment would be the collective responsibility of all\nthe world's citizens; a world where peace, love, mutual\nrespect and collective security would be the order of the\nday.\nIt has since become an established fact that poverty is\nthe root cause of many conflicts in the world, particularly\nin Africa.\nIt is gratifying to note that following the social summit\na number of poverty eradication strategies have been\nelaborated, and it is our fervent hope that the special\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to the\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\nSocial Development and further initiatives will give fresh\nimpetus to the campaign for the eradication of poverty. One\neffective way of eradicating poverty in Africa would be the\ntotal cancellation of all of the continent's external debts.\nThe debt burden is the cause of untold suffering to the\nmasses of Africa's women, children and the elderly.\nRegarding the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\nInitiative (HIPC), much as it could be characterized as\nlaudable, it must be recognized that the eligibility criteria\nfor accessing HIPC assistance are very restrictive and\npenalize those countries that really need assistance. For\nexample, the Gambia, with a high debt service ratio of 33\nper cent of the gross domestic product, although meeting\nthe other two criteria \u2014 first, establishing a track record of\ngood performance and, secondly, eligibility under the\nEnhanced Structural Adjustment Facility and International\nDevelopment Association-sponsored programmes \u2014 has\nbeen excluded.\nMy delegation strongly appeals for an across-the-board\ncancellation of all Africa's debts so as to give us a new\nlease on life in the coming millennium.\nTalk about poverty eradication would be incomplete\nwithout mention of the United Nations System-wide Special\nInitiative on Africa. I have no doubt whatsoever that if the\nresources required are made available to fund all the\ncomponents of the Initiative within a reasonable time-frame,\nwe could already claim victory in the battle against poverty.\nIn this regard, we note with satisfaction, the Economic and\nSocial Council meeting held in Geneva during the month of\nJuly and the attention given to the segment on the\ndevelopment of Africa.\nAll said and done, in this era of globalization and\nliberalization, our salvation lies in regional integration and\ncooperation if we are to achieve economies of scale and\ncollective self-reliance. This is why we in the Gambia\nattach a lot of importance to Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) as one of the building\nblocks of the African Economic Community. For us\nAfricans, the Lagos Plan of Action and indeed the Final\nAct of Lagos constitute the blue print for the economic\ndevelopment of Africa. It is even more relevant today\nthan ever before.\nAt the continental level, we the African leaders\ndecided at the recently concluded OAU extraordinary\nsummit in Sirte, Libya, to form a Union of African States\nwhich would put us in a better position to tackle the\ncontinent's economic and political crises that have plagued\nus throughout this century. However, I want to emphasize\nthat the objective of this African continental union is not\nto form a military bloc, but an economic and political one\ncapable of resolving Africa's numerous crises and\nconflicts, with the ultimate objective of eradicating\npoverty in Africa.\nToday, as we speak, the gap between rich and poor\nhas widened threefold. The 1999 Human Development\nReport has made stunning revelations, raised important\nissues and made a series of recommendations. The\nchallenges are daunting, but with the necessary political\nwill poverty can be eradicated, and, as stated in that\nreport the challenge is \u201cto ensure that globalization works\nfor people \u2014 not just for profits\u201d. In this endeavour, there\nshould be greater cooperation between North and South.\nI would like at this juncture to salute President Bill\nClinton's bold initiative to visit the African continent, the\nsecond by a sitting American President in peacetime. This\nvisit is very important as it gives the United States\nAdministration first-hand knowledge of the numerous\nproblems and challenges facing our continent. It also\nstrengthens the historic bonds linking the United States\nand Africa. This is a positive development that should be\nnurtured, as the United States will continue to play a\npivotal role in Africa's socio-economic development. The\nmassive financial and economic assistance given to some\nAfrican countries as a result of the visit could go a long\nway towards improving the living conditions of the\npeople in those countries, as well as ensuring a bright\nfuture for the African continent as a whole.\nThus, I cannot but express my sincere appreciation\nand gratitude, on behalf of the youth of Africa, for this\nbold and laudable initiative taken by President Clinton,\nand I hope that it will be emulated by future United\nStates Administrations.\n10\n\n\nIt is our fervent hope, therefore, that as we approach\nthe threshold of the new millennium, we will draw\ninspiration from the Charter of the United Nations by\ngiving concrete expression to the pledge made therein \u201cto\nemploy international machinery for the promotion of the\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples\u201d.\nWe anxiously look forward to the Millennium\nAssembly, which, beyond its symbolism, could provide a\nunique opportunity to renew our commitment and\nrededicate our efforts to the attainment of this goal. It\nwould be inexcusable if we were not strengthened in our\nresolve to eradicate poverty in the next millennium. With\nall the global conferences since the beginning of the decade\non almost all issues of common concern, a solid foundation\nhas thus been laid. All we have to do is build upon it.\nIt is against this background that we are poised to\nembrace the third millennium and all that it has in store for\nus. Caught between the spectre of nuclear holocaust and the\noverpowering and irrepressible phenomenon of\nglobalization, our only hope for survival depends on how\nfar we are committed to putting our collective security\nbefore our narrow, individual national interests. This in turn\nis only possible through multilateralism, and the latter has\nproved its worth through the United Nations.\nHaving learned numerous bitter lessons, including the\nfact of two world wars in this century, the compelling need\nto create the United Nations to save succeeding generations\nfrom the scourge of war is more valid now than ever\nbefore, taking into account the rapid advances in military\ntechnology and the devastating effects of modern weaponry.\nOur Organization has withstood the test of time, and as\nlong as we continue individually and collectively to make\nevery effort to uphold the lofty ideals enshrined in the\nCharter, we can together make this world a better place for\nall mankind.\nThe United Nations is certainly not irreproachable, but\nit is definitely irreplaceable and indispensable. It is the\nembodiment of our hopes and aspirations. This is why we\nare emboldened in our conviction that, despite some acerbic\ncriticism, we envisage an even greater role for the United\nNations in the twenty-first century. It was therefore very\ntimely to adopt the Declaration and Programme of Action\non a Culture of Peace shortly before the beginning of this\nsession.\nIn this connection, it is important to carry out reforms\nwhen and where necessary to address the Organization's\nshortcomings. The organ that needs serious and urgent\nreform more than any other is the Security Council. The\nimportance of this body cannot be over-emphasized, but\nits present composition, especially at the level of\npermanent membership, is unacceptable, to say the least.\nIts composition should reflect the realities of the day and\nmust be democratic and transparent in its working\nmethods.\nTo begin with, it is a fact that Africa, the second\nlargest continent, is not represented at the permanent\nmember level. This anomaly should be rectified\nimmediately; then we can take it from there. Also not\nacceptable is the veto power wielded by the five\npermanent members, a practice that is diametrically\nopposed to the principles of democracy and human rights.\nI propose that the veto power be abolished during the\ncourse of the United Nations reform process.\nAs my country's term on the Security Council draws\nto an end, I would like to seize this opportunity on behalf\nof the Government and people of the Gambia, and indeed\non my own behalf, to express our sincere gratitude to the\nentire membership of the United Nations for the\nconfidence reposed in us to represent you. We also thank\nMembers most sincerely for the partnership and\ncooperation, the advice and support, without which it\nwould not have been possible to carry out the mandate\nentrusted to us. As a small country, our contribution\nmight have been modest, but it was sincere, in our\ncollective endeavour to make this world a better place for\nhumankind. This noble goal, in my view, is what the\nUnited Nations stands for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should\nlike to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Didier Opertti for\nhis tireless work during the session just closed. I should\nalso like, on behalf of my Government and my compatriots,\nto thank the Secretary-General for his tireless work to carry\nforward the principles that unite all the nations represented\nin this Hall.\nI should like to tell the Assembly about the\nfundamental challenges facing my country, which have to\ndo, in those more specific circumstances, with those more\nuniversal issues that are the concern of this Organization of\nall nations.\nIn only my fourth month as President of El Salvador,\nI believe I must say that I recognize what a great honour it\nis for me to address the Assembly. During the months when\nI was a presidential candidate, my country was full of\nconfused and contradictory ideas as to its direction and\ndestiny. I therefore felt the need to counter the many\nopposing viewpoints with the one inescapable argument \u2014\nthe reality of my country \u2014 in order to find what direction\nthat should be. That is why I dropped the political debate\nto delve deeply into the only matter that is of interest to\nany candidate in El Salvador: reading the relationship\nbetween the citizens of El Salvador and their country in\norder to move forward.\nThat enabled me to identify with rural people, potters,\nindustrialists and tradespeople in their efforts to build a\ndecent future for themselves and their families. At no time\nduring the conversations that I had in various parts of my\ncountry was I asked for privileges or perquisites, and\nneither did people demand assistance programmes: they all\nwanted to see their own families' destinies built on a\nfoundation of decent work and their own efforts. That\nrequirement, those aspirations addressed to my\nGovernment \u2014 and to which my Administration is duty\nbound \u2014 are what bring me to this rostrum to address the\nAssembly.\nIt seems to me that in recent decades significant\nprogress has been made by our region and by the world as\na whole in developing all the political freedoms. My\ncountry in particular has moved rapidly during the past\nseven years through universal suffrage to democratic\ninstitutions and the will of the people expressed in all\norgans of the State. Just seven years ago, El Salvador was\ncompletely divided by a fratricidal war; today it has a fully\nfledged democracy. And in this effort to move forward,\nwe have been encouraged and stimulated by many of the\nnations whose representatives are listening to these words\nhere today.\nHowever, I must say that the commitment of nations\nto political freedom finds no corresponding stimulus to or\ndevelopment of economic freedoms: developed countries\nrespond to our efforts to bring our products to the world\nmarket with protectionism, trade barriers and quotas. By\ncontrast, our nations are completely open; we have\ncomplete economic freedom; we welcome free trade with\nall nations.\nWhat is the cause of this discontinuity between\npolitical freedoms and economic freedoms? How can we\npromote political freedom and democracy when the world\nis being closed to economic freedom? Neither I nor my\ncompatriots are asking the world for assistance because of\npoverty: we are trying to build honourable nations forged\nby our own work. That is the aspiration of my\ncompatriots, of El Salvador, and of all nations that can\nhold up their heads in dignity. It is absurd for us to be\ncalled upon to demonstrate openness when the developed\ncountries respond with protectionism.\nThat is why it is important that I highlight these\nessential challenges. We must choose the path of freedom,\nbut not freedom limited to certain areas. It must be\nfreedom in all its fullness. If political freedom is not\nmatched by economic freedom, how can we justify the\nefforts of those of us who are trying to change our\ncountries institutionally in order to make them freer?\nSome in our region are waxing nostalgic about State\ninterventionism and other forms of authoritarianism, as a\nway of solving our problems.\nFuture generations will not judge us only by our\ndeeds; they will judge us too by what we fail to do. If we\nlack the courage to speak or to act, they will demand to\nknow why, on the threshold of the new millennium, we\ndid not want genuinely to open the world to freedom.\nLet me acknowledge United Nations assistance and\nintervention in my country. The efforts of Salvadorans to\nmeet our aspirations to lasting peace would not have met\nwith success without the proper forum through which to\nbring conciliation among Salvadorans: the United Nations.\nWe must therefore express our gratitude to the\nOrganization, a house of concord among nations, and to\nits Member States, for their involvement in the\nachievement of our Peace Agreement. El Salvador has\n4\n\n\nonly one way of expressing that gratitude: while\nunderstanding that historical experiences vary, we offer the\nworld our humble experience so that it may be studied by\nany country that chooses to resolve its conflicts by taking\nthe path of concord.\nFollowing the armed conflict, hundreds of thousands\nof Salvadorans were forced to leave their homes and\ncommunities in order to feed their families. Many of my\ncompatriots have been received in nations represented in\nthis Hall. Let me address the nations in which Salvadorans\nare living, sometimes in difficult circumstances: I ask for\nunderstanding for my compatriots; they are in your\ncountries solely because they have to earn a living for their\nfamilies. They must not be blamed for social tensions that\npredate their arrival. I call for respect for those\nSalvadorans. Citizens of the world do not lose their dignity\nor their rights when they become emigrants. And I wish to\nsend this message to my compatriots scattered across the\nglobe because of the armed struggle: in El Salvador there\nwill always be room for them to thrive. Our common\ndestiny is linked to our hopes and to a hopeful future: that\nwe should be together. I am here not only to represent you\nbut to defend your rights.\nIn the name of the freedom I have so often evoked, let\nme speak of a matter that has been a concern of the\nGeneral Assembly: that of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan. We believe that when a people, expressing its\nsovereign will through democratic elections, elects officials,\nchooses a common destiny and builds a vision of its\nrelations with the rest of the world, it is has the absolute\nright to participate on an equal footing with the rest of us\nin this forum. For nearly 50 years, we Salvadorans have\nmaintained relations of all kinds with the Republic of China\non Taiwan. It is our firm hope that that friendly people will\nbe able to have a voice in this forum.\nWe also express our concern that so many years have\ngone by, and that the matter of setting up operational\nmachinery to promote peace among nations has so often\ncome before the Security Council without any resolution. It\nis a paradox that, as we speak of concord for the next\nmillennium, we have been unable to reach agreement on\nthis matter. This weakens all; it weakens the United\nNations. It is a betrayal of the beliefs of all the nations that\nwant the Organization to participate actively in promoting\npeace.\nI stand in solidarity with nations that have been the\nvictims of natural disasters. We in Central America owe a\ndebt of gratitude to all who helped us when the recent\nhurricane devastated our Republics \u2014 non-governmental\norganizations, Governments, the United Nations and\nfriendly nations. That debt of gratitude can be converted\nto solidarity only if we say that we in turn want to do our\nutmost to help other nations that have been the victims of\nnatural disasters, such as Turkey and the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan, not to mention other, no less painful\ndifficulties such as the conflict that is of such grave\nconcern to our Colombian brethren.\nIn solidarity between the peoples of Latin America\nand in solidarity between our two countries \u2014 for we too\nhave experienced such a conflict \u2014 we offer our brothers\nin Colombia any kind of assistance or experience they ask\nfor to deal successfully with this problem so like the one\nthat tore apart the lives of the people of El Salvador.\nIn this Hall that is the forum for the comity of\nnations, it is incumbent upon us to give substance to the\nrhetoric of our words. For this reason, since you have\ndone me the honour of patiently listening to me, I would\nlike to say to you that we, just as you, in our efforts for\nour common future, foresee that the entire world will live\nin peace, justice and liberty in the years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I have stood\nupon this platform on many occasions, and I well\nremember every speech I have given here since 1985.\nThis is perhaps because, first, I cannot conceive of any\nloftier rostrum in the world and, secondly, because my\npersonal political fate has always brought me here at\ntimes of great change. My most recent appearance before\nthe General Assembly was in 1992, when I was already\nHead of State of my country, Georgia. That, too, was a\nmoment filled with drama \u2014 one in which a new,\nindependent State was going through a painful birth\nprocess.\nToday, I am with the Assembly at the end of a\nstormy century, one which I would call the century of\nfreedom. That is not because freedom has become a\nuniversal norm of life \u2014 regrettably, that is not yet the\ncase \u2014 but, rather, because the concept of freedom has\nassumed pre-eminence on the scale of political values and\nalso because it was, indeed, in our century that the worst\nenemies of freedom and democracy were defeated.\nPerhaps the most unanticipated and important of these\nevents was the demise of the Soviet empire, which\n19\n\n\nbrought about the end of the cold war, the bipolar world\nand the post-war world order.\nThe collapse of empires follows a more or less similar\npattern. Initially, centrifugal forces triumph, but later\nphantom pains for the lost territories begin to be felt in the\nmetropolis and attempts are made to recentralize the former\nimperial space.\nYet historical experience demonstrates that designs to\nrestore an empire inevitably remain the unfulfilled dream of\nimperial reactionaries. History cannot be turned back.\nHowever, in the arsenal of today\u2019s reactionaries there\nremains still one chance to partially, if not completely,\nreturn to past ways \u2014 by maintaining spheres of influence\nover the territories of the former empire. Here I do not\nmean spheres of interest, including strategic interests.\nHarmonizing interests in a civilized way is a normal\ninternational practice. The concept of spheres of influence,\nhowever, particularly within the context of globalization,\nrepresents an anachronism.\nBut let me return to the demise of the cold war and\nthe bipolar world. As someone who happened to participate\nin this process, I think an explanation is in order since\ndebate on how and why it all happened continues to this\nday.\nI do not deny that the reasons for the end of the cold\nwar were many and complex. Yet I want to especially\nstress the role of the new thinking, which was conceived\neven before perestroika. I am certain that no drawn-out\neconomic hardships, not even any \u201cStar Wars project\u201d,\nwould have compelled the socialist camp to democratize\nwithin, or to take radical steps in the international arena to\novercome the confrontation, if instead of Mikhail\nGorbachev and his team, leaders who possessed the old\nmentality had remained at the helm of the Soviet ship of\nstate.\nSince I have mentioned Mikhail Gorbachev, I must\nsend to him, a man who is an outstanding figure of our\ntime, condolences for the death of his spouse, Raisa\nGorbachev.\nThe new thinking of that period contained many\nelements, but we can generally describe it as a concept\ndesigned to make all spheres of political and public life\nmore human.\nIn international relations, this implied, first and\nforemost, replacing the class-based ideological approach\nwith ethically motivated decisions, in line with universal\nvalues. Only due to this new approach were the countries\nof the Soviet space and Eastern Europe able to make their\ndemocratic choices with relatively little pain. Without the\nnew thinking it would have been difficult to conceive of\nthe withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan or that\ntruly epochal event, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the\nsubsequent reunification of Germany and the liberation of\nEastern Europe.\nThe old found it difficult to come to terms with the\nnew. The two could not exist harmoniously together.\nMoreover, not everyone accepted the idea of replacing the\nclass-based approach with the primacy of universal\nvalues. I remember that when I first expressed this\nconcept to the Soviet diplomatic corps, it spawned\naggressive clashes of opinion and upheaval across the\nentire Soviet space.\nBut has not this always been the case? Historically,\nchanges of this scale were always preceded by paradigm\nshifts in human thinking \u2014 that is, new thinking had to\noccur first. This was the case in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries, when a new world based on\nscientific thinking was emerging, and also in the epoch of\nthe Enlightenment, during which the ideas of equality and\nhumanism gave birth to the theory and practice of a\ndemocratic state.\nIn the historical literature and memoirs dedicated to\nthe end of the cold war, one often finds references to\nwinners and losers. It is erroneous to frame this most\ncomplex event of global historical significance in such\nsimplistic terms. For example, how can Russia be\nconsidered to have been \u201cdefeated\u201d when it set forth the\nexample to other peoples by creating its own independent\nState? One might ask the same about other States which\nbelonged to the so-called socialist camp and today are\nindependent democracies.\nCredit for the victory over the cold war equally\nbelongs to the representatives of the former opposing\ncamps who had in common the new thinking and a\ncommitment to the noble idea of saving mankind from a\nnuclear nightmare.\nIf we talk of any loser at all, it was the old, stagnant\nthinking which was defeated, and a new common sense\nprevailed. Shifts in thinking should occur at every stage\nof human development. The end of the cold war is a\nhighly significant intellectual breakthrough of the\ntwentieth century.\n20\n\n\nThe process of renovation of ideas is perennial.\nStagnation is tantamount to backward motion. At the\nthreshold of the new millennium, it is necessary that we\nonce again develop a new thinking \u2014 new principles in the\nrelationship between States and a new approach to common\nproblems and threats.\nToday, nearly a decade after the Iron Curtain was\nlifted and the cold war came to an end, one often hears\nscepticism expressed about this great liberal democratic\nrevolution of the twentieth century. \u201cWhat has changed,\nafter all?\u201d some ask. Indeed, it is high time that we\nthoroughly assessed what has happened and surveyed the\nmyriad new opportunities that have presented themselves as\na result of this tectonic shift, as well as the far-from-simple\nproblems that up until now one would hardly ever think\nabout.\nMy ancient country, Georgia, is one of those newly\nindependent States which provide a good platform for\nobserving both the virtues and shortcomings of the\nprocesses under way in this new, post-bipolar world.\nAlthough the history of Georgian statehood stretches\nback more than three millennia, the vicissitudes of history\ncaused us to have to begin building our nation State from\nscratch once again in the last decade of this century. The\nbeginning proved especially difficult. The utter\nincompetence and inexperience of its first post-communist\nleadership threw Georgia into conflict and civil war. The\nresult was complete economic collapse and the loss of even\nthose token signs of statehood that we had inherited from\nthe Soviet system. Georgia in fact found itself isolated from\nthe rest of the world. All this was accompanied by an\nunprecedented criminal rampage the eradication of which\ntook several years.\nGeorgia began to work its way out of this isolation in\nthe spring of 1992 when it became a member of the United\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope and the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and began\nto actively forge diplomatic relations with its neighbours\nand more distant nations. In fact, it was during this difficult\nperiod that our country \u2014 its people and leadership \u2014\nmade its choice. Georgia would set forth on the way\ntowards building a free and democratic society based on a\nsocially oriented market economy. Despite the serious\nbarriers that continued to emerge along the way, Georgia\nnever once departed from the course it set for itself.\nThe principles and practice of the construction of our\ndemocratic country did not go unnoticed by the\ninternational community. Under new conditions, when the\nbipolar confrontation was no more, international\norganizations were given the opportunity for their actions\nto span the entire globe, to help those States in need and\nto assist in their development. The United Nations, the\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the\nEuropean Union and particularly the United States,\nGermany and Holland, as well as others, extended their\nhelp to us.\nThe year 1995 was indeed the turning point in\nGeorgia\u2019s new era. With it came the adoption of a new\ndemocratic Constitution, as well as the holding of the first\nparliamentary and presidential elections. In the same year,\nwe achieved financial stability and introduced a new\nnational currency. At the end of that year, for the first\ntime in Georgia\u2019s democratic development, growth in\ngross domestic product was recorded. Very importantly\nalso, law and order prevailed in the country, and the\nrampage of crime was finally curbed.\nIt was in the same year, however, 1995, that the first\nblast thundered. It was a terrorist act targeting Georgia\u2019s\nhead of State. This barbaric act signalled to the world that\nnot everyone found Georgia\u2019s progress towards\ndemocracy to their liking, especially if Georgia were to\nsucceed along the path of her choice.\nRecent years have demonstrated that the positive\ntrends in Georgia have become irreversible. From 1996 to\n1997, the annual economic growth was around 11 per\ncent, the exchange rate was stable and inflation continued\nto decline.\nNo less significant was the progress made in\nbuilding democratic institutions and putting in place and\nenforcing the legal framework for a civil society. In this\nrespect, it is no exaggeration to say that Georgia has\ntravelled in several short years a distance that often\nrequires decades. I am happy to say that as Georgia\ncontinues to improve its democratic institutions and\ndevelop its economy we are becoming a partner to others\nrather than merely a recipient of international aid. This is\nlargely made possible through the new function that my\ncountry has been establishing for itself over the past few\nyears.\nFor many decades the fuel-rich countries of the\nCaspian region and Central Asia were cut off from the\nrest of the world by impermeable walls. Now they have\nbegun to seek alternative routes to deliver their wealth to\n21\n\n\nthe world market. The south Caucasus, especially Georgia,\nwith its outlets to the Black Sea, has a pivotal location on\nthe route along which cargoes are already being shipped\nbetween east and west and between north and south. Since\nApril this year, oil has been flowing westward across the\nterritory of Georgia via the new Baku-Supsa pipeline. In\nancient times, Georgia was part of the great Silk Road. This\nfunction is reviving along with that vast highway that in\nancient times traversed the continents, bridging peoples and\npromoting the diffusion of cultures and the exchange of\nideas. I am referring to the great Eurasian space and\nrelevant transport routes.\nInternational organizations and individual countries\nhave shown great interest in the idea of a rebirth of the\ngreat Silk Road. The European Union initiated the\nTRACECA and INOGATE projects, under which the\nconstruction of the transport infrastructure is funded and\nmultiple alternative networks of oil and gas pipelines are\nbeing elaborated. The United States Senate recently adopted\nthe Silk Road strategy support bill, introduced by Senator\nBrownbeck, which envisages providing assistance to the\nsouth Caucasus and Central Asian States to strengthen\nindependence and democratic development, as well as to\nbuild a transport infrastructure that will include multiple oil\nand gas pipelines. In addition, the Japanese Government has\ndeveloped a strategy for the new Silk Road. China and\nother States are also participating in the realization of this\nproject. The countries of south Caucasus \u2014 Azerbaijan,\nArmenia and Georgia \u2014 signed partnership and cooperation\nagreements with the European Union that entered into force\nin June of this year. As for Georgia\u2019s progress in building\na democratic society based on the rule of law and respect\nfor human rights, its accomplishments have been recognized\nby the Council of Europe, of which Georgia became a full-\nfledged member earlier this year.\nAs I said earlier, the modest successes we have\nenjoyed on the way towards independent development \u2014\nthat is, our participation in projects of global significance\nand our aspiration to integrate with international, regional\nand Euro-Atlantic institutions \u2014 have irritated and continue\nto irritate the reactionary forces that are scattered across the\nentire territory of the former Soviet Union, where they pose\na serious threat to democratic regimes in the new States,\nincluding Russia.\nThe terrorist blast of 1995 was not an isolated\nincident. It was followed by other provocations and terrorist\nacts, which included another attempt on the President\u2019s life.\nWill these attempts to force Georgia\u2019s deviation from its\nchosen path continue? We cannot rule this out, since\ngeopolitical shifts of this scale never proceed smoothly.\nThe enemies of our country use the entire arsenal at their\ndisposal, including buying politicians and even votes, in\nattempting to bring to power a regime that is more to\ntheir liking.\nIn the current conditions of globalization and\nincreased interdependence, no country is immune to the\ncontagion of economic crisis. Last year independent\nGeorgia experienced first hand the repercussions of the\nnegative global economic situation, especially when the\nfinancial crisis erupted in neighbouring Russia, which\ncontinues to play a major part in Georgia\u2019s foreign trade\noperations. Today we can claim with reasonable\nconfidence that Georgia\u2019s young market economy and\nbanking system passed this test worthily, and international\norganizations and friendly countries made major\ncontributions to our ability to survive.\nUnresolved conflicts and our violated territorial\nintegrity remain Georgia\u2019s most painful problem \u2014 in\nother words, the very problem which is among the series\nof new threats that the international community has\nshown itself unprepared to deal with. As a result of the\ncampaign of genocide and ethnic cleansing conducted by\nAbkhaz separatists, with external military support, many\ncivilians of Georgian and other ethnic extractions have\nbeen killed, and nearly 300,000 people have been\ndisplaced. Despite the aid that our Government, the Office\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\nand other organizations provide, these innocent victims\ncontinue to live in conditions of extreme deprivation.\nThese severely traumatized people, who have been\nsubjected to inhuman brutalities, demand protection of\ntheir most inalienable right: the right to live in their own\nhomes. It is unfortunate that, unlike the confrontation in\nthe Balkans, the Abkhaz conflict has been given no\nexposure on world television screens, and therefore the\ninternational community has little awareness of it. Having\nseen with my own eyes the brutalities committed there, I\nhave no doubt whatsoever that people infected by the\ngerm of hatred lose their humanity and behave in the\nsame barbaric manner, be it in Kosovo, Rwanda or\nAbkhazia.\nIt is difficult to believe what has happened. With the\nhelp of foreign regular army units and mercenaries, the\nAbkhaz, who originally constituted only 17 per cent of\nthe population, expelled the majority just because they\nwere not Abkhaz, but Georgians, Armenians, Jews,\nRussians, Greeks or other ethnicities. This was\n22\n\n\naccomplished alongside ethnically motivated summary\nexecutions and mass killings.\nThe involvement of international entities \u2014 the United\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE), the Russian Federation and the Group of\nFriends of the Secretary-General \u2014 has so far failed to\nproduce tangible results. In my opinion, one of the reasons\nfor the failure of all attempts to resolve this conflict is that\nwhat has really happened in Abkhazia has not yet been\nobjectively assessed at the level of the highest international\nbody \u2014 the Security Council, which the Charter mandates\nto act as the guarantor of security in the world. Is it not all\ntoo obvious that it is impossible to fight evil if one does not\ncall it by its proper name \u2014 that is, if one does not assign\nan appropriate legal assessment to what has happened?\nThe 21 United Nations resolutions on the conflict in\nAbkhazia, Georgia, do not provide such an unequivocal\nassessment, despite the fact that the final documents of the\nOSCE\u2019s Budapest and Lisbon summits qualify the action of\nthe leaders of the Abkhaz separatists as ethnic cleansing.\nIndeed, the sole objective of the separatist leadership,\nencouraged by reactionary external forces, was to change\nthe demography of this autonomous republic. It is hard to\nimagine that a regime that has in fact attained its goal can\nbe convinced through mere request and persuasion to allow\nthe displaced to return.\nI do not want to be misunderstood. We do not thirst\nfor the blood of our Abkhaz brothers, nor do we seek\nvengeance. No, I am sure that in time Georgians and\nAbkhaz will dwell together in their historic homeland:\nGeorgia. But in order to speed up the process of the\nGeorgian-Abkhaz reconciliation, the tragedy must be given\nits fair legal assessment.\nIt is no surprise that in a century in which the concept\nof freedom has acquired such scope, human rights\ncommand special attention. Before Georgia was accepted\ninto the Council of Europe, rapporteurs scrutinized our\nhuman rights profile, examining how free the media were,\nthe conditions of prisoners \u2014 including the worst\noffenders \u2014 and many other aspects of human rights. We\nare grateful to the Council of Europe and other international\nbodies and non-governmental organizations for their\nundiminished attention to this critical aspect of life in our\ncountry, and for their unbiased assessments and\nrecommendations.\nEspecially against the backdrop of such keen attention\nto matters of human rights, I find it hard to understand the\nindifference of the international community to the fate of\nthe 300,000 people currently displaced from Abkhazia and\nto the flagrant violation of their basic right to live in their\nown homes. The matter is not whether or not help is\nbeing extended to these people. Of course, they would\nhave been in far more difficult straits had the United\nNations and individual countries not provided relief. But\nin terms of human rights the only response proportionate\nto their situation would be to assist them in restoring their\ninalienable rights \u2014 that is, allowing them to return to\ntheir homes and holding those who have violated their\nrights responsible, if only by giving an appropriate\nassessment of the acts of the perpetrators of ethnic\ncleansing. Unfortunately, little has been done to this end.\nAlthough expressing personal feelings is perhaps not\nappropriate from this podium, I find it difficult to repress\nmy emotions when talking of completely innocent people\nexpelled from their homes by brutal force fuelled by\nsimple hatred. My heart is heavy. I was involved in the\ncomplex processes that brought an end to the Cold War.\nI believed, as did my co-thinkers, that the future world\norder, liberated from the confrontations between camps,\nwould not permit injustice; that under the new conditions,\nthe United Nations and the Security Council, at the\npinnacle of our world\u2019s hierarchy, would be able to\nprevent individual assaults against civilized norms of\nexistence.\nThe Assembly can imagine how disillusioned I was\nwhen ethnic purging of the Georgian population occurred,\nand, by the way, remaining unpunished within my own\ncountry. I addressed the Security Council twice with a\ndetailed account and explanation of what happened, but\nno substantial progress has yet been made, even in the\nformulation of its resolutions. Having experienced this\ndisappointment, I believe it should have come as no\nsurprise that I firmly supported the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) operation in Kosovo, aimed at\nputting an end to ethnic cleansing, since I viewed that\noperation as the long-awaited manifestation of a firm\nstand against evil. At the same time, however, the action\nin Kosovo must not be interpreted by anyone as even\nindirect support of aggressive separatism. By no means.\nI have always believed that aggressive separatism and\nattempts to manipulate evolving democratic orders by use\nof force is one of the worst and most dangerous maladies\nof modern times.\nSince the end of the cold war, during which the\nthreat of nuclear war hung over our heads like the sword\nof Damocles, while local conflicts, despite their true\n23\n\n\ncauses, inevitably acquired an ideological tint, political\nanalysts have made extensive efforts to determine the\nnature of the virus causing today\u2019s aggression and the\ncauses of possible future clashes. The theories are\nextremely interesting, and the debates as to how well they\ncorrespond to reality will doubtless continue for years to\ncome.\nOn the other hand, from even a brief glance at today\u2019s\nconflicts it is clear that virtually all of them are linked to an\nerroneous interpretation by ethnic minorities of the principle\nof self-determination, and to a likewise erroneous\nunderstanding by titular nations and their central authorities\nof minorities\u2019 rights with respect to that principle. In other\nwords, either aggressive separatism or no less aggressive\nviolation of the rights of ethnic minorities, and in some\ncases both, underlie these conflicts.\nDuring such confrontations, a certain segment of the\npopulation becomes undesirable to a group of political\nadventurists. This \u201cforeign body\u201d is then removed through\nthe policy of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and genocide. Today there\nare hundreds of places in the world where some groups of\nindividuals may come to entertain an ambition towards this\nmanner of self- determination and apply the well tried \u2014\nand, regrettably, in many cases successful \u2014 method,\nwhich I would call the method of demographic engineering.\nIt is not difficult to foresee how chaotic our world can\nbecome and what torment millions of innocent people will\nsuffer just because they are found to be ethnically\ninappropriate, so to speak.\nToday, when the epoch of colonial empires has been\nrelegated to the past, the issue of the integrity of the State\nand the self-determination of peoples demands new, clearer\nformulations to ensure that each side in a potential conflict\nfully realizes the limits of international legitimacy of its\nclaims. In democratic States, with Governments equally\nrepresenting the interests of all its citizens, self-\ndetermination must be regarded as the right to express\noneself in a very broad sense, but only within the\nboundaries of a State which, on its part, respects these\nrights. There should be no talk of separation by the use of\nforce and violation of territorial integrity.\nLet me also add that the rationale provided by\nopposing sides to justify forcible redrawing of borders\nalways centres around an alleged necessity to restore\nhistorical justice. History, which is hardly an exact science,\nis interpreted according to the respective interests of the\nsides involved. I believe that new thinking should have a\nsay with regard to this matter as well. In international\nrelations, perhaps, one must not overemphasize, or, to be\nmore precise, blow out of proportion the role of historical\nprecedence. That was precisely the intent of the Helsinki\nAccords, regarding norms for the inviolability of existing\nborders.\nAt the same time, there is nothing more fundamental\nto the formation of a national consciousness than the\ncitizens\u2019 knowledge of their own history. And this\nacquires special significance in the present era of vigorous\nglobalization. The efforts of individual peoples,\nparticularly small ones, will not be enough to sustain\nworld diversity.\nThe contribution of each nation, large or small, to\nthe development of world civilization and culture is\nunique and special. So is that of my small country. The\nculture of every nationality is a singular phenomenon.\nAlthough the economy, the environment, the elimination\nof poverty, the management of demographic processes\nand sustainable development are the main challenges for\nus all, the time is also ripe to protect and preserve the\nnational cultural heritage, which remains an ever present\nfountain to enrich and ennoble the human spirit.\nThe Georgians say \u201cLet us save culture, and culture\nwill save us\u201d. Universal homogenization, which endangers\nthe identity of small nations, should be entered in the\nregister of modern threats. I suggest that we develop a\ncollective mechanism for their cultural protection.\nDevelopments in recent years have clearly shown\nthat the existing system of collective responsibility for\nglobal security is still far from perfect. Certainly, since\nbipolarity has been overcome we have significantly\nimproved the prospects for the successful activities of\ninternational organizations, especially the United Nations,\nwhose decisions were often not enforced because of the\nrivalry between the two ideological blocs. Yet they are\nnot always able to effectively address new perils. Order\ncannot be ensured unless negative sanctions are applied,\nand this is exactly what the United Nations is avoiding in\nevery way. Although the United Nations Charter does\nprovide for fairly strong mechanisms for ensuring\nsecurity, such awesome word combinations as Chapter\nVII and the Military Staff Committee exist most often\nmerely on paper. Surely the founders of the United\nNations deserve praise for their wisdom and vision, but\nwe should not forget that the mechanism they created for\nour collective responsibility for the world\u2019s fate was\nframed for a different time.\n24\n\n\nIt must be admitted that, despite attempts to establish\norder in the world, the planet continues to live in a state of\nanarchy. On the other hand, the need for a tougher and\nmore just order becomes increasingly more obvious. Most\nof today\u2019s threats go way beyond the scope of the\ncompetence of the nation-State. They are global in nature.\nNo individual country can cope with them alone. Much as\nis the case within individual nations, the international\ncommunity primarily needs the unanimity of its subjects in\nterms of their commitment to a set of fundamental\nprinciples. This seems to be expressed in many charters and\nconventions. In reality, however, it is not the case. The\nattitude towards terrorism can be cited as an example.\nDespite public statements condemning terrorism, it appears\nthat many still allow it as an acceptable means for\nachieving political and other ends. How else can one\nexplain that terrorists whose identities are known to all are\nnot hiding in the woods, but, rather, are able to find shelter\nin different States?\nOf course, it is true that the world does respond to\nsome extent to threats as they occur. Individual States and\nalliances of States do make serious efforts to fight global\nailments. Sometimes, as has just happened in Kosovo, they\nundertake such tasks as a coercion to peace. It is my\nposition that no one has a moral right to denounce NATO\nfor that operation, particularly those who, through their\ninaction, play into the hands of those who disturb the peace.\nYet this is not precisely what one would call a\ndemonstration of collective responsibility. In such a case\nseveral democratic and developed \u2014 and therefore\npowerful \u2014 States undertake the stewardship of the rest of\nthe world. Of course, we can only thank them for this. But\nit would be better for all if those who have undertaken\nresponsibility for the fate of the world carried out their\nmission within the framework of a mechanism established\nby the international organizations. We have already\nproposed to expand the membership of the Security Council\nand address the issue of veto rights in order to adapt it to\npresent-day requirements. In my view, the almost automatic\nuse of the veto is unacceptable. In the bipolar world this\npractice largely cancelled out the possibility of conducting\npeace enforcement operations, because in those years any\nforce represented, to some extent, one pole or the other.\nWith the end of the cold war, the possibility of using\ncollective decisions to bring about peace reappeared. The\ndecision taken against the aggression in Kuwait gave many\nthe hope that from then on the Security Council would be\nbound by shared principles and that an ethical approach\nwould prevail. There were other encouraging episodes as\nwell. But in the case of Kosovo, a new cold breeze\nseemed to have begun to blow from the Security Council.\nDespite its humane motivations, the operation carried out\nby NATO \u2014 like any ethical action today \u2014 also\ncontained a pragmatic component. Had NATO not\nintervened in Kosovo, the influx of refugees would\ninevitably have upset the fragile balance in that extremely\nimportant part of Europe. Perhaps a number of States\nwould have been drawn into the conflict. We might even\nhave witnessed a big Balkan war.\nIn today\u2019s world an ethical approach in international\npolitics is justified from a pragmatic standpoint as well.\nIt is from a position of morality that we should act if we\nwant to do good for mankind. Morality should be the\nbasis of our policy, and it should become the pillar of the\nnew thinking of the twenty-first century.\nWe are encouraged by the Secretary-General\u2019s\nstatement that measures to reform the Security Council\nwill be taking place shortly and that the reform will\nenable us to act in accordance with the norms of\ninternational law when addressing regional conflicts in the\nfuture.\nRegardless of the serious threats existing today, it\nwould not be an overstatement to say that mankind has\nnever in the course of history had a more singular\nopportunity to create a just world order and a more\nharmonious community of nations. True, occasionally\nconfrontational rhetoric can still be heard, but I am\nconvinced that today\u2019s controversies between East and\nWest are ghosts of the past, artificially grafted onto the\npresent. One may argue that this is done mostly to\ncamouflage the acute internal problems of individual\nStates. The generation that ended the cold war, the most\ndangerous conflict in the history of mankind, without\nspilling blood, can find a common language between\ncontinents, States and individual people and, through\ncivilized dialogue, shorten the route leading to the\nresolution of global problems today and in the future.\nNow that we have overcome the dividing lines of the\nideological confrontation, we must learn how to erase\nother lines that divide the peoples of our world into rich\nand poor, educated and uneducated. In this process too, a\nnew approach and new thinking are critical. Those who\nspoke before me have already mentioned that\nglobalization should not mean only access to markets,\nfree trade across borders, free movement of capital and\nfinancial interdependence. All this should be paralleled by\nthe globalization of responsibility for the fate of the\n25\n\n\nplanet and the realization that today\u2019s world is too small to\nallow for the painless coexistence of affluence and poverty.\nWe must find ways to alleviate the burden of debt on the\npoorest developing States. Otherwise, the perpetual pressure\nof a shortage in financial resources will render them unable\nto emerge from poverty and, certainly, unequipped to build\na free society.\nAssisting them in building free societies is a pragmatic\nobjective, not merely an ethical cause. In today\u2019s\ninterdependent world the poverty of States will produce\nechoes of terrorism, drugs and crime in others. In order to\nbe secure, the future world must consist of at least\nmoderately well-off, free nations that will pursue\ntransparent and predictable domestic and foreign policies.\nI recall appeals made by the leaders of many developed\nStates at different international forums, including President\nClinton\u2019s reassuring remarks at the annual meeting of the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank,\nwhere he underlined the critical importance of relieving the\ndebt burden on poor nations.\nThere are also appeals to the effect that we should\nenter the twenty-first century with developing and\neconomically weak nations freed of the heavy burden of\ndebt. We could, in fact, think of a 10-year programme\ndesigned to resolve the problem of debts right at the outset\nof the twenty-first century. This would be a most fair\ndecision which, at the threshold of a new century and a\nnew millennium, would become a kind of beacon guiding\nmany a nation to a brighter future.\nI have said many times that I am generally optimistic\nabout the future of mankind. This optimism is grounded in\nthe belief that we are slowly acquiring experience; we can\nlearn and we can be transformed. The Marshall Plan and\npost-war Europe, which have vanquished the chimera of\nantagonisms and showed new ways of integration, are good\nexamples of this.\nIn 1985, when many from this platform spoke of \u201cstar\nwars\u201d and the end of humanity, I declared that the new\nthinking offered to the world not \u201cstar wars\u201d, but a \u201cstar\npeace\u201d. I thank God that this declaration did not remain\nsimply a dream, and that mankind is gradually emerging\nfrom the nightmare of nuclear war, both on the ground and\nin the sky. This gives me reason to hope that humankind,\nequipped with the capacity for constant intellectual renewal,\nwill live its next century with a single mind which will\nmake it an epoch of peace and freedom, justice and\nuniversal harmony.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like\nfirst of all to express to you, Sir, our warm\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. We join the\nearlier delegations in wishing you success in the\nimportant task of guiding our debates.\nI would like to express to your predecessor, the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Eastern Republic of\nUruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, our gratitude for his\noutstanding leadership as President of the Assembly at its\nfifty-third session.\nI also wish to convey very special greetings to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to express our\ndeep appreciation for the work that he has done and our\nfirm support for his efforts to achieve peace in a year that\nhas been of critical importance for the United Nations.\nChile extends a hearty welcome to the new Member\nStates of our Organization, Kiribati, Nauru and the\n19\n\n\nKingdom of Tonga, fraternal countries of the Pacific\ncommunity.\nGlobalization and interdependence require new and\nstronger international institutions. As the international\nenvironment becomes increasingly complex and difficult,\nthe United Nations, with all its limitations, remains the only\nglobal actor capable of addressing not only the problems of\ncooperation and global conflict, but also issues that, by their\nvery nature, are no longer within the exclusive competence\nof States.\nThe expansion of the international agenda and the\nneed for collective management of the problems of\ninterdependence are the impetus for this trend. The issue of\ndemocracy, or rather of the lack of democracy, has ceased\nto be exclusively a sovereign matter for countries to deal\nwith; it has become a universal concern that no Government\ncan ignore. Protection of the environment has an\nindisputable international dimension, inasmuch as issues of\nvital importance for our future, such as climate change, the\npollution and over-exploitation of the oceans, the\ndeterioration of the ozone layer and growing desertification,\nall require global remedies. Increasingly strict international\nregimes are being established for the regulation and\nprohibition of weapons of mass destruction and for the\nelimination of anti-personnel landmines. The fight against\ndrug-trafficking can be truly effective only if it is waged\nwithin a framework of close regional and international\ncooperation, based on the principle of shared responsibility.\nSuch moving issues as the treatment of refugees, the fight\nagainst hunger and major epidemics fall squarely within the\nscope of multilateral action. The Government of Chile\nenthusiastically supports this trend towards a new\nmultilateralism.\nThe crisis in Kosovo revealed one of the most serious\nweaknesses and contradictions of the United Nations. The\npolicies of ethnic cleansing supported by the Serbian\nleadership in that region required an immediate and\nvigorous response by the international community.\nIt was truly regrettable that our Organization was\nprevented from the outset from taking action with the\nvigour that the situation required. It was also regrettable\nthat the solution to the crisis was found outside the\nappropriate framework of United Nations mechanisms and\nin contravention of the principles of the Charter. There is\nclearly a responsibility shared by all the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council for the inadequate\nfunctioning of the mechanisms of collective security. Once\nagain, it was evident that the veto or the threat of its use\ncan reduce to impotence the world's principal organ of\ncollective security. Once again, it was evident that, when\nthis occurs, a vacuum is created that can lead to the\nunilateral use of force without the prior authorization of\nthe Security Council.\nMore recently, the United Nations has had to face a\nnew challenge, a fresh humanitarian tragedy that it had to\nstop at all costs. I refer to the crisis in East Timor. Chile\nsupported with hope and enthusiasm the holding of the\nreferendum on 30 August, which was made possible by\nthe significant agreement reached between Indonesia and\nPortugal under United Nations auspices.\nA Chilean delegation of two distinguished\nparliamentarians was able to observe the successful\norganization of the electoral process and the admirable\nwork of the United Nations volunteers and staff. They\nalso witnessed the onset of the incidents that culminated\nin the massacre of which we are all aware. These acts are\ntotally unacceptable. We are pleased that the Republic of\nIndonesia has requested the intervention of the United\nNations to put an end to violence on the island. We are\nencouraged by the fact that, after so many unnecessary\ndeaths, it has been possible to organize a multinational\nforce under the efficient leadership of Australia.\nI wish to reiterate and reaffirm the commitment of\nChile to the peacekeeping operations of the United\nNations. Without interruption since 1949, my country has\nlent its cooperation to several of these operations. Today,\nwe are expanding our participation in this field and have\ndecided to contribute to the peacekeeping forces deployed\nin Kosovo and in East Timor. In February, Chile formally\njoined the reserve forces system. We have already\nidentified the personnel to be kept at the ready in terms\nof military units, police monitors and civilian experts.\nI wish to stress the importance that we attach to the\nimplementation of the Ottawa Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction, which Chile has signed and for which it is\ncompleting the formalities required for its approval by our\nNational Congress. In keeping with the spirit and purpose\nof that instrument, I reiterate my country's commitment\nnot to produce, export, import or lay any new anti-\npersonnel landmines, as we demonstrated last April in our\nofficial declaration of a unilateral moratorium.\nMy country notes with optimism and hope the\npositive signs that have recently emerged with regard to\n20\n\n\nthe long-awaited resumption of the peace process between\nIsrael and the Palestinian people. Chile has resolutely\nsupported this process from the very beginning and noted\nwith great concern its virtual paralysis. We hope that the\nIsraelis and the Palestinians alike will have the courage and\nresolve to opt unambiguously for dialogue and peace.\nChile expresses its concern and frustration at the\nobstacles that continue to block the self-determination\nreferendum provided for under the United Nations\nSettlement Plan for Western Sahara. We hope that the date\nthat has been set will be honoured so that the Sahraoui\npeople can have the opportunity to express their preference\nin a free, informed and transparent manner.\nLatin America has continued to make significant\ncontributions to international peace and stability throughout\nthe year. A final settlement has been achieved in the border\nconflict between two fraternal peoples on our continent:\nEcuador and Peru. As one of the four guarantor countries\nof the 1941 treaty by which those two countries are bound,\nChile is pleased to have contributed to the rapprochement\nbetween the parties and to have facilitated the dialogue that\nled this year to the settlement of their differences and the\nsigning of a peace agreement.\nThe border between Argentina and Chile is one of the\nlongest in the world. Numerous disagreements have arisen\nin the past over its demarcation. Thanks to the political will\nof the two nations, it has been possible to find solutions to\neach one of these problems. I have the deep satisfaction of\nannouncing to this Assembly that we have reached a\nsettlement with Argentina on the last remaining border\ndispute between our peoples. Our Parliaments have adopted\nthe Campo de Hielo Sur agreement and we can now\nconcentrate without distraction on the task of developing a\nrelationship of peace, friendship and cooperation and a true\nstrategic alliance between our two countries.\nFour years have passed since, on the occasion of the\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, the Member States undertook to intensify efforts\nto reform and democratize the Organization's structures in\norder to equip it to deal with the new and complex\nchallenges that it faces in a constantly changing\ninternational environment. We must acknowledge, however,\nthat little progress has been made. It has become a truism\nto point to the changes that have occurred in the\ninternational system set up after the Second World War.\nLess frequently mentioned is the fact that the institutions\nhave not kept pace with these changes.\nChile has stressed the need for due importance to be\ngiven to the process of reforming the General Assembly\nas the prime deliberative and decision-making body of the\nentire system. It is only here that all Member States are\nrepresented on an equal footing.\nOn this occasion, we reaffirm our position that the\nreform of the Security Council must take into account\nsuch criteria and principles as the sovereign equality of\nStates, equitable geographic representation and the need\nto create conditions for a functioning that would\nguarantee greater transparency and democracy in the\nworking methods and procedures of that body. The\npersistence of the veto \u2014 which, moreover, can be\nexercised without any public justification \u2014 represents a\nserious obstacle to the achievement of substantive\nagreements. It is a fact that most of the obstacles to the\nadmission of new permanent members are directly related\nto the right of veto that accompanies such membership.\nClearly, the loosening of regulations that govern the\nfree circulation across borders of the knowledge, goods\nand capital that are characteristic elements of\nglobalization has entailed significant benefits for our\nsocieties. It is also true, however, that globalization has\nthrown up new challenges and, in some cases, new risks,\nparticularly those associated with capital movement.\nThe international financial crisis of recent years has\ndemonstrated our ongoing vulnerability to events that we\ncannot control and for which we are not entirely\nresponsible. Following the near collapse of the\ninternational financial system, the demand for structural\nreform has increased exponentially. Today, while the\nsituation appears more hopeful, nothing has changed in\nsubstance. The systemic risks remain. We must relaunch,\nwith fresh impetus and vigour, the necessary reform\nprocess to stabilize the international financial system in\nthe future.\nCapital flows far exceed the value of world trade. It\nis ironic that, while we have devoted so much effort to\nestablishing new trade regimes throughout the world, so\nlittle has been done in the field of international finance.\nThe point is certainly not to impede the international flow\nof capital, but to establish an appropriate international\nframework to address the problems to which it may give\nrise. We cannot continue to be passive spectators as\nfinancial crises interrupt world growth and limit the\ndevelopment of our countries.\n21\n\n\nIt is also essential that we put all our energies into the\nnew round of multilateral trade negotiations that is just\nbeginning. The multilateral trade system, reflected most\naccurately in the World Trade Organization, must be\nstrengthened with a view to ensuring sustained and\ngenuinely equitable growth for all countries. It is essential\nthat the new round soon to start in Seattle be balanced so\nas to reflect the interests of developed and developing\ncountries alike. We also hope that it will be comprehensive\nin its thematic coverage. We oppose a limited approach in\nthe form of sectoral trade negotiations.\nIn the framework of the agendas of United Nations\nsummits and conferences, the closing decade has witnessed\ngatherings at the highest level to consider the urgent social\nproblems that beset mankind. From Copenhagen to Rio de\nJaneiro, Beijing to Cairo, Vienna to New York, the United\nNations has accomplished a superlative task in reviewing\nproblems and adopting programmes of action in the most\nimportant social spheres. In this connection, we attach the\ngreatest importance to the follow-up and implementation of\nagreements emanating from the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment. A special session of the General Assembly,\nto be held in Geneva next June, should renew the\ninternational community's commitment to the process begun\nin Copenhagen.\nWe welcome the recent Convention of the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) on the prohibition\nof the most severe forms of child labour. We are confident\nthat that organization, under the leadership of our fellow\nChilean, Mr. Juan Somav'a, will play an increasingly\nrelevant role in the new international social agenda.\nViolations of the basic rights of individuals can no\nlonger be considered an exclusively domestic problem of a\ncountry. Protection of these rights is the inescapable task of\nthe international community. This has been recognized by\nChile, which, since regaining democracy in 1990, has\nfirmly and sincerely supported the establishment of\neffective universal and regional regimes for the protection\nof human rights. We must bear in mind that the\ninternational regime for the protection of human rights is\nfragmentary and evolving. It consists of a set of standards\nand institutions that are gradually beginning to be applied\nwith many gaps and imperfections. It should also be noted\nthat this regime is being applied within the context of a\ncertain international reality characterized by important\ndifferences in the relative power of countries and by\nselective and sometimes paternalistic practices.\nGenocide and massive violations of human rights are\ndestined to fall within the competence of international\ntribunals. Chile welcomes that tendency, but it also\nrecognizes that we are now in a transitional stage of the\nprocess of globalization of justice. In this stage the norms\nof jurisdictions are not clear and are subject to various\ninterpretations, including some that may be arbitrary and\nerroneous.\nChile regained its democracy almost 10 years ago.\nMy Government represents those who fought for nearly\ntwo decades to restore Chile's tradition of freedom. Our\neconomy has experienced remarkable growth during this\nperiod. We scrupulously respect human rights. We\nparticipate avidly in furthering Latin American\nintegration. We are adhering to the new regimes being\nestablished by the international community in very diverse\nspheres.\nWe have also faced the dilemma of administering\njustice with respect to violations of human rights that\noccurred in the past in our country. This choice has led to\nconsiderable tension. Many countries that began the\nprocess of transition to democracy in more favourable\nconditions than Chile's preferred to circumvent such\ntensions by refraining from prosecuting very serious\ncrimes that occurred during the previous regimes.\nIn these circumstances, what grounds would exist for\nthe judiciary of a third State to exercise jurisdiction with\nrespect to acts that are currently the subject of\nproceedings in the court of the State in which those acts\nwere committed? There is no denial of justice in Chile.\nWe do not accept impunity for human rights violations.\nThe Government has initiated a broad dialogue to deal\nwith the consequences of the most serious human rights\nviolations that occurred in our country, particularly the\ntragedy of those who were arrested and disappeared. At\npresent nearly 300 cases relating to human rights\nviolations committed during the authoritarian regime that\ngoverned our country between 1973 and 1990 are being\ntried in Chilean courts. In several cases, the Chilean\ncourts have convicted the accused and have sentenced\nthem to prison terms that are now being served in\npenitentiaries.\nWe would understand if the organized international\ncommunity attempted to administer justice in countries in\nwhich the rule of law did not prevail or where the most\nbasic human rights continued to be trampled. But in a\ndemocratic State the task of administering justice must be\nundertaken by that State and its institutions.\n22\n\n\nThe Government of Chile considers it highly\nundesirable that judges of other countries should claim\njurisdiction to intervene directly in that process. This claim\nto jurisdiction, based on the principle of separation of\npowers, means plainly and simply ignoring the principle of\nthe juridical equality of States. Interference in matters\nwithin our country's jurisdiction is inappropriate and\nmisplaced and is tantamount to a lack of respect for our\nState of law and our democracy. Today this interference\naffects Chile and other fraternal countries of the Southern\nCone of Latin America. Tomorrow it may extend to the rest\nof the international community, leading to juridical chaos\nand competing judicial claims that will end up damaging\nthe international relations of many of our countries.\nBut our reaction to these imperfections and\ndiscriminatory practices is not to seek refuge in outdated\nprinciples and notions. On the contrary: we must move\nforward towards a clear, orderly and non-discriminatory\nregime, such as the one envisaged in the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. The establishment of a\npermanent organ designed to exercise criminal jurisdiction\nover persons accused of any of the crimes over which it has\ncompetence will have the virtue of discouraging both\nimproper internal procedures that guarantee the impunity of\nthe perpetrators and attempts by judges in other countries\nto make themselves the righteous of the world.\nI wish to conclude by expressing prudent optimism for\nthe future of our Organization. Many States and other\nactors, such as non-governmental organizations that make\nup our increasingly vibrant international civil society, would\nlike to raise the standing of the United Nations. We hope\nthat the Millennium Assembly, to which we have given all\nour support, will become the symbol of a renewed and\nmuch stronger United Nations as it faces the new century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, on\nmy own behalf and on behalf of my country, to express our\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of\nthe General Assembly for the current session. I am certain\nthat, with a person of your qualities and experience at the\nhelm, the Assembly will achieve the desired results.\nI wish to express my congratulations and gratitude\nto your predecessor, my friend Chancellor Didier Opertti\nof Uruguay, for his efficient work.\nI would also like to express my appreciation to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfor his dedication and his contribution to the renewal of\nthe Organization, and to reiterate to him our confidence\nin his work and his leadership.\nThis session of the General Assembly is the last one\nof the twentieth century. In the last hundred years, despite\ntwo disastrous global conflagrations, the nations of the\nworld have come to the collective realization that all wars\nare civil wars, all killing is fratricidal, and that any minor\nconflict could, by escalating to the nuclear level, spark\nhumankind\u2019s final war. It has thus become clear that in\norder to survive and prosper, nations must be united in a\nbasic agreement on the prevention of war and the\nprotection of human rights, with the preservation of the\nhuman race as a first priority.\nToday, on the eve of the new millennium, after half\na century marked by setbacks as well as by major\nsuccesses, the United Nations must renew its mandate as\na source of social and economic development and as a\nforce for peace.\nHere I would prefer to avoid pro forma statements\nand present instead some concrete and explicit\nconsiderations, as we believe that this Organization must\nbe the catalyst of a fair and realistic response to the\nchallenges of our common destiny.\nNo one could argue with the lofty principles\nunderlying the Charter of the United Nations. Its\nunquestioned universality is one of the characteristics of\nthe second half of the twentieth century. We agree that\nrespecting the Charter must mean, above all else, applying\nthose principles effectively, without interpreting them in\nways that distort the purposes of the Charter.\nOur collective experience of over half a century has\nshown that the proper application of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations is indeed the best and safest way of\nachieving and consolidating the benefits of world peace.\nOne of the Charter\u2019s cherished principles is the obligation\nof States not to interfere, directly or indirectly, in the\naffairs of other States, as sovereign equality excludes\n8\n\n\ninterference in the internal jurisdiction of other countries. It\nalso implies complying, in good faith, with agreed\ncommitments; observing the principles underlying them;\nand simultaneously respecting freedoms and human rights.\nThis is a fundamental aspect of international affairs.\nThe founders of the United Nations \u2014 and my\ngrandfather was among them \u2014 were not mistaken in their\nbelief that international peace is based on the sovereignty\nof Member States. Nor were they wrong when, ruling out\nthe unilateral use of threats and force against the integrity\nand independence of States, they envisaged the use of\neffective collective means.\nOver the past year, we have worked with\ndetermination to put an end to the 40-year-old conflict in\nColombia. We have reached agreement on an agenda for\nnegotiations between our Government and the Colombia\nRevolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), the oldest and largest\nof the guerrilla groups. But as the world knows, we are\nnegotiating in the midst of conflict, without benefit of a\nceasefire, so the killings, kidnappings and attacks by the\nguerrillas and the \u201cself-defence\u201d groups are still taking a\nhigh human, social and economic toll. Achieving peace will\nrequire time, patience and optimism in order to successfully\novercome the obstacles and doubts inherent in this process.\nWhen I last stood upon this rostrum, one year ago, I\noutlined a new direction for my country: to work to put an\nend to the corruption and violence in Colombia. I must\nadmit that the past year has been difficult; the challenges\nwe face are complex. The most important lesson we have\nlearned is that peace is a primary goal for Colombia. Not\npeace at any price, but a genuine peace that strengthens our\ndemocracy, preserves territorial unity and gives every\nColombian his or her rightful place in our common destiny.\nThe quest for peace is not limited to dialogue and\nnegotiation or to putting an end to armed conflict.\nAchieving peace requires much more than convincing the\nparties to sit at the negotiating table and reach\ncompromises. It requires rebuilding a society and State in\nwhich the causes of conflict have been eradicated, which\nstrengthens the State and helps to create the foundations of\na stable and lasting peace.\nWe Colombians have taken seriously the responsibility\nof achieving peace. As our recent history makes clear,\ninternational support is also necessary for us to face our\nchallenges. Colombia needs financial support from\nmultilateral organizations, from friendly countries and from\nnon-governmental organizations to complement my\nAdministration\u2019s efforts. Such support is key for\nColombia.\nTo this end, we have formulated a strategic package\nfor peace, economic prosperity and the strengthening of\nthe State; it is called Plan Colombia. It synthesizes our\neconomic, political and social views and aims to defend\nColombia from the threat of drug trafficking, to\nstrengthen our democratic institutions throughout the\nnational territory, and to guarantee the security of our\ncitizens and the full enjoyment of their rights and\nfreedoms. For that reason, we are counting on the\nsolidarity and contributions of the international\ncommunity.\nGiven the complexity of the process, it is clear that\ncooperation for peace must be carried out with the utmost\ncaution. Careless actions can thwart these efforts. That is\nwhy we are increasingly concerned by the groundless\nrumours of alleged military interventions in Colombia,\nwhose supposed purpose is to help my country in the\nstruggle in which it is engaged.\nI would like from this rostrum solemnly to state that\nColombia, true to the principles that govern our Republic,\nrejects any foreign interference or intervention in its\ninternal affairs. We Colombians will work to overcome\nour own challenges. These are times of cooperation, not\nintervention.\nMy Government also believes that the peace process\nis key in winning the fight against the worldwide problem\nof drugs. That immoral trade, which ruins lives, fuels\nviolence, promotes corruption and destroys our ecosystem,\nmust be opposed by all nations, by all available means.\nTo that end, we must coordinate our efforts regarding\nproduction and consumption as well as the numerous\nlinks between these two evils.\nOver the past two decades, Colombia has been on\nthe front lines of this battle, facing down the drug cartels\nand their campaigns of intimidation and terror. In the\nprocess we have lost many of our finest citizens, to whom\nwe owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude.\nBut as the major Colombian cartels are wiped out,\nthe illegal drug trade has become a kind of hydra \u2014 more\nspread out, more international and less public, and\ntherefore more difficult to defeat. To vanquish it requires\na genuine partnership among the countries that consume\nand produce illegal drugs, underpinned by the principles\nof joint responsibility, reciprocity and fairness.\n9\n\n\nIncreased efforts must also be made to confiscate from\ndrug traffickers the money and property they have obtained\nfrom that illegal trade. In particular, we must fight the\nsmuggling of industrial products to Colombia, which serves\nto launder drug money and ends up suffocating Colombia\u2019s\nindustries. We must also halt the flow of precursor\nchemicals needed for the production of narcotics. And\nmultinational corporations that benefit in one way or\nanother should be held accountable for not taking the\nnecessary precautions to prevent their helping and\nparticipating in drug trafficking through negligence.\nThere will be no peace in Colombia as long as the\ngreedy businesses of drug trafficking and the black market\nin weapons continue supplying irregular groups. We are\nvery concerned about the significant amounts of various\ntypes of weapons illegally entering Colombian territory.\nThere is an urgent, inescapable need for all Governments to\ncooperate to control and halt this unacceptable traffic in\ndeath and destruction.\nFor the last two years, since the first shock wave of\nthe so-called Asian crisis, the economy has been suffering\nthe difficulties of instability and slow-down. This crisis has\nshown that no State, however powerful, is immune, and that\nthe poor countries have suffered the most from its\nconsequences.\nThe hypothesis that capital flows would promote\naccelerated and sustained economic growth has faded in the\nlight of the facts. We have seen the growth of enormous\nsums of virtual money, whose uncontrolled movements\nhave brought economic turbulence, unemployment, more\npoverty and even, in some cases, political instability. Latin\nAmerica has become the most recent victim of the crisis.\nWe must, therefore, give the most serious consideration and\npriority to the design of a new financial structure. This will\nbe viable and efficient only if it involves increased\nresources from multilateral financial institutions. It must\nalso involve support mechanisms to lessen the social impact\nof structural adjustment programmes, especially those\naffecting the most vulnerable. The Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, said so when he spoke about the need to\nrespect essential values to give a human face to the global\nmarket.\nAt the end of the twentieth century, we are moving\ninto an era of powerful changes, accompanied by\nworrisome tensions. Globalization is deepening, but it\ncoexists with forces that encourage fragmentation. As the\npeace processes move forward in many regions, new\nviolence explodes in others. Wealth is expanding to\nunprecedented levels, but alienation and poverty persist.\nThe technological means that promote interdependence\nand development also support networks of organized\ncrime, drug trafficking, money laundering, terrorism and\narms trafficking. New struggles and conflicts have\nappeared, some using means for which the international\ncommunity does not seem to be prepared.\nGlobal confrontation is a thing of the past, as are the\nold plots resulting from strife and spheres of influence.\nThese are times to think in terms of a real community of\nnations, as competing partners, but mainly as partners that\nshare a common destiny.\nThere is, nevertheless, a perception that not\neverything is going well. The world is still not satisfied\nwith itself. There are forces of destabilization and\nimbalance which put at risk the achievements made to\ndate. Many millions still suffer from malnutrition,\nilliteracy, disease and exclusion.\nWe must, therefore, revitalize international\ncooperation to make the best of globalization, to distribute\nits benefits more fairly so that development and peace can\ncomplement each other efficiently and productively.\nRevitalizing cooperation is not an option; it is a duty.\nAfter over five decades of existence, the United\nNations has partially fulfilled its promise. It has been able\nto avoid the horrors of a new world holocaust. But the\nanticipated order, wherein the United Nations would\nguarantee peace, security and development for all peoples,\nremains to be built.\nAfter the progress achieved with the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s reform proposals, we see with great concern\nthat the pace of change has slowed. Reform must be a\ncontinuing process. The United Nations must continue\nadapting ever more effectively to new conditions and\nrealities. But this cannot simply take a form that is a\nproduct of the post-cold-war era. We need a concerted\nwill. From various directions there are calls for the\nSecurity Council to become more effective, to consult the\nspirit of the Charter and to balance the realities of world\npower with the just aspirations of those peoples which are\nleast strong.\nThe system of collective security is one of the\ncornerstones of multilateralism. It is the rational response\nto interventionist or isolationist tendencies, the maximum\nguarantee of the principles to which we all adhere.\nColombia reiterates its confidence in these principles of\n10\n\n\ncollective security and its commitment to work, decisively,\nwith the different sectors of the international community in\norder to invigorate the capacity of the Security Council to\nrespond to problems and crises in all regions. That is why\nmy country has submitted its candidature for a seat on the\nCouncil for the period 2001-2002.\nThe time for simple reform intentions is past. With the\narrival of the new millennium, the historic moment has\ncome to begin anew real negotiations in the different\ninstitutions. We need to find genuinely universal paradigms\nto ensure that multilateralism leads to the globalization of\nsolidarity. It is necessary to leave behind generalities or\nfragmented criteria in order to find a comprehensive vision\nof the United Nations system. A great effort of coordination\nis required between these institutions and the new\ninternational actors, including non-governmental\norganizations, and the promotion of a real association\nwithin a globalized but fairer system. The twentieth century\nhas demonstrated that, alongside the horror and cruelty,\nthere has prevailed what was once considered utopian: the\nUnited Nations.\nOur paramount commitment must be to the human\ncondition, the ethics and culture of peoples, solidarity and\nrespect for others, regardless of ethnic, ideological, religious\nor any other considerations. We cannot give in until the day\nwhen the freedom and democracy proclaimed in our\ndocuments have become a universal reality. When we have\nliberated the human spirit so that it may fully develop its\nenormous potential, we will have laid the foundations of a\nworld truly at peace.\nColombia, amidst its difficulties and problems, does\nnot want to be, nor will it be, simply a witness to the\nchanges of these times. Colombia is not a military or\neconomic power. Nonetheless, it is respected by the\ncommunity of nations for its unlimited and unconditional\nsupport for the norms and principles of international law.\nWe offer our contribution \u2014 modest, but part of the\ncommon effort \u2014 to a better future for all mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like\nto warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly and to wish you every success in this difficult\noffice.\nI should also like to thank Foreign Minister Opertti for\nhis tireless dedication in successfully presiding over the\nfifty-third session of the General Assembly.\nI welcome Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga, with which\nGermany has long enjoyed friendly ties, as new Members\nof the world Organization.\nI endorse the statement of my Finnish colleague, Tarja\nHalonen, on behalf of the European Union.\nThis session of the General Assembly is the last in\nthis \u201ccentury of extremes\u201d, as the British historian Eric\nHobsbawm called the century now drawing to a close. That\nis reason enough to take stock. Since its foundation, the\nUnited Nations has greatly enhanced relations between\npeoples. The development of international law, protection\nof human rights, decolonization, worldwide humanitarian\nand disaster aid, arousing awareness of the great problems\nfacing mankind, such as population growth, poverty and the\nglobal environmental crisis \u2014 all of this would be\ninconceivable without the United Nations.\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations\nobjectives and values \u2014 peace, human rights, freedom,\njustice and development \u2014 and they have gained\nworldwide recognition, even if, unfortunately, they are not\nalways respected everywhere. Nevertheless, even after more\nthan 50 years, there is still a long way to go before they are\nuniversally respected and implemented. Despite all its\nefforts, the international community has not yet succeeded\nin ridding our planet of war, oppression, tyranny, expulsion\nand grave human rights violations, including genocide. At\nthe close of this century, the United Nations and its\nMember States are unable to fully master their core task,\nnamely, safeguarding peace and security. The great hope\nthat following the end of the East-West conflict the era of\nmultilateral cooperation and worldwide rule of law would\ndawn has not yet come to fruition.\nToday the question of peacekeeping must be\nconsidered under conditions very different to those during\nthe United Nations early years. First, most conflicts today\nare internal rather than international, as in earlier times.\nSecondly, the role of the nation State has been\nconsiderably relativized by the increased importance of\nhuman rights and the globalization of the economy and\nsociety. Against this background, the question of\npeacekeeping arises more and more in an area of tension\nbetween traditional State sovereignty and protection of\nhuman rights.\nWhat is to be done when entire States collapse and\nthe civilian population is massacred in never-ending civil\nwars from all sides? What if ethnic tensions in a State are\npartly provoked by criminal Governments, which then\nrespond with pogroms, mass expulsions and mass\nmurders, even genocide? Should the United Nations then\nregard State sovereignty as more important than\nprotection of individuals and their rights? Rwanda,\nKosovo and East Timor are dramatic examples of this.\nIn many ways, therefore, the Kosovo conflict\nrepresents a turning point. The international community\ncould no longer tolerate a State waging war against its\nown people and using terror and expulsion as a political\ninstrument. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his\nbrilliant and trail-blazing speech to the fifty-fifth session\nof the Commission on Human Rights, no Government has\nthe right to use the cover of the principle of State\nsovereignty to violate human rights. Non-interference in\ninternal affairs must no longer be misused as a shield for\ndictators and murderers. The World Conference on\nHuman Rights in Vienna reaffirmed this in 1993, with the\napproval of all United Nations Members States, with the\nwords:\n\u201cthe promotion and protection of all human rights is\na legitimate concern of the international\ncommunity\u201d. (Vienna Declaration and Programme\nof Action, I, para. 4)\nHowever, the Kosovo conflict also marks a change\nof direction in the development of international relations.\nHow will the international community decide in the\nfuture \u2014 this question has just been raised once more in\nEast Timor \u2014 when it comes to preventing massive\nhuman rights violations against an entire people? Two\ndevelopments are conceivable.\n\n\n\nA practice of humanitarian interventions could evolve\noutside the United Nations system. This would be a very\nproblematic development. The intervention in Kosovo,\nwhich took place in a situation where the Security Council\nhad tied its own hands after all efforts to find a peaceful\nsolution had failed, was intended to provide emergency\nassistance and, ultimately, to protect the displaced Kosovo\nAlbanians. The unity of the European States and the\nWestern Alliance, as well as various Security Council\nresolutions, were of crucial significance here. However, this\nstep, which is only justified in this special situation, must\nnot set a precedent for weakening the United Nations\nSecurity Council's monopoly on authorizing the use of legal\ninternational force. Nor must it become a licence to use\nexternal force under the pretext of humanitarian assistance.\nThis would open the door to the arbitrary use of power and\nanarchy and throw the world back to the nineteenth century.\nThe only solution to this dilemma, therefore, is to\nfurther develop the existing United Nations system in such\na way that in the future it is able to intervene in good time\nin cases of very grave human rights violations, but not until\nall means of settling conflicts peacefully have been\nexhausted and \u2014 this is a crucial point \u2014 within a strictly\nlimited legal and controlled framework.\nIn the twenty-first century the individual and his rights\nmust take a more prominent place alongside the rights of\nStates in the concept of security as defined by the\ninternational community. The reform of the Security\nCouncil, the central body for safeguarding world peace,\nmust be oriented towards this principle. The Security\nCouncil is, in fact, authorized to act, and able to do so,\nwhere peace or security are at risk due to internal\ndevelopments. This has been demonstrated by a long chain\nof decisions, from the apartheid resolution to the\ninterventions in Iraq, Bosnia and Haiti. However, in\nRwanda, Kosovo and the Congo, decision making in the\nSecurity Council was blocked, thus rendering it unable to\nlive up to its responsibilities enshrined in the United\nNations Charter, with disastrous results for the peoples in\nquestion.\nThese conflicts are a pressing reason, particularly in\nview of the important Millennium General Assembly, to\nfinally carry out the long-overdue substantial reform of the\nSecurity Council. The Security Council must be adapted to\nthe new realities of the global political situation. It must\nhave a more representative composition and, above all, it\nmust be equipped to react to the crises and conflicts of\ntoday. Reform must involve enlargement to include both\nmore permanent and non-permanent members, as well as a\nstrengthening of its decision-making powers. As the\nAssembly knows, Germany has for some time now\nexpressed its willingness to assume more and lasting\nresponsibility in this connection. We stand by this\nunreservedly.\nIn the debate on reform we must not avoid the issue\nof the permanent members' right of veto, a question of\nkey importance for the Security Council's capability to\nact. The right of veto is regarded by many as outdated in\nits current form. However, it is a situation with which we\nhave to reckon internationally for a long time to come.\nHow then can decision-making in the Security Council be\nmade more efficient?\nAccording to the Charter, the Security Council acts\nwith the mandate, and on behalf, of all United Nations\nMember States. But hitherto they have not been entitled\nto learn why a State has exercised its right of veto. This\nis not only neither democratic nor transparent, but also\nmakes it easier for States to veto a draft resolution\nunilaterally for national rather than international interests.\nThe introduction of an obligation for a State to explain to\nthe General Assembly why it is vetoing a draft resolution\nwould make it more difficult to do so and thus bring\nabout substantial progress towards using the right of veto\nmore responsibly. Why should not the General Assembly\nassume more responsibility in the future, too?\nA second approach to making the international\npeacekeeping system more efficient would be via Chapter\nVIII of the United Nations Charter, namely by\nstrengthening the regional security systems and\nredistributing tasks and areas of responsibility among\nthem and the United Nations. It is becoming clear that the\nregional organizations could be allocated an even greater\nimplementation role. This would also foster the\ncapabilities of regional organizations to engage in security\ncooperation, as well as their collaboration with the United\nNations. However, the primacy of the Security Council\nremains absolutely essential.\nWithout reforms in the area of peacekeeping, the\nSecurity Council will be circumvented more and more\nfrequently, resulting in the erosion of the Security Council\nand, ultimately, of the entire United Nations system. The\nUnited Nations, one of civilization's greatest achievements\nthis century, as well as the values and principles it\nrepresents, would thus be at risk of subsiding into\ninsignificance. We must prevent that.\n12\n\n\nThe disaster in East Timor is currently demonstrating\nhow necessary close cooperation is between a Security\nCouncil capable of taking action and the countries in the\nregion. The Security Council's mandate to send a\nmultilateral peacekeeping force must be fully implemented.\nIndonesia must now cooperate closely with the United\nNations Mission and do everything in its power to\nguarantee its success. The bloodshed must end. The victims\nmust be helped. Those displaced must be able to return\nhome safely. Germany has already provided humanitarian\nand food aid. We will send a medical corps to assist the\npeacekeeping troops and make further contributions towards\nrebuilding the destroyed country. I am confident that our\nParliament will lend this plan its full backing.\nIn Africa, the Great Lakes region, the Congo and\nSierra Leone have for many years been the scene of terrible\nwars, mass murders, destruction and much suffering on the\npart of refugees. The Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nand the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) and its Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) have\ndone much to contain and resolve these conflicts. However,\nthese organizations also need the support of the United\nNations, in Sierra Leone, in the Congo and, in particular, in\nthe conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Both parties to\nthe conflict must observe the agreements concluded and\nwork closely together with the United Nations and the OAU\nso that the peace process now begun can be brought to a\nsuccessful conclusion.\nThe international community must focus on the causes\nrather than merely the symptoms of wars and conflicts in\nthe context of multilateral peacekeeping. Secretary-General\nKofi Annan rightly called for a \u201cculture of prevention\u201d to\nbe developed in order to prevent the outbreak of wars and\navert natural disasters more effectively in future.\nEveryone knows how difficult the transition from the\n\u201cculture of reaction\u201d to the \u201cculture of prevention\u201d will be.\nIt takes a lot of persuading to summon up the political and\neconomic will for measures intended to prevent something\nwhich we hope will never happen. However, on financial\ngrounds and, above all, on humanitarian grounds, it is our\nduty and responsibility to revise our thinking here. Progress\nis urgently required in four areas.\nFirst, we must move on from early warning to early\nresponse. The United Nations has considerable resources at\nits disposal for preventive diplomacy, which must be used\neven more. There is also a great potential for synergy in\ncooperation with non-governmental organizations.\nSecondly, peacekeeping operations must be carried\nout before conflicts erupt. The United Nations mission in\nMacedonia has set a standard in this respect.\nThirdly, disarmament and the non-proliferation of\nmeans of mass destruction are in need of fresh political\nimpetus. It is essential that the Geneva negotiations gain\nmomentum, particularly in the fields of global nuclear\ndisarmament and the verification of biological weapons,\nand in the implementation of the Chemical Weapons\nConvention. Furthermore, Germany advocates the\nadoption of a convention on preventing the illegal transfer\nof small arms worldwide.\nFourthly, peace-building is a prevention task of\ngrowing importance. With the United Nations Interim\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the United\nNations is facing one of the most comprehensive tests in\nits history. Building public order by creating an efficient\njudicial system and quickly sending the pledged\ninternational police units is now crucial. Since the United\nNations began incorporating national police units in the\ninternational standby system, they have been able to act\nmore swiftly. We must continue along this path.\nProtection of human rights and the growing\ndemocratization of States form the basis for a preventive\npeace policy and civil conflict management. It is a\nhistorical fact that democracies with a well-developed\ncivil society hardly ever wage war against each other.\nLasting economic success cannot be achieved in the\nglobalized information society of tomorrow without good\ngovernance founded on human rights, the separation of\npowers and a functioning legal and constitutional\nframework.\nIn the field of human rights, welcome progress has\nbeen made towards broadening the legal basis for\ninternational relations, particularly during the last year.\nThe detention of Pinochet and the indictment of Milosevic\nby the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\nYugoslavia are milestones along the path towards creating\na world in which the rule of law prevails. In future,\ndictators and perpetrators of human rights violations will\nno longer be able to rely on not being called to account\nfor their actions. This must also apply to the murderers of\nDili and those who issued the orders. Just like everywhere\nelse in the world, internal peace is contingent upon\njustice.\nThe adoption of the Statute of the International\nCriminal Court represented a quantum leap in the\n13\n\n\ndevelopment of international law. I call upon all States to\nrespect the integrity of the Rome Statute, to sign it and to\nswiftly ratify it, so that the Court can commence work next\nyear.\nGermany is doing all it can to bring about progress in\nthe following fields of human rights. The heinous crimes of\nchild trafficking and child prostitution must be banned\nthroughout the world, as must the use of child soldiers. In\nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts,\nthe age limit must be raised to 18.\nIn many countries women are still largely without\nrights and protection and subjected to discrimination and\nviolence. This is an unacceptable injustice. Unfortunately,\nour world is still a long way from genuine equality, even\nwith regard to fundamental rights. We must therefore aim\nto adopt the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the\nElimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.\nIn our view, the death penalty cannot be justified\neither ethically or legally. Together with its European\npartners, Germany will therefore continue to vigorously\nwork towards ensuring the implementation of the joint\nresolution on abolishing the death penalty.\nProtection of press freedom must be improved. The\nfreedom to inform is a reliable gauge of respect for human\nrights. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights guarantees the right to freedom of opinion.\nHowever, censorship, intimidation and reprisals are the\norder of the day in many countries. It is particularly\nshocking that year after year dozens of journalists are killed\nwhile on assignment. The United Nations should take a\ncloser look at this issue and consider practical solutions as\nwell as enhance legal protection for journalists. To this end\nwe will shortly be extending invitations to a conference to\nbe held in Germany.\nThe United Nations third major task alongside\npeacekeeping and promoting human rights in the coming\ncentury will be to bring about a reconciliation between rich\nand poor countries.\nThe tenth Human Development Report of the United\nNations Development Programme came to the sad\nconclusion that globalization has further widened the gap\nbetween rich and poor countries. The international\ncommunity must endeavour to counter this trend. The\ndevelopment of the poorer and the poorest countries must\nnot be left to the invisible hand of the global market. The\nindividual, not the market, must be the focus of the\nglobalization debate. This will also require greater\nsteering at the political level.\nThe rich countries have a responsibility to help poor\ncountries take advantage of globalization and enable them\nto have a fairer share of the world economy by assisting\nthem with internal reforms and by opening up markets.\nWithin the framework of its European Union and Group\nof 8 presidencies, Germany launched substantial\ninitiatives, which must be further developed in the form\nof the 1999 K\u00f6ln Debt Initiative and the commencement\nof negotiations on a follow-up arrangement for the Lom\u00e9\nConvention.\nDevelopment cooperation in the broadest sense must\nbecome one of the United Nations core tasks to a greater\ndegree than hitherto. Science and technology are geared\nfar too much to the problems of rich countries. Why do\nwe not make greater use of the United Nations framework\nto build bridges here? The economist Jeffrey Sachs made\nthe interesting suggestion, for example, that a millennium\nvaccine fund could be established, with guaranteed\nmarkets in the future for vaccines against tropical viruses\nsuch as tuberculosis, malaria and, above all, AIDS.\nFurthermore, in the context of the emergence of a global\nknowledge society, the international regime for the\nprotection of intellectual property must be revised in order\nto ensure that the world\u2019s poor do not lose a large part of\ntheir rights and freedoms in the near future. Rich and\npoor countries should get together with one another more\nfrequently to discuss such proposals. During its\npresidency of the Group of Eight, Germany made a start\nby meeting the non-aligned countries and the Group of\n77.\nThe destruction of the environment has long since\nceased to be a soft issue, but, rather, has become a very\nhard question which will have an increasingly strong\nimpact on international security. According to the new\nstudy by the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP), global warming and water shortages will be the\nbiggest problems facing humanity in the coming century.\nUNEP also rightly draws attention to the close connection\nbetween environmental destruction, poverty and excessive\nconsumption. The deadlock in the climate protection\nnegotiations must finally be overcome and the Kyoto\nProtocol implemented. The destruction of the rain forest\nmust be stopped and further desertification prevented, and\nwe must halt the squandering of our planet\u2019s natural\nresources and switch to renewable energy as quickly as\npossible. The world does not have much time left to\n14\n\n\nremap a course towards sustainability. This will also require\na much more active population policy, including a\nlong-term strategy to deal with the ageing of our world\u2019s\npopulation. The International Plan of Action on Ageing,\nadopted in 1982, is in need of urgent revision. We intend\nto hold a ministerial conference in Germany on this issue\nunder the auspices of the Economic Commission for\nEurope.\nWith the leap into the next millennium, the nation\nState principle will continue to diminish in importance. It\nwill no longer be possible to find answers to major global\nproblems within the framework of the traditional nation\nstate. Rather, this will take place in a strengthened\ninternational structure and with a transfer of power to\ninternational organizations, with the United Nations at their\nhead. This will entail a transformation of traditional power\ninto justice, the reconciliation of interests and a greater role\nfor civil society in the international political system, with\nthe ever-greater involvement of representatives of civil\nsociety and industry. Reaching agreement on minimum\nstandards with regard to social issues \u2014 on the issue of\nchild labour, for example \u2014 will be possible in many cases\nonly in a global context. I support the proposal put forward\nby Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact on\ncommon values and principles be concluded within the\nframework of a public/private partnership, between the\nUnited Nations and major companies, in order to lend the\nlaw of the market a human face.\nThe United Nations must become the core of effective\nglobal governance. Strengthening the United Nations, which\nmust begin by guaranteeing its financial basis, is therefore\none of Germany\u2019s most important foreign policy objectives.\nDuring the past 50 years, and for the first time in its\nhistory, Germany has been opting wholeheartedly for\nintegration into multilateral structures, thereby achieving\ndemocracy, freedom and reunification. Today, out of a\nsense of deep conviction and historical responsibility, our\ncountry is committed to peaceful reconciliation of interests\nand to multilateralism. We are taking this conviction with\nus to our old and new capital, Berlin. In the international\nState system of tomorrow the answer to the challenges of\nglobalization will come from multilateralism alone. Our\nworld will always be plural, and no form of unilateralism\ncan therefore work in the long run. For that reason, the\ntwenty-first century, with its more than 6 billion people and\ntheir States, will need a United Nations that is capable of\ntaking action. The United Nations and its Members can\ntherefore be certain that we Germans will be their\nstaunchest allies in the efforts to strengthen the United\nNations.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The\ndelegation of Peru is greatly pleased, Sir, at your election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession, especially since Peru was an active participant in\nNamibia\u2019s independence process, which was advanced by\nthe United Nations. As the first speaker at this morning\u2019s\nmeeting I am particularly pleased to congratulate you and\nthe other officers of the General Assembly.\nThe arrival of the new millennium is a great historic\nopportunity to initiate an era of peace, progress and well-\nbeing, from which no people on Earth should be excluded.\nThat requires a greater commitment on the part of the\ninternational community to create conditions that will\nenable developing nations properly to channel their own\nenergy and potential with a view to achieving\ncomprehensive national development.\nAt the height of the twentieth century, the majority\nof the world\u2019s peoples remain mired in the social, cultural\nand technological conditions of the nineteenth century \u2014\nor even of earlier centuries. We shall be able truly to\nspeak of a new era only if our aspirations for the twenty-\nfirst century and the third millennium become tangible\nreality for those peoples and if those peoples succeed in\nfulfilling their own legitimate aspirations: in other words,\nif a globalized world can globalize well-being and dignity.\nThe conversion of our economies to adapt them to\nglobalization has social costs which we can bear provided\nthat this process assures us a future of development and\nwell-being, not one of additional frustrations. Such\nfrustrations could arise if our national economies, rather\nthan growing stronger, are weakened by economic\nopening based on unequal or unjust terms of trade. The\nreaction, which no one wishes to see, could be a return to\ndefeated economic ideas.\nIn speaking of my own country, Peru, I can say that,\nlike other peoples, it inherited a heavy burden of injustice\nand backwardness, but it also has an extraordinary future-\nlooking calling that has made it possible over the past 10\nyears for our country to become an emerging economy.\nThat future-looking calling has enabled us to defeat\nthe totalitarian, terrorist designs of the Shining Path and\nof the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. It was the\n\n\nlatter group that seized the residence of the Japanese\nAmbassador in 1996.\nThe destructive capacity of such criminal activity is on\nthe increase thanks to access to new technology, and today\nit threatens every region and every continent. If it is not\nduly stopped, it will undoubtedly become the nightmare of\nthe twenty-first century. Both internal and external peace\nare essential for the coming of the new era that we are\nchampioning.\nIn 1998, Peru and Ecuador were at a crossroads: either\nto pursue the path of armed conflict, the situation typical of\nthe entire century, which has led to the destruction of\npeoples; or to follow the path of peace, the only possibility\nfor development. Peru and Ecuador chose peace. The 1998\npeace agreement between Peru and Ecuador was the\nproduct of two equally important factors: the political will\nof two Governments taken to its ultimate conclusion; and\nthe capacities, energy and awareness of two peoples\ndetermined to overcome old prejudices and work towards\na future of development. Ecuador and Peru intend to reach\nthe twenty-first century without the baggage of the\nnineteenth. Peace has opened up possibilities for the\ndevelopment of Peru and of Ecuador thanks to savings in\nresources once earmarked for defence, and it has shown\nagain that Latin America is a mature region that rejects\nwarlike tension.\nBut tranquility in our region has been disturbed by the\nalliance of drug trafficking and terrorism. In some cases,\nthese criminal activities have created power sufficient to\nchallenge States as well as to upset the world economy:\nillicit drug money may have infiltrated productive,\ncommercial and even political activities. Terrorism and drug\ntrafficking therefore represent a threat to modern society\nand to good governance.\nIn general terms, poverty, terrorism, drug trafficking\nand racial discrimination are the main barriers to our\nglimpsing the new era that as civilized peoples we propose\nto reach. Our task and our commitment is to overcome\nthese obstacles with firm political will if we want this\ntransitional period in which we live to mark the threshold\nof a new era for mankind.\nThe concepts of democracy and fairness must prevail.\nIt is important to promote democracy within countries, but\nalso to promote it between countries and between peoples.\nDemocracy applies not only to the internal structure of\nStates, but also to the international relations that will\ndetermine the fate of the world.\nHuman rights raised to their maximal power and\nhighest expression are the rights of peoples, and all\npeoples have a right to the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr.\nPresident, it gives me great pleasure to see you presiding\nover this new session of the General Assembly after your\nlong struggle to gain freedom, along with Sam Nujoma,\nNelson Mandela and others who fought to bring an end to\nthe era of colonialism, apartheid and foreign occupation.\nYour presence here today leading this session of the\nGeneral Assembly attests to the victory achieved by the\npeople of Namibia in the battle for freedom and\nindependence. It strengthens the hope of the Palestinian\npeople that the dawn of their freedom and the independence\nof their homeland, Palestine, is near. Furthermore, the\nvictory of your friendly country, Namibia, affirms the\nconstructive role played by the United Nations in the\neradication of the colonialism that has burdened oppressed\npeoples and in enabling them to gain their national\nindependence. I call upon the United Nations to continue to\nundertake this historic role to eliminate all forms of\noccupation and colonialism and to strengthen the\nfoundations of peace throughout the world.\nAs I congratulate and welcome you, Sir, I would be\nremiss if I did not extend our gratitude to your predecessor,\nMr. Didier Opertti. It also gives me great pleasure to\nexpress our deep appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary-General, for his distinguished role in leading this\ninternational Organization and promoting for world peace.\nI also want to congratulate the three new members of\nthe United Nations: the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic\nof Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Their membership is\nan important step towards the realization of the universality\nof the Organization.\nI address the Assembly today \u2014 the representatives of\nthe international community \u2014 for the second consecutive\nyear, seeking the continuation of support for the realization\nof the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people,\nparticularly at this crucial and sensitive stage that lies\nbetween us and the declaration of our independent\nPalestinian State and sovereignty over our liberated land.\nThis requires the strengthening of international efforts in\norder to really achieve a just solution to the question of\nPalestine, the crux of the Middle East conflict. The\ncoming millennium summit, with all the renewed hope\nand promising beginning it represents for all people, must\nbe a decisive deadline for the achievement of peace in the\nMiddle East. We should work collectively and vigorously\nto achieve this. I look forward to the participation of\nPalestine, as a Member State of the United Nations, in the\ndeliberations of the coming millennium summit, and I\nhope for and trust in the Assembly's support for this\nPalestinian determination to achieve independence so that\nPalestine can assume the position it deserves within the\nfamily of nations.\nAs the Assembly is aware, we concluded the Sharm\nel-Sheikh Memorandum with Mr. Barak, the new Prime\nMinister of Israel, on 4 September, under the auspices of\nPresident Hosni Mubarak, and in the presence of King\nAbdullah II, Secretary of State Albright, Mr. Moratinos,\nrepresenting the European Union, and Mr. Larsen,\nrepresenting Mr. Kofi Annan.\nThe Memorandum is aimed at the implementation of\nall the obligations of the interim period under the Oslo\nagreement, the Wye River Memorandum and the Hebron\nProtocol, and at the resumption of the final status\nnegotiations. This was done with the hope of bringing to\nan end the policy of protraction and freezing that was\npursued by the former Israeli Government, which\ncompletely paralysed the peace process and almost dashed\nthe ambitious hopes created by this process for all the\ncountries and peoples of the Middle East.\nThe Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum serves as a\nsource of new hope for putting the peace process back on\nthe right track, as it reaffirms the implementation of\nexisting agreements and of all the obligations within a\nspecific time-frame. In this connection, I extend my\ngratitude and thanks to all those who contributed to the\nconclusion of the Memorandum, particularly our host in\nSharm el-Sheikh, President Hosni Mubarak, as well as\nKing Abdullah II and Secretary of State Albright, who\nundertook tangible and concrete efforts as a representative\nof President Clinton, and the European leaders, their\nrepresentatives and their envoys to the peace process. The\ncontinuous involvement of these friends in this process\nwas essential and necessary for pushing the process\nforward. International sponsorship of the Middle East\npeace process is the guarantee for its definitive and final\nsuccess.\n24\n\n\nThe absence of such an international role would send\nthe fragile situation in the region back to square one. I\ntherefore call upon the international community to\naccelerate and strengthen its efforts and participation to\npush the peace process forward and revitalize it on all\ntracks. A just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East\ncan last only if it is protected by international legitimacy\nand if efforts are undertaken to implement all of the\nresolutions pertaining to the Middle East conflict on the\nPalestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks.\nWe should work hard so that the signing of this\nMemorandum will succeed in ending the stagnation of the\npeace process and in opening the door that the former\nIsraeli Government closed in the face of all serious efforts\naimed at achieving real peace.\nAs we reaffirm once more our commitment to the\npeace process and the implementation of the signed\nagreements, we hope that this time the Israeli side will\nimplement these agreements scrupulously and honestly,\nincluding the phases of redeployment agreed upon in the\nWye River and Oslo agreements, the release of prisoners\nand the other obligations of the transitional period, such as\nsafe passage between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\nand the construction of the Gaza seaport.\nThe Israeli Government is called upon to immediately\nand decisively cease all measures that violate international\nresolutions, laws and covenants and thus destroy the\nchances of peace. At the forefront of these are the\nsettlement activities and the confiscation of land, especially\nin AI-Quds Al-Sharif, and its vicinity, and the siege of the\ncity of Bethlehem and the rest of the Palestinian territories.\nThe continuation of these settlement policies and practices\nwill quash the hopes and expectations generated by the\nsigning of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum and destroy\nprospects for the final settlement negotiations, which began\non 13 September. The cessation of all such measures is\nneeded in order that we can, together with my new partner,\nMr. Barak, continue the march of the peace of the brave\nthat we began with two other partners \u2014 the late Yitzhak\nRabin, who gave his life for this peace, and Shimon\nPeres \u2014 for a new Middle East.\nHence, we look forward to seeing new, real and\ntangible changes in the positions and actions of the Israeli\nside that will open the door, in word and in deed, for the\nachievement of a just and comprehensive peace \u2014 a peace\nof the brave that will lead to the realization of the right of\nthe Palestinian people to self-determination and to the\nestablishment of their independent State, with Al-Quds Al-\nSharif (Jerusalem) as its capital, and the realization of the\nright of the Palestine refugees to return to their homeland\nin accordance with resolution 194 (III) which affirms the\nright of the refugees to return to their homes and the right\nto compensation for those who do not wish to return.\nThe realization of the right of the Palestinian people\nto establish their independent State with Al-Quds Al-\nSharif as its capital will provide the definitive guarantee\nfor the establishment of a permanent peace in the Middle\nEast. It will also be a validation of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and its numerous resolutions over 50\nyears, beginning with resolution 181 (II) which called for\nthe establishment of two States in Palestine, one Jewish,\nwhich is Israel, and one Arab, which is Palestine. The\nrights of peoples do not diminish because of a statute of\nlimitations or under oppression, and our people have\nproved through the years that they deserve life, freedom\nand their own independent State. The time has come for\nthe international community, represented by the General\nAssembly, to reaffirm this right and to work for its\nrealization.\nThe goal of the current peace process is the\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and the application of\nthe principle of land for peace. The latter means total\nIsraeli withdrawal from all Palestinian and other Arab\nterritories occupied since 1967, including Al-Quds Al-\nSharif \u2014 the Holy City of Jerusalem, which is the first of\nthe two Qiblahs and the third Holy Sanctuary of Islam,\nthe place from which the Prophet Muhammad ascended\nto heaven, and the cradle of the birth of Jesus Christ.\nThe catastrophe that befell our people 51 years ago,\nuprooting them from their homeland and dispersing them\ninto exile \u2014 thereby stripping them of their dreams and\nrights as human beings in an attempt to negate their\nexistence \u2014 is one of the greatest human tragedies\nwitnessed by the twentieth century. The question of the\nrefugees of Palestine is the oldest and greatest refugee\nquestion in our contemporary world. We must recognize\nthe legitimate right of those refugees to return to their\nhomeland, in accordance with United Nations resolutions.\nFour million Palestinians live in exile and in refugee\ncamps awaiting the time of their return to their homeland,\nfrom which they were forcibly expelled. There is no way\nto achieve peace, stability and security in the Middle East\nwithout a solution to the question of the refugees of\nPalestine and the implementation of resolution 194 (III),\nwhich declares their right to return to their homeland.\n25\n\n\nTwo essential things must occur for peace to be\ncomplete. First, it is necessary to reach a final settlement on\nall tracks \u2014 the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese \u2014 on the\nbasis of the complete and precise implementation of\ninternational legitimacy, especially Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), and 425 (1978). The\nsecond is the provision of economic support and assistance\nby the international community sufficient for the\nachievement of a better economic situation and for\nachieving prosperity in the region. What is required\nforemost in this regard is raising the Palestinian economy\nup from the miserable situation in which it finds itself as a\nresult of the long years of occupation, so that building\ncooperative economic relations in the region will become\npossible.\nHere I wish to thank the donor countries that have\nprovided and continue to provide important assistance to the\nPalestinian people and to the Palestinian Authority. This\nassistance is necessary to enable us to overcome the\nimmense difficulties that we have been confronting since\nthe establishment of the Palestinian Authority, as a result of\nthe closures and sieges imposed by the previous Israeli\nGovernment on the Palestinian territory for long periods,\nwhich worsened further the total destruction of the\nPalestinian economy. The shadows of poverty and\nunemployment still threaten our economic abilities and\nplans to reconstruct, build and develop.\nThe achievement of all of this necessitates the\ncontinuation of the constructive efforts of the United\nNations, which has permanent responsibility towards the\nquestion of Palestine until that issue is resolved in all its\naspects. We will also remain in need of our Arab brothers,\nthe Islamic countries and our friends in the Non-Aligned\nMovement. We will remain in need of the two co-sponsors\nof the peace process, the United States and the Russian\nFederation, and also of the European Union, China, Japan,\nNorway and our other friends around the world.\nWe must heighten all our efforts until the arrival of\nthe new millennium in many areas and spheres, and not\nonly in the Middle East. In this respect, we have observed\nsome positive developments which are quite reassuring.\nThere is tangible improvement in the area of conflict\nresolution on the African continent and on the path towards\nachieving better economic and social development in that\ngreat continent. There is the international attention given to\nKosovo, as well as other measures carried out in the\nBalkans. There is also the adoption of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, as well as the additional\nconsideration being given to the four Geneva Conventions\non the occasion of their fiftieth anniversary. We refer\nhere, with appreciation, to the convening of the\nConference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth\nGeneva Convention last July regarding the Israeli\noccupation of our land. There are also the follow-ups and\nreviews of a series of international conferences five years\nafter their convening, in addition to the preparations being\nmade with regard to such important issues as the culture\nof peace and the dialogue among civilizations.\nAll of these things are important developments, but\nperhaps not enough for us to be able to begin the new\nmillennium under new circumstances. This is particularly\nso if we look at some of the events and worrisome\ndevelopments in different areas. There is the continuation\nof the state of siege in Iraq and the profound suffering of\nits brotherly people. There is also the continuation of\ninternal conflicts in many countries, such as Afghanistan\nand others. Recently there have also been worrisome\ndevelopments in East Timor. But I would like, in\nparticular, to refer to the rise of extreme poverty and to\nthe widening gap between the haves and the have-nots on\nthe individual, national and regional levels.\nPerhaps it is we, the poor people of the South, who\nare most concerned about how to bridge the gap between\nus and the North, particularly in this era of globalization\nof the world economy, whose challenges and\nconsequences we must all face. Here we must exert\nserious efforts and seek creative means beyond hasty and\ntemporary measures. While it is time for the South to be\nmore prepared to realize such an achievement, the North\nshould also be more prepared for partnership and more\nrealistic, effective and just sharing.\nIn addition to economic matters, we must also strive\nto achieve some needed improvements at the political\nlevel, particularly with regard to international political\nrelations. It is imperative in this connection that we all\ngive greater significance to the United Nations. This must\nbe done in order for this body to truly and urgently\nbecome the effective centre of international and political\nrelations and the source of international legitimacy. It is\nalso necessary to be wholly committed to upholding the\nprinciples and provisions of the Charter of the United\nNations and of international and humanitarian laws, as\nwell as ensuring that they apply to all. We should apply\nto others the same moral values as we accept for\nourselves. There should be one set of criteria and one\nstandard for all cases and in all places. All of this will\nlead to a more credible system of international relations,\nin which the incentive to commit wrongs will be lessened\n26\n\n\nand the collective capability to confront and prevent those\nwrongs will, in turn, be enhanced.\nIt is with great pride that I would now like to speak of\nthe Bethlehem 2000 celebrations. The Palestinian city of\nBethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, is the place\nwhere we are making preparations to celebrate the end of\nthe second millennium and the beginning of the third. It is\nalso there, in Palestine, that the past, the present and the\nfuture will meet in a global vision of hope for all peoples.\nIt is a religious and spiritual occasion of high importance,\nnot only for our people and the other peoples of the region,\nbut also for all the faithful around the world and for the\nentire international community. I appreciate the unanimous\nadoption last year of the resolution concerning this great\nand important matter, and invite the Assembly to continue\nto grant it its attention and consideration this year.\nHere, I wish to extend once again the Palestinian\npeople\u2019s invitation to the Assembly and to all the leaders\nof the world to visit us during this important spiritual and\nreligious occasion in Bethlehem, Jerusalem and the other\nreligious and spiritual places, so that we can proudly live\ntogether in peace at this special, historic time.\nI should like to extend my gratitude to the\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of\nthe Palestinian People, to the Committee\u2019s Chairman,\nAmbassador Ibra Ka of Senegal, to the Special\nCommittee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the\nHuman Rights of the Palestinian People and other Arabs\nof the Occupied Terrotiries and to all the staff members\nof this international Organization working in programmes\nrelating to the question of Palestine. They have all\nprovided immeasurable support to the just cause of the\nPalestinian people and have most certainly contributed to\nadvancing the peace process towards the achievement of\na just, permanent and comprehensive peace \u2014 a peace of\nthe brave that will secure justice and freedom for the\nPalestinian people and their sovereignty over their land,\nalong with security, stability and peace for all countries\nand peoples of this region.\nOnce again I express my congratulations to you, Mr.\nPresident, and my gratitude to all the members of the\ninternational community, reiterating to you the appeal of\nPalestine \u2014 an appeal of right, justice and peace.\n\n\n\n\n"

I would also like to\nthank the outgoing President, Mr. Didier Opertti of\nUruguay, for the guidance he provided to the fifty-third\nsession of the General Assembly.\nLet me also take this opportunity to warmly welcome\nthe Republic of Nauru, the Republic of Kiribati and the\nKingdom of Tonga, which have just joined the United\nNations family.\nWe are gathered here at the threshold not just of a\nnew century but of a new millennium. It is appropriate,\ntherefore, that we take advantage of this important occasion\nto reflect upon our situation in the world today. I speak\nhere not of our situation as individuals or even as nations,\nbut as a race.\nThere are many signs of progress, and there are\nreasons for hope. However, the ultimate goal of world\npeace still seems elusive. The number of conflicts is\nsignificantly increasing. All over the world, millions of\ncivilians are the victims of well-planned and systematic\npolicies of killing, displacement, property destruction and\nintimidation. At the end of last year, the number of people\nworldwide who had been evicted from their homes stood\nat more than 21 million.\nEast Timor and Kosovo are just two tragic examples\nof typical cases of contemporary armed conflicts. These\nare conflicts frequently take place within what the outside\nworld recognizes as State borders, rather than between\npreviously established States. Today, these types of wars\namount to more than 90 per cent of those raging in the\nworld.\nTo make matters even worse, the number of civilians\nkilled in these nominally \u201cinternal\u201d wars is sharply\nincreasing. A new kind of warfare is developing in which\ncivilians are a primary strategic target. \u201cEthnic cleansing\u201d,\nmassacres and a horrifying variety of war crimes have\nbecome weapons for achieving political, economic and\nmilitary goals. Ethnic, religious, national and social\ninequalities are frequently used as a smokescreen to hide\nthe reality of massacre and conquest from the rest of the\nworld. Furthermore, these inequalities are exploited by\nruthless leaders, who use them as a tool to achieve very\nconcrete aims. We have seen this phenomenon in almost\nall of the armed conflicts of recent times \u2014 in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, Kosovo, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Afghanistan\nand, most recently, in East Timor.\nHow should the international community react to\ngross violations of human rights \u2014 violations that amount\nto threats to international peace and security? When and\nhow can the international community seek to establish\nthat a sovereign Government cannot, or does not want to,\nprevent a humanitarian catastrophe? When and by what\ncriteria does it decide to use its instruments of\nenforcement?\nAll United Nations Member States must think hard\nabout these questions. We are grateful to the Secretary-\nGeneral, who made, at the beginning of this debate, a\nsignificant contribution to such thinking.\nThis turn-of-the-century crime wave cries out for\nnew approaches and new ways of protecting vulnerable\ncivilian populations. Armed conflicts have in fact become\na problem for humankind, not just for the nation or\nnations directly concerned.\nThe international community must innovate as it\nseeks to solve these pressing humanitarian problems. Our\nbasic aim has to be human security, and here I mean\nphysical and not just legal security. Slovenia welcomes\n15\n\n\nand participates in the initiatives of like-minded countries\nwhich are determined to give full meaning and specific\npractical expression to the concept of human security. In\naddition, as one answer to these challenges, new and more\nsophisticated concepts of peacekeeping operations are being\ndeveloped. New methods of conflict prevention should also\nbe explored. Preventive diplomacy, preventive deployment,\npreventive disarmament and post-conflict peace-building are\nthe orders of the day.\nWe have to ensure respect for human rights. We are\nfirm in our belief that a determined commitment to promote\nand protect human rights has to be an underlying principle\nfor the activities of the United Nations at the threshold of\nthe new millennium. We have to create conditions for good\ngovernance, the rule of law, sustainable development and\nsocial justice. All of these tasks and many others require\ncreative thinking and bold action. Solving these thorny\nproblems is a prerequisite for peace and prosperity. This is\nalso the way to prevent conditions which directly feed the\nflames of the conflicts that I have described.\nAs an elected member of the Security Council, we are\ncontributing to the maintenance of world peace and\nsecurity. We are cooperating actively in the resolution of\ncrises in South-Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America\nand the Middle East. We believe that special importance\nshould be attached to preventive action in situations posing\na potential threat to international peace but which have not\nyet developed into armed conflict. Where situations have\nalready escalated into armed conflict, no effort should be\nspared in finding a peaceful and timely resolution. We\nrecognize the recent Security Council mission to Jakarta\nand Dili, in which Slovenia took part, as an innovative\napproach by the United Nations in dealing with crisis\nsituations. Clearly, we welcome this.\nFinally, in post-conflict situations, such as Kosovo,\ncontinued coordinated action by the international\ncommunity is necessary. It is only by working in concert\nthat the United Nations, regional organizations and other\ninternational players can be effective. Only in this way can\nthe difficult goals that have been set be achieved. These\ngoals include bringing political and economic stabilization,\ndemocratization, the protection of human rights to the\nterritory in question and establishing a functional legal\nsystem there.\nThe changing nature of armed conflicts is also\nchanging the role of the Security Council as it discharges\nits primary responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. We note the increased\nreadiness and determination of regional organizations to\ntake on their share of responsibility for the maintenance\nof regional peace and security. As many examples of\nfruitful collaboration attest, relations between the Security\nCouncil and these regional organizations are relations not\nof competition but rather of cooperation. We therefore\ncommend the increased role of regional organizations\nunder Chapter VIII of the Charter.\nLet me continue by presenting some elements that\nwe must consider in any international response to the\nchanging nature of armed conflicts. There is an\nunacceptably wide \u2014 even a growing \u2014 gap between the\nexisting norms of international humanitarian and human\nrights law and common situations on the ground: human\nrights are frequently and openly violated. Determined and\nunited action by the international community is needed to\nensure that the existing norms of human rights are fully\nobserved.\nThose who commit war crimes and crimes against\nhumanity must be brought to justice. This is primarily the\nresponsibility of States, which must act both individually\nthrough their national systems of justice, and collectively\nthrough an effective international justice system. Failure\nto act is no more and no less than an invitation to those\ncapable of creating new, even more serious cycles of\nhuman tragedy to do just that.\nWhether there is to be human progress and\ndevelopment depends on the result of this confrontation\nbetween the rule of international law and those who stand\nto benefit directly from lawlessness. International\nindifference can only reward such people. In this regard,\nSlovenia attaches particular importance to the need to\nensure more effective, comprehensive and efficient\ndelivery of international justice. We are supportive of the\ntwo existing United Nations International Criminal\nTribunals and of the ongoing process designed to give\nbirth to a permanent International Criminal Court. To this\nend we have begun the legislative procedures necessary\nto ratify the Rome Statute. We are also contributing to\nefforts to complete the mandate of the Preparatory\nCommission for the International Criminal Court.\nPeacekeeping operations have in recent years\nbecome increasingly multidimensional: they encompass\nnot only demanding military tasks but also a variety of\nother functions, such as civilian police activities, support\nfor humanitarian assistance, practical disarmament\nmeasures, demobilization and integration of former\ncombatants, and enhancing and monitoring human rights.\n16\n\n\nI should like to avail myself of this important occasion\nto affirm that Slovenia considers peacekeeping to be one of\nthe key instruments available to the United Nations in\ndischarging its responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. We have increased our\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping operations \u2014\nand are committed to further increasing our participation in\nthe near future \u2014 not only in terms of military personnel\nbut also of civilian police and humanitarian aid workers.\nDisarmament efforts are a vital ingredient in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\nachievements of past years have been considerable,\nespecially in such areas as chemical weapons and the\ncomprehensive ban on nuclear weapon testing. However,\nthere is a need to strengthen disarmament work, in the area\nnot only of weapons of mass destruction but also in\nreducing flows of conventional arms. We hope that the\nConference on Disarmament will be strengthened as an\neffective disarmament negotiation body. We also hope that\nthe forthcoming Review Conference of the Parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\nwill represent a decisive step in the strengthening of the\nnon-proliferation regime, and that progress will be made\ntowards the objective of nuclear disarmament.\nI strongly believe that States Members of the United\nNations and the international community as a whole must\ncontinue efforts to strengthen the prohibition of land mines,\nwhich is one specific front in protecting the physical\nsecurity to which I referred. Last year our Government\nestablished an International Trust Fund for Demining and\nMine Victim Assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our\naim is to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and other mine-\naffected countries in the region get rid of those lethal,\nhidden weapons, and to help those who have been wounded\nby them. In only the first year of its existence, the\nInternational Trust Fund has achieved many positive results\nin Bosnia; it is now extending its activities to Kosovo.\nThere are many ways in which United Nations\nMember States can contribute to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. I would like to point out\nthat Slovenia has joined a number of other nations in\ncommitting itself to tackling the security challenges of\nSouth-Eastern Europe. In establishing the Stability Pact, the\ninternational community has formed a framework intended\nto enable the concerted and sustained action necessary to\nstabilize the region. If it lives up to its early promise \u2014\nand we intend to work hard to make sure that it does \u2014 the\nStability Pact could be the key factor in bringing lasting\npeace, economic recovery and development to a very\ntroubled neighbourhood. That such a wide range of States\nand international organizations \u2014 not least the United\nNations \u2014 have committed themselves to helping in this\nvery ambitious task gives us grounds for hope.\nIn conclusion, I would like to return to the question\nwith which I started: at the end of the millennium, how\ndoes the human race stand? Are there grounds for hope?\nDo we have the institutions and strategies needed to deal\nwith our problems? If not, can we modify and redesign\nthem? Even in the face of tragic conflicts, I believe that\nthe answer to these questions must be \u201cyes\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is a special pleasure\nfor me to see Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab guiding the General\nAssembly this session over the junction of two centuries\nand millenniums. We will lend all possible support to his\nendeavours, including through the Permanent\nRepresentative of Lithuania, who is also one of his Vice-\nChairmen.\nAnother landmark of this session is the fact that we\nhave grown. We welcome the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to this\nhouse of nations where all, large or small, are equal. We\nare glad to see nations from the Pacific enrich the\norganization. On behalf of the Lithuanian Government I\n31\n\n\npay our deep respects to the Secretary-General, who has\nalways been a brilliant servant of peace around the globe.\nSpeakers before me have referred to the symbolic\nmeaning of this session of the General Assembly. It may be\njust a simple turn of our calendar pages or we can make it\na stepping-stone to a better world with less violence, more\nfood for the hungry, less deliberately caused suffering and\ndeath, more care for the helpless and more shelter for the\nhomeless.\nThis century has taught us many lessons. Yet, even if\nwe have avoided another world war, we have witnessed too\nmany wars. The nature of crises has changed. Member\nStates should be able to find common ground in upholding\nthe principles of the Charter and acting in defence of\nhumanity. We should devise ways and means to prevent\nhumanitarian catastrophes and alleviate profound human\nsuffering. Just this last year, Angola and Kosovo, Sierra\nLeone and East Timor have posed new challenges to the\nUnited Nations and made us re-evaluate our actions in\nconflict prevention; the role of the United Nations Security\nCouncil and its interactions with regional organizations; the\nCouncil's credibility with regard to speed of deployment;\nthe role of civilian police and civilian administration; and\nthe problem of impunity. When evidence of the murder of\nhelpless people percolates through international borders, the\ndilemma emerging before the international community\nbecomes a moral one of the sanctity of human life and\nstrict international standards.\nIt is precisely towards this end that the United Nations\nsystem is undergoing changes. A number of administrative\nmeasures have been taken, especially those within the\npower of the Secretary-General. One of the most urgent\nmeasures which must be taken is reform of the Security\nCouncil. The Council has too often been accused of failures\nin the maintenance of international peace and security in the\nspecific cases I mentioned.\nThe efficiency of the Security Council's actions can be\nenhanced by improving its representativeness, legitimacy\nand credibility, thus generating wider acceptance of its\ndecisions. This would be possible primarily through an\nenlargement of the Council's membership. The two most\nqualified industrialized countries could become permanent\nmembers of the Security Council: their membership would\nstrengthen the Council and ensure democratic decisions. A\nbroader representation of developing nations on the Council\nwould also reinforce its legitimacy and enhance respect for\nit: they deserve additional seats, both permanent and non-\npermanent.\nIn recent years we have seen the development of the\nUnited Nations response away from peacekeeping to more\nactive conflict prevention and crises management of\ncivilian. Internal crises often lead to the complete\ndestruction of societies and their structures: repair and\nrehabilitation of collapsed countries by the international\ncommunity are needed.\nThe United Nations needs both the means and\ncooperation from all if it is to fulfil its mandate in terms\nof its primary responsibility for maintaining international\npeace and security. In this connection, Lithuania signed a\nstandby agreement as early as the beginning of 1998 and\nprovided a detailed description of its contribution. A\nsubstantial part of our contribution is comprised of well-\ntrained civilian policemen who are now doing their duty\nby serving in Kosovo.\nA comprehensive set of political measures will have\nto be elaborated before and adopted at the millennium\nsummit, which should be a breath of fresh air for the\nOrganization. We take this seriously and are ready to\nassist in designing a meaningful future for the United\nNations.\nSituations that deteriorate into conflicts are ignited\nby a variety of causes, usually a combination of them.\nThe wave of economic crashes that swept through Asia,\nLatin America and some European countries has had a\nglobal impact. The quick recovery of many economies\nshows that democracies with free market economies have\nthe strongest immunity against macroeconomic illnesses.\nMarkets and democracy allow for the fairest distribution\nof resources within societies which would otherwise be\nfeeling the pain of economic injustice.\nSimilarly, concerns about the potential and actual\nviolence which more often occurs within than between\nStates are almost always well-founded in places with poor\nhuman rights records. No one today is surprised by news\nof violence sparked by various rebel groups that feel\nmarginalized in the States where they live.\nMany instruments must still be designed to uphold\nthe principle that those responsible for gross violations of\nhuman rights and crimes against humanity \u2014 who still\nexpect impunity \u2014 must be held accountable. The\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court is one\nof the fruits of the new developments in international\nrelations. We are committed to the early entry into force\nof the Rome Statute and to an effective International\nCriminal Court.\n32\n\n\nWeaponry and armaments can be reduced through\ncommon actions, regardless of borders. There is literally a\nconsensus among nations that weapons of mass destruction\nmust be eliminated, but in reality the process of nuclear\ndisarmament is unacceptably precarious. We see reductions\nin numbers of warheads in some places and the\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons in others. Also, the\nbiological and chemical weapons which States have reduced\nhave become available to non-State terrorist entities that\nfeel almost no qualms about using them. I see no other way\nto build a safer world than by reducing, eliminating and\nvery strictly prohibiting weapons of mass destruction and\nthe means for delivering them.\nConventional arms and weapons are also weapons of\nmass destruction of life: half a million lives in Rwanda\nwere wiped out with clubs and machetes that can only be\nconsidered weapons. Lives are lost to firearms and\nlandmines all over the world, even in places that can hardly\nqualify as battlegrounds. The elimination of landmines is\nunder way. Nowhere else but in this Hall can we begin\neffective conventional disarmament to be carried out under\nthe responsibility of all States.\nEurope happens to be blessed with good regional\nsecurity instruments, the best of which was nevertheless\ninspired by the deaths of millions in senseless wars. The\nEuropean security charter, the concepts for which are now\nbeing discussed in the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), will further build on the\nideals of democracy, peace and unity set out in the Charter\nof Paris for a New Europe on the basis of the Helsinki\nFinal Act. The implementation of OSCE principles,\nincluding a country's right to choose its own security\narrangements, is fundamental to ensuring peace and\nsecurity. Finally, regional, subregional and bilateral\npractical cooperative efforts do enhance broader European\nendeavours and processes, including complementing \u2014 not\nundercutting \u2014 the work of other Euro-Atlantic institutions.\nWe believe in collective security and have made\nmembership in effective alliances of democratic and peace-\nloving nations \u2014 the European Union and the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization \u2014 our priority. The collective\nsecurity that we have chosen is the most efficient means of\nmeeting our legitimate needs.\nLithuania works actively in the Baltic region to create\nsecurity and stability based on cooperation and good-\nneighbourly relations. The Baltic Sea region is becoming\none of the most stable and dynamic, developing and\npromising regions in this part of the world.\nNine days ago, Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke\nfrom this very podium about a progressing supremacy of\ncollective needs over individual needs. In fact, his speech\nwas a testimony of brave and modern thought. It deserves\na place in textbooks for politicians and diplomats.\nConflicts are but one challenge for us. There are so\nmany inhabitants on Earth who need our help yet\nsometimes cannot even ask for it. Children deserve our\nstrongest love, and yet they are helplessly suffering in\nmany parts of the world. They do not realize that the\nadult world will soon celebrate the tenth anniversary of\nthe adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild, which has been ratified or acceded to by 191\ncountries \u2014 more than the number of United Nations\nMember States. It is the most universal human rights\ntreaty, the violation of which must be inconceivable and\npunishable. The newly adopted Convention on the\nElimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour should\nalso become universal and support compliance.\nThis year will also be the twentieth year since the\nadoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). It is\nsymbolic and crucial that this Convention has been\nstrengthened by the optional protocol. Lithuania supports\nthe proposal by Austria, after its adoption by the United\nNations General Assembly, to have this new human rights\ninstrument opened for signature on 10 December, which\nmarks Human Rights Day 1999. States have to give\nwomen the chance to address their grievances to the\nCEDAW Committee as soon as possible, perhaps even at\nthe special session of the General Assembly on \u201cWomen\n2000: gender, equality, development and peace for the\ntwenty-first century\u201d to be held in June in the year 2000.\nIdeals advocated by Woodrow Wilson at the\nbeginning of this century are celebrating their second\nbirth at the very end of the century. I am convinced that\nafter many ups and downs, the evolution of humankind is\nfinally taking the straight and right course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "May I, on behalf of my\ndelegation congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. Kenya's pride in seeing you preside over the affairs\nof the Assembly, which you have been associated with for\nso long, derives from our close and long bilateral ties with\nyour great country.\nI take this opportunity to register my delegation's\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency Didier\nOpertti of Uruguay, for the able manner in which he\npresided over the work of the fifty-third session.\nWe commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for the effective and tireless manner in which he\ncontinues to manage the affairs of this Organization and\nencourage him to continue serving the international\ncommunity with his characteristic selfless dedication to\nduty. Kenya will continue to support his efforts to further\nstrengthen the Organization.\nKenya warmly welcomes the Republics of Kiribati\nand Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga into this family of\nnations.\nAs we approach the new millennium, there is need\nfor us to reflect on the past, the present and the future of\nour world. The cumulative history of mankind during the\ncurrent millennium has been characterized by the struggle\nof the human race to overcome the various problems of\nhunger, war and disease. Throughout time man has\ninvested constantly to provide shelter, increase literacy\nand tackle the various problems of underdevelopment.\nThe latter part of this millennium has witnessed enormous\npolitical, economic and social changes. Where once\nslavery was acceptable, today freedom is the norm. Where\nonce crude methods of economic production dominated,\ntoday sophisticated production techniques govern. Where\nignorance was widespread, today science and technology\ndetermine man's progress. Where before the human rights\nof peoples were unknown, today they are an integral part\nof the international agenda.\nBut even as we note the progress that has been\nmade, the scourge of poverty and underdevelopment\nremains a painful reality for most of us. We believe that\npoverty is the root cause of the conflicts that pervade\nvarious regions of our globe, unleashing immense\nsuffering on humankind \u2014 particularly on women and\nchildren.\nOur continent, Africa, continues to suffer from the\nravages of intra-State and inter-State conflicts. The issue\nof the complementarity of the roles of the United Nations\nand that of regional organizations needs to be addressed.\nAfrican countries have taken their own initiatives to\nresolve the various conflicts raging in the continent.\nAlthough progress has been made in some cases, many of\nthe conflicts remain intractable, making it difficult for\naffected countries to redirect their efforts and resources\ntowards economic development.\n20\n\n\nIn our own region, together with other members of the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\nKenya is seized with the conflicts in Sudan and Somalia.\nThe subcommittee on the Sudan peace process, for\nexample, is actively engaged in the search for a peaceful\nsettlement to the conflict in the southern Sudan. At the\nmost recent meeting, held in Nairobi from 19 to 23 July\n1999, members of the IGAD ministerial subcommittee\nagreed to establish a secretariat to facilitate intensive and\ncontinuous negotiations to resolve this conflict. As\nchairman of this subcommittee, Kenya is optimistic that this\nnew arrangement will contribute positively towards reaching\na negotiated settlement. We hope we can count on the\nsupport of all the members of the international community\nto find a solution to this long-standing conflict.\nKenya continues to be seized with the situation in\nSomalia. As a neighbour that shares a border of 1,200\nkilometres with Somalia, we are concerned at the loss of\ninternational interest and support for this sad country. The\ninternational community should resume its active interest\nand support for Somalia in order to instill in the innocent\npeople of that country some measure of hope for the future.\nWe are grateful for the roles that the Organization of\nAfrican Unity and the United Nations have played and\ncontinue to play. However, Kenya calls for greater\ninvolvement by the United Nations in support of ongoing\nregional efforts. The new initiative unveiled by the\nChairman of IGAD, President Guelleh of Djibouti, at this\npodium on 22 September 1999, deserves serious\nconsideration.\nIn efforts to support and assist the people of Somalia,\nthe territorial integrity of that country must be respected.\nRegional entities that may have come into existence during\nthis period in Somalia's history should be seen as building\nblocks intended to eventually lead to a Government of\nnational unity. We the neighbouring countries, as well as\nthe international community, have an important role in\nfacilitating the process leading to a peaceful and\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict. Our common\ncommitment to a united Somalia should not waver.\nIn the tradition of African hospitality, Kenya has\nalways provided a home to displaced people from\nneighbouring countries. As a result of the collapse of the\ncentral authority in Somalia, a large number of refugees\nfound their way into our country. We are proud to have\nbeen able to assist and even settle some of them. In this\nregard, we are grateful for the role being played by the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\nUnited Nations Children's Fund, the World Health\nOrganization and many others who have provided\ninvaluable assistance, without which it would have been\nimpossible for the Government of Kenya alone to cope\nwith the humanitarian crisis.\nRecently, Kenya decided to tighten its border\ncontrols with Somalia. However, we remain committed to\nfacilitating ongoing humanitarian operations, which\ncontinue with numerous daily flights into Somalia from\nour territory \u2014 and, in some cases, by land as well. We\nhave been able to do this by coordinating our actions with\nthe relevant humanitarian agencies and organizations.\nThe crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nremains of utmost concern to us because it poses a\nserious threat not only to the Great Lakes region but also\nto the rest of our continent. It is for this reason that\nKenya has been involved in the attempts to resolve the\nconflict, particularly in its early, initial stages. Kenya's\noffer to host in Nairobi the proposed Congolese national\ndebate on the political future of their country still stands.\nWe commend the recent personal efforts that President\nChiluba of Zambia has made in negotiating a settlement\nplan which seeks to find a comprehensive solution to that\ncrisis. We will do everything possible to complement\nthese efforts and hope that the international community\nwill be prepared to fulfil its own supporting role.\nAs the international community continues to play its\npart, the responsibility for a final, comprehensive and\nlasting settlement to the crisis in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo falls largely to the people and their leaders.\nIn that regard, Kenya urges all parties to the Lusaka\nAgreement to demonstrate their commitment by\nimplementing it, both in letter and in spirit, in a timely\nand appropriate manner.\nWe firmly believe that it is time for the Security\nCouncil to actively step in and provide tangible support\nfor the peace process. Africa expects that the support\ngiven to peacekeeping operations in other parts of the\nworld will be replicated, both in scope and in content, in\nthe case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We\nknow that most members of the Security Council have\nembraced this challenge and are willing to do their part.\nThe situation in Angola continues to be a source of\ngreat frustration. Indeed, the resumption of hostilities at\na level not seen since the signing of the Lusaka Protocol\ndoes not augur well. Kenya is deeply disappointed that\nthe leader of UNITA, Mr. Savimbi, continues to\nflagrantly defy the collective will of the international\n21\n\n\ncommunity. We call on him to immediately cease all acts\nof hostility against the people of Angola.\nWith regard to the border conflict between Ethiopia\nand Eritrea, we note with satisfaction that the combined\ninitiatives of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the\nUnited Nations and the United States to secure definitive\nagreement on the modalities for the implementation of the\nOAU Framework Agreement are still on course. We appeal\nto both parties to exercise utmost restraint and not to\nresume fighting.\nIn accordance with the United Nations Charter, the\nSecurity Council has the primary responsibility to determine\nthe existence of any threat to international peace and\nsecurity and to recommend appropriate intervention\nmeasures. There can be no derogation from this primary\nresponsibility. In the fulfilment of this responsibility, it\nmust be borne in mind that the principle of non-interference\nin the internal affairs of Member States remains a cardinal\nelement in the conduct of international relations, as spelt\nout in the Charter.\nWe have serious reservations on the evolving view\nthat even the United Nations Charter provides leeway for\nnon-United Nations intervention. We would like to caution\nthat this approach needs to be carefully balanced with\nlegitimate concerns of sovereignty. Whatever we may say\non intervention, the sovereignty of States remains at the\ncore of diplomatic discourse. Derogation from this principle\nin the case of serious humanitarian emergencies must be\nmade on the basis of general consensus in the United\nNations.\nIt is in this spirit that Kenya has always supported and\nparticipated in many United Nations peacekeeping missions\nthroughout the world. We will continue to contribute\npersonnel and remain actively involved in United Nations\npeacekeeping activities. All peacekeeping missions must be\nestablished in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nThis is why we welcome the assumption of responsibility\nin Kosovo by the United Nations in the form of the United\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\n(UNMIK). We should do everything possible to support\nefforts towards the restoration of normalcy in Kosovo. We\nalso hope that the spirit that prevailed in the establishment\nand financing of UNMIK will be applied to peacekeeping\noperations in Africa.\nWith regard to the situation in East Timor, Kenya\ncommends Indonesia for allowing the international\ncommunity to send a United Nations \u2014 mandated\nmultinational force to restore order. We welcome the\nunequivocal statement by the Foreign Minister of\nIndonesia, Mr. Ali Alatas, reiterating his Government's\nresponsibility to ensure the fulfilment of the newly\nexpressed will of the majority of East Timorese to seek\na new destiny outside the Indonesian Republic. We hope,\nas he expressed the hope, that the parting of ways will, in\nhis own words, proceed honourably, peacefully and\namicably.\nAs Sierra Leone continues along the path of national\nreconciliation and true peace, we encourage the United\nNations to remain committed to and engaged in that\ncountry. We again place on record our appreciation to the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) for its immense sacrifice\nin assisting the people of Sierra Leone in their search for\npeace and democracy. On our part, we will continue to\nsupport our brothers and sisters in that country. Towards\nthat end, we have already contributed personnel to the\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone\n(UNOMSIL).\nKenya is encouraged by the recent positive\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process. The\nresumption of direct dialogue between the State of Israel\nand the Palestinian National Authority, which resulted in\nagreement on the implementation of aspects of the Wye\naccords, demonstrates the vast opportunities that political\ngoodwill can unleash. We encourage those involved to\nstay on course and we welcome indications that the other\ntracks in the Middle East peace process are receiving\ncareful attention.\nOn the economic front, my delegation is of the view\nthat the slow progress in Africa's efforts to attain\nsustainable economic growth and development is directly\nrelated to the failure by the international community to\nmobilize adequate resources for development. This has\nbeen aggravated by situations of internal conflict and the\nprevalence of such diseases as malaria and AIDS, among\nothers, which are compounded in turn by the shackles of\npoverty and deprivation and an unfavourable external\neconomic environment.\nMy delegation welcomes the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt (HIPC) Initiative made at the G-8 meeting\nin Cologne, Germany. The crushing burden of external\ndebt on the developing countries, especially those in sub-\n22\n\n\nSaharan Africa, remains a major obstacle to our\ndevelopment efforts. While we welcome this Initiative, we\nare of the view that much still needs to be done. We would\nlike to see HIPC coverage broadened to include more of the\nindebted countries, with relief being offered in a graduated\nmanner. This would envisage providing the greatest relief\nto the most indebted countries. In addition, consideration\ncould be given to modifying the existing terms and\nconditions of HIPC to enable countries like Kenya, not\ncovered by HIPC as currently proposed, to participate\nwithout the possibility of losing access to credit that would\notherwise be available to them. The terms and conditions of\nthe HIPC Initiative are based on a piecemeal approach\nwhich will not contribute to the overall goal of debt\ncancellation. Debt-relief measures should be structured in\na holistic and comprehensive manner without eroding\nAfrica's future capacity to attract investments and should be\nlinked to the long-term social and economic development\nof the continent.\nAnother issue that requires the concerted efforts of the\ninternational community is that of poverty eradication.\nKenya has already launched a Poverty Eradication Plan,\nwhich has received some support and which we hope will\nattract wider support to allow us to achieve our goal of\nbecoming a newly industrialized country by the year 2020.\nBold actions are required to ensure that the developed\ncountries fulfil the commitments agreed upon to maintain\nofficial development assistance flows to developing\ncountries at 0.7 per cent of their gross national product. In\nthis regard, Kenya supports the proposal to hold an\ninternational conference on financing for development next\nyear.\nThe United Nations remains our only hope to\nspearhead the process of development. Accordingly, all\nMember States have an obligation to support the\nOrganization in order for it to fulfil its development\nmandate. The United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) and other specialized bodies \u2014 such as the United\nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) and the United Nations Centre for Human\nSettlements (Habitat) \u2014 must be strengthened in order to\nenable them to succeed in their respective roles.\nKenya looks forward to the convening of the first\nSouth-South summit in Havana, Cuba, in April next year.\nThe conference will be a historic milestone in the\nstrengthening of South-South cooperation. The South-South\nsummit provides a golden opportunity at the highest\npolitical level for the members of the Group of 77 and\nChina to share their experiences and to consolidate\npolitical goodwill, which is so vital for economic\ncooperation and development.\nKenya attaches great importance to economic\ncooperation among developing countries. It is for this\nreason that Kenya has actively pursued the path of\neconomic integration at the regional and subregional\nlevels. In addition to the Common Market for Eastern and\nSouthern Africa (COMESA), comprising 21 countries\nwith a population approaching 400 million, we are\ndetermined, at the subregional level, to upgrade the East\nAfrican cooperation arrangements \u2014 comprising Kenya,\nUganda and Tanzania \u2014 into a full-fledged East African\ncommunity by the end of the year. Our vision is to\nestablish an East African community with a population of\nnearly 90 million people with natural, historic, social and\ncultural ties into one investment destination, one tourist\ndestination, one single market and one common external\ntariff, with a free flow of goods, services and people.\nKenya is greatly concerned by the rise in\ntransnational crime, narcotics, money-laundering and\nterrorism networks. The tragic bombing of the embassies\nof the United States of America in Nairobi and Dar-es-\nSalaam in August 1998 is still fresh in our memories.\nThis incident, not to mention the recent terrorist attacks\nin Moscow, has heightened our resolve to work closely\nwith the international community to fight and eradicate\nterrorism. We call for concerted efforts to adopt effective\ninternational measures to eradicate the growing and\ndangerous links between terrorist groups, drug traffickers\nand armed criminal elements. Towards this end, Kenya\nparticipated actively in the Algiers summit of OAU in\nJuly 1999, at which African States adopted a convention\non preventing and combating terrorism. Clearly, more\nneeds to be done. We support the proposal to hold an\ninternational conference next year on combating terrorism.\nKenya is situated in the heart of a turbulent region.\nThe proliferation of illegal small arms and their increased\ncriminal use on Kenyan territory, often by groups from\nacross our borders, is motivating us to push for practical\nand sustained international cooperation to stop illegal\ntrafficking in small arms. In this connection, we express\nour support for the convening of an international\nconference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects to be\nheld by the year 2001.\nIn our own region, Kenya will host a meeting before\nthe end of this year to address the complex problems of\n23\n\n\nsmall arms and their ramifications for security and conflicts\nin our region. We look forward to the support and\ncooperation of our development partners to ensure that this\nconference is a success.\nOn this issue, Kenya would like to draw a clear\ndistinction between the legitimate rights of sovereign States\nto self-defence and therefore to the procurement of\narmaments for that purpose, and the illicit traffic in small\narms involving non-State actors.\nKenya welcomes the urgency and importance with\nwhich the international community has recently addressed\nthe problem of antipersonnel landmines. We participated\nactively in the negotiations leading to the Ottawa\nConvention on anti-personnel landmines and in the recent\nMaputo Conference of States Parties to the Ottawa\nConvention. We have signed the Ottawa Convention, which\nis now going through the ratification process. The\nprevailing international consensus on outlawing landmines\nmust be maintained in order to achieve the target of a total\nban on the production, use and eventual elimination of anti-\npersonnel landmines. International cooperation is essential\nin the areas of landmine clearance and the physical\nrehabilitation of victims, as well as their social and\neconomic rehabilitation and reintegration.\nAs we celebrate the United Nations Decade of\nInternational Law, Kenya regards the adoption of the\nStatute of the International Criminal Court as a historic\nmilestone in the progressive development of international\nlaw. We participated actively in the negotiations leading to\nthe adoption of the Rome Statute, became the eighty-fourth\nState to append our signature to it and have embarked on\nthe ratification process for it.\nWe look to the Preparatory Commission for the\nInternational Criminal Court to elaborate on the outstanding\nissues, including the elements of crime and the rules of\nprocedure, in order to reach an early consensus and ensure\nuniversal acceptance of the Statute. We hope that the\nPreparatory Commission will complete its work before the\nJune 2000 deadline.\nAs eloquently stated by the Secretary-General, reform\nof the United Nations is a process and not an event. In\norder to attain a more transparent, accountable and\ndemocratic United Nations, the collective resolve of its\nMember States is imperative. We must resist any attempts\nto approach the reform process in terms of downsizing:\nreform must entail restructuring to cope better with the\nimmense economic development challenges facing our\nworld, and the success of the reform effort must be\nmeasured in terms of the Organization's capacity to\ndeliver programmes, strengthen the Secretariat, enhance\nits strategic orientation and use the development dividend\nto enhance socio-economic development in all our\ncountries. In this context, Kenya welcomes the\nappointment of Dr. Klaus T\u00f6pfer as Director-General of\nthe United Nations Office at Nairobi. As host to the only\nUnited Nations headquarters in the developing world, we\ncontinue to be greatly concerned by the underutilization\nof the excellent conference facilities at the United Nations\nOffice at Nairobi. Practical plans are urgently required to\nplace the Nairobi Office on the same level as the United\nNations Offices at Geneva and Vienna by providing it\nwith adequate resources and personnel to enable it to\ncarry out its functions effectively.\nThe changes that have taken place in international\nrelations need to be reflected in the composition and\nstructure of the Security Council. The Security Council is\na body that is empowered to make important executive\ndecisions on matters of peace and security on behalf of\nthe entire membership of the United Nations. It is\nimperative that the reform of the Security Council should\nensure greater accountability and democracy together with\nequitable representation. The universal and democratic\nnature of the United Nations should be preserved and\nreforms introduced to ensure fair representation of all the\nmajor geographic regions of the world.\nA strong and persuasive case has been made by\nAfrican countries for at least two seats in the permanent\nmembership of the Security Council. Our recent\nexperience as a nonpermanent member of the Council has\nconvinced us of the urgency of restructuring this\nimportant organ so that developing countries can play\ntheir rightful part in the maintenance of international\npeace and security.\nKenya is of the view that sanctions should be\nimposed only in accordance with the Charter and only\nafter all means for the pacific settlement of disputes under\nChapter VI have been exhausted. A thorough study of the\nshort- and long-term effects of sanctions, especially on\ninnocent victims, should be undertaken. The objectives of\nsanctions should be clearly defined and the sanctions\nshould be lifted as soon as those objectives have been\nachieved. Sanctions should be imposed for a specified\ntime, and the conditions to be met by the country or party\non which sanctions are imposed must be clearly defined\nand subjected to periodic review. We reject any attempts\n24\n\n\nto impose or prolong the application of sanctions for\nreasons other than the specified objectives.\nThe application of sanctions usually has profound\neffects not only on the target countries but also on their\nneighbouring countries and other trading partners. Efforts\nshould therefore be made to put Article 50 of the Charter,\nwhich refers to third States, into operation by establishing\nmechanisms or Funds to provide them with relief. In this\nregard, Kenya urges that the sanctions on Iraq should be\nurgently reviewed with a view to their suspension and\neventual lifting. We also hope that the sanctions on Libya,\nrecently suspended, will soon be lifted.\nAs we enter the twenty-first century, it is hard to\nimagine what this world would be without the United\nNations. Consider for a moment the number of lives that\nhave been saved by the Organization; the personal freedoms\nthat many countries and individuals now enjoy; and the\ndiseases that have been controlled or eliminated: the list of\nsuccesses is endless. But much still needs to be done: the\nSecretary-General's proposal for a Millennium Assembly,\nwith a millennium summit as an integral part, would\nprovide an important forum for us to reexamine the role of\nthe Organization and chart our path for the next\nmillennium. Kenya will play its part."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to\ncongratulate Mr. Gurirab on his election to preside over this\nhistoric session of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to\nhis rich experience and to his great country, Namibia.\nHis predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, also\ndeserves our appreciation for the excellent manner in\nwhich he discharged his important responsibilities.\nPermit me also to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his dedication and\ncommitment to the ideals of the United Nations.\nAs we meet for the final session of this century, and,\nindeed, of this millennium, we are faced with a future that\nholds for us promises and perils, hopes and fears,\nopportunities and challenges. We cannot secure a better\nfuture unless the root causes of the problems of our times\nare resolved. The United Nations, as the only truly global\nOrganization, is best suited to address these problems. Its\nrole, therefore, must be reaffirmed and must remain\ncentral to our efforts in the reconstruction of a more just\nworld order where human security is guaranteed.\nSince the establishment of this Organization, small\nStates have earned a legitimate voice in multilateral\ndiplomacy. I am delighted today to welcome the three\nnew Members of the United Nations, the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga. As small States, Maldives and the three new\nMembers share numerous interests and concerns which\nare vital to our common survival and progress.\nWe stand at a crossroads. This is an ideal\nopportunity to review our past performance and to map\nout innovative approaches to address existing and\nemerging problems. As we get ready to enter the new\ncentury and the new millennium, we in the Maldives have\ndeveloped Vision 2020 for our country, based on the\nlessons of the past. The Vision sets out major directions\nfor the next two decades. We envision a community that\nis just, caring and peaceful. Our country must continue to\nbe one in which good governance, democracy and the\nwelfare of the people are given the highest priority. We\nseek a society where gender equality is a reality and\nwhere everyone has the opportunity for self-actualization.\nWe want our children to be happy, creative and safe.\nThese aims can be realized only through a high level\nof economic achievement and social progress. However,\nour resources are meagre. We face numerous natural\nhazards and are vulnerable to a wide range of man-made\nthreats. Nevertheless, we remain firm in our determination\nto achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. But for\n36\n\n\nthat to happen, our own efforts must be supplemented by a\nsupportive international environment. That much we need\nand that much we seek.\nNevertheless, the withdrawal of that supportive\nframework seems, regrettably, to be imminent. The\nMaldives has been earmarked for graduation from the list\nof least developed countries (LDC) next year. We do not\nfeel entirely comfortable with the LDC label. Indeed, we\nwould like to enter the new millennium as a self-reliant\ncountry. National pride, however, cannot transcend harsh\neconomic reality. Our economy is small and narrowly\nbased. Capacity for economic diversification in the\nimmediate future is limited. Graduation would therefore\nimpose unbearable burdens on us. The General Assembly\nis to review the graduation process and its criteria this year.\nI appeal to you to consider the realities on the ground. I\ncall upon you to look beyond abstract indicators to the\ninherent vulnerabilities of small States. My President has\nalready conveyed our concerns in detail to the President of\nthe Economic and Social Council. The Commonwealth has\nstrongly supported our case.\nThe liberalization of trade and the globalization of the\neconomy have created windows of opportunity for increased\neconomic growth. Their impact, though, has created a\nparticularly difficult economic road for developing\ncountries. Globalization must progress without\nmarginalization and without further impoverishment. The\nseven nations of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation (SAARC) are working together to enhance our\nprospects in the new international economic climate through\ngreater regional cooperation.\nYet, ominously, on a global scale the gulf between\nrich and poor nations has reached tragic proportions. These\nharsh economic realities have been accompanied by the\nfragmentation of the international will to foster greater\nequality. Aid programmes had previously supplemented\ndomestic savings in recipient countries, but today they are\nnot even adequate to save the destitute, leaving many\ndeveloping countries with little choice but to replace their\nvisions of advancement with those of survival and life-\nsupport. The world's present focus on poverty eradication\nonly underscores its past failure to narrow the gap between\nthe rich and the poor. It is disheartening to note that the\ngap has more than doubled since 1950.\nI am happy that a number of international initiatives\non social issues have taken place during this decade. The\nMaldives attaches great importance to the fulfilment of the\nCopenhagen commitments and the implementation of the\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action. We look\nforward to their review meetings next year to give a fresh\nimpetus to our action. In South Asia, the Maldives has\ncalled for the drawing up of a social charter that will\ninstitutionalize social development in the region. We are\nalso pressing for a SAARC convention on regional\narrangements to promote and protect child welfare. I hope\nthat the convention will be adopted as we mark the tenth\nanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nThe international social agenda is indeed a\ndemanding one. It cannot be addressed by national\nGovernments acting alone. Cooperation among States and\npartnerships with inter-governmental and non-\ngovernmental organizations are essential for victory on\nthis front. At the same time, our approach to economic\nperformance needs to be re-oriented towards human\nsecurity and ecological safety. We need to temper our\nobsession over economic growth with concerns for the\nquality of life. We all accept the importance of\nsustainable development. We all agree on the need for\neffective global action to achieve environment-friendly\nprogress. Yet, the clear message that has emerged from\nthe review of the Barbados Programme of Action\ncompleted this week is that of weak commitment and\npoor implementation. Our deeds must match the\nsentiments we have expressed. We must deliver on our\npromises.\nSmall island developing States have few options that\nthey can pursue on their own. International cooperation is\nvital to ensure that sustainable development strategies are\nviable for them. It is also necessary to help them adapt to\nthe dangers posed by global warming and climate change.\nAs we have reiterated on numerous occasions, the\nMaldives could very well cease to exist if the sea level\nrises by one metre. Many other low-lying regions would\nsuffer a similar fate. Should the sea level rise by one\nmetre, the developed countries too would be affected\nsignificantly, and the direct impact on biodiversity would\nbe unfathomable. The Maldives is therefore deeply\ndisappointed by the lack of action in implementing the\nBarbados pledges.\nWhile great Powers may be able to look after their\nown security needs, the small States need to rely on\ninstitutions of collective security. I am happy to recall that\n10 years ago, the Assembly adopted resolution 44/51,\nwhich recognized that the international community has an\nobligation to make provision for the protection and\nsecurity of small States. We are grateful for the support\n37\n\n\nof the international community for our initiative on this\nissue, but we remain concerned that time and again the\nresponse of the United Nations to crises, especially those\ninvolving small States, has been found wanting in speed\nand in effectiveness.\nIt is a pity that we have to enter the new century and\nthe new millennium still carrying baggage containing many\nunresolved and deep-seated problems that confronted the\nUnited Nations at its birth.\nOne such problem is the Middle East problem. Peace\nin the Middle East still remains elusive. Hesitant steps have\nbeen taken, but many issues remain unresolved. The\nMaldives has welcomed the Middle East peace process\nfrom the beginning. We are disappointed at its slow\nprogress and look forward to a more earnest and bold\nsearch for peace. Once again, we express our full support\nto the Palestinian cause and call for the full implementation\nof the relevant United Nations resolutions on lasting peace\nin the region.\nEight years after the Gulf war, there are still many\nunresolved issues that affect the security and progress of\nthe region. The Maldives calls upon all parties concerned\nto fully comply with the resolutions of the United Nations\non the subject. We regret the suspension of talks between\nKuwait and Iraq on outstanding bilateral issues, including\nthat of missing persons, and believe that the resolution of\nthese issues should be pursued within the existing\nframework of relevant United Nations resolutions. The\nMaldives reaffirms its unwavering support for the\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of\nKuwait. We reiterate our belief that the United Nations has\nan obligation to uphold the security and territorial integrity\nof all Member States, including smaller States.\nThe post-cold-war years have seen the bitter betrayal\nof the promise of greater freedom and development. Rather\nthan seeing a celebration of human rights and the legitimate\nrights of communities to their own identity and cultural\nvalues, arrogant ethnocentrism and intolerance appear to be\nrampant. Indeed, the violent disintegration of States and\ncivil wars have led to the most gruesome crimes against\nhumanity. Genuine aspirations have often been met with\nbrutal force, as in Bosnia and Kosovo. Protracted disputes,\nsuch as in Kashmir, are continuing to exact a high price in\nhuman lives and constantly endanger security at both the\nregional and international levels.\nStrategies of nuclear deterrence which presumably rely\non the credible threat of mass destruction cannot be\njustified on moral grounds. We welcome the steps that are\nbeing taken to increase nuclear safety. We continue to be\nalarmed by the increased risk of nuclear war that\naccompanies proliferation. The Maldives is a staunch\nsupporter of non-proliferation. We firmly believe that the\nworld will be a safer place without nuclear weapons. We\nhope that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) review process will find ways to achieve\nprogress in all aspects of the non-proliferation regime.\nThe continuation of many conflicts and the flaring\nup of others call into question the efficacy of this\nOrganization. It is not only the passage of time that\ndemands the reform and restructuring of the United\nNations. The most persuasive argument is the urgent need\nto increase the ability of the United Nations to realize the\nobjectives for which it has been set up. Whatever reform\nis undertaken should be instrumental in that sense.\nReform must enhance its legitimacy. Reform must make\nthe United Nations more democratic and transparent, and\nit must also reinforce the United Nations ability to uphold\nequality among nations.\nAs we step into the new century, the world has\nreached a major turning point. We are bidding farewell to\none millennium and are marching with determination into\na new one. It is one in which a stronger commitment to\nmultilateralism will be essential. Many of the hazards that\nwe are faced with do not recognize national borders. The\nworld has become closely integrated, and communities\nhave become highly interwoven across national frontiers,\nnecessitating global approaches to global problems.\nAdvances in science and technology give us cause for\noptimism in our efforts to overcome several of the\nchallenges that confront us today. These are assisted by\nnew mindsets of cooperation and emotional intelligence.\nWe need to nurture the positive strands and prune the\nnegative. Yet the new century will not usher in a new age\nunless hope and progress become universal.\nThe new millennium will not set an enlightened\ncourse for world politics until right can triumph over\nmight and double standards give way to justice for all.\nThat is the millennium challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is an\nhonour for me to address this Assembly. I bring to all\ngreetings and good wishes from His Majesty Norodom\nSihanouk, King of Cambodia, and from the people and\n19\n\n\nthe Royal Government of Cambodia. I should like to inform\nthe Assembly about the recent strides Cambodia has made\nand about how it stands ready to fulfil its role in the\ncommunity of nations. I wish also to share with the\nAssembly some humble thoughts on global events of the\npast and responsibilities for the future.\nFirst of all, on behalf of the delegation of the\nKingdom of Cambodia, and on my own behalf, I would\nlike to extend heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab on his election as the President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We wish him success\nin his important work and pledge him our full support and\ncooperation.\nAllow me also to express my sincere thanks and\nadmiration to Mr. Didier Opertti, President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session, for his benevolent\nleadership and guidance.\nI also wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of the\nRoyal Government and the people of Cambodia, to warmly\nwelcome the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru\nand the Kingdom of Tonga to the United Nations.\nJust in the past year, Cambodia has finally turned a\ncorner of history, putting firmly behind it the darkness of\nits recent past and emerging into the new dawn of its\nfuture. For the first time in many decades, Cambodia is\nnow a fully integrated country, without rebels or separatists\nand without internal strife or conflict. The black chapter of\nstrife, violence, turbulence and turmoil is finally closed.\nLast year we held open and free general elections on our\nown, assisted and witnessed closely by the international\ncommunity, which pronounced them fully free and fair.\nAfter considerable discussions among the main elected\nparties concerning a common platform to serve the cause of\nthe country and its people, a new coalition Government is\nnow in place.\nThe last remnants of the genocidal Khmer Rouge have\neither surrendered or been captured, and are in custody\nawaiting trial for their crimes of genocide. We are firmly\nresolved to do whatever is needed to ensure an open trial\nfor those responsible for genocidal crimes perpetrated in the\ncountry in the past. In holding this trial, we will carefully\nbalance the need to provide our people, who were the\nvictims of this genocidal regime, with justice in order\nfinally to put behind us that dark chapter in our national\nhistory, and the paramount need for continued national\nreconciliation and the preservation of the hard-earned peace,\nnational independence and sovereignty which we value\nmost highly.\nPeace, which was so elusive for many decades past,\nnow finally prevails throughout the country. Cambodia\nhas joined that important regional group, the Association\nof South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and is determined\nto play its responsible role in regional and international\naffairs.\nCambodia and its people are committed to pluralist\ndemocracy and to upholding and protecting human dignity\nand human rights. We will be guided and governed to in\nall our efforts by the pursuit of the rule of law, which\nprovides equality for all before the law and ensures that\nlegal procedures and practices are the same for all and\nthat the law is enforced through a competent and\nimpartial judiciary system with built-in procedures for\nappeal and for rendering judgment.\nOn the economic front, we have pursued and will\ncontinue to pursue market-oriented policies, with safety\nnets for the vulnerable sectors of society until they are\nable to compete on an equal footing with others. Our\nprincipal goal is poverty alleviation. Our economic\npolicies and practices, with generous external\nassistance \u2014 for which we are grateful \u2014 have resulted\nin steady growth over the past few years. Even during the\nfinancial melt-down in the region two years ago the\nCambodian economy maintained a fairly even keel.\nMoreover, with strong political will, the Royal\nGovernment is implementing its policy platform and\nreform programmes with a view to establishing a viable\nfoundation for long-term economic growth and sustainable\ndevelopment. The key areas of the reform programmes\ninclude military and police demobilization; public sector\nreform aimed at strengthening democracy; improving\npublic services and increasing their efficiency; enhancing\nthe rule of law and respect for human rights; and\neconomic reforms focused on maintaining macroeconomic\nstability: strengthening banking and financial institutions,\nfiscal reform, sound management of public property and\nincreased public investment in physical and social\ninfrastructure and human resource development.\nSo now, as the century ends, we can say with\nconfidence that we are firmly back on track as one\nunified nation \u2014 unified in our desire not to be drawn\ninto the divisive factions of the past, but rather to play\nour part in the comity of nations for a better future for all\nmankind. We look to the future with great optimism born\n20\n\n\nout of our own achievements in political reconciliation,\ncompromise and adaptation placing the people\u2019s longer-term\ninterests above narrow and short-term partisan gains, and\nout of our sound economic and social policies. We are both\ndetermined and confident that Cambodia will march ahead\ninto the next century, and millennium, with renewed\nconfidence and vigour, and that it will contribute to human\nprogress.\nThis is a historic session which affords us all an\nopportunity \u2014 indeed compels us \u2014 to reflect on the past\nand plan our planet\u2019s future together. Looking at a wider\nperspective, we can see that humanity has witnessed\nunimaginable and immeasurably great change and progress\nover the last millennium. Progress in science and\ntechnology has helped us conquer deadly diseases, extend\nand enhance human life and improve the human condition.\nWe have vastly increased our understanding of our planet\nand our universe. We have annihilated distance and\nimproved communications to make our Earth a global\nvillage indeed.\nMuch of our technological progress and many notable\nachievements have indeed occurred in the last mere\nhundred years, and the more we advance, the more\npossibilities for achievement arise.\nYet our achievements also mask many continued\nfailings and appear to give rise to potential dangers. On a\nplanetary level, we have vastly depleted our natural\nresources, mining and using non-renewable resources at a\nrapid rate; destroying our forests; depleting our oceans;\npolluting resources that are essential to our very survival,\nsuch as air and water; and driving to extinction rare species\nof fauna and flora, the value of whose contributions to\nbalance and harmony in nature we have yet to understand.\nWe have acquired weapons of awesome power that\ncan destroy all that we have accomplished and built. The\ntechnological revolution that we have witnessed in this\ncentury has gone so far that human morals have yet to\ncatch up with it. We have deployed vast efforts and\nresources \u2014 intellectual, physical and financial \u2014 to\nachieve this tremendous progress in science and technology,\nbut we must be sure that these accomplishments can be\nharnessed and will serve only to increase the well-being of\nhumankind instead of destroying it.\nThe greatest concern of the coming century is that the\nrevolutionary progress in science and technology achieved\nover the past 100 years has resulted in, among other\nthings, the production of all kinds of weapons of mass\ndestruction. As a result, there are now countless arms\nfactories and a huge stock of modern weapons in many\ncountries worldwide. Meanwhile, the modernization of\narmed forces \u2014 which is actually an arms race \u2014\ncontinues unabated, in parallel with the many conflicts\nthat are spreading throughout the world. Where will this\nsituation lead us? This century has witnessed two great\nwars, unleashed by intolerance and bigotry, which caused\nmore division in their wake. More and more lives are\nbeing lost. Social tensions and hatred abound, caused by\nreligious and other differences. The world has reached a\nstage of complete disorder, where the rich and mighty\nimpose their agenda on the poor and force the weak to\nfollow them.\nWe must also stress that scientific and technological\nresearch, which has been conducted in a morally\nirresponsible manner, has turned our world into one of\ndrug production, where most of the discoveries have been\nmade by the developed countries but have had a\ndestructive impact on poor developing countries. The\nworld is facing many fundamental challenges, such as\norganized crime, drug and human trafficking, and so on,\nthat jeopardize the future of coming generations.\nIn addition, the gap between the rich and the poor,\nthe mighty and the meek, and the haves and have-nots\nhave widened. We have lost the art of sharing and caring.\nOur numbers have multiplied many times, but science has\nyet to find ways to feed future billions and to stretch\nmother earth\u2019s capacity to sustain us. The aging of our\npeople will pose immense challenges for future\ngenerations, when fewer productive people will have to\nmeet the needs of larger numbers of dependents, young\nand old alike. Half a billion people live in abject poverty,\nwhile a few enjoy conspicuous comfort. The poor,\nvulnerable and oppressed suffer everywhere because of\nexploitation and neglect.\nIn our rapid progress and our daily race to achieve\nmore and temporarily resolve problems as they arise, we\nseem not to pay attention to the longer-term future. The\ndawn of the next millennium is forcing us to pause and\nreflect. In the past, human destiny has from time to time\nbeen guided by far-seeing messiahs and visionaries. But\nwe cannot afford to wait for another messiah to appear.\nSince all our religions teach us that there is a messiah\ndeep down in each one of us, that is where we must\nsearch for answers. Let not the arrogance of our justified\nachievements lull us into inaction for the future.\n21\n\n\nWorld leaders have a rare and grave responsibility to\ncarry out this soul-searching. It is given to few of us to\nundertake the task of charting the future as the next\nmillennium dawns. We have to set aside our daily chores\nand power games and devote our attention to long-term\nproblems. A few hours or days of reflection in 2000 will\ndetermine the destiny of the next thousand years and more\nfor humankind and for mother earth. Let us for a time\nforget all our differences; imagine that there are no national\nboundaries or religious, racial or regional differences; and\ndevote our attention to the most important and essential\nareas we must address in the next four to five years in\norder to set our planet on the correct course for the future.\nWe do not need long, drawn-out academic conferences of\nevery kind and on every subject to do this. We do not need\nvolumes of position papers. We need only to trust our\ncollective knowledge; the lessons of the past, which are\nimmense; and our innate basic good instincts.\nIn this spirit, I would like to express Cambodia\u2019s\nstrong support for the 2000 millennium summit of the\nleaders of all countries, where \u2014 without having to watch\nour sound-bites, pose for the cameras or please domestic\naudiences \u2014 we can talk of our planet and humankind and\nof what needs to be done. The overarching need is to\nensure that the Cambodian Buddhist concept of \u201cDharma\u201d,\nor its equivalent in every religion, be respected, and that we\ndo what past messiahs have enjoined us to do. In essence,\nwe must lead a balanced and tolerant life, in harmony with\noneself, with one\u2019s neighbours, with other beings, with\nnature and with the cosmos. Perhaps we have to visualize\nand devise new institutions and agendas, or significantly\nreshape and redirect existing ones, to guide us through the\nbeginning of the next millennium.\nWe also have to set short- to medium-term agendas of\na more practical nature. Of topmost priority is the need to\neradicate poverty, a continuing scourge and stigma for\nhumanity. We should devise steps to achieve this in the\nfirst 10 years of the next century. With sharing from the\nrich to the poor, internationally and within countries, this is\nnot an impossible task. Already the G-8 nations have\nagreed to forgo past debts of poorer nations. This trend\nneeds to continue, and future assistance should largely be\nthrough well-monitored grants rather than loans.\nSecondly, we must preserve and enhance our\nenvironment and ecology. We have already seen how some\nareas try to dispose of their contaminated wastes in other\nplaces. It is necessary to stop the generation of wastes or to\ncontain their levels at the source. In some cases we have to\nslow, or sacrifice current consumption, but this takes\nvision and determination.\nLast but not least, we need to re-evaluate the roles\nof common institutions and focus on their positive\naspects. The United Nations has served us well for more\nthan half a century. It has done commendable work\nbeyond its original mandate and has adapted to changing\nneeds. It has been a platform for defining common goals.\nBut we need to show more dedicated determination to rid\nit of functions, committees and forums which have lost\nrelevance or usefulness.\nWithin the United Nations much has been\naccomplished under the bold and visionary leadership of\nthe Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and we all pay tribute\nto his wisdom and managerial abilities. Yet some\nchallenges remain including further efforts to curtail the\nburgeoning budget levels. Cambodia supports the need to\nreform the United Nations. The Organization and its\nspecialized organs need to become more unified at the\ncountry level under the mechanism of the United Nations\nresident coordinator. In other words, there should be a\nsingle United Nations presence in each country, with\nspecialized organs serving under one leadership, much\nlike an ambassador providing an overall umbrella for all\nthe activities of his country in a host country.\nWith this reform, our world body will be required to\nimprove the criteria for recruiting staff and officials for\nposting in various United Nations agencies, especially for\nposting in member countries. Otherwise, they will\nconsider themselves almighty gods, without any virtue,\nready to violate the sovereignty of a member country,\nwhich has paid considerable membership dues to pay their\nhigh salaries. In this regard, Cambodia has had some\nexperience in the history of its cooperation with some\nUnited Nations officials.\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia deems it necessary, on\nthe other hand, to abide strictly by the United Nations\nCharter and to reinforce the role of the Security Council\nin the process of maintaining peace in the world. We\nappeal to the international community to make further\ncontributions to the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), so that it can continue to provide\ndevelopment aid to the least developed countries.\nWe also think that punishing poor people of the least\ndeveloped countries, by imposing sanctions and economic\nblockade to achieve one\u2019s political agenda, goes against\nthe principle of humanity and respect for human rights\n22\n\n\nand for the right to self-determination of the people living\nin the affected country. Therefore, Cambodia fully supports\nthe demand of many countries for the immediate removal\nof the economic blockade imposed on Cuba.\nCambodia fully welcomes the decision of the\nGovernment of Indonesia to accept the multinational\npeacekeeping forces of the United Nations so as to restore\nand strengthen order and stability in East Timor. We\ncherish the strong hope that the multinational peacekeeping\nforces of the United Nations will effectively cooperate with\nthe Indonesian Government to quickly and successfully\ncreate a peaceful situation for the people of East Timor.\nIn closing, let me once again appeal to world leaders\nto use the opportunity of the dawn of the new millennium\nto carefully evaluate our achievements and their costs, as\nwell as the future perils that confront us, and to consider\nimportant steps to establish a new world order that will take\nthis planet safely through the next thousand years. The\nlessons of the past should steer us towards ensuring lasting\nlegacies for generations yet to be born. Cambodia stands\nready to join in this global effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish most\nheartily to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to lead\nthis body at this most significant time, as we stand at the\nthreshold of the new millennium. I am persuaded that\nyour antecedents, both in your own country and here at\nthe United Nations, have eminently prepared you for the\nrole that you have been elected to fill. I, for my part,\npledge the total support and assistance of my delegation\nfor the accomplishment of your great task.\nI would also like to pay tribute to the work of your\npredecessor, the Foreign Minister of Uruguay, a\nrepresentative of the Group of Latin America and\nCaribbean States, who steered the General Assembly\nthrough the difficult period of the fifty-third session.\nOnce again, I would like to express my unreserved\nesteem for the Secretary-General, whose charm, affability\nand intellect have been of great benefit to the United\nNations system. It is clear to all that Mr. Kofi Annan is\nmaking a unique contribution to the development of this,\nour Organization. My country, Saint Kitts and Nevis, its\nGovernment, its people and myself heartily commend the\nSecretary-General.\nMay I take this opportunity to say a word of\nwelcome and congratulations to the three new Member\nStates admitted at the opening of this fifty-fourth session:\nthe Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga. As representative of a small island\nState from the Caribbean, I am happy to welcome them\nas small island States from the Pacific region. I recognize\nthat even though they have only now attained full\nmembership in the United Nations they are well seized of\ntheir obligations and they will play their full part in\nupholding the principles of the Charter. Once again I\ncongratulate them and wish them well for the future.\n23\n\n\nWhen this Organization was formed, some 54 years\nago, it ushered in bright hopes and held out bright promise.\nIt was an Organization dedicated to the ending of war and\nthe enhancement of peace. Nations were to have beaten\ntheir swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning\nhooks. I wish that, as we come to the end of the twentieth\ncentury and embark upon the twenty-first, we really could\nhave celebrated this bright new world. But even now,\nduring the closing months of the closing year of the\nmillennium, mankind has been afflicted by violence and\nbrutality, and man's inhumanity to man has been expressed\nin some of the most outrageous fashions.\nThe recent development in Kosovo, the terribly\ndisturbing stories of the human tragedy that befell its\npeople, the injustices that were highlighted during that\nconflict \u2014 all this constitutes a severe limitation in the\nwork of the United Nations.\nMy Government takes the view that genocidal activity,\nfrom whichever sources it emanates, is unacceptable and a\nviolation of international law. The United Nations must\ntherefore be vigilant as it continues its pacification efforts.\nNow that the job of rebuilding is under way, let us look\nforward \u2014 look forward with hope to an era of peace and\nreconstruction \u2014 and let us hope that what may have\nseemed initially a failure may turn out to be part of the\nstriking success of the United Nations.\nAs if there is to be no respite from the challenges\naffecting this body, while we thought we were overcoming\nthe problems of Kosovo there flared up the problem of East\nTimor. Saint Kitts and Nevis, as a small State, has been\nappalled at the wanton violence and death visited upon the\nEast Timorese people since the referendum. This world\nbody must roundly condemn the inhumane activities\nperpetrated against the people of East Timor only because\nin seeking to fulfil their aspirations to live as a sovereign\npeople, they gave legitimate expression them.\nMy Government would like to commend the work of\nthe Secretary-General and all others who have sought to\npull us back from this abyss of human disaster. Saint Kitts\nand Nevis urges the Indonesian authorities to discharge\ntheir obligations with maturity and to work together with\nthe international community for the preservation of the\npeace and the protection of the people of East Timor. We\nwelcome the acceptance by the Indonesian authorities of an\ninternational protective force and we pray that the people of\nEast Timor will have their rights respected and be able to\ndevelop in freedom and democracy. We commend the\nrecent commitment of the international community to the\nreconstruction and development of Kosovo and, now, to\nthe people of East Timor.\nWe still hope, however, that there will be equal\nresponsiveness to the people of the Great Lakes region\nand the rest of sub-Saharan Africa.\nSince I have referred to the outrages in areas of the\nworld which constitute a dark blot on the human\ncondition, perhaps I ought to balance my remarks by\nrecognizing that, in one area of the world, the Middle\nEast, where peace for such a long time seemed illusive,\na process of peace is now finally under way. I should\nplace on record the appreciation of my country for all\nthose who are assisting in the process of peace. We must\ncontinue to support the efforts of the peacemakers in\norder to ensure that the rhetoric of violence is silenced.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis urges the United Nations and\nfellow world leaders to work towards preserving the\nintegrity of the country and the people of Kuwait and to\nensure that they enjoy the dignity of life without fear. The\nterritorial integrity of their national must be respected and\npreserved and the Security Council solution concerning\nIraqi aggression in Kuwait should be fully implemented.\nBy the same token, Saint Kitts and Nevis notes the\npeace process in Ireland and compliments all those who\nare contributing to the process. The world community\nshould give its support to this initiative so that those who\nare seeking to retard the process of peaceful development\nwill find no encouragement.\nAt this point, Saint Kitts and Nevis would like to\nexpress profound condolences to the Government of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan on the loss of lives which\nresulted from the recent devastating earthquake. We hope\nthat the process of recovery will be speedy. I call on the\ninternational community, therefore, to come to the\nassistance of Taiwan, which in times past has assisted\nwillingly in bringing relief to countries facing similar\ndisasters.\nLet me know say a word about the unsettled issue of\nthe Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. In\ndoing so, let me first make it clear that it never has been\nand is not now the intention of my country to interfere in\nthe internal affairs or to give offence to any State\nMember of the United Nations. Saint Kitts and Nevis is\npersuaded that the Chinese people have the capacity and\nthe accumulated wisdom to find a solution to whatever\ntheir differences appear to be, but our relationship with\n24\n\n\nthe authorities of the Republic of China, with whom we\nhave conducted diplomatic relations since our independence\nin 1983, convinces me that the 22 million Chinese on\nTaiwan have a valuable contribution which they can make\nto international dialogue. The record of their development\nas a freedom-loving, peaceful, pluralistic democracy; the\nmiraculous rebuilding of their economy; and their\ncontribution to developing countries are all attributes which,\nin our view, require that they be recognized as being\ncapable of making a contribution in international forums,\nincluding those of the United Nations.\nIn addition to the scourges of human conflict, there are\nother evils which still stare us in the face in these last few\nmonths of the closing year of the century. Poverty still\nconfronts the vast majority of mankind. Children are still\ndying of malnutrition and some, in order to get food, have\nto allow themselves to be victimized and turned into cannon\nfodder. Some still do not get an education. Indeed, there are\nmany children around the world who do not enjoy a\nchildhood. I am happy that the United Nations has declared\nthe decade beginning 2001 to be the International Decade\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children\nof the World. The new millennium belongs to our children.\nIt belongs to our children in Saint Kitts and Nevis and to\nthe children of the world. We have a duty to help make, for\nthem and with them, a better world than the one in which\nwe now live.\nAdditionally, I have noted that the agenda for this\nfifty-fourth session includes an item entitled \u201cBuilding a\npeaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic\nideal\u201d. Saint Kitts and Nevis wishes to place on record its\ncountry's support for that item, as we are doing everything\nin our power to build the development of our youth through\nsports.\nBy the same token, I am proud to report that our\neducational policies are yielding very positive results. We\nin Saint Kitts and Nevis have achieved a 98 per cent\nliteracy rate and we have not only begun, but are\nintensifying the process of making all of our young people\ncomputer-literate and equipped to face the challenges of the\nnew dawning century. Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the\nassistance of the international community to enable us to\nrealize our objectives in this regard and to give this\nprogramme even greater forward thrust.\nIt is our view that the technological advancement of\nthe past 54 years, instead of creating dislocations, should be\nused to improve understanding. It should be used to\nimprove efficiency of production and to provide better\nrevenue allocation and better living standards. Saint Kitts\nand Nevis urges those countries with the wherewithal to\ndemonstrate appropriate leadership. I encourage them to\nuse the availability of and their access to these\ntechnologies not only to generate greater economic wealth\nfor themselves, but also to advance the economic and\nsocial well-being of the citizens of the world.\nWe applaud the progress being made with regard to\nwomen in development since the adoption of the Beijing\nDeclaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World\nConference on Women on 15 September 1995. Our\ncountry has demonstrated its unswerving commitment to\ngender equity by our participation in the Committee on\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women (CEDAW). For its part,\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is currently implementing a new\ngender management system and is introducing measures\nto ensure that the national budget in my country is more\nsensitive to gender issues. We are grateful to the\nCommonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation for\ntechnical assistance in this regard.\nIn a few days, the United Nations will convene a\nspecial session of the General Assembly for the review\nand appraisal of the implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the small island developing\nStates. We trust that the international community will give\ndue recognition to the efforts being made by small island\nStates to implement their commitments under the\nProgramme of Action and note that those efforts have\nbeen affected by financial and other resource constraints\nand by global, economic and environmental factors. We\nlook forward, therefore, to the international community's\nproviding continued support for capacity- and institution-\nbuilding programmes and projects in the small island\ndeveloping States.\nIn the meantime, my Government welcomes the\ncontinued efforts of the Alliance of Small Island States\n(AOSIS) in promoting the interests and concerns of small\nisland States. All small island developing States, like\nthose of us in the Caribbean, are susceptible to the\nvagaries of nature as well as to man-made difficulties.\nJust last week our brothers and sisters in the Bahamas,\nlike those along the south-eastern coastal states of the\nUnited States of America, suffered terrible and destructive\nlosses as a result of hurricane Floyd. I urge States\nMembers of the United Nations to be generous in their\nsupport for any reconstruction endeavours for the\nthousands of displaced people.\n25\n\n\nLast year Saint Kitts and Nevis suffered a similar\nmajor blow, from hurricane Georges. The Assembly\nexpressed its support for the efforts of my Government, and\nseveral other governments in the region, as we coped with\nthat particular disaster. The Assembly also urged all States\nas a matter of urgency to contribute generously to the relief,\nrehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. It further requested\nthe Secretary-General, in collaboration with the\ninternational financial institutions and other bodies and\nagencies of the United Nations system, to assist the affected\nGovernments in identifying their medium- and long-term\nneeds and in mobilizing resources, as well as helping with\nthe task of rehabilitation and reconstruction in the affected\nCaribbean countries.\nI have dealt with this at some length because Saint\nKitts and Nevis wishes to thank the Assembly for the\nsupport expressed in that decision. We hereby place on\nrecord that we have received assistance from the United\nNations system and, in particular, from the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), and I assure the\nrepresentatives in this world body that our efforts at\nrehabilitation have proceeded with what some have\ndescribed as remarkable speed. But, however commendable\nemergency assistance is, it is not a formula for long-term,\nsustainable development. Countries such as ours need the\ncontinued support of the international community to ensure\nthat our development is not sacrificed on the altar of\nglobalization and trade liberalization.\nHow will the banana farmers in Saint Lucia, Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines, and Dominica, or the sugar-\ncane workers in Saint Kitts and Nevis preserve the integrity\nof their families? How will they preserve the dignity of a\ngood standard of living when the impersonal tentacles of\nglobalization reach out to deprive them of the resources\nthey need to survive? Human rights, in their purest and\nmost practical sense, embody the human condition in all its\nbasic elements. Therefore, the United Nations, as a major\nguarantor of these rights, should act as a counterbalance to\nglobalization, which has begun to take food away from our\npeople instead of helping them.\nThe World Trade Organization is expected to play a\nkey role in promoting trade liberalization, thereby fuelling\nthe globalization process. The World Trade Organization,\nhowever, is not a panacea for the ills of world trade. No\nnew rules can alter the fact that in most areas of exports,\ndeveloped countries will have a comparative advantage over\ndeveloping countries. It is a basic principle in economics\nthat a country with a comparative advantage in producing\ngoods and services in given areas will always make money\nat the expense of countries that are less equipped. In\nshort, the rules as now written will inevitably lead to a\nzero-sum situation where trade between developed\ncountries and developing countries is concerned.\nA regime, therefore, of unrestricted trade can lead to\ntremendous shocks in the economy of the less developed\ncountries with very critical repercussions for their\ncitizens. As part of the Caribbean Community, we have\nalready witnessed how the logic of applying the same\nrules to all, regardless of the level of economic\ndevelopment, has led to serious dislocation within the\nbanana-producing countries of our Caribbean subregion.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis would prefer to see this body,\nthrough the United Nations Conference on Trade on\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), take up the issue of what\nhappens to countries caught in the toils of a free-trade\nregime. Saint Kitts and Nevis believes that this matter\nrequires careful study by experts with a global perspective\nand it is our view that the United Nations is the one\nOrganization capable of studying this issue objectively\nand putting recommendations before the leaders of the\nworld to remedy what could potentially be a disaster for\nsmall, vulnerable economies.\nBy and large, a country such as Saint Kitts and\nNevis, which depends upon a buoyant tourist sector, the\nexport of sugar and the provision of financial services\ncannot \u2014 I repeat, cannot \u2014 object in principle to a\nworld of open economies. But our position is that a world\neconomic order predicated upon open economies works\nbest with countries whose economies are roughly equal.\nIf we are committed to eradicating poverty in every area\nof this world, then we must address the implications for\npoverty that are inherent in trading arrangements.\nThose of us who live in the Caribbean, mostly in\ndeveloping countries and small island States, are\nvulnerable and also affected by, inter alia, lack of\ncapacity and human resource bases, the need for financial\nresources, social problems, high levels of poverty and the\neffects of globalization. We rely heavily on the coastal\nareas, as well as the marine environment in general, to\nachieve sustainable development, and meet our needs and\ngoals. For us, in the context of sustainable development,\nthe Caribbean Sea must be seen as a special area. Saint\nKitts and Nevis earnestly expects that Member States, the\ninternational community and the United Nations system\nwill actively support our efforts in order to develop and\nimplement this concept and take action so as to avert the\n26\n\n\nthreat of pollution from ship-generated waste, as well as\naccidental release of hazardous and noxious substances.\nDespite the socio-economic quagmire that bedevils and\nundermines our efforts, my Government has remained\nsteadfast. It has remained committed to create more\nopportunities for the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis. But\nwe are aware that the Government cannot solve these\nproblems alone. There is a critical role for the private sector\nas well. My Government is equally committed to working\nwith local and international businesses, without, however,\nsurrendering the fate of our nation to disinterested forces\nthat could wreak further havoc on their lives.\nMy Government repeats its call for an expansion of\nthe interpretation of human rights to incorporate fully\neconomic rights and the right to development. In\nrecognizing that there is an inseparable link between the\nhuman rights and economic rights of the individual, my\nGovernment has pledged to continue our programme to\nbuild affordable houses, create jobs, fight poverty and\npursue new sources of local and foreign investment. My\nGovernment will be an avid partner and facilitator of\nbusiness without compromising the quality of life for each\nof our citizens.\nThere is an important part for national Governments\nto play in the protection of their citizens\u2019 human rights, but\nthere is a more substantial, comprehensive and far-reaching\nrole for the United Nations as ultimate protector of the\nentire body of human rights.\nThis means that there should be a greater partnership\nbetween the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the United Nations human\nrights mechanisms and other agencies and organs. In this\nway, new strategies can be devised for opening access to\nmarkets for those countries that continue to find themselves\non the periphery of the international trading system. The\nOrganization should help to create and investigate practical\nalternatives.\nHence, I maintain that we need a United Nations that\nis informed by the inequities of the world economic\nsystems, and is able to respond to the social challenges that\nare being exacerbated as a result.\nWe do our best to achieve the eradication of poverty.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis seeks the support of the international\ncommunity, thus building a bridge to a better world.\nTomorrow\u2019s world should open with our people finding\nanswers to the request to give them each day their daily\nbread, and the kingdom of peace should be realized here\non Earth. There is an urgency to match our deeds with\nour words so that we may, all of us, find the forgiveness\nwhich is necessary as the basis for building peace in this\nworld.\nLast year I spoke of the viability of social-venture\nphilanthropy through which Governments and businesses\nmay collaborate with each other. This concept already\nexists at a similar level within many corporate structures.\nCompanies are already engaged in projects that enhance\nand maintain a positive corporate image. We would take\nthis further if companies would recognize the importance\nof preserving a good corporate culture by improving the\nstandard of living of the national constituencies in which\nthey do profitable business. A reformed United Nations,\nwith its existing organs, funds and programmes, can help\nto implement such strategies.\nWe must move with informed haste, because I fear\nthat if we fail to translate the benefits of democracy,\ntechnological growth and economic wealth into tangible\ngains for our people, future chaos will not be far behind.\nI am one of those who refuse to accept that the developed\nworld could be ignorant of the challenges facing the small\nand poor economies. I am reluctant to think that national\ninterests could be so blinding that Governments neglect to\nrealize that the problems plaguing any one region, for\ninstance, have serious ramifications much further afield.\nWe have to recommit to the elimination of the\npotent cancer of illicit drugs and global consequences. We\nare all victims. Therefore, we must all become partners.\nLet us commit to root out the menace of narco-trafficking\nthat is becoming embedded in our various societies.\nI dare say that the multitude of problems before us\nis complex and very involved. The old paradigms that\nprevailed in the cold war have outlived their usefulness.\nIt is not only those elements that directly threaten our\npolitical and strategic interests, but also those factors that\nundermine a country\u2019s ability to preserve its economic,\nsocial and cultural fabric that should guide national\ninterests. There is no longer one giant enemy, but there\nare a number of persistent factors that could conspire at\nany one time to destroy the delicate balance of our\nsocieties.\nIn spite of all the shortcomings of this body, if the\nUnited Nations did not exist, it would be necessary to\ninvent it, because there is no other organization that has\ncontributed as much to the development of humankind.\n27\n\n\nMoreover, the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\nis happy to be given this opportunity to express its views\non a number of issues of concern to my country.\nWithout the United Nations, a micro State such as\nSaint Kitts and Nevis would never have been heard.\nTherefore, as we cross over into the new millennium, Saint\nKitts and Nevis joins with the rest of the world as we\ncommit ourselves to the continued development of the\nUnited Nations in order to ensure that all people\neverywhere will enjoy the fulfilment of the promise of\npeace, prosperity and progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people and the\nGovernment of the Republic of Vanuatu, I wish to join\nprevious speakers in congratulating you, Mr. President, on\nyour election to this high and important post. Your\nunanimous election as President of the fifty-fourth session\nof General Assembly shows the esteem in which the\ninternational community holds both you, personally, and\nyour country, Namibia. The Republic of Vanuatu\u2019s\ndelegation is confident that you will guide the session to a\nsuccessful conclusion.\nMay I take this opportunity, through you, to express\nmy delegation\u2019s sincere appreciation on your predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for his\noutstanding stewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-\nthird session.\nI wish to commend our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his wise leadership and dedication to the reform\nand restructuring of our Organization. Through you,\nMr. President, we would like to assure him of our support.\nFour years ago, we gathered here to celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization \u2014 in particular, to\nrenew our commitment to the fundamental principles which\ncreated it in 1945.\nWe have also made strong a commitment to further\nstrengthen our collaborative and genuine efforts in ensuring\nthat this Organization continues to promote global peace,\njustice, healthy environment, human rights, law and order,\nand support the process of sustainable development of its\nMember nations \u2014 in particular, the least developed\ncountries (LDCs) such as those in the Pacific region,\nincluding the Republic of Vanuatu.\nThe current international political and economic\nsituation has grown ever more complex and demanding on\nour very limited and scarce resources as well as on the\nsupport available from our development partners.\nWe are deeply concerned by the continuing escalation\nof international crimes of all sorts \u2014 drug trafficking,\nmoney laundering, human rights violations, terrorism,\norganized crime and other similar activities which have the\npotential of placing the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of small island States at great risk. The\ninternational community must be seen to genuinely\ncollaborate in combating these criminal phenomena if the\nnew philosophy of globalization is to positively progress\nand if we are to advance into the new millennium with\nfresh and renewed hope to build a better future for our\nchildren.\nWe do not believe that the world is doing us justice\nand the fundamental principles of peace and economic\nprosperity as enshrined in the Charter if we do not\nobserve our joint call for disarmament of nuclear weapons\nand other weapons of mass destruction. International\nsecurity cannot be guaranteed if we fail to accord priority\nattention and resources to education, protection of the\nenvironment and good Heath of humankind and its\nsurvival into the next millennium.\nAs a small island developing State where the ocean\nprovides one of the most important parts of our food\nchain, we would like to join others in voicing our main\nconcern regarding the management of our oceans and\nseas. Our participation at the Second London Oceans\nWorkshop last December demonstrated this. We would\ntherefore join other nations in calling for a collective\naffirmation by all respective Member States at this session\nof the General Assembly for a resolution to establish a\nconsultative process to improve coordination and\nmanagement of programmes that are associated with the\nprotection of the oceans and the seas which are very dear\nto our very survival. This year my Government acceded\nto and ratified three International Maritime Organization\nConventions which again reflects our concern for the\nprotection of our oceans and seas.\nThe momentum of the fiftieth anniversary of our\nOrganization, and the lessons we have learned from past\nmistakes and our renewed commitment must guide us in\nour pursuit for a better world where, through this\nOrganization, a renewed sense of mutual trust and\ngenuine dialogue can he resurrected to ease the political\ntensions and economic crisis in all the regions and\nsub-regions of the planet.\nFor our part of the world, these new developments\nconstitute a real threat to the already vulnerable\nenvironment of our small island economies and our\npopulation. Confronted with these challenges, many\n13\n\n\ncountries in the Pacific Region, including Vanuatu, do not\nhave much choice at the end of the century but to embark\non difficult programmes of reform, both within their\nrespective Governments and societies.\nLast year, The Honourable Donald Kalpokas Masike\nVanua, Prime Minister of Vanuatu, informed the Assembly\nthat Vanuatu had initiated a Comprehensive Reform\nProgramme with the support of both multilateral and\nbilateral donor agencies and countries. As we are still in the\nimplementation stage of our reform, it is our genuine hope\nthat it will not only be beneficial to our people but also\nresponsive to their needs, in particular those of the 80 per\ncent who live in the rural areas on subsistence farming.\nTherefore Vanuatu would continue to need the special\nsupport being accorded to it as a least developed country.\nThe role of Mr. Gurirab\u2019s predecessor and of the\nSecretary-General in subsequently facilitating a constructive\ndialogue and comprehensive appreciation of the economic\nhardships of Vanuatu must be commended, and it is our\nhope that this will continue as we enter the new\nmillennium.\nIn this regard, the Government and the people of\nVanuatu warmly welcome the recent decision of the\nEconomic and Social Council, at its recent meeting in\nGeneva this year, to defer consideration of Vanuatu\u2019s\ngraduation from least developed country status, pending full\nassessment of the usefulness of the vulnerability index and\necological fragility as criteria for least developed country\ndesignation.\nIn this connection, I am pleased to inform the\nAssembly that with the assistance of the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), my\nGovernment will be carrying out a review of our situation\nin Vanuatu which we hope will assist the Committee for\nDevelopment Planning in its endeavour to come up with\ncriteria that will hopefully be accepted and adopted to\ndetermine the status of most least developed countries. We\nwould like to register our most sincere appreciation and\nrecognition to each and every country and group of\ncountries for their continuous support.\nOne of the commitments we all made during the\nfiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995 was that our\nOrganization ought to be reformed and restructured in a\nmanner that reflects reality and the problems we are\ncurrently experiencing, so that it could be effective in\naddressing the issues and needs of its Member States, both\nindividually and as a group. On this note, we want to\nassociate ourselves with earlier statements in reference to\nreform and restructuring, in particular on the issue of\ngeographical location. Here we are referring specifically\nto our close neighbours, Australia and New Zealand,\nwhich are considered as part of the Asia-Pacific region.\nFrom our perspective \u2014 shared, we have no doubt,\nby others \u2014 the United Nations must include in its\nreform agenda a full assessment and recognition of the\ninherent particularities of small island States like the\nRepublic of Vanuatu and the impact of the international\neconomic crisis, in particular that of globalization, on\ntheir economic performance and on the sustainability of\ntheir political stability.\nThe pursuit and promotion of a free and responsible\npress, the protection of individual rights and gender\nequality, as noted in Mr. Gurirab\u2019s opening remarks, are\nmatters which are receiving more attention under the\nreform programme. These are real challenges to Vanuatu\ntoday, but they are challenges which we are confident we\nwill successfully address over time, with the necessary\nsupport of the international community.\nThe right of self-determination must also continue to\noccupy our agenda. As the United Nations International\nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism ends next year,\nit is my Government\u2019s hope that all administering Powers\nof the countries concerned will take appropriate steps, in\ncooperation with the territories, to work out some time-\nframe for those countries to exercise their inalienable\nright self-determination, self-government or independence.\nThe United Nations, as mandated by its Charter, must be\nseen to encourage and support dialogue at the appropriate\npolitical levels in the regions and countries where human\nsuffering and social disorder continue as a direct result of\nconflicts of opinion on the issue of self-determination.\nIn the Pacific region, while we warmly welcomed\nthe signing last year of the Noum\u00e9a Accord between the\nFrench Government and the major political parties in New\nCaledonia, we urge all parties concerned to uphold their\ncommitment in relation to the rights and wishes of the\nindigenous population of New Caledonia. We welcome\nthe decision by the French Government to allow\nrepresentatives from the South Pacific Forum and\nrepresentatives of the United Nations Special Political and\nDecolonization Committee to visit the Territory in August\nof this year, as outlined in resolution 53/65. We believe\nthis new agreement and the latest developments will help\nto foster a stronger sense of commitment in all parties to\nwork together to support an irreversible trend for the\n14\n\n\nfuture political status of New Caledonia \u2014 that is, its\nself-determination.\nStill in our region, while the East Timorese people\nhave finally realized their right to self-determination, my\nGovernment notes with grave concern the deteriorating\nsituation in East Timor following the results of the ballot at\nthe end of August in which many human rights violations\nhave been noted and many innocent people have lost their\nlives. However, my Government is pleased to note the\ninitiatives taken by the Government of Indonesia to allow\nthe deployment of a Security Council peacekeeping force in\nthe troubled area and to assist in restoring normalcy and\nallowing the democratic process to take its course.\nAs I said earlier on, the world and our Organization\nwill be going through very challenging times as we prepare\nto turn the page of this century and start a new one. The\ncredibility of the United Nations in the next millennium\nwill be measured in terms of its effectiveness in responding\nto the real situations prevailing in its Member States,\nespecially in small island States. The recent admission of\nour Pacific Island neighbours, namely the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga,\nto this body is a manifestation of this, and we hope that\ntheir admission not only increases the membership of the\nUnited Nations but also that they will bring with them new\nideas to contribute to this important Organization. As small\nisland States, we feel that our problems will be addressed\nadequately and be heard in an international Organization\nlike the United Nations, and we join others in welcoming\nthem to our family of nations.\nTo conclude, let me say that it is therefore vital that\nwe all support and supplement the process of reform\nspearheaded by our Secretary-General, which is aimed not\nonly at streamlining our Organization but also at\nstrengthening it. As we approach the dawn of the new\nmillennium, with its unforeseen challenges, cooperation will\nno doubt be required between all Members in order that we\nmay discuss and debate our common issues in this very\nvenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The fifty-fourth session of\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations takes place\nat a time marking humanity's crossing into the next\nmillennium. It emerges as a link in the long chain of\ntumultuous events that have reshaped the map of the\nfamily of nations.\n12\n\n\nThe United Nations was born against the backdrop of\nthe destruction and desolation of the Second World War,\nthe most bitter, deadly and inhumane war known to\nmankind. The descent of the Nazi regime to the depths of\nevil was like an eclipse in the history of civilization and\nwill be recalled in history as a nightmare in which man\ncreated the devil, who wreaked devastation, destruction,\nterror and annihilation upon the world. The stand taken by\nthe Allied forces against the Nazi monster, and the creation\nof the United Nations in April 1945, on the verge of the\ndefeat of the forces of destruction, was an act that marked\nthe return of humanity to its senses, to salvage the future of\nmankind.\nIn this month when we mark 60 years since the\noutbreak of the most horrible of wars, we are strengthened\nmore than ever in our sense of hope and confidence in the\nnecessity of the United Nations and of its activities\nthroughout the world. The various agencies of the United\nNations work to enhance world health and tend the sick; to\nsupply the needy with food and nourishment; to build\nbridges between cultures; to promote education and\novercome ignorance; to instil hope into the lives of refugees\nand displaced persons; and to assist the victims of disasters,\nwhether natural or man-made.\nThe soldiers of the United Nations forces are the true\npeacekeepers of our age. In its corps are soldiers from all\nthe nations of the world. At times they risk their lives in\nareas riddled with conflict and violence around the world,\nwhether their United Nations mandate is to make peace or\nto be observers that safeguard the peace. These distinctions,\nimportant as they may be to the policy makers and shapers\nof international relations, have no meaning to the individual\nUnited Nations soldier, posted far from his country, who\nbrings hope and tranquillity to places fraught with tragedy,\nsuffering and violence.\nAfter many centuries of violence and war, of\nenslavement and destructiveness in the name of murderous\nideologies, after decades of cold war and polarized world\nalliances of the East and the West, the human race is now\nmaking great strides down the paths of peace and\nreconciliation. Before our very eyes, a process is\nenveloping the world, signalling hope for the future.\nMankind is adopting a new path, the path of the prophet\nIsaiah, who as far back as 2,600 years ago prophesied that\nthe day would come when\n\u201cthey shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and\ntheir spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up\nsword against nation, neither shall they learn war\nany more.\u201d (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4)\nThis prophecy \u2014 which has been adopted by the\nUnited Nations as a source of hope, as the symbol of the\nvictory of the good in human beings over evil \u2014 should\nserve today more than ever as a beacon and a path for all\nwho cherish peace around the world and for their\nrepresentatives gathered here today.\nThe world has become more open. Satellites, the\nInternet and telecommunications networks shorten\ngeographical and cultural distances. The political and\nideological blocs of the past have disintegrated, and the\nwalls of animosity have fallen along with the tyrants and\ndictators who built them. They are being replaced by new\nblocs, some of which are in the process of being created\nwhere development and prosperity reign. I hope and\nbelieve that these beneficial transformations will also\noccur in the Middle East.\nIn our region, too, the light of hope has been\nrekindled. We are now in the midst of a political process,\nthe objective of which is to reach peace between States\nand reconciliation between peoples. Israel aspires to reach\na comprehensive peace with its neighbours, a peace of\nharmony. Israel will not be satisfied with a merely\npolitical or strategic peace. In our eyes, the absence of\nwar is not the peace we aspire to achieve.\nMay I be allowed to emphasize once again that\npeace means a culture of peace; peace means no more\nthreats of violence, whether implied or categorical; peace\nentails the end of boycotts, the end of contempt and\ndefamation, the end of incitement and confrontation...\npeace is also a language of peace: it is the way leaders\naddress their nations, teachers teach their students and\nreligious leaders inspire their followers.\nAt a time when various kinds of religious extremism\nare rearing their heads and eroding human wisdom and\nhuman freedom, it is essential that inter-faith dialogue be\nstrengthened and that the religions be manifested in their\nenlightened forms, which sanctify tolerance and\ncoexistence.\nOn the way to achieving peace in our region, we\noften find ourselves confronted with contradictory\nrealities. Parallel to the political process, our negotiating\npartners are conducting a constant political war against\nIsrael in various international forums, including from the\npodium of this Assembly. This dualism is inconsistent\n13\n\n\nwith the peace process and is intolerable, as are the extreme\ndecisions taken by the Arab League against Israel. These\ndecisions are not in keeping with the spirit of peace, as\nexpressed in the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.\nWe hoped for and expected a different atmosphere,\none that would complement the impetus initiated by the\nnew Government in Israel. We have been saddened to\nwitness events that undermine the essence of peace. These\nevents can be defined only as anti-peace resolutions.\nEngaging in a peace process, on the one hand, and\nmaintaining anti-Israel declarations and resolutions, on the\nother, raises some serious concerns about our negotiating\npartners and their concept of peace. Is it a peace of\nnormalization with open borders, or is it only one of\ntemporary initial recognition? Will our relations with the\nGulf and Maghreb countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia,\nMauritania, Qatar and Oman, be allowed to expand and\ndevelop? Or will these relations remain hostage to mood\nswings after each and every difficulty in the negotiations or\nwhenever there is disagreement? Continued doubts about\nthese cardinal questions cannot be tolerated in the light of\nthe heavy price and grave risks that Israel is taking upon\nitself in this process.\nThree weeks ago, on 4 September, Israel and the\nPalestinian Authority signed the Sharm el-Sheikh\nMemorandum, which for the first time creates a direct,\nchronological, political and conceptual link between the\nInterim Agreements and the final status agreement. On 13\nSeptember, the final status talks were renewed between\nIsraelis and Palestinians.\nWe are determined to reach a framework agreement\nthat will form the basis of the final status agreement by\nFebruary 2000, as stated and agreed upon in the Sharm\nel-Sheikh Memorandum. In this framework we will select\nthe issues and set an agenda for the final status agreement.\nThe topics at hand are known, as are the differing vantage\npoints and positions of each side. The differences can be\nresolved only by direct negotiations.\nRegarding the final status, I wish to affirm from this\npodium that when we refer to political separation as one of\nthe prime concepts of the permanent settlement, we are also\nsaying that, for the benefit of both sides, we should not\nnecessarily sever ties that are vital to coexistence in the\nvarious spheres of living.\nFrom Israel\u2019s perspective, there is no competition and\nnever has been any between the different negotiating tracks.\nIsrael also aspires to reach peace with Syria, our\nneighbour to the north. This is, after all, in the higher\ncommon interests of both Israel and Syria. H o w e v e r ,\nalong with these common interests, the following point\nmust be made clear: A democratic country like Israel\ncannot accept a precondition to beginning the talks that\nrequires a prior acceptance of the final outcome as\ndictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of the\nopposing side.\nWe must maintain the momentum of good will so\nthat we can face our children, Syrian and Israeli alike,\nwith a clear conscience and say to them in all honesty:\nWe tried everything and did our utmost. I call upon the\nleaders of Syria, in view of what we have gone through\ntogether, to cease hesitating. It is time to talk. Meetings\nand discussion are not political sacrifices \u2014 they are\nbasic necessities.\nOn the road to a comprehensive peace, we wish to\nsee Lebanon join the camp of peacemakers. The anomaly\nwhich has developed in its territory must come to an end.\nWe have never had nor do we have now any territorial\nclaims or disputes with Lebanon. Our one and only\ninterest is to guarantee the safety and security of our\ncitizens. I must say that, regrettably, the Government of\nLebanon has for many years failed to enforce its\nsovereignty in the southern part of Lebanon and to disarm\nHezbollah. I hope that this situation will improve and that\nIsrael, within the framework of an agreement, will be able\nto leave the southern part of Lebanon.\nNevertheless, with that as our ambition, I wish to\nemphasize that we will not be held hostage much longer\non this track to a stubborn and defiant attitude. We will\nmake our own independent decisions, as we see fit, in\norder to ensure our protection and our vital interests,\ntaking all options under consideration.\nA reconciliation between Israel and its neighbours\nmust extend the promise that all the peoples of the region\nmay reap the benefits of peace. Normalization must not\nbe viewed as a one-sided gesture. As a natural outcome\nof peaceful coexistence, normalization is not in the\nservice of one particular party. It is in the interests of all\nthe nations of the region.\nWe hope to renew the multilateral tracks as early as\nthis year. There is a need for close cooperation in\nregional multilateral projects. Our region has tremendous\npotential. In order to fully realize this potential, we must\nestablish a mechanism of true cooperation among the\n14\n\n\nStates of the region. This cooperation would clearly be to\nthe benefit of all of us in the region.\nThe scarcity of water in our region, which will only\nget worse, may impose a new way of life on the inhabitants\nof the Middle East in the coming years. Israel is\nanticipating this problem and preparing for it, but in this\ncase, as in others, cooperation in the region is essential and\nwill benefit all sides.\nThe working groups of the multilateral tracks\nundertook various assignments of primary importance.\nUnfortunately, their activities have been frozen for\nirrelevant reasons. This is the time to resurrect them. Any\ndelay or imposed condition is liable to undermine the peace\nprocess and delay the aid packages so essential to the\npeoples of the region. Throughout this important process,\non the bilateral and the multilateral tracks alike, we are\naccompanied by the international community. First and\nforemost was the United States of America, along with the\nRussian Federation, the European Union, Canada, Norway,\nJapan, China and other countries and organizations that\nhave assisted and continue to do so. Their key contributions\nearn them special commendation from this rostrum.\nEgypt and Jordan were our first partners in breaking\ndown the walls of enmity and in thawing relations in our\nregion. Improving our relations with Egypt, as well as\nrenewing the multilateral tracks, are essential to furthering\nthe common objectives of the nations in our region. T h e\nrelations between Israel and Jordan are an example of\nappropriate and favourable relations between neighbouring\ncountries. We intend to strengthen and broaden the relations\nbetween the two nations in the economic, social and\npolitical realms.\nAs we march further along the difficult path of\nmaking peace, we look back with sorrow and sadness as we\nremember the pioneers who broke new ground and are no\nlonger with us today: the late Menachem Begin, Anwar\nSaddat, Yitzhak Rabin, King Hussein and King Hassan II\nof Morocco. Their vision and their work inspire us to\ncontinue to work towards completing their enterprise of\npeacemaking.\nWe cannot afford to be disillusioned. Our region is\nneither North America nor Benelux. Even as we negotiate\nthe peace process, we remain aware of the threats and\ndangers directed against us, threatening the stability of the\nentire region. The mix of extreme fundamentalism, on the\none hand, and of the potential use of weapons of mass\ndestruction, on the other, threatens the peace, stability and\nfuture of the entire region. This threat is not just an\nelement of academic debates in the study of international\nrelations, but a harsh reality which we must all face.\nFrom this international platform, I call for a halt to\nall technological, scientific and other kinds of assistance\nto countries looking to obtain unconventional weapons,\nwhile threatening the existence of the State of Israel and\nthe region as a whole.\nThe Persian Gulf War demonstrated that leadership\nlacking reason and stability poses a threat to all the\ncountries in the region and to the world at large. The\nmonitoring groups and machinery in Iraq must be\nimmediately resumed. That is the obligation of the\ninternational community so long as the Iraqi regime seeks\nnon-conventional weapons and threatens the region. The\nUnited Nations is the largest, most authoritative and most\nrecognized international body. It should therefore be the\none to take the initiative and the responsibility in curbing\nthis danger.\nTerrorism is an additional strategic enemy and we\ncannot come to terms with its existence. It is a threat not\nonly to Israel, but to many other nations across the world\nas well. Terror knows no borders or civilized rules. There\ncan be no coexistence with terror, either in the context of\nthe negotiations conducted by Israel with its neighbours,\nor in the broader regional context. Anyone who believes\nthat terror is a nuisance which can be tolerated is\nmistaken. Terror is in essence a strategic threat. A\nsynthesized, coordinated and unrelenting approach must\nbe adopted against it.\nHere, in this building of stone and glass, reflecting\nthe current image of our world today with its points of\nlight and shadows of darkness, counterparts and enemies\nmeet as friends and allies in the creation of a forum for\ndiscussion and coexistence. Discussion is the way to\nresolve conflict. It is also the way of tomorrow. Dialogue\nand common language are the tools of diplomacy, the raw\nmaterial for the creation of a new reality and the\nfoundation for a stable and safer society.\nIt was here in the General Assembly, at the\nbeginning of the decade, that I first met with my Chinese\ncounterpart. After 40 years of total dissociation between\nour two countries, we endeavoured to re-establish\ndiplomatic relations between Israel and China. It was also\nhere that we laid the groundwork for establishing ties\nwith the former Soviet Union, as well as with India,\nNigeria and other States. These are only a few examples\n15\n\n\ndemonstrating the possibility in this arena for building a\nbridge between nations and States.\nAs a nation that experienced great difficulties,\novercome only by accelerated development efforts, the State\nof Israel takes part in the international effort to aid others\nand share knowledge, experience and technology,\nexperience which it has accumulated in various fields. The\nnation of Israel is proud of its ancient tradition of sharing\nand identifying with the world at large.\nThrough the Division for International Cooperation\nwithin the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Israel maintains ongoing\nprojects and a broad range of training courses in Israel. We\nhave demonstration units and we are conducting research.\nFor example, a special medical centre was recently\nestablished in Mauritania and serves the many citizens of\nthat State who suffer from chronic eye problems. Similarly,\nIsrael invests great efforts and resources in training\nprofessionals to acquire the skills and abilities necessary for\nmeeting the various challenges that engage many parts of\nthe world.\nIn the more than 40 years since its inception, the\nDivision for International Cooperation has trained more\nthan 70,000 trainees from more than 120 countries, who\nhave come to Israel and attended its training courses in the\nareas of agriculture, water resources, health and medicine,\nscience, education and others.\nIn 1998 alone, some 155 courses were held in Israel\non a variety of topics, with the participation of more than\n4,000 trainees. Gladly, I can report that many of the\ntrainees were from Middle Eastern countries. Fully 820\nPalestinians participated in these courses over the past year,\nthereby helping to strengthen the bridges of peace which\nhave been built between Israelis and Palestinians. In the\nsame year, Israel ran more than 150 courses in over 60\ndifferent countries, with the participation of over 7,000\ntrainees. I am proud to point out that in many of the\ncountries to which we sent Israeli experts, the local\npersonnel managed to translate our goodwill into positive\nresults on the ground, to the benefit of their people and\ntheir land.\nBecause of the reputation it has acquired, the Division\nfor International Cooperation is also one of the central\naddresses in Israel to which people can turn in times of\ndisaster around the world. We have recently witnessed just\nhow essential such assistance can be in times of natural\ndisasters. Israel has always responded favourably to\nrequests for aid and relief, regardless of the political\ncontext or the state of diplomatic relations.\nWe wish to support and commend the United States\nof America, our friend and ally, an inspiration to us all in\nits efforts to promote the values of cooperation among\nnations. This is also the time to express our appreciation\nto the United States for its intensive efforts to bring true\npeace to the Middle East.\nEven today in the United States we have witnessed\nagain a new resort to the threat of boycott. The case at\nhand is the threat to declare a boycott against the\nAmerican company Disney, because the company dared\nto allow Jerusalem to be portrayed in an exhibition\ncelebrating the millennium. We condemn these threats and\nthe use by certain Arab States of this anachronistic\ndevice. It has no place here or anywhere else in the\nworld.\nOver thousands of years, since the time of biblical\nKing David, the builder of Jerusalem, until the present\nday, Jerusalem has not served as the capital of any other\nnation in the world besides the nation of Israel, the\nJewish people. Even after our forced exile from the land\nof Israel, we continued, generation after generation, to\nstay faithful to Jerusalem. The flame of Jerusalem was\ncarried in our hearts as a hidden source of faith and hope.\nIn our wanderings, in the East and in the West, in\nthe African deserts and on the outskirts of Siberia, from\nthe golden age of Spain through the dark Inquisition,\nduring the prosperous Europe of the romantic era to the\ncharred ashes of the Holocaust, throughout all the above\nthe eyes of the Jews and their prayers have been directed\ntoward Jerusalem. Year after year, from father to son, the\nanthem of the Jewish nation has constantly been \u201cNext\nYear in Jerusalem\u201d.\nWith the passing of those previous generations and\nexiles, we have had the privilege of being deemed worthy\nto return to Jerusalem, to rebuild the ruins, to rededicate\nthe city as a centre radiating with beauty, open to all\nfollowers of all religions, as the poet has said, where\nfreedom of all religions is a fact of life.\nIt is so upsetting then that even today, 51 years since\nthe independence of the State of Israel, there are still\nthose who would deny our natural right to decide the\nlocation of our capital, a natural right given to every\nnation in the world. From Jerusalem, the city of David, I\nwill quote from the original song of David on Jerusalem,\n16\n\n\nin words which transcends the limits of time and retains\ntheir meaning in every generation:\n\u201cOur feet shall stand within thy gates, oh Jerusalem.\nJerusalem is built as a city that is bound firmly\ntogether.\u201d (The Holy Bible, Psalm 122:2-3)\nToday, as before, from this podium we declare to the\nentire world, to our friends and people and those who are\ndistant from us: Jerusalem, unified under Israeli\nsovereignty, is and will remain forever the capital of Israel.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to\njoin with others who have spoken before me in\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I am certain\nthat your experience and skills, as well as your dedication\nto freedom and justice, make you qualified to lead the\nUnited Nations as it searches for peace in Africa and\nelsewhere in the coming year.\nI also take this opportunity to pay tribute to your\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the effective manner in\nwhich he guided the work of the previous session. I extend\nmy gratitude to the Secretary-General for his dedicated and\nexemplary contributions to the cause of peace.\nPermit me also to welcome the Republic of Kiribati,\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as new\nMembers of our Organization.\nIt is a matter of deep concern that this year is\nwitnessing the continuation of conflicts and the emergence\nof new sources of conflict. In particular, it is disturbing to\nnote the growing tendency to resort to the use or threat of\nforce. This has become a grave danger to the independence\nand unity of States as well as to regional and international\npeace and security. This year has recorded some of the\nbloodiest inter-State and intra-State conflicts, in Africa,\nAsia and Europe.\nSub-Saharan African has been the part of the world\nthat has suffered most from those conflicts. Sub-Saharan\nAfrica\u2019s economic performance and political stability have,\nin fact, taken a turn for the worse in 1999. About one\nthird of the 52 members of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), all of them in sub-Saharan Africa, have\nbeen worse off economically in 1999 than they were in\nthe previous year. Almost 20 countries have been afflicted\nby armed civil conflict or inter-State war. It is not\nsurprising that almost all of the countries that have\nsuffered economic relapse are the ones that are embroiled\nin conflict.\nAmong those 20, the worst are to be found in the\nHorn of Africa. More than two thirds of their people are\nliving in abject misery. Most have little or no food. They\nare ridden with disease. The economies of most of those\ncountries are in shambles. The region is politically\nunstable and racked by conflict. It is no surprise,\ntherefore, that some donor States and international\nfinancial institutions have rightly denounced the state of\naffairs and have informed a few of those States that they\nwould be better advised to feed their hungry millions and\nbetter manage their economies than squander countless\nmillions to finance ill-advised military adventures.\nIn his report on Africa, Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan made it amply clear that economic stagnation and\npoverty are a direct function of conflict. However, this is\nas evident elsewhere as it is in Africa. Thus, the situations\nin East Timor, Afghanistan, Kosovo or Bosnia and\nHerzegovina are no different from those in the Horn of\nAfrica, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo or Angola. In all those cases, conflicts have caused\nserious setbacks in development plans and negatively\nimpacted on the living conditions of the people. In almost\nall cases, conflict has been the intrinsic cause of famine\nand serious violations of human rights and other\nhumanitarian crises. The international community cannot\nafford complacency in the face of such threats to\ninternational peace and security, if it is to be believed that\npeace is indivisible and that what happens in one region\nwill have an impact on others.\nVarious reasons, including ethnic and religious\nhatred, economic and political grievances and\nunemployment, have been advanced as the root causes of\nconflict. While these are valid factors, it must never be\nforgotten that territorial expansionism, both within and\noutside the State, and the determination to achieve it by\nthe use or threat of military force and by political and\neconomic coercion against the territorial integrity and\nindependence of neighbouring countries, has been the\nmajor cause of conflict and the disturbance of peace in\n29\n\n\nthe Horn of Africa. Eritrea, the victim of Ethiopia\u2019s\nterritorial ambitions and its policy of aggression, is one\nexample of this.\nIt has now been 16 months since the eruption of the\nconflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the root cause of\nwhich is Ethiopia\u2019s avowedly ethnic-based policy of\nterritorial aggrandizement and its systematic annexation of\nlarge areas of Eritrean territory. From the beginning of the\nconflict, Eritrea has consistently pursued a policy of\npeaceful resolution of the border problem even in the face\nof provocation, creeping annexation of its territory and\noutright aggression. To that end, it had attempted, before\nthe eruption of the conflict, to engage the Ethiopian\nGovernment in peaceful dialogue to amicably resolve all\nexisting problems and controversies related to their\ncommon border. Even after the start of the conflict, Eritrea\non several occasions requested the Ethiopian side to agree\nto accept bilateral negotiations. When this was rejected by\nEthiopia, Eritrea unilaterally issued a proposal which\ncontained detailed modalities for the peaceful resolution of\nthe conflict. That too was rejected by the Ethiopian regime.\nAfter the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was\nseized of the matter, Eritrea accepted, despite its grave\nreservations, the Framework Agreement submitted to both\nparties following the Ouagadougou summit of June 1998,\nafter it had received the clarifications it had sought on\nseveral critical issues. Eritrea also readily and unequivocally\naccepted, at the Algiers OAU summit in July 1999, the\nmodalities for the implementation of the Framework\nAgreement. The modalities were in fact drawn up to satisfy\nthe unjust, unfair and unwarranted new preconditions made\nby Ethiopia on the basis of its own unilateral interpretation\nof the Framework Agreement. Eritrea declared that it was\naccepting the modalities only in the interests of peace and\nof the good of both the Ethiopian and the Eritrean peoples.\nFinally, Eritrea also accepted without any delay the\ntechnical arrangements for the implementation of the\nFramework Agreement and modalities which were\nsubmitted to both parties on 23 August 1999.\nImplementation of the provisions of the Framework\nAgreement would entail, inter alia, the following: it would\nrequire a cessation of hostilities, the redeployment of the\ntroops of both sides from disputed territories and the\ndeployment of peacekeeping forces in those areas. Eritrea\nis fully committed to this. It would require investigation of\nthe sequence of events to determine the origins of the\nconflict. Eritrea welcomes this since it would conclusively\nidentify the real aggressor. The Framework Agreement\nenvisages the investigation of human rights abuses. Eritrea\nawaits the results eagerly. Implementation would\ndetermine the exact borders between the two countries.\nEritrea is enthusiastic about this. Eritrea is certain that the\ninternational community too is just as eager and\nenthusiastic about finding the final truth on all these and\nother related matters.\nOn the other hand, the Ethiopian Government was\ndetermined to achieve its territorial ambitions by all\nmeans, fair or foul. To this end, in 1997 and 1998,\nmembers of the armed forces and militia of the Ethiopian\nGovernment systematically used brute force to expel\nEritreans from Eritrean lands and to incorporate southern\nand south-eastern Eritrean territories into Ethiopia. That\nGovernment then rejected all Eritrean overtures on direct\npeace talks and continued feverishly to prepare for new\naggression even as it paid lip service to the Framework\nAgreement. On 6 February 1999, it launched an invasion\nalong several sectors of our common boundary, even\nwhile peace facilitators from the United Nations and the\nUnited States were engaged in shuttle diplomacy to bring\nthe conflict to an end. Sadly, tens of thousands of\nEthiopians and many Eritreans perished or were wounded\nduring that aggression.\nWhen Eritrea accepted the Framework Agreement,\nEthiopia came out with new preconditions based solely on\nits own interpretation of the Agreement, rather than\njoining Eritrea in the implementation of the peace plan.\nYet Ethiopia was to accept the modalities \u2014 which were\nactually formulated to satisfy its unfair, unjust and\nunwarranted demands \u2014 only after much prevarication\nand procrastination. Finally, Ethiopia issued a statement\non 4 September 1999 which was tantamount to a rejection\nof the technical arrangements, which are only a procedure\nfor implementing the Framework Agreement and the\nmodalities, on the untenable grounds that it contained\nelements which were not part of the previous two\ndocuments. One week later, on the eve of the Ethiopian\nnew year, in a reiteration of Ethiopia\u2019s previous\ndeclaration of war, its President publicly announced that\nEthiopia would use force to impose its will over disputed\nterritory. That was a blatant repudiation of the OAU\neffort, all of whose documents had been endorsed by the\nUnited Nations and other concerned organizations and\nGovernments.\nThe OAU has given Ethiopia clear and unambiguous\nclarifications in response to its queries and concerns. It is\nalso to be recalled that the OAU had decided, and both\nparties had accepted, that any interpretation of the\ndocuments would be made solely by the OAU and its\n30\n\n\ncurrent Chairman. The OAU and the United Nations have\nalso agreed to become guarantors of the scrupulous\nimplementation of all the provisions of the OAU peace\npackage. Ethiopia\u2019s latest threat of war and its consequent\nrepudiation of its commitment to the OAU peace process,\nwhich is inflexible about the peaceful resolution of the\nconflict, are thus in contempt of the OAU, the United\nNations and the international community. Ethiopia\u2019s refusal\nto accept the technical arrangements until its new set of\npreconditions are met is holding the peace process hostage\nin spite of the clamour of the international community for\nthe acceptance and quick implementation of the peace plan.\nHowever quixotic and unjustifiable it may be, the\nEthiopian Government has declared that it will not accept\nthe technical arrangements until it receives from the OAU\na firm assurance of Ethiopian sovereignty over the disputed\nareas. Obviously, this is a direct contradiction of, and a\nfrontal assault on, the Framework Agreement, whose\nprovisions clearly declare that the\n\u201credeployment will not prejudge the final status of the\narea concerned, which will be determined at the end\nof the delimitation and demarcation of the border and,\nif need be, through an appropriate mechanism of\narbitration\u201d. (S/1998/1223, annex, p. 25)\nSurely, the proposition that a State must a priori be\nawarded full sovereignty over contested territory before the\ndetermination of ownership must distort the norms of\ninternational law and international relations. Ethiopia has\nalso claimed that its decision to use force to control\ncontested areas was taken in self-defence. Such a notion\nrelegates the concept of self-defence to the realm of self-\nhelp.\nIt is not difficult to conclude which party to the\nEritrean-Ethiopian conflict has undertaken to fulfil in good\nfaith its obligations under the OAU peace package and\nwhich party is determined to undermine, by direct or\nindirect aggression, the Charters of the United Nations and\nthe OAU, thereby endangering peace, security, stability and\npeaceful development in our region. It is not difficult to\ndetermine which of the parties is resolved to bring about\nterritorial changes, in clear violation of the OAU and\nUnited Nations Charters, by aggression, coercion,\ninfiltration and subterfuge. A perfunctory analysis of the\nmedia \u2014 particularly the broadcast media \u2014 of both\ncountries will also reveal which of the parties is fanning the\nflames of ethnic hatred and is actively engaged in\npropaganda and in preparation for a new war, thereby\ncommitting a crime against peace. In short, it is very easy\nto identify which of the parties is committed to peace and\nwhich is committed to war and aggression.\nOnce again, war clouds are looming ominously over\nour region. It is now self-evident that the Ethiopian\nGovernment is still determined to pursue a policy\npredicated on violent aggression. By its shrill war\nhysteria, the Government of Ethiopia is making it clear\nthat it is poised to invade our country yet again. It is not\nour wish to fight. The bitter experience of a long war of\nindependence has taught us to dread war. We seek no\nterritorial expansion, and we have no plan to commit\naggression against any other State. We seek to live in\npeaceful cooperation with all our neighbours. Yet if war\nis imposed on us we must \u2014 and will \u2014 fight to\nsafeguard the sovereignty of our country and to preserve\nour dignity as a people. In this connection, Eritrea\nsolemnly declares in this Assembly that the responsibility\nfor any new military engagement will lie with the Addis\nAbaba regime.\nWe have exercised prudence and patience in the face\nof aggression, provocation and crimes committed by the\nGovernment of Ethiopia against our nationals in Ethiopia\nand Eritrea. A State has the duty to protect its nationals\nfrom injury caused by the Government of any State. Yet\nEritrea has hitherto preferred to react with equanimity to\nthe gross and violent violations of the human rights of\nEritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin in the hope of\nsecuring a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\nHowever, there are limits to the misdoings that any\nrespectable State must tolerate. It would be unacceptable\nfor any Government worthy of the trust of its people not\nto defend the State and the people it represents against\naggression. It would be an unthinkable calamity for a\npeople which had fought for so long, endured\nunimaginable hardship and won its independence against\nall odds to lose its rights as a people and a nation to an\naggressor.\nIt is incumbent on those who love freedom and\njustice and respect the equality of peoples, who are\ncommitted to peace and cherish the norms and principles\nof the United Nations, to ensure that law and moral\nprinciples prevail against international lawlessness and\nimmorality.\nEthiopia\u2019s threatened aggression must be a source of\ndeep concern to the international community and\nparticularly to the OAU and the United Nations which\nhave consistently urged both parties to restrain themselves\n31\n\n\nfrom the use or threat of force and to solve the conflict by\npeaceful means.\nTo this end, the international community must insist\nthat both parties recognize and respect each other\u2019s right to\nlive in peace within secure and recognized borders. It is for\nthis reason that Eritrea believes that this Assembly has the\nduty to uphold the decision of the OAU, which has already\nbeen endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, and\ncalls upon the Assembly to denounce Ethiopia\u2019s renewed\npreparation for war against Eritrea and to demand that it\naccept and implement the OAU peace package. Surely, if\nthere is any lesson that must have been learned in the last\n16 months, it is that nothing can be gained, and everything\nmay be lost, by continued warfare.\nTherefore, the Government of Eritrea calls upon the\nUnited Nations and the international community to: first,\ncondemn Ethiopia\u2019s commitment to the use and threat of\nforce; secondly, establish a short time-frame within which\nEthiopia must definitively respond to the peace package;\nthirdly, take timely and appropriate measures for the\nimmediate and unconditional implementation of the OAU\npeace plan in its entirety; and, fourthly, immediately deploy\nan observer mission to identify the aggression in the event\nof renewed conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "In this\nHall today are representatives of wealthy countries and also\nrepresentatives of poor countries, who constitute the\nmajority. There are ministers and ambassadors from\ncountries whose per capita gross domestic product is\n$25,000 dollars, and others who represent countries where\nthat figure is a mere $300 dollars. Moreover, that difference\ngrows year by year.\nThere are representatives of countries that appear to\nhave a promising future. These are the countries with only\n20 per cent of the world's population, but 86 per cent of its\ngross domestic product, 82 per cent of world export\nmarkets, 68 per cent of direct foreign investment, and 74\nper cent of all of the telephone lines on the planet.\nWhat can we say about the future of those whom we\nrepresent here who account for 80 per cent of the world's\npopulation, living in countries that were colonized and\nplundered for centuries to increase the wealth of the former\nmetropolises? It is true that time has passed, and that our\nhistory is what it is and not what we might have wished it\nto be. But must we simply resign ourselves to a future that\nis essentially the same?\nCan we feel reassured knowing that the wealth of the\nthree richest people in the world is greater than the\ncombined gross domestic product of the 48 least developed\ncountries, with their population of 600 million, whose\nrepresentatives are present in this hall today demanding\njustice?\nIn this hall today we have representatives of countries\nwhere most of the population \u2014 which is hardly growing\nat all \u2014 are guaranteed decent living standards and where\nsome live in opulence. These populations spend $12 billion\non perfume and $17 billion on pet food every year.\nBut there is a majority represented in this hall that has\nno reason to feel optimistic. This majority comprises 900\nmillion people who go hungry and 1.3 billion who live in\npoverty. My brothers and sisters here today representing\nAfrica have no reason to feel reassured. They know that\ntoday there are 23 million people on their continent who are\nHIV-positive. They also know that it costs $12,000 to treat\njust one person infected with the virus, which means that it\nwould take almost $300 billion a year for all the AIDS\npatients in Africa to receive the same treatment currently\nprovided to AIDS sufferers in wealthy countries.\nCould my colleagues representing 6 billion of the\nplanet's inhabitants \u2014 to which a further 80 million are\nadded every year, almost all of them in the Third\nWorld \u2014 really think that a situation like this could\ncontinue unchanged into the next century?\nHow can any of us prevent the continued growth in\nthe number of emigrants from poor nations who flock to\nthe wealthy countries in pursuit of a dream, while the\ncurrent world order does not allow them to find the\nconditions for a decent life in their own countries?\nA small number of representatives in this hall\nrepresent countries that have no need to fear a military\nthreat in the coming century. Some even have nuclear\nweapons, belong to a powerful alliance or build up their\narmies every year with better, more sophisticated\nweapons. They are the ones who view the rest of the\nworld as merely the Euro-Atlantic periphery of the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, and therefore they will\nnever have to endure the devastation of massive bombings\nby invisible attackers acting under what has come to be\nknown as a new strategic concept of that aggressive\nmilitary organization.\nBut the vast majority of those of us gathered here\ntoday do not enjoy such security. We are troubled to see\nthat in a world dominated by a single military and\ntechnological Power, we are today less safe than during\nthe difficult years of the cold war.\nIf one day we wished to call upon the Security\nCouncil to discuss a situation that we viewed as a threat\nto one of our poor countries, does the Assembly think\nthat we would be heard? I fear that recent examples have\nproved otherwise.\nWhy is there no discussion in the Assembly about\ngeneral and complete disarmament, including nuclear\ndisarmament? Why is the issue limited to controlling\nsmall arms, which are necessary in a case such as that of\nCuba \u2014 a country attacked and under blockade for 40\nyears? Why is there no mention of the deadly laser-\nguided bombs, the depleted uranium missiles, or the\ncluster or graphite bombs used indiscriminately by the\nUnited States in bombing the civilian populations in\nKosovo?\nCould anyone claim that our children will inherit a\njust and secure world if we do not change the unfair and\nunequal standards that are currently used to measure\nissues of such key importance to our collective security?\n14\n\n\nMust we also accept the imposition of free market\nrules and the sacred law of supply and demand in the brutal\ncommerce of death? What is stopping the international\ncommunity from attempting, in a rational and coordinated\nmanner, to redirect a large part of the $780 billion currently\nused for military expenditures to promoting development in\nthe Third World countries?\nThat is why we so passionately defend respect for the\nprinciples of international law, which have guided relations\namong all of the world's countries for more than half a\ncentury. What would we have left to defend ourselves in\nthe future if we poor countries were no longer able to rely\non such principles as respect for sovereignty and self-\ndetermination, the sovereign equality of all States and non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of other nations? How\ncould we call on the international community to protest a\nthreat against one of our countries if those principles, which\nare today systematically and flagrantly violated, were to be\nstruck from the Charter of the United Nations?\nIn a unipolar world, attempts to impose notions such\nas the limitation of sovereignty, and humanitarian\nintervention, do not advance international security: they\npose a threat to the countries of the Third World, which\nhave neither powerful armies nor nuclear weapons. Such\nattempts must therefore be brought to an end: they violate\nthe letter and the spirit of the Charter.\nAt the same time, we believe it is necessary to defend\nthe United Nations, now more than ever. We defend the\nneed for its existence as much as we do the need to\ndemocratize it. The challenge facing us is that of reforming\nthe United Nations so that it serves the interests of all\nnations equally. We defend both the need for the existence\nof the Security Council and the need to make it more\ninclusive, democratic and transparent. Why not expand the\nnumber of permanent members? Why could not the Council\ninclude at least two or three new permanent members from\nLatin America, Africa and Asia? The membership now is\nthree times the number of countries which founded the\nUnited Nations in San Francisco in 1945, and the vast\nmajority of them \u2014 the Third World countries \u2014 do not\nhave a single permanent member to represent them.\nHowever, we do not defend the right of veto. We do\nnot believe that anyone should have it. But if it is not\npossible to eliminate it, we should at least attempt to ensure\nthat this prerogative is more evenly shared, and provide that\nall new permanent members have the right of veto. Why,\nif the right of veto cannot be eliminated now, is it not\nrestricted to votes on proposed measures under Chapter VII\nof the Charter? As things stand at present, a single\ncountry can override the will of all the other United\nNations Members. And there is one country that has\nexercised its unlimited right to veto an infinite number of\ntimes: the United States. This is untenable.\nAt the United Nations, we must curb the attempt to\nimpose a single way of thinking on us by trying to make\nus believe that it is our way, or that it is superior to our\nrich diversity of cultures and models, or that it is more\nadvanced and modern than our multiplicity of identities.\nTo survive, we must resist being treated as merely the\nEuro-Atlantic periphery and oppose having labelled as\nglobal threats the problems that we face as consequences\nof colonialism: underdevelopment; the consumerism of\nthe wealthy countries; and even the results of their recent\nor current policies.\nHere in this Hall are the representatives of the Group\nof 7, whose countries have 685 million inhabitants and\neconomies with a combined gross domestic product of\n$20 trillion. Also present are the rest of us, who represent\nthe remaining 181 countries, with more than 5 billion\ninhabitants and economies with a combined gross\ndomestic product of barely $10 trillion. Yes, we are all\nequal under the Charter of the United Nations, but not in\nreal life.\nWhile rich countries have the transnational\ncorporations that control over one third of all of the\nworld's exports, we poor countries have the asphyxiating\nburden of external debt, which has risen to the level of $2\ntrillion and continues to grow, devouring almost 25 per\ncent of our export earnings just to service our debt. How\ncan development be possible under these conditions?\nWhile we speak insistently in this Hall of the need for a\nnew international financial architecture, our countries are\nbeing buffeted by the scourge of a system that allows the\ndaily occurrence of speculative transactions worth $3\ntrillion. That structure cannot be fixed; it is not a matter\nof remodelling it, but rather of demolishing it and\nrebuilding it anew.\nCan anyone explain the logic of this phantom\neconomy that produces nothing and is sustained by\nbuying and selling things that do not exist? Should we or\nshould we not demolish this chaotic financial system and\nbuild upon its ruins a system that favours production,\ntakes differences into account and stops forcing our\nbattered economies to endlessly pursue the impossible\nillusion of increasing financial reserves? Sooner or later,\nthose reserves evaporate in the course of the desperate\n15\n\n\nand unfair battle to defend our currencies from the strong\nand highly favoured currency of the anachronistic Bretton\nWoods accord, the sacrosanct dollar.\nWhen the history of these years is written, it will be\nvery difficult to explain how a single country was able to\naccumulate so many privileges and such absolute power.\nWhat will the economists of the next century say when they\nrealize that the United States was able to live with a current\naccount deficit that is already about $300 billion without\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) having imposed\neven one of the severe adjustment programmes that are\nimpoverishing the countries of the third world?\nWho will explain the fact that, thanks to the privilege\nof having the world's reserve currency, the Americans, save\nless and spend more than anyone else in the world? Will\nanyone tell them that in 1998 they were able to import\n$124 billion worth of cars and spend $8 billion in\ncosmetics, thanks in good measure to the fact that they\ncontrolled 17.8 per cent of the votes of the International\nMonetary Fund, which gives them a virtual right of veto?\nHow can we explain to the people of Tanzania, for\nexample, that while all of this was happening they had to\nspend nine times as much on servicing the foreign debt\nthan on primary health care, and four times as much as on\nprimary education?\nThe current international economic system is not only\nprofoundly unjust, but also absolutely unsustainable. An\neconomic system that destroys the environment cannot be\nsustained. The world's supply of drinking water today is 60\nper cent of what it was in 1970; and today there are 2.3\nbillion more human beings on the planet than there were\nback then. The same is happening with our forests. Could\nanyone in this Hall defend the proposition that such a pace\nof destruction can go on indefinitely?\nAn economic system based on the irrational\nconsumption patterns of the rich countries, which are later\nexported to our own countries through the mass media,\ncannot be sustained. Why not accept that it is possible to\nprovide a decent life to all the people of the planet with the\nresources that are within our reach and the degree of\ntechnological development we have achieved, through a\nrational and solidarity-based exploitation of all this\npotential?\nHow will they explain that the member countries of\nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment, whose representatives I now address with all\ndue respect, have fallen so far behind as to provide less\nthan one third of their 1970 commitment to dedicate a\nminimum of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product\nto official development assistance?\nI asked a member of our delegation, a Deputy in our\nNational Assembly and a professed Christian, what the\nBible would say about such an unjust economic order. He\nresponded quickly with the words of a Prophet from the\nHoly Book:\n\u201cWoe unto them that decree unrighteous\ndecrees, and that write grievousness which they have\nprescribed;\nTo turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take\naway the right from the poor of my people, that\nwidows may be their prey, and that they may rob\nthe fatherless!\nAnd what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in\nthe desolation which shall come from afar? to whom\nwill ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your\nglory?\u201d (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 10: 1-3)\nI know that many people in this Hall share these\nconcerns, and I also know that almost all of us are asking\nourselves the same question. Can the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) be spared from becoming a fiefdom\nof the United States and its allies, as the International\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank are today? Will we\ntruly succeed in making the World Trade Organization the\ndemocratic and transparent forum we need, or will the\npowerful interests of a minority be imposed to the\ndetriment of the silent majority, which is too divided,\nconfused and unsuspecting to understand the dangers of\na cold and dogmatic liberalization of world trade? Will\nthey remember that the vast majority of third world\ncountries, dependent on the export of a single agricultural\nproduct or a few spices, will be wiped out of world trade\nand crushed by the fierce competition of a few\ntransnational corporations? Should we or should we not\ntake these realities into account and accept the need to\nprotect the interests of the underdeveloped countries, if\nonly to guarantee their very survival?\nHow will we poor countries be able to compete if\nour professionals leave for the wealthy nations in pursuit\nof better opportunities; if we are not even allowed to keep\nour athletes and we must watch with sorrow as they\ncompete under another country's flag? How will we poor\nnations be able to compete economically if the 10 most\n16\n\n\ndeveloped countries control 95 per cent of the patents\nissued in the last 20 years, and intellectual property, far\nfrom being liberalized, is ever more closely protected?\nTalking to us poor countries about trade through the\nInternet is almost a joke, when we know that 91 per cent of\nInternet users live in the member countries of the\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nWill we ever see a change in the current situation, in which\nthere are over 600 telephone lines for every 1,000 people\nin the United States, Sweden and Switzerland, yet only 1\ntelephone per 1,000 people in Cambodia, Chad and\nAfghanistan?\nAs part of this tragic depiction of the situation facing\nthe vast majority of countries in the world, I feel bound to\ntalk about my own country. The situation in Cuba is an\neloquent example, if ever there was one, of what should not\nbe done in terms of relations between powerful and small\nnations.\nFor more than 40 years, my people have been\nsubjected to a brutal policy of hostility and all kinds of\naggression imposed by the United States. High-level\nauthorities in that country have openly admitted that this\npolicy is aimed at destroying the political and economic\nsystem built by the Cuban people of their own free will and\nat restoring the neo-colonial power that the United States\nheld over Cuba and definitively lost on 1 January 1959,\nwith the triumph of the Cuban revolution.\nAs has been made clear by events, public statements\nby American spokespersons and by declassified secret\nUnited States documents, this policy of aggression has been\ncarried out through means that have ranged from political\nand diplomatic measures, propaganda campaigns, espionage\nand subversion, and fostering defection and illegal\nemigration, to acts of terrorism, sabotage and biological\nwarfare. This policy has also included the organization and\nsupport of armed groups; air and naval raids against our\nterritory; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the\nleader of our revolution; a military invasion by a mercenary\narmy; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear\nconflict, in October 1962; and finally, a brutal commercial\nand financial blockade and a ferocious economic war\nagainst my country that have now lasted 40 years.\nLet me set aside the economic aspects of this\naggression against Cuba and deal solely with the physical\naggression and acts of war carried out by the United States\nGovernment. Recently Cuban social organizations, on\nbehalf of the entire population of Cuba, filed a civil lawsuit\nagainst the United States Administration claiming\nreparation and compensation for loss and damages\nresulting from the deaths of 3,478 Cuban citizens and for\na further 2,099 survivors who have been left disabled as\na consequence of the covert plots and the \u201cdirty war\u201d\nwaged by the United States. The suit demands that the\nUnited States Government, which is responsible for these\nhuman losses and injuries, be sentenced to pay a total of\n$181.1 billion in reparation as a minimum symbolic\ncompensation for the loss of something that is clearly\nirreplaceable and priceless: the lives and physical well-\nbeing of the more than 5,500 Cuban citizens who have\nbeen victims of the United States' obsessive policy against\nCuba.\nAt the open and public trial, televised nationwide, at\nwhich this claim was considered, it was clearly proved\nthat the United States Government was directly\nresponsible for this continued aggression, and that the\nundeclared war against Cuba had constituted an official\nState policy enforced by no fewer than nine successive\nUnited States Administrations over the last 40 years.\nWhat will they tell their grandchildren, these leaders,\nofficials and agents of the United States Government\nwhose consciences are weighed down by the guilt of\nplanning and carrying out this \u201cdirty war\u201d against Cuba\nand by the moral burden of responsibility for the death of\nthousands of Cubans?\nCan we possibly allow an international system to\ncontinue into the next century that accords total impunity\nfor monstrous actions such as these, which have been\nsystematically and flagrantly perpetrated by a major\nPower?\nThe ferocious economic blockade that extends to\nevery facet of our country's foreign trade and financial\nrelations merits particular attention. This blockade, which\nhas lasted over 40 years, began to develop before the\ntriumph of the revolution. A secret United States\ndocument, declassified in 1991, reveals that on 23\nDecember 1958, at a National Security Council meeting\nattended by President Dwight Eisenhower at which the\nsituation in Cuba was discussed, the then-Director of the\nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA), Allen Dulles,\ncategorically stated: \u201cWe must prevent a Castro victory\u201d.\nThree days later, on 26 December, President\nEisenhower instructed the CIA that he did not wish the\nspecifics of covert operations against Cuba to be\n17\n\n\npresented to the National Security Council. Everything had\nto be kept strictly secret.\nThe sudden and overwhelming triumph of the\nrevolutionary forces six days later did not give them time\nto prevent a Castro victory. The first United States assault\non the national economy took place on 1 January 1959,\nwhen those who had looted the public treasury fled for the\nUnited States, together with the perpetrators of the worst\nmassacres and abuses against the Cuban people.\nFive weeks after the triumph of the revolution,\neconomist Felipe Pazos, a professional man \u2014 well known\nand respected in United States Government circles \u2014 who\nhad been appointed by the revolutionary Government to\ntake over the management of the Cuban National Bank,\nannounced on 6 February that the former regime had\nembezzled or seized $424 million from the gold and dollar\nreserves that backed the Cuban peso. The New York Times\nsubsequently corroborated the report's claim concerning the\ntheft of the funds, which constituted the country's only\nreserves.\nThe spoils of this colossal theft ended up in United\nStates banks. Not a dime was returned to Cuba. The\nNational Bank immediately requested a modest quantity of\nfunds to deal with this highly critical situation. That request\nwas turned down.\nThe Agrarian Reform Act, enacted on 17 May 1959,\nwas aimed at providing food for the vast majority of our\nundernourished people and direct or indirect employment\nfor the large percentage of the population that was then\nunemployed. It was enacted when the word socialism had\nnot yet been spoken in Cuba; however, it provoked an\nextreme reaction in the United States, whose companies\nowned much of the best and most fertile land in Cuba.\nCuba's willingness, stipulated in the Act itself, to provide\nthe owners with deferred compensation paid out in\nreasonable and workable instalments was met with an\nimmediate demand from the United States Government for\nprompt, effective and full cash compensation. There was\nnothing in the public coffers with which to meet this\ndemand.\nA month later, on 24 June, at a meeting called by the\nState Department to consider options for action against\nCuba, the view was put forth that the United States should\ntake a very strong stance forthwith against the Act and its\nimplementation, and that the best way to achieve the\nnecessary results was through economic pressure. The\nelimination of the Cuban sugar cane quota from the United\nStates market was proposed. According to a declassified\ndocument, this would cause the sugar industry to suffer\nan abrupt and immediate decline, causing widespread\nhigher unemployment; the large numbers of people\nthereby forced out of work would begin to go hungry. At\nthat same meeting, Secretary of State Herter explicitly\ndescribed these proposals as measures of economic\nwarfare.\nIn a memorandum dated 6 April 1960, Mr. L. D.\nMallory, a senior State Department official, stated that:\n\u201cThe only foreseeable means of alienating internal\nsupport is through disenchantment and disaffection\nbased on economic dissatisfaction and hardship ...\nevery possible means should be undertaken promptly\nto weaken the economic life of Cuba\u201d.\nHe suggested taking:\n\u201c... a line of action which ... makes the greatest\ninroads in denying money and supplies to Cuba, to\ndecrease monetary and real wages, to bring about\nhunger, desperation and the overthrow of the\nGovernment.\u201d\nOn 6 July of that same year, the United States\nadopted one of the measures proposed: the elimination of\nthe Cuban sugar quota. Never again would the United\nStates buy a single pound of sugar from Cuba. A market\nthat was established over the course of more than 100\nyears between the United States and Cuba, with Cuba\nguaranteeing the supply of this essential food product to\nthe United States and its allies during the first half of the\ncentury, including during the two World Wars from which\nthe United States emerged as the wealthiest, most\npowerful nation in the world, was wiped out in a second,\ndealing a cruel blow to the country's major source of\nemployment and wealth and depriving it of essential\nfunds for the food, medicine, fuel and raw materials\nneeded to ensure the material survival of our people.\nFrom that time on, successive economic measures\nagainst the Cuban people continued to accumulate until\nthey formed a absolute and total blockade, which went so\nfar as to prevent Cuba from importing even an aspirin\nproduced in the United States, or from exporting to that\ncountry a single flower grown in Cuba.\nThis complete blockade, cynically referred to in\nofficial terminology with the euphemistic and apparently\ninnocuous word \u201cembargo\u201d, has continued to intensify\n18\n\n\nover the past 40 years. At the most critical and difficult\ntime in our history, when the Union of Soviet Socialist\nRepublics and the socialist bloc collapsed, and with them\nthe basic markets and sources of supply that the country\ncould count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfare\nwaged against an island only 90 miles from the United\nStates coast, they decided to be yet more unyielding in their\napproach to Cuba: with truly vulgar and repugnant\nopportunism, the blockade was intensified to the maximum.\nThe so-called Torricelli Act of 1992, among other\nrestrictive measures that greatly affected the maritime\ntransport of food and other commodities between Cuba and\nthe rest of the world, prohibited United States subsidiaries\nbased in third countries from trading with Cuba. This put\nan end to commercial operations that amounted to over\n$700 million in imports of foodstuffs and medicines from\nthose countries. This genocidal policy reached even more\ninfamous heights with the Helms-Burton Act, which\ncodified all previous administrative restrictions, expanded\nand tightened the blockade and established it in perpetuity.\nSubsequent to the passage of that law, and with the\naim of tightening even further the blockade against the\nCuban people, numerous amendments, introduced into bills\nof such urgency and length that many United States\nlawmakers did not even have time to read them, were\nadopted by show of hands in the United States Congress.\nThe Cuban-American terrorist mafia, which is closely\nlinked to the extreme right wing, has achieved its goal of\nchanging the blockade from an order from the executive\ninto rigorous and inflexible legislation. The genocide\nthereby became institutionalized.\nFollowing a 1997 study of the consequences of the\nblockade for health, the American Association for World\nHealth concluded that it violates the most basic\ninternational agreements and conventions governing human\nrights standards, including the United Nations Charter, the\nCharter of the Organization of American States and the\nGeneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian\nPersons in time of War. The Geneva Conventions, to which\nsome 165 countries, including the United States, are parties,\nrequire the free passage of all medical supplies and\nfoodstuffs intended for civilian use in time of war. The\nUnited States and Cuba are not at war. Indeed, their\nGovernments have even maintain diplomatic representation\nin Havana and Washington. However, the American\nAssociation for World Health has determined that the\nembargo's restrictions are a deliberate blockade of the\nCuban population's access to food and medicine in\npeacetime.\nIn the same report, the American Association for\nWorld Health expresses its belief that the United States\nembargo against Cuba has dramatically harmed the health\nand nutrition of a large number of ordinary Cuban\ncitizens and concludes that the embargo has significantly\nincreased suffering in Cuba, to the point of causing death.\nFor seven consecutive years, the Assembly has\nconsistently adopted a resolution on the need to end the\neconomic blockade imposed by the Government of the\nUnited States of America on the Cuban people. The\ncondemnation of that genocidal policy has visibly grown\nfrom year to year: year on year between 1992 and 1998,\nthe Cuban resolution against the blockade received 59, 88,\n101, 117, 137, 143 and 157 votes in favour, while the\nUnited States obtained only 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3 and 2 votes,\nincluding its own. Given the absolute contempt\ndemonstrated by the United States with regard to these\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, the people of Cuba have\ndecided, independently of the battle taking place in this\nAssembly, to resort to the legal procedures to which they\nare entitled in order to demand the appropriate sanctions\nagainst those responsible for such acts of genocide.\nCuba's initiative is based on a solid and irrefutable\nlegal foundation. The Convention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide was adopted by the\nAssembly on 9 December 1948 and signed by the\nGovernment of the United States of America on 11\nDecember 1948 and by the Republic of Cuba on 28\nDecember 1949. It entered into force on 12 January 1951\nand has been signed and ratified by 124 States. Article II\nof that Convention reads:\n\u201cIn the present Convention, genocide means any of\nthe following acts committed with intent to destroy,\nin whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or\nreligious group\u201d.\nIn subparagraph (c), it immediately goes on to\ninclude, among these acts,\n\u201cDeliberately inflicting on the group conditions\nof life calculated to bring about its physical\ndestruction in whole or in part\u201d.\nArticle III stipulates that the following acts, among\nothers, shall be punishable: \u201c(a) Genocide; ... (d) Attempt\nto commit genocide; (e) Complicity in genocide\u201d. It\nexplicitly states in article IV that\n19\n\n\n\u201cPersons committing genocide or any of the other\nacts enumerated in article III shall be punished,\nwhether they are constitutionally responsible rulers,\npublic officials or private individuals\u201d.\nThe Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of\nCivilian Persons in Time of War was signed on 12 August\n1949, and was ratified by the Governments of the United\nStates and Cuba; it entered into force on 21 October 1950.\nA total of 188 States are currently parties to the\nConvention. Article 23 decrees that\n\u201cEach High Contracting Party shall allow the free\npassage of all consignments of medical and hospital\nstores and objects necessary for religious worship\nintended only for civilians of another High\nContracting Party, even if the latter is its adversary. It\nshall likewise permit the free passage of all\nconsignments of essential foodstuffs, clothing and\ntonics intended for children under fifteen, expectant\nmothers and maternity cases\u201d.\nThe first Protocol Additional to that Convention\nspecifically, precisely and categorically stipulates, in its\narticle 54, entitled \u201cProtection of objects indispensable to\nthe survival of the civilian population\u201d, that\n\u201c1. Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare\nis prohibited.\n\u201c2. It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or\nrender useless objects indispensable to the survival of\nthe civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural\nareas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock,\ndrinking water installations and supplies and irrigation\nworks, for the specific purpose of denying them for\ntheir sustenance value to the civilian population or to\nthe adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in\norder to starve out civilians, to cause them to move\naway, or for any other motive\u201d.\nArticle VII of the 1948 Convention on genocide states,\nwithout room for the slightest doubt, that\n\u201cPersons charged with genocide or any of the\nother acts enumerated in article III shall be tried by a\ncompetent tribunal of the State in the territory of\nwhich the act was committed\u201d.\nSubparagraph (e) of article III of that Convention\nstipulates with the same precision that accomplices to\ngenocide shall also be punished.\nAs a consequence, the National Assembly of\nPeople's Power of the Republic of Cuba declared on 13\nSeptember 1999: first, that the economic blockade\nimposed on Cuba by the Government of the United States\nconstitutes an international crime of genocide in\naccordance with the definition stipulated in the\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the\nCrime of Genocide, adopted by the General Assembly on\n9 December 1948; second, that, on the basis of the\narguments put forward and of the foregoing statement, it\nproclaims Cuba's right to demand that such acts be\npunished; third, that as a result of the grave, systematic\nand ongoing genocide carried out over the course of 40\nyears against the people of Cuba, and in accordance with\ninternational standards, principles, agreements and laws,\nCuban courts have the right to try and punish the guilty\nparties, whether they be present or absent; fourth, that\nacts of genocide and other war crimes are not subject to\nany statute of limitations; fifth, that the guilty parties can\nbe punished even with a sentence of life imprisonment;\nsixth, that criminal responsibility does not exempt the\naggressor State from providing material compensation for\nthe human and economic damage it may have caused; and\nseventh, that it calls on the international community for\nsupport in this struggle to defend the most elementary\nprinciples of justice, the right to life, peace and the\nfreedom of all peoples.\nHere in this Hall today, as members of the Cuban\ndelegation to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession, there are three young Cubans representing our\ncountry's university students, secondary-school students,\nand children and adolescents. They are here on behalf of\nthe social organizations that went before the relevant\ncourts to file the claim against the United States\nGovernment, demanding reparations and compensation for\nthe damages and injuries suffered by thousands of people.\nThose same organizations also took the legal initiative of\nproposing to the National Assembly of People's Power the\nproclamation I have just cited.\nHere with us as well are three outstanding\npersonalities in Cuban medicine, Deputies in the National\nAssembly, who have testified before that body on the\ntragic harm that has resulted from the blockade on\nmedicines imposed against our country. There are also\nthree Christian deputies, whose profound ethical, religious\nand human convictions led them to support the\nproclamation made in our National Assembly demanding\nthe trial and punishment of the guilty parties.\n20\n\n\nThese individuals are prepared to respond, here in the\nUnited States, to any questions posed to them, or to meet\nwith the press, academic institutions, non-governmental\norganizations, legislators, senators or even any committee\nof the United States Congress. We are prepared not only to\nmake accusations, but also to engage in debate and prove\nthe facts that support them.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to\nexpress my pleasure at your recent election, Mr. President.\nI also wish to acknowledge the work of your illustrious\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti. The Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, also deserves acknowledgement for his\nuntiring efforts to ensure that peace and security govern\ninternational relations in this turbulent world in which we\nlive, always showing sensitivity and a very special concern\nfor those who suffer the most, have the least, and therefore\nneed the greatest care.\nAlmost a year ago, Central America was tragically\nstruck by one of the most terrible hurricanes of the century.\nOur country, Honduras, was the most severely damaged,\nwith billions of dollars in losses resulting from the\ndestruction of more than 70 per cent of its infrastructure\nand economy. More than 15,000 people were killed,\ninjured or went missing and more than 1.5 million\nsuffered losses, either directly or indirectly, a high\npercentage of whom lost their homes, belongings and\nbusinesses in their entirety.\nThose unfortunate circumstances through which we\nhad to live, the consequences of which we have only just\nbegun to recover from, have been aggravated in recent\nweeks by the severity of the winter and high levels of\nprecipitation. Once again, the banks of our country\u2019s main\nrivers have overflowed, as it was not possible to dredge\nthem because of lack of time and resources. This is again\njeopardizing the safety of numerous population centres\nand cities, causing more flooding and mudslides and\nblocking the country\u2019s main transportation arteries. This\nhas brought further insecurity and anguish to our\npopulation, adding new losses and difficulties to the\nalready grave state of affairs we have faced since last\nOctober.\nHurricane Mitch and other natural phenomena of\nuncommon violence lay bare the physical vulnerability of\nour countries and highlight the absolute necessity of early\nand organized preventive measures. Such preventive\nmeasures can be achieved at the national, regional,\ncontinental and, indeed, global levels only through\ncombined, joint efforts and resources. No country, much\nless a country that is poor in material resources, is up to\nthe task of bearing the massive destructive power of these\n\n\n\n\nphenomena alone. This is a huge new challenge for the\nUnited Nations, whose diligent attention to this matter we\ntake this opportunity to request, knowing that it stands to\nsave thousands upon thousands of lives, spare us enormous\ndamage, and deflect immense ills.\nWe, the Honduran people, have always valued the\nworld\u2019s solidarity, for which we are most grateful, and have\nalso learned that brotherhood among men and among\nnations is a value that we must not lose. On the contrary,\nwe must revitalize, strengthen and disseminate it, especially\nnow that globalization and high-speed communications are\ndrawing States and continents closer together, making it\npossible for one nation instantly to feel the pain that afflicts\nanother as if it affected us all directly.\nMore than neighbours, we must be brethren. Beyond\ncooperation, we must sow the seeds of brotherhood.\nSolidarity is a fine thing, but brotherhood is stronger and\nmore human, because it breathes from the depth of our\nhearts that divine, universal breath of life with which God\nendows each and every one of his creatures so that we\nshould be equal and enjoy the planet\u2019s wealth as equals.\nSince its founding in 1945, the United Nations has\nplayed a preeminent role in the life of our planet. The 50\nnations that met at San Francisco, California, among which\nthe Honduran people were honoured to count ourselves, and\nthat signed the United Nations Charter, have increased in\nnumber over the years. Some have changed, while others\nhave disappeared as multinational or federated structures.\nTherefore, the challenges that the next century will place\nbefore the United Nations are new, even greater challenges,\nand most likely will be even more difficult and will arise\never more frequently.\nThe growing victories of human rights; the accelerated\nexpansion of democracy as a system of governance and\ncoexistence among peoples; the rights of women and\nchildren, and the imperative to protect both against abuse,\ndiscrimination and violence: these are matters that challenge\nthe creative imagination of the world\u2019s peoples and\nGovernments. They are paradigms for a new millennium,\nwhose portals we approach with a watchful mind and a\nhopeful heart.\nPeace; the environment; population growth; the\nabandonment of the fields and the forced, chaotic\nurbanization of our cities \u2014 which have thus become\nruralized; issues of food; the vast differences between a\nsmall cluster of rich nations and an immense universe of\nnations that are in a permanent process of pauperization;\nand the eradication of weapons of mass destruction: these\nare but a few of the topics that transcend the boundaries\nof the centuries. These issues demand new approaches\nand solutions formulated in the light of the experiences\nthat this waning century leaves us.\nNow, when the end of the twentieth century enables\nus to be exceptionally privileged witnesses to a change of\nmillennium, is a time for reflection, so that we may\nharvest the century\u2019s finest fruits and bear them across the\nbridge between the centuries. However, we must not carry\nto the other frontier of time those things that in this\ncentury have produced the great disasters of war and\nagonizing tensions on the international scene; nor must\nwe hold on to those that have segregated peoples and\ndismembered entire States or that have spawned the\nmarginalization and exclusion that still torment a large\npart of humanity.\nIt is of the utmost necessity, then, that fraternity\nshould return to its rightful place in the triangle of liberal\nprinciples, the very ideals that gave birth to the rule of\nlaw and the concept of constitutionality, to harmony and\nequality among individuals and among nations, thus\nshaping democratic States and the paradigm of human\nfreedom as the basis of the existence of humankind, its\nvery raison d\u2019\u00eatre on this planet.\nWe say that the elder siblings among the community\nof nations must adopt the concept of fraternity as a\nprinciple and a guiding ethic for international coexistence\nwith their brethren, so that together \u2014 without exclusion,\nwithout the yawning chasms that separate the great from\nthe small, the wealthy from the impoverished \u2014 we may\nall cross to the other side of the millennium with a new\noutlook of justice, opportunity and hope, for the sake of\nall that we are as the human race, and for the sake of all\nthe efforts, sacrifices and suffering expended in our\nattempts to dodge the blows of economic disparity and\nunjust treatment in finance and markets. Yet we have\nremained steadfast, and continue to do so through titanic\nefforts and countless sacrifices, to avoid being left behind\nby development, cultural trends and the scientific and\ntechnological benefits of transportation and\ncommunications. We have struggled for all of this while\ngiving our heroes and martyrs to the cause of freedom;\nwe stretch as far as we can to develop democratic rule in\nour States. We struggle each and every day to make\ndemocratic rule able to govern, credible, hope-inspiring\nand trustworthy in the eyes and hearts of the many who\ndo not always have the patience to wait until the benefits\n2\n\n\nof the system materialize, who despair and grow weary of\ndreaming dreams that are difficult to attain.\nFor democracy to survive the times and to justify the\nhigh price that we have paid for it, it must respond to the\nconcerns and aspirations of peoples. Protecting against\nregression in what so many have paid dearly to achieve;\npreserving the advances we have made; and finding a way\nto ensure that there will respond in a positive way for the\nbenefit of peoples: these are the greatest challenges that we\ncarry with us as we meet the coming millennium.\nCentral Americans have learned, through bitter\nexperience and a painful toll of blood and sacrifice, that\nfraternity is a higher value than mere neighbourliness, that\ncooperation and understanding yield better fruit for us than\npast rivalries and local nationalisms and that there is no\ndifference, however serious it may appear, that we cannot\nresolve in a peaceful, harmonious and civilized manner.\nA few days ago the presidents of El Salvador and\nHonduras set a beautiful example for the continent and the\nworld when they ratified the Convention on Nationality and\nAcquired Rights which covers the inhabitants of the areas\ndelimited by the Judgment of 11 September 1992 of the\nInternational Court of Justice in the land, island and\nmaritime frontier dispute between El Salvador and\nHonduras. With this action, we have resolved, definitively\nand in perpetuity, the frontier dispute which for many years\ncast a pall over our fraternal relations.\nThe Central American bloc is today working towards\naccess to the United States market under conditions as\nadvantageous as those already enjoyed by other partners to\nour north; also, as a region we are seeking to open up the\nfield for ourselves in trade throughout the continent through\nagreements with other existing blocs and with individual\nnations, including Mexico and countries of South America.\nCentral America is preparing to cross the bridge\nbetween the millennia with all its republics more integrated\nwith each other than ever before, identifying with each\nother in the common ideal of keeping ourselves united so\nthat we are stronger, of playing a stellar role in the\nAmerican continent, of turning the isthmus into a point of\nstrategic convergence for world trade, and of writing\nourselves into a success story that will serve as an example\nand touchstone to the world community.\nThe globalization process, which has accelerated over\nthe last decade, will continue to expand, creating challenges\nand chances, problems and opportunities. The dizzying\nflows of capital which in a single day can wreak\ncatastrophic collapse on the economies of entire countries\nand regions must surely merit special attention from this\nOrganization. Our peoples fail to understand why they\nshould be affected by breakdowns in the financial system\narising out of risk-taking and speculative flows in regions\nof the world that are remote, alien and even unknown to\nthem. We are affected by them although we play no part\nin them and are not to blame for them, yet they raise the\nprices of our staples, rob us of development opportunities,\nimpoverish us even further and make life harder for us.\nGlobalization ought to be an experience that generates\nbroader possibilities and greater opportunities for all\ncountries and for all people, not greater imbalances and\ninequalities.\nIn stark contrast to the elimination of customs and\nborder posts and to equal access to markets stands the\nneed to reinforce the identity of ethnic groups, nations,\ncountries and regions. Cultural diversity is a source of\nlegitimate pride, and of wealth, creativity and global\ncomplementarity. Automation of mass production cannot\nand should not make human behaviour, the most precious\nresource on our planet, automatic. Homogenizing the\nworld\u2019s cultural diversity, by whatever means, would be\nas serious and unthinkable as eliminating the planet\u2019s\nbiodiversity.\nThe world\u2019s age-old desire for a new world order\nbased on peace, cooperation and fraternity between all\ncountries rather than on a balance of arms between\npowerful and hegemonic States has already come to pass.\nAlthough there are still some local problems, and\nalthough some old nationalisms are once again raising the\nflag, the world is generally a much more peaceful and\nstable place than it was 100 years ago. Although small\ngroups of terrorists are still rattling various countries in\nthe old world and the new, the truth is that, broadly\nspeaking, we live in a world which is more peaceful \u2014\nthank God \u2014 than the one our forebears knew. That is\nwhy we must indeed acknowledge that, despite all its\nimperfections, the world has brought in a new world\norder at the end of this century and the dawn of the new,\nan order led by the United Nations.\nIn this new world order which we are seeing at the\nend of the second millennium, there is no more room for\nthe struggle left us by the Cold War, much less for\nEurope\u2019s various hegemonies of the past three centuries.\nNor is there any possibility that one State alone can\ndominate the rest, as neither the human capacity nor the\nmaterial resources exist to do so. Rather than the balance\n3\n\n\nof compulsion upon which the politics of coexistence\nbetween the world\u2019s strongest States was based, what\npredominates now is multiple independence,\ncomplementarity between States and international\ncooperation and, of course, teamwork as much in the quest\nfor peace as in coping with civilian crises and natural\ndisasters.\nEven a superficial look at events north and south, east\nand west gives us an inkling that peace, international trade\nand the fact that States now have no choice but to\ncooperate with each other have levelled the playing field in\ninternational relations: on the world stage, it is now not so\nmuch a State\u2019s economic clout or military capability that\ndetermine whether its voice is heard in the debate but rather\nits moral force, and especially its democratic values and its\nideals in terms of protecting human rights. In our specific\ncontext here, there are no more big States and small States,\njust members of the world community whether committed\nor not to the common task of making Planet Earth a real\nand effective place for human happiness for everyone\nwithout exception.\nWith this in mind Honduras, together with the other\nrepresentatives of this great community, the United Nations,\ncelebrates the new world order in which all of us are\nneeded and are even indispensable to maintaining and\ndeveloping it. A crisis between one State and another, or\nany internal difficulties arising out of conflicts rooted in\ninequity or because of nationalist, racial or religious\ndemands, are no longer matters to be shrugged off.\nOn the contrary, today, with the globalized view of the\nEarth, each State assumes responsibility for its own\nprotection, not merely for its own sake, but because in that\nway it guarantees the life and happiness of humankind for\ncenturies to come.\nDifficulties such as those in East Timor, the crisis in\nKosovo, the increasing nuclearization of the Indian\nsubcontinent or the rise in terrorism in Colombia and\nRussia are issues that concern us all. Although not all\ncountries participate in each peacekeeping and humanitarian\nmission, there is a disposition and openness in each and\nevery one of their inhabitants to respond to the calls for\ninternational solidarity, whose strongest voice is that of the\nUnited Nations, and especially that of its Secretary-General.\nIn the Sahara, for several years now Honduran soldiers\nhave participated in peacekeeping missions under United\nNations command. We are sure that, like us, no other\ncountry skimps when it comes to offering cooperation and\nmaking sacrifices.\nBoth the intervention of the Security Council in the\nKosovo conflict just recently and the organization of an\ninternational peacekeeping force for East Timor illustrate\nthe efficacy of this system, which makes all of us\nbrethren, neighbours, friends and partners.\nIt is undeniable that, even as the world has changed\nand with obvious respect among all States, the United\nNations still operates using the mechanisms that were\nestablished at its founding in 1945. The limited number\nof Member States on the Security Council leaves out\nother States that, because of their contribution to the\ndevelopment of the world, should participate in the high-\nlevel decisions of that important organism of our\nOrganization.\nLikewise, we believe it is time to provide\nalternatives so that the veto power enjoyed by certain\nStates is limited to certain matters and certain\ncircumstances, and so that the mere protection of private\ninterests does not have excessive influence or provide\njustification for aggressions directed at the rest of the\nworld community. To end the practice whereby the veto\nserves as the Organization's last word should be a goal to\nwhich all of the States represented here dedicate ample\ntime and consideration.\nThe incorporation of three new Members into this\nOrganization fills us with joy and hope, while inspiring\nconfidence that the Organization will treat the Republic of\nChina in the same manner \u2014 that, as Taiwan expects, the\nnew world order will be reflected in greater respect for\nthe rights and values of Taiwan's inhabitants, including\nrenewed respect for its aspirations to participate fully in\nthe greatest human organization on Earth. I do not wish\nto miss this opportunity to express the solidarity of the\npeople of Honduras and of all Central America with the\npeople of Taiwan as they suffer the terrible misfortune\nthat is afflicting that sister region of the world.\nTo summarize, with regard to the new world order,\nwhich we hope will prevail in this global forum,\nHonduras supports broader representation of the peoples\nand the nations of the world, and a more just and\nbalanced representation in the discussions and decisions\nof the United Nations.\nAlmost a year ago, my country was lashed by the\nmost fearsome and destructive hurricane in history. Along\nwith causing suffering among a noble and stoical people,\nthe tragedy made evident the sensitivity and diligence of\ninternational cooperation and fraternity. Marked by\n4\n\n\nauthentic sincerity and dedication to the highest values of\nbrotherhood, in which we profoundly believe, messages of\nconcern poured in from all over the world, along with\nassistance, which continues to flow, enabling the people and\nGovernment to reconstruct what the hurricane wrecked.\nThanks to that fraternity, we have moved forward in\nthe process of rehabilitation and reconstruction and created\na foundation for the transformation of Honduras \u2014 and the\nsame applies to Central America. I hereby declare that we,\nthe people of Honduras \u2014 with the tears from this recent\nand painful event still fresh, and while facing a new round\nof anguish \u2014 are back on our feet, brimming with the\nvibrant spirit of utmost hope, ready to become a success\nstory in this world, to convert tragedy into opportunity.\nRegarding the cooperation that most of the countries\npresent here have offered and continue to offer us, we take\nthis occasion, on behalf of the Honduran people and the\nGovernment over which I preside by the sovereign will of\nits citizens, to extend our most heartfelt gratitude to all, and\nlikewise to confirm before the Assembly Honduras's desire\nto reciprocate \u2014 in a way that is commensurate with the\ngreatness of its heart and the legitimacy of its democratic\ninstitutions \u2014 for all that the world has with such deep\naffection provided us in our time of trouble.\nAll I would add is our most respectful request that\ncooperating institutions and nations expedite the resources\nand projects that they have committed to Honduras's\nreconstruction, which we urgently require now more than\never.\nOn this occasion our country, never forgetting that it\nis a founding Member of the United Nations, calls for a\nreform of our Organization so that a new order, based on\nworldwide cooperation and fraternity, can guarantee for all\nof us that the Earth was created not for the strongest and\nthe most powerful, but for all human beings.\nMay God bless all nations. May God illuminate us all.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

At the same time, I would like to express my\nappreciation of and respect for the President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session, Mr. Didier\nOpertti, for the results achieved during his presidency.\nLet me also express my deep respect for Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, for his excellent leadership of the\nOrganization. I wish to assure him that the Republic of\nMacedonia is ready to continue to closely cooperate with\nhim.\nThe Republic of Macedonia welcomes the admission\nof the new Members \u2014 the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga \u2014 and\nwishes them success in their contribution to United\nNations activities, and at the same time expresses its\n41\n\n\nreadiness to establish diplomatic relations with them. Also,\nI hope that we shall continue the process of establishing\ndiplomatic relations between the Republic of Macedonia \u2014\nof course, using the constitutional name \u2014 and Member\nStates with which we have not yet done so.\nOn this occasion, I would like to express my deepest\ncondolences to the people of Taiwan on the earthquake that\nhit the Republic of China on Taiwan, with which the\nRepublic of Macedonia has recently established diplomatic\nrelations.\nIt is with regret that we have to note that one of the\nmain characteristics of the past year was flagrant and highly\nrisky disrespect for the fundamental values of democratic\nsociety. In addition to the major tragedies the world was\nfaced with, we witnessed a growing trend of armed\nconflicts and internal and external tensions. Concerning the\narea surrounding the Republic of Macedonia, I would focus\non the huge humanitarian crisis that took place in South-\nEastern Europe and the heavy consequences which\njeopardized the stability and security of the Balkans and\nbeyond in Europe.\nThe Kosovo crisis had particularly adverse effects on\nmy country. We had to cope with an enormous influx of\nrefugees, numbering more than 360,000, or 18 per cent of\nthe total population. The Republic of Macedonia entered a\nrather difficult economic, social and political situation that\ntended to destabilize it, particularly against the background\nthat the international community reacted with insufficient\nspeed and agility. The damage which the Macedonian\neconomy suffered is enormous, amounting to approximately\n$660 million. A large number of workers were dismissed as\na result of lost markets and increased transportation costs.\nThe unemployment rate reached 40 per cent. All of this has\nnegatively affected the already poor economic and social\nsituation. In these circumstances, the citizens of the\nRepublic of Macedonia have demonstrated great\nhumaneness towards the refugees, tolerance and solidarity,\nbut also restraint in the conditions of enormous social,\npolitical and economic pressure they were exposed to and\nwhose consequences could have been more dramatic.\nFinally, we should not forget that there are still 30,000\nrefugees in the Republic of Macedonia. I urge the\nAssembly to continue the joint efforts for their safe return\nto their homes.\nAt the same time, the peace forces of the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for Kosovo were\ndeployed in the Republic of Macedonia in support of the\ninternational efforts for a political resolution of the crisis,\nas were a large number of international governmental and\nnon-governmental organizations.\nMacedonia has managed to overcome these\nhardships, but the consequences are still being felt in the\nnational economy. Financial assistance and support from\nthe international community are indispensable for the\nrecovery of the national economy. It is beyond doubt that\ncompensation for the damage we suffered by making our\nnational capacities available for the resolution of the\nKosovo crisis should be an obligation of the international\ncommunity.\nThe Macedonian Government highly appreciates the\nassistance provided by the international community thus\nfar through certain financial institutions or on a bilateral\nbasis. The assistance should continue, which is to say, we\nexpect States to fully carry out the commitments they\nhave undertaken. This is the right moment to write off\nparts of our external debts as a recognition of the efforts\nwe are making to overcome the crisis. Today, the only\nthing that the Republic of Macedonia requests is the\nfulfilment of the promises made by the international\ncommunity during the crisis.\nEven prior to the outbreak of the crisis and the\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), my\ncountry had consistently supported a peaceful and\npolitical solution to the Kosovo crisis that would include\nsubstantial autonomy within the framework of the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia; respect for the human rights of\nall living in Kosovo; respect for the inviolability of\nexisting borders; the cessation of hostilities and of\nrepression; the deployment of peace forces; the safe and\nfree return of refugees; the demilitarization of the Kosovo\nLiberation Army (KLA) and other paramilitary forces;\nand the economic reconstruction of Kosovo and the\nregion.\nI would like to take this opportunity to commend the\nefforts made fully to implement Security Council\nresolution 1244 (1999). The Republic of Macedonia, in\nthis respect, will continue to support the United Nations\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the\nEuropean Union, the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and all\nother international governmental and non-governmental\norganizations. In this context, I would like to recall that\non many occasions the Macedonian Government has\ndemonstrated its readiness closely to cooperate with the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, with his Special\n42\n\n\nRepresentative, Mr. Kouchner, and with UNMIK, and that\nit has offered its good offices.\nThe Republic of Macedonia strongly supports the\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe as one of the most\nimportant adopted documents for the wider region and for\nEurope. Furthermore, it is prepared to take an active part in\nits implementation and to contribute to the reconstruction\nand stabilization of the region and its speedy integration\ninto European structures. The Stability Pact, through its\nthree pillars, or \u201cworking tables\u201d, and through the relevant\ninternational global and regional institutions, is expected to\ncontribute to a lasting stabilization of the region and to its\nfinal integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures.\nTo this effect, I would like to call upon all of the parties to\nthis extremely important document to mutually reinforce\ntheir activities and to enhance their coordination.\nI would here like to underscore the strong interest of\nthe Republic of Macedonia in the prompt implementation\nof the second pillar for economic development and\nreconstruction. The most important issue linked with its\nunimpeded functioning and the realization of the desired\nresults \u2014 greater inclusion of the Balkans in European\neconomic, political and democratic trends \u2014 is the setting\nup of lasting mechanisms for the necessary fund-raising and\nthe securing of funds to this end. Many United Nations\nprogrammes and activities could be used for this purpose.\nThe Republic of Macedonia is interested in seeing the\nUnited Nations play a role in this sphere.\nThe Republic of Macedonia will propose a pertinent\ndraft resolution at this session of the General Assembly that\nstresses the importance of the prompt consolidation and\ndevelopment of South-Eastern Europe, the importance of\nthe Stability Pact and the need for the full implementation\nof Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). We are\nconvinced that the draft will be supported by all States\nMembers of the United Nations.\nLet us hope that this will be the last crisis in the\nBalkans or South-Eastern Europe. But to prevent any\nrecurrence of this kind of situation, we will have to defend\nmore successfully democratic principles and values and\ndevelop long-term preventive strategies.\nI am convinced that the beginning of the next\nmillennium will mark a new era in the history of this area,\nwhich has been overburdened with conflicts and therefore\nneeds to focus primarily on its own development and\nprosperity. In the long run, regional stability can be\nprovided by economic development, democracy, respect of\nhuman rights and the rights of national minorities, and\nbilateral and regional cooperation. However, the best way\nto guarantee the security of the region and transform it\ninto an area of democracy, development, stability and\ncooperation is for the countries of the region to join the\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) and become fully fledged members.\nThe Republic of Macedonia is among the countries\nmost affected by the crisis \u2014 economically, socially and\npolitically. This has hampered our efforts to build a\nsociety that meets the expectations of our people.\nDespite the major challenges it has confronted in the\npast, my country has managed to implement and advance\nthe strategic commitments set out in its foreign policy:\nintegration in the European Union, inclusion in\nEuro-Atlantic security structures and development of\ngood-neighbourliness.\nThe success of that policy is reflected in the fact that\nthe Republic of Macedonia was able to stay out of the\nfour armed conflicts which have taken place in the last\ndecade on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. For the\nfirst time in the history of the Republic of Macedonia as\nan independent country, we have been faced with a war\non our borders. In such circumstances, the contribution of\nthe peaceful and constructive Macedonian policy to\nconflict resolution is highly significant. The Republic of\nMacedonia is fully committed to carrying out the reforms\nthat have been initiated, based on European standards, in\nthe political, economic and democracy fields, with\nmaximum respect for human rights, including minority\nrights.\nThat commitment by the Macedonian Government\nand the results of the reforms have been commended by\nthe international community. That is precisely why the\nEuropean Union has decided that the Republic of\nMacedonia should be the first partner in the\ncommencement of negotiations for the conclusion of the\nStability and Association Agreement.\nThe Republic of Macedonia has a long-term\ncommitment to the continuing improvement of its\nrelations with all of its neighbours. The advancement and\ndevelopment of these relations, as well as of bilateral\ncooperation with all of its neighbours, is evidenced by\nintensive cooperation in the framework of a number of\nregional initiatives. Two trilateral meetings have taken\nplace among the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of\nMacedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Greece, the aim of\n43\n\n\nwhich was to coordinate and promote activities aimed at a\nmore successful implementation of the Stability Pact.\nI would like to emphasize that the policy of the\nGovernment of the Republic of Macedonia, elected less\nthan a year ago, is aimed in particular at improving, as\nsoon as possible, the situation in the region. To this effect,\nmany practical steps have been taken, which to our mutual\nsatisfaction are yielding results.\nAs we approach the new millennium, the last session\nof the General Assembly for this century is undoubtedly the\nforum best suited to evaluating what has been achieved in\nthe area of the promotion and protection of human rights\nand freedoms. Over the last 50 years, impressive progress\nhas been made in international humanitarian law. Today, we\nare proud to note that the United Nations, having adopted\nthe fundamental Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nhas managed to affirm the international consensus on the\nbasic postulates of human dignity and to promote them as\na basic standard and objective to be attained by all\nindividuals and nations.\nOf no less importance is the promotion and\nstrengthening of all United Nations human rights bodies\nengaged in the protection and promotion of human rights,\nincluding minority rights. In this regard, the Republic of\nMacedonia supports the reform of the mechanisms and\nfunctioning of the United Nations bodies in this area.\nThis year we mark the tenth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nAlthough this Convention has been ratified by almost all\nStates, its genuine implementation is still a desired aim. A\nlarge number of children are still victims of disrespect for\ntheir fundamental rights. We therefore fully and firmly\nsupport the efforts made at this year's session of the\nCommission on Human Rights to undertake concrete\nmeasures for the protection of the rights of the child, the\naim of which is to promote the next century as the century\nof the universal protection of the rights of the child.\nThe role and efforts of the international community in\nthe full implementation of currently accepted standards and\nprinciples are important, but the primary role and\nresponsibility lies with the States themselves. As is evident\nfrom the democratic development of my country, the\nRepublic of Macedonia completely associates itself with the\nendeavours of the international community for the\nobservance and promotion of human rights.\nIn the twenty-first century the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security all over the world should\nbe the priority aim of our Organization. As the Secretary-\nGeneral stated in his report, the world, and our\nOrganization in particular, will be faced with the need to\nbe fully involved in the prevention and peaceful\nresolution of conflicts and with the development of the\naffected States. The elimination of poverty and reducing\nthe gap between the developed and developing countries\nshould be our priorities, as my colleagues have already\nsaid. In the next century the Republic of Macedonia\nwould like to see an improvement in economic\ndevelopment and international economic cooperation, as\nwell as an enhancement of efforts being made within the\ndisarmament process and greater support for them.\nWe may note that the global community has\nachieved significant improvements with regard to living\nstandards and the reduction of poverty. The global\neconomy is showing modest but constant growth of 2 per\ncent annually, while the volume of trade is continuing to\nincrease. However, it seems that, irrespective of the\nimportant accomplishments, the world community is\nconfronted with a series of alarming problems that must\nbe resolved.\nIncreased world poverty and unemployment are key\nproblems, which should be the main preoccupation of the\ninternational community, the aim being to eliminate them.\nHalf the population of the world lives on less than $3 per\ncapita per day, while the unemployment rate is increasing\ncontinuously; the international community has to face the\nchallenge of overcoming that situation. Decisions of the\ninternational community regarding international economic\npolicies are most frequently made in the United Nations\nframework. The Governments of the developed countries\nhave a leading role to play and the primary responsibility\nin this domain.\nThe indebtedness of the developing countries and\ncountries in transition is mainly a result of inappropriate\npolitical circumstances, in the form of armed conflicts;\ndifferent types of embargoes and factors make it\nimpossible for them to market their goods; and natural\ndisasters. Writing off the debts, or part of the debts, of\nthe countries affected by objective external factors would\nhave a very positive impact on diminishing global poverty\nand unemployment and on economic development. Only\nthe economically developed and independent State can be\ntruly politically independent and sovereign and have a\nrole to play in the international community.\n44\n\n\nGlobalization of the world economy and liberalization\nof world trade are necessary preconditions for the\nimprovement of living standards and the reduction of\nexisting differences in countries' development relative to\nglobal development. The role of the United Nations in this\narea is of great importance. The increased globalization and\nliberalization of the world economy should be accompanied\nby a lowering of existing barriers and by facilitating the\nfree transfer of goods and services and of the work force.\nThis would create a unified world economy in its true\nmeaning.\nIn the next century more attention will be placed on\nthe observance of the United Nations Charter. In the\ninterests of the maintenance of international peace and\ncollective security, it is extremely important that Security\nCouncil decisions be made on behalf of all the Member\nStates of our Organization, without its being possible for\nthem to abuse the right of veto. The contribution of the\nRepublic of Macedonia to the promotion of peace and\nsecurity is well known, and this was confirmed by the\ndeployment on its territory of the United Nations Preventive\nDeployment Force (UNPREDEP), which was unfortunately\nterminated at the moment when the region may have been\nmost in need of it.\nThe importance of the leading role played by this\nsingle universal Organization is reflected in its skill in\nadapting to real situations and practical problems. I am\ndeeply convinced that the new challenges are already\nreflected in the manner of operation of our Organization\nand in its structure. I would like to salute the firm\ndetermination to continue to implement United Nations\nreforms, which have already produced results, as stated in\nthe Secretary-General's report. The Republic of Macedonia\nis of the opinion that the reform of the United Nations\nsystem will be successful only if reform of the Security\nCouncil is followed by reform of the General Assembly and\nthe Economic and Social Council.\nWe expect the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly to successfully conclude preparations for the\norganization of the Millennium Assembly in the year 2000.\nIn this context, we are anticipating with great interest the\nSecretary-General's report. At the same time, we join the\nappeal for all Member States to be represented by heads of\nState or Government at that event.\nUnited Nations Member States must constantly\ncontribute to the strengthening of the basic democratic\nvalues of peace, security, stability, social and economic\ndevelopment, respect for international law and respect for\nhuman and minority rights. The United Nations is the true\nplace for the improvement of these basic values. The\nresolution of each country to persist in that way is of\ncrucial importance in determining whether we will jointly\nmanage to fully implement these commitments and enjoy\nthe fruits of development.\nI would like to assure the Assembly that the\nRepublic of Macedonia has already embarked on that road\nand will continue to make its contribution to the full\nimplementation of those values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to\nconvey to my friend Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab how proud and\nhappy I am to see a son of Africa leading the General\nAssembly into the new millennium. I congratulate him\nwarmly. I am certain that his experience, gained as the\nrepresentative of the South-West Africa People\u2019s\nOrganization to the United Nations and in the course of a\nlong diplomatic career, will help him resolve the complex\nissues facing the Assembly at this session. This is an\nhonour for him and for the African continent. I wish also\nto convey my congratulations to the other officers of the\nGeneral Assembly. The President may rest assured that my\ndelegation is ready to work with him for the success of the\nwork of the Assembly at this session.\nI wish also to convey to the President of the\nAssembly at its fifty-third session, His Excellency Mr.\nDidier Opertti of Uruguay, our thanks for the quality of\nthe work carried out under his presidency.\nI pay heartfelt tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, and reaffirm the appreciation of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire for the unflagging and able way in which he is\nfulfilling the mandate entrusted to him.\nMy delegation welcomes the three new Members of\nthe Organization: the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic\nof Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\nOn the eve of the new millennium, the Organization\nmust adapt to the new shape of international relations in\norder to increase its effectiveness in all areas, including\nthat of the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. Every passing day reveals the dysfunction of\ninternational society. Nearly 10 years after the euphoria\nborn of the end of ideological confrontation, we have yet\nto put in place machinery for political, economic and\nfinancial controls that could lead to the peaceful world\nevoked by the 1945 Charter.\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, we are\nobliged to say that might continues to prevail over right,\nthat hotbeds of war continue to proliferate, that individual\nrights are often flouted, and that a large part of mankind\nhas only a remote idea of social progress.\nYet the 1945 Charter remains timely; all that is\nlacking is the full implementation of the great principles\nit articulates. The faith of peoples in the United Nations\nremains intact. This obliges us to make a sustained effort\nto increase its credibility and strengthen its capacity to\nmeet the challenges it faces.\nFor a number of years the Organization has been\nengaged in renewal. Working groups have been\nestablished to reform the main structures of the United\nNations and adapt them better to the new international\ncontext. The Secretary-General himself is involved in this\neffort, in part by initiating reforms within his areas of\nresponsibility. It is now up to us, the Member States, to\nwork together to complete the process in the months to\ncome.\nWe hope that the Millennium Summit planned for\nSeptember 2000 will launch the United Nations into the\ntwenty-first century. It is therefore of great urgency that\nthe plan to enlarge the Security Council be completed.\n30\n\n\nThere can be no doubt that by increasing the number of\nboth permanent and non-permanent members, among which\nAfrica will have to have its rightful place, we will also be\nremedying the lack of political visibility from which the\nCouncil has been suffering. The Kosovo crisis revealed the\nnecessity of reaffirming the primacy of the Security Council\nand hence that of the United Nations.\nConfirming the authority of the Security Council must\nby no means imply a reduced role for the General\nAssembly. This body, whose representative nature lends it\ngreat legitimacy, must be at the heart of the system, with\nall that this implies for its ability to set the overall course\nof the United Nations. But such institutional reform can be\neffective only if all States meet their financial obligations.\nBy reiterating the validity of the principles of the Charter\nat the dawn of a new millennium, we commit ourselves to\nguaranteeing international peace and security for succeeding\ngenerations.\nFor the past two years the Organization has been\npaying particular attention to the conflicts besetting Africa.\nIn his report to the Security Council of 13 April 1998\n(S/1998/318), the Secretary-General identified the many\ncauses of these conflicts. He reviewed the ways to promote\npeace, the most important of which is a development policy\nthat can eradicate the seeds of violence. For their part,\nAfrican States are making every effort to acquire machinery\nenabling them to avert conflict situations or, if necessary,\nto act.\nConvinced that war is not inevitable and that the keys\nto peace are at hand so long as the political will exists, the\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) has unanimously\ndeclared the restoration of peace on the continent to be its\npriority activity for the years to come.\nBut let us not delude ourselves: that goal will be met\nonly if the international community, as embodied by the\nUnited Nations, is mobilized and if it firmly supports\nAfrica\u2019s efforts. It is not my intention to disregard all that\nhas been done by friendly countries \u2014 the United States,\nFrance, the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada, to name\nbut a few \u2014 to explore new ways to promote peace and\nsecurity in Africa and to strengthen Africa\u2019s capacity in that\nregard. Let me recall the establishment in my own country,\nat Zambakro, of a military training centre specializing in\npeacekeeping techniques, which is open to all African\nStates.\nNor can I fail to mention the initiatives taken by the\nUnited Nations where the scourge of war is at its horrific\nworst, such as in Sierra Leone, or where it wantonly flays\nits victims, such as in Guinea-Bissau or in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. The Ceasefire Agreement for the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, signed at Lusaka on\n10 July 1999, to which all the factions of the Congolese\nRally for Democracy have now subscribed, owes a great\ndeal to the perseverance of the Secretary-General and to\nthe persuasive labours of his Special Envoy.\nTo help our continent escape the spiral of violence,\nthe United Nations has acted at every stage of crises,\ncombining its efforts with those of the OAU and of other\nregional and subregional organizations.\nBased on its success in the former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, the United Nations has\nexperimented in the Central African Republic with a\npreventive peacekeeping mission, which has thus far been\nachieving its objectives. The Organization has thus\nprevented that country from beginning a descent into the\nhell that the repeated mutinies of 1996 and 1997 seemed\nto prefigure and the political and social tension that\nfollowed. I am particularly pleased to say this because my\ncountry has sent a 235-member contingent consisting of\na medical unit, an armoured squadron and members of the\ngeneral staff.\nEven though it is more complex in terms of the\nmany issues in its subregion, the work of the United\nNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\n(MINURSO) is also praiseworthy. It has made it possible\nto build a momentum for dialogue that will ultimately\nprevail over the passions and divisiveness that have long\nbeen a source of conflict: this is no mean achievement.\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire welcomes developments in the\nsituation in the Middle East, including recent steps taken\nby the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Ehud Barak, and by\nPresident Yasser Arafat with a view to implementing a\njust and fair peace that would protect the inalienable\nrights of the Palestinian people and Israel\u2019s right to\nexistence within secure and recognized boundaries.\nI would be remiss if I did not mention all that has\nbeen done to strengthen cooperation in peacekeeping with\nthe OAU, as well as with the Economic Community of\nWest African States and the Southern African\nDevelopment Community. We must welcome the fact that\nthe United Nations seems gradually to be overcoming the\nSomalia syndrome that led it to reduce its commitments.\n31\n\n\nThe prospect of the Organization\u2019s soon deploying a\npeacekeeping force of 20,000 for the implementation of the\nLusaka agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nis certainly a harbinger of an increased effort of the\ninternational community to restore peace and security in\nAfrica. But we should take care that this hope not be\ndashed, thereby strengthening the feeling, widely held in\nAfrican public opinion, that our continent is subject to\ndiscriminatory treatment as compared with other regions of\nthe world. What was possible in Kosovo should also be\npossible in Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone. The reference\nto the values of democracy and human rights that served as\na catalyst for the large-scale action in Kosovo is equally\napplicable to African populations.\nI am fully aware of the reluctance of the great Powers\nto become involved in complex conflicts whose local\nprotagonists are often difficult to identify and tend to\ncompete with one another, at very great humanitarian cost.\nCertainly, political prerequisites, especially in the form of\nceasefire agreements, are necessary for the deployment of\npeacekeeping forces, but they are not insurmountable when\nthe Security Council makes use of all the resources offered\nby the Charter.\nThe breathing of new life into the principle of\npeacekeeping operations through the provision of credible\ndeterrent elements and resources should not absolve us of\nreviewing or of clarifying Chapter VIII on cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and regional arrangements. Too\nmany uncertainties remain on the scope and modalities of\nsuch cooperation and the role that falls to the Security\nCouncil in this regard.\nThe Kosovo crisis and military intervention under the\nauspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have\nonly increased our doubts and questions in this connection.\nThe promotion of the regional approach to collective\nsecurity should in no way serve as a pretext for the\nSecurity Council\u2019s lack of involvement. By reiterating the\nvalidity of the principles of the Charter at the dawn of a\nnew millennium, we commit ourselves to establishing better\nliving conditions for future generations, including all the\nchildren of Africa.\nAfrica, of course, has little weight in world economic\nstatistics, but it does have a potential on which the future\nof humankind will largely depend. It must participate fully\nin efforts to build a new world financial architecture. It is\nalso important that, on the eve of major trade negotiations\nunder the aegis of the World Trade Organization, the\ninterests of the developing countries not be sacrificed on\nthe altar of globalization.\nI welcome the efforts of the Secretariat to strengthen\nthe resources available for development and to harmonize\nthe activities of various United Nations agencies. It was\nto that end that a development group was established to\nbring together the various operational bodies, including\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund and the United Nations\nPopulation Fund. The result has been improved\nstreamlining of activities, more consistent management of\naid and simplified procedures for funding projects. This\nrepresents progress that we can only welcome by paying\na heartfelt tribute to the coordination of the assistance\nprovided by UNDP, particularly by its resident\nrepresentatives.\nBut this satisfaction cannot calm the anxiety\nprovoked by the continued decline of official development\nassistance, which the statistics of the past decade show to\nbe precipitous. Official development assistance has now\nfallen to below 0.2 per cent of gross national product.\nWe welcome the initiatives taken last June in\nCologne at the summit of the G-8. These attest to a desire\nto increase assistance to developing countries, especially\nthrough significant debt alleviation. The cancellation of\npart of the debt of the developing countries, against the\nprospect of the opportunity for these countries to relaunch\ntheir investment policies, should allow for harmonization\nand coordination of the activities of the major\ninternational financial institutions. The multilateral\nframework will also offer the advantage of avoiding direct\ndealings between a given country and aid providers,\nwhich experience has often shown to be a source of\nmisunderstandings that may hamper the smooth\nfunctioning of national economies. However, decisions\ntaken by the richest countries for reducing debt are likely\nto create disparities among the countries concerned,\ndepending on what category they belong to. The\ndefinition of these categories may rely on economic\ncriteria that, by definition, are extremely inflexible.\nThe question of debt is of grave concern to African\ncountries, which, at the Fourth Extraordinary Summit of\nthe OAU in Syrte, instructed the current OAU Chairman,\nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, and President Thabo\nMbeki of South Africa to negotiate with creditors with a\nview to achieving a total cancellation of African debt. We\nhope that this mission, led by a head of State, will soon\nachieve success.\n32\n\n\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, it is urgent that\nwe define a global development assistance strategy and\nguarantee its financing. We therefore support the convening\nof a world conference on development financing to set\nprecise objectives and emphasize support for education and\nsocial projects without, however, neglecting the industrial\nand agricultural sectors. I would make a solemn appeal to\nall donor countries to reverse the current trend and to\nincrease their contributions to the United Nations system in\ngeneral, and to UNDP in particular, so as to enable them to\npursue their activities on behalf of our countries. I would\nask these donors to base their actions not on short-term\neconomic interests, but on solidarity.\nBy reiterating the validity of the principles of the\nCharter at the dawn of the new millennium, we commit\nourselves to restoring dignity to every human being,\nbecause nothing is lasting if it is not based on mankind.\nI wish here to express my Government\u2019s satisfaction\nwith the activities of the United Nations and its two\nspecialized Programmes, the Joint United Nations\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS and the United Nations\nInternational Drug Control Programme, in our countries.\nThe campaigns against these pandemics, especially that of\nHIV/AIDS, and endemic diseases, as well as the struggle\nagainst narcotics and drugs, are designed to end these two\nscourges, which directly threaten the individual and upset\nsocial stability. At the International Conference on\nHIV-AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases, held in\nAbidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, from 7 to 11 December 1997, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire and France proposed the establishment of a\nsolidarity fund to mobilize the international community. At\nthe suggestion of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, this proposal was taken up\nby the OAU last June in Ouagadougou.\nThe actions undertaken by President Henri Konan\nB\u00e9di\u00e9, especially to protect and manage forests, develop\nand manage coastal areas, improve the water supply and\nadopt a water code demonstrate our concern to preserve\nhuman health and to protect the environment.\nFor several years now and in the context of more\nsustained economic growth, most African States have opted\nfor political pluralism and the consolidation of the rule of\nlaw. These are the counterparts of improved economic and\nfinancial management through internationally recognized\ncriteria of good governance. Much remains to be done and\nthe situation varies from one region to another and even\nfrom one country to another. But the progress that has been\nachieved should be taken into account in major international\nnegotiations. In particular, we must never lose sight of the\nfact that violence is born of poverty. Anything that can\nhelp to eradicate the latter is a source of hope to millions\nof men and women.\nAn Africa in peace and committed to the path of\ndevelopment is the best guarantee of a better world. This\nAfrica must be united and free of small arms, trafficking\nand rivalry. It must be united.\nAn Africa at peace and on the road of development,\nis the best guarantee for a better world. Such an Africa\nmust be united and free from arms \u2014 particularly small\narms \u2014 trafficking and greed. Above all, it must be\nunited.\nDuring the OAU summit in Algiers, Heads of State\nand Government proclaimed their faith in the integration\nof the continent enshrined in instruments such as the\nLagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the\nMonrovian Strategy for the Economic Development of\nAfrica, the Final Act of Lagos and the Abuja Treaty\nestablished by the African Economic Community.\nAfrica now realizes that time is not on its side; it is\nfaced with rapid globalization, whose effects do not\nalways seem to be in Africa's favour. With this\nawareness, the fourth special Summit of OAU Heads of\nState and Government, meeting on 9 September 1999 in\nSirte, Libya, decided to create an African Union and a\nPan-African Parliament. Next year, another special session\nwill be held, also in Sirte, to adopt the text establishing\nthe Union. For Africa can continue to exist only if the\nAfrican Union becomes a true Power.\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire, keeping faith with this commitment,\nhas started taking action to strengthen the existing\nsubregional integration machinery, within the West\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and\nthe Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS). Within WAEMU we have already\nestablished policies to harmonize tax rates, price statistics,\nwith a regional stock market and transferable securities.\nAll these actions by C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, instigated by\nPresident Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9, have no other purpose than\nto contribute to internal peace, peace in Africa and peace\nbetween Africa and the rest of the world. They are\ndesigned to buttress greater solidarity and to seek a more\njust world, with progress and happiness for each and\nevery one of us.\n33\n\n\nThe millennium summit will afford world leaders an\nopportunity to reiterate their commitment to the\nfundamental principles of the United Nations Charter,\nwhich urges us to unite our strength to maintain\ninternational peace and security and to employ international\nmachinery for the promotion of the economic and social\nadvancement of all peoples, because the principles set forth\nin the Charter \u2014 dignity, the value of the individual,\nequality including gender equality and equality between\nnations \u2014 are immutable. They cannot be changed. They\nare absolute. It is up to us to act, and we must do so, for\naction is the very essence of politics.\nLet us therefore work together to make real these\nnoble objectives of a better future for us all."

        "file_text": "On behalf of my\ndelegation, I offer Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab my sincere\ncongratulations on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. I also pay a tribute to\nhis predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, under whose leadership\nthe Assembly succeeded in achieving positive results at its\nfifty-third session.\nI have every expectation that this, the final session of\nthe Assembly of the twentieth century, will be as fruitful.\nThe rich experience and leadership Mr. Gurirab brings to\nthe presidency ensure the session's success. I assure him of\nour full cooperation and support in his noble endeavours.\nI warmly congratulate the three new Members, the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga, on their admission to the United\nNations.\nThe new millennium is about to dawn, and we will\nenter it with great hope for the new age, but also burdened\nby numerous problems left unresolved from the passing\ncentury. To realize the hope and mould the twenty-first\ncentury into an era of global peace and stability, of\nwell-being and prosperity for all humankind, we must face\nup to these problems, decide what our priority goals are and\nseek measures to achieve them. So that the fifty-fourth\nsession may illuminate the way, let us gather the best of\nour collective wisdom.\nThe defining character of our times is change and\nthe acceleration of change. The guiding precept of the\nglobal actors is shifting from nationalism to\ninternationalism, and further to globalism. The whole\nworld is converging around shared values and behaviour\npatterns. In economic affairs, the market economy is\nbecoming the global norm. In political matters,\nreconciliation and cooperation have become the expected\nmode of behaviour. The world is becoming a global\nvillage of countries willing and eager to live with one\nanother in interdependence and integration.\nA conspicuous exception to the tide of the times is\nthe Korean peninsula, where the confrontational structure\nof the cold-war era still keeps the two divided sides in\nmutual distrust and hostility. Decades have passed since\nthe end of the Korean war, but genuine peace has yet to\ncome to the Korean people. Despite the warm wind of\nreconciliation blowing around the world, the Korean\npeninsula has remained frozen in an icy time warp.\nThe Republic of Korea aspires to melt away the ice\nand reconcile with the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea. It aspires to free the Korean peninsula from the\nfinal legacy of the cold war and allow it to take its\nrightful place in the grand march of history towards the\nnew era. To realize this aspiration, the engagement policy\nof the Government of President Kim Dae-jung has been\nsending warm winds of sunshine to the North, in hopes\nthat it will respond in kind. Inspired by the lessons of\nhistory and the trend of the times, this sunshine policy\nrepresents a bold shift in our thinking about South-North\nrelations.\nOur engagement policy is not aimed at undermining\nor absorbing the North. Instead, it is a policy of\ncooperation, designed to help North Korea overcome its\neconomic difficulties and promote the co-prosperity of all\nKoreans, so that we may finally be free from the threat of\nanother war. It is a policy of tolerance, envisioning the\npeaceful coexistence of two systems along the road to\neventual unification.\nThe steady and consistent implementation of the\nengagement policy during the past year and a half has\nmade meaningful and unprecedented openings in the thick\nwall that divides South and North Korea. South Korean\nbusinesses are investing in the North. In one such venture,\nover 100,000 South Korean tourists were able to visit a\nscenic mountain in the North for the first time since the\nnational division.\n19\n\n\nEconomic cooperation is also an important element in\nthe work of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development\nOrganization, a joint endeavour of the Republic of Korea,\nthe United States, Japan, the European Union and many\nother countries to help resolve North Korea's energy-\nshortage problem while keeping it free of nuclear weapons.\nThe engagement policy is being carried out in close\nconsultation with the United States and Japan. It also has\nthe full support of our neighbours in North-East Asia \u2014\nChina, the Russian Federation and Mongolia \u2014 as well as\nthe G-7, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, the\nEuropean Union and other members of the international\ncommunity. South Korea is deeply grateful for their\nunderstanding and support.\nStill North Korea remains suspicious of our intentions.\nIt may perceive the engagement policy as a strategy to\nbring about its downfall or to absorb it. Speaking in this\nsolemn Hall, I must reiterate the genuine, good-hearted\nintentions of the engagement policy. The Republic of Korea\nhas no wish to undermine North Korea or to make it a part\nof us. All we seek is peaceful coexistence.\nI make this appeal. Let us, South and North Korea,\nlive in lasting peace. Let us together join the mainstream of\nhistory: reconciliation, cooperation and interdependence. I\nsincerely hope that North Korea responds to the warm\nsunshine we have been sending it with some warm sunshine\nof its own.\nI also hope that the North Korean authorities will take\nsteps to fundamentally address the chronic food shortage\nand other difficulties that have plagued the people in the\nNorth for many years. The problems require the continued\ninterest and assistance of the international community.\nCountless children in the North are suffering and dying\nfrom starvation and malnutrition, stunted growth and\ndisease. With their right to food and life irrevocably\nimpaired, tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled the\ncountry in search of food.\nThe primary responsibility for redressing the situation\nlies with the North Korean authorities. They must face up\nto the enormity of the problems. We also hope that the\ninternational community will provide continued\nhumanitarian assistance to North Korea.\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea has actively\ntaken part in the humanitarian efforts to help the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea. We are prepared to\noffer far more in terms of food and fertilizer, as well as\nassistance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's\nagricultural restructuring. We urge the North Korean\nauthorities to join us in dialogue for cooperation on this\nand other matters.\nNorth-East Asia, where the interests of the major\nPowers intersect, is an economic powerhouse and a region\nvital to global peace and stability. With the market\neconomy taking root throughout the region, a new age of\nstability, cooperation and mutual prosperity is sprouting\nin North-East Asia. The countries of the region are\nbecoming bound ever closer together in economic ties and\ninterdependencies. Unhampered exchanges and\ncooperation are expanding far beyond the trade in goods\nand services to people-to-people contacts and other\ninteractions in the fields of culture, sports, education and\nmany others. Mutual understanding and appreciation is\ndeepening.\nTo further the trend, North-East Asia requires\nadequate mechanisms to deal with transnational issues,\nsuch as environmental pollution, drug-trafficking,\nrefugees, organized crime and public health. There is also\na need for a region-wide channel of dialogue and\ncooperation to defuse tension and prevent conflict.\nTo enjoy a stable security environment and co-\nprosperity in the twenty-first century, the countries of\nNorth-East Asia must learn from the lessons of\nregion-wide cooperation and integration in many other\nareas of the world. They must strengthen mutual trust by\nupgrading the mode and calibre of their dialogue and\nconsultations. They should promptly set out to establish\na dialogue forum where they can all engage in earnest\nexchanges of views and nurture the sense of community.\nThe Republic of Korea stands ready to cooperate\nclosely with the other countries of the region to launch\nsuch a mechanism for dialogue and cooperation\nencompassing all of North-East Asia. I urge the countries\nof the region to join in the efforts to translate this idea\ninto reality.\nPeace and co-prosperity in North-East Asia will\ncertainly gain from the global disarmament and\nnon-proliferation efforts, in which the Republic of Korea\nhas been an active participant. With the ratification of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), my\ncountry is now a party to all the key non-proliferation\ntreaties. We call upon other countries that have yet to sign\nand ratify the CTBT to promptly do so, so that the Treaty\ncan soon go into effect. We call upon all States to join in\nthe non-proliferation efforts by acceding to all global\n20\n\n\nregimes, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention, aimed\nat combating the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\nA priority task for the global community will be to\nsuccessfully carry out the review Conference of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) slated\nfor next year and to revitalize the Conference on\nDisarmament. I urge the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea, as a party to the NPT, to fulfil its responsibilities\nunder the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\nsafeguards agreement and to cooperate with us to\nimplement the 1991 Joint Declaration on the\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nWe are living in a single global community.\nGlobalization has been good to the Republic of Korea.\nWithout the open markets, interdependencies and instant\ninformation flow nurtured by globalization, we would not\nhave been able to achieve the rapid economic development\nthat we did. However, stuck in the expediencies fostered\nduring the years of Government-driven quantitative growth,\nKorea neglected to strengthen the market rules in the\nnational economy. We failed to realize that globalization\nrequires constant efforts to reinforce the market rules \u2014\ntransparency, accountability, efficiency and productivity. As\na result, Korea was struck by a severe economic crisis in\n1997.\nBut now we are trying to make up for past neglect.\nDuring the past year and a half, we have been undertaking\nsweeping and intense reforms in the key sectors of society.\nThe reforms have required painful restructuring and\nsacrifices, but we have been steady and firm in putting into\npractice the belief that trade and investment liberalization\nand the strengthening of market rules are the keys to\nsustained economic growth and prosperity.\nA year ago, from this same rostrum, I spoke about the\nefforts of my Government and people to overcome the\ncrisis, guided by the conviction in the parallel development\nof democracy and the free-market economy. Today, I am\nhappy to report that the efforts have begun to pay off and\nthe country is expected to achieve over 6 per cent economic\ngrowth this year, a dramatic turnaround from the -5.8\npercent of last year. Other economic indicators also speak\nof a stable, recovering economy.\nKorea has learned valuable lessons from the economic\ncrisis. We are now keenly aware that free and fair\ncompetition and good governance are essential to\nsustainable economic development. We also realized that a\nsystem of social welfare based on human-resources\ndevelopment must be established to mitigate the painful\nconsequences of the reforms. Applying those lessons in\nthe reform drive, we are on our way to becoming a\nmarket economy with a human face.\nOf course, in a globalized economy, crisis knows no\nborders and the efforts at preventing and coping with\ncrisis must also extend beyond borders. In this regard, we\nwelcome the discussions concerning the restructuring of\nthe global financial architecture. For the discussions to be\nproductive, the crisis-stricken countries and other\nemerging market economies should have extensive\nparticipation. Keeping track of the discussions for\nmeaningful progress, we count on the continued\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton\nWoods systems.\nOne consequence of globalization has been the\nwidening gap between the developed and the developing\ncountries and the increasing marginalization of the least\ndeveloped ones. Unattended, the disparity will only grow\nin the twenty-first century of unlimited competition,\nbecoming a risk factor that could endanger global stability\nand peace. There is a pressing need for a new paradigm\nof international development cooperation, whereby the\nchronic poverty and excessive debts besetting the\ndeveloping countries and other related issues are taken as\nchallenges to be overcome with the active input of all\nmembers of the global community.\nDevelopment is meaningless without a healthy\npopulation to reap the fruits. Thus, we welcome the joint\ninitiative of the United Nations Children's Fund and the\nWorld Health Organization to establish the Global\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization and the\nChildren's Vaccine Initiative. Doing its share in the efforts\nto save the 9 million children of the world who are dying\nevery year from diseases that can be prevented, the\nRepublic of Korea has hosted the International Vaccine\nInstitute since 1994. We hope the Institute will be able to\nwork in close cooperation with the Global Alliance and\nthe Vaccine Initiative.\nIn the half century since the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights was adopted in 1948, the United\nNations has taken the lead in forging global mechanisms\nfor the protection and advancement of human rights\naround the world. The principles of universality,\nindivisibility and interdependence of all human rights are\nnow widely upheld. Human rights violations, wherever\nthey may take place, are now considered a legitimate\nconcern of the international community. Human rights has\n21\n\n\nbecome a priority agenda of the post-cold-war global\ncommunity. In the Republic of Korea, the Government of\nPresident Kim Dae Jung has made significant advances in\nthe field of human rights. We have also been an active\nparticipant in the efforts of the United Nations and the\nglobal community to resolve concrete cases of human rights\nviolations.\nWhile we note the advances in human rights, we must\nnot forget that a quarter of the world's population still\nstruggles to survive in abject poverty. Poverty undermines\nhuman dignity and human rights. Poverty is fertile ground\nfor conflict and dictatorship. Poverty alleviation should be\nincorporated as a key goal in the United Nations\nendeavours to advance human rights around the world. We\nwish to see the mainstreaming of human rights in all the\nprogrammes and activities of the United Nations further\nexpanded and deepened. Furthermore, we believe this\nglobal body should strengthen its capacity for early warning\nand preventive action so as to forestall massive human\nrights violations and the outflow of refugees.\nThe task of advancing human rights has always\nbenefited from the push and pull of civil society. It will be\neven more so in the new century as Governments and the\nUnited Nations work in closer alliance and cooperation with\nnon-governmental organizations, research organizations and\nadvocacy groups. Next month, some 3,000 non-\ngovernmental organization representatives will gather in\nSeoul to take part in the 1999 international conference of\nnon-governmental organizations. Exploring the role of the\nnon-governmental organizations in the twenty-first century\nglobal community, the meeting from October 11 to 15\nshould bring the United Nations system and civil society\ncloser together.\nLet us turn our attention to the situation in East Timor.\nThe Republic of Korea applauded the Government of\nIndonesia for making the decision to let the people of East\nTimor choose their own fate. The will of the people, as\nunequivocally registered on 30 August, must be upheld. The\nviolent repression of that will is a grave challenge to the\nbasic principle of democracy and human decency. The\natrocity must not be left unpunished and law and order\nmust be restored in East Timor. The Indonesian\nGovernment has again shown wisdom and courage in\naccepting the multinational peacekeeping forces under the\nauspices of the United Nations. We hope that peace is soon\nreturned and that the will of the people for independence is\nfully implemented through the conjoined efforts of the\nIndonesian Government and the United Nations. The\nRepublic of Korea will take part in the peacekeeping\noperations and will continue to do its share in the efforts\nto safeguard regional and global peace and stability.\nThe United Nations has much work to do in the\ntwenty-first century. The Republic of Korea deeply\nappreciates the reforms introduced by the\nSecretary-General to enhance the responsiveness of the\nglobal body to new challenges. We welcome the\ndesignation of the fifty-fifth session next year as the\nMillennium Assembly to identify the challenges awaiting\nthe global community in the twenty-first century. We\nhope the Millennium Assembly strengthens the global\nleadership of the United Nations for the new age.\nIn this regard, such thought-provoking concepts as\nglobal public goods, human security and global\ngovernance may serve to frame the discussions at the\nMillennium Assembly.\nI look to the twenty-first century as the era of the\nUnited Nations. I sincerely hope to see the global body\nrenew itself and fulfil its missions through continuous\nreforms and to enhance its effectiveness and democratic\ncharacter. Recalling the lofty spirit that gave birth to the\nUnited Nations half a century ago, on behalf of the\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Korea, I\npledge our abiding support for the global body in its\nnoble mission for peace and prosperity around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First let convey my\nwarmest congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your\nelection. As we enter the new millennium, the United\nNations is crossing a significant threshold, and we need\na seasoned hand to lead us. Your long experience with the\n23\n\n\nUnited Nations, first as a freedom fighter, now as Foreign\nMinister of Namibia, will stand us in good stead.\nLet me also thank your distinguished predecessor,\nMr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for the good work he did\nlast year.\nAs a fellow small State, Singapore would also like to\nwarmly welcome the three new Members to the United\nNations: Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga. We hope that they will\nalso join the forum of small States.\nI wish to pose this question: Will the United Nations\nsurvive in the twenty-first century? I have framed this\nquestion provocatively because I believe that the United\nNations has not yet adequately come to grips with the\ncentral challenges of its next phase of development. Unless\nit does so, my question may not be just rhetorical.\nTo be sure, the United Nations has been seized of\nefforts at reform for several years. But what is required\nmust go beyond the modification of existing institutions or\norganizational structures. The issue is not just how to make\nthe General Assembly, the Security Council, the Secretariat\nor other organs work more effectively, although that is\nimportant. But we cannot succeed if we neglect the broader\ncontext of such endeavours. The key question is whether\nthe current United Nations is conceptually and\nconstitutionally sound.\nThe simple but hard-won lesson of this century's\nexperiments with international organizations, from the\nLeague to the United Nations, is that the United Nations\nmust work within the framework of the state system. If the\nUnited Nations has worked better or has lasted longer than\nthe League, it is because the United Nations has\naccommodated the state system rather than posed a direct\nthreat to it. Its Member States see the United Nations as an\nadditional protective umbrella, not as a body that\ndiminishes them.\nThe League's Covenant was based on different\npremises. It emphasized disarmament. It promoted\ncollective security. It required States to submit disputes to\narbitration and judicial settlement. By doing so, the League\nposed an explicit challenge to the rights of States. On the\nother hand, the United Nations can do nothing that its\nMembers do not expressly allow it to do. Our Charter is\nclear and explicit that the United Nations is based on the\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of its Members. It also\nstresses the concomitant principle of non-interference in\ninternal affairs.\nBut these premises are now under pressure. As the\ntwentieth century draws to a close, the state system is on\nthe verge of major transformation. This will profoundly\naffect all Members and the United Nations itself.\nI do not predict the end of the nation State. The\nconcept of sovereignty is undergoing profound\nmodification, but it does not seem likely that the nation\nState will simply disappear. No viable alternative to\norganizing international political life has yet emerged, no\nmatter how inadequate or ineffective the current form\nmay have become. Radical proposals for restructuring the\nframework of the state system will inevitably invite\ndisappointment. The United Nations must therefore work\nwithin the existing framework, even as that framework is\nbeing transformed. Herein lie the subtlety and the\ndifficulty of the new challenge.\nTwo forces are impelling change: the pressures of a\ntruly integrated world economy and the end of the cold\nwar. Neither is adequately understood; even less\nunderstood is their interplay. This dialectic simultaneously\nimpels an unprecedented degree of international\ncooperation and makes international cooperation more\ndifficult to achieve.\nThere have always been issues which required States\nto work together. Interdependence is not new. In a sense,\nit is as old as the state system. To be sure, the number\nand scope of transnational issues that require international\ncooperative action have now expanded, but this is a\nchange of degree, not of kind. Globalization is not just\nmore interdependence.\nWhile globalization's effects are most evident in\nfinance and economics, there are far-reaching implications\nacross a range of issues. It affects the very notion of\nstatehood and government as they have hitherto been\nunderstood.\nThe essential function of any Government is to\ngovern \u2014 to provide public goods and services to its\ncitizens within its borders. But in a globalized economy,\nnational borders no longer include sufficient territory to\nfunction as self-contained economic units. Financial\ngeography and economic geography no longer coincide\nwith political geography. This mismatch means that\nGovernments no longer have a monopoly of legitimate\n24\n\n\npower within their own state boundaries. This does not\nchallenge the de jure sovereignty of States, but profoundly\nalters every Government's de facto capacity to govern.\nThe challenge is not, as it was throughout history,\nmerely of one State circumscribing the sovereignty of\nanother \u2014 of the powerful forcing their will on the weak.\nThe real challenge is now within each State, no matter how\npowerful.\nDealing with this phenomenon poses a different kind\nof challenge than just insisting on the legal concept of\nsovereignty or persuading Governments to work together on\nspecific issues. It forces a reconceptualization of the very\nidea of government and statehood. It requires a complete\nchange of mindset by the powerful as well as by the weak.\nThis will be difficult and painful to achieve.\nWhat is required is an unprecedented and qualitatively\nnew kind of international cooperation, not just cooperation\nbased on the alignment of national interests, as has occurred\nthroughout history. It requires the redefinition of what\nconstitutes both \u201cnation\u201d and \u201cinterests\u201d. States can no\nlonger just collide or cooperate at the boundaries of their\nsovereignties. It demands nothing less than shared\nresponsibility for governance and a pooling of\nsovereignties.\nFor this new kind of international cooperation to be\nconstructed and take root, the imperative of cooperation\nmust be supported by practical experience that demonstrates\nthat it is superior to any other political alternative. It is here\nthat the intersection and interplay of globalization and the\npost-cold-war international order complicate matters.\nThe end of the cold war at first seemed to promise a\nnew dawn for the United Nations, opening up vast\npotentialities for international cooperation unfettered by\nideological conflict. But these hopes have now been dashed.\nIn reality, the end of the cold war may have made\ninternational cooperation less likely.\nParadoxically, the ever-greater integration of the world\neconomy has been accompanied by increasing political\nfragmentation. The cold war was not just an ideological\ngeopolitical struggle; the cold war imposed identities that\ntranscended nationalism. Even those who sought to escape\nthe cold war in fact defined themselves in relation to it.\nIrrespective of which side we stood for, the cold war was\nthe organizing principle for international action and the\nconcept by which we understood global events.\nTo those disoriented by the pressures of\nglobalization, the end of the cold war provided an\nopportunity to seek reassurance and a new identity in real\nor imagined ethnic nationalisms. The resulting\nproliferation of States and the lack of a clear organizing\nprinciple for international action have made cooperation\nproblematic.\nThe end of ideological conflict and the increasing\ninfluence of market principles in all areas of life are\nmaking economic efficiency an essential condition for\nevaluating political actions. But globalization has\nsimultaneously eroded the ability of States to muster the\npolitical consensus of their own citizens for such action.\nIt is therefore not very surprising that the right kind of\nnew response has not yet been forthcoming.\nOf course, lip service is being paid to the need for\nnew international institutions to deal with new\ntransnational problems or to the reform of existing\ninternational institutions, the United Nations among them.\nBut the more usual reaction to the mismatch between\neconomic geography and the political geography of state\nboundaries has been defensive or a sterile triumphalism:\na new protectionism, xenophobic or nostalgic nationalisms\nor, where a country feels strong and confident enough, a\nnew kind of extraterritoriality, reminiscent of the\nnineteenth century. Strong States try to project their\nnational laws beyond their boundaries or insist on their\nstandards as conditionalities for trade and other kinds of\ncooperative interactions.\nThe recognition that problems are global, and the\nalmost universal acceptance of the market, commands at\nbest only superficial international consensus. The real\nresponses, the most concrete and practical responses, have\nbeen regional rather than universal.\nThis process is most advanced in Europe and North\nAmerica, through the European Union and the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, and less so in Latin\nAmerica and Asia, through the Southern Cone Common\nMarket, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\nand the Association of South-East Asian Nations Free\nTrade Area. Tentative linkages are being explored\nbetween regions. Africa has been only peripherally\nengaged. But relying on regionalism as more than a\nstopgap in a globalized world creates a latent instability.\nIf projected unchecked into the twenty-first century, this\nmust ultimately affect basic issues of war and peace. It is\nobviously unacceptable for an entire continent to be\nmarginalized.\n25\n\n\nSo a truly universal approach to shared responsibility\nfor global governance and pooling of sovereignties to deal\nwith global problems requires an international consensus on\nwhat is legitimately in the general interest of still sovereign\nStates. No matter how compelling the issue or problem, this\nis not self-evident.\nThe definition of what is in the legitimate public\ninterest within a specific State or nation is the product of a\nlong historical process, cultural attributes and a level of\neconomic development. It is the basic stuff of most political\ncontests in most States. Consensus is not easy to reach\ndomestically. It certainly will be even more difficult in an\ninternational system that is concurrently united and divided\nby globalization and the end of the cold war.\nThe international problem is compounded because the\nexpectation that the post-cold-war international system\nwould be multipolar has proved premature. A multipolar\nworld is still more a matter of potential rather than a\ncurrent reality. This has engendered discomfort.\nThe war in Kosovo focused such feelings. It threw\ninto brutal relief a trend that has been under way for some\ntime: that the absolute sovereignty of States has to be\nqualified to require compliance with generally accepted\nstandards of conduct and respect for human rights.\nThis is not all that novel a notion. The traditional\napproach of non-interference in domestic affairs was never\nas absolute in practice as in theory. The doctrine of\nhumanitarian intervention dates from the nineteenth century,\nwhen the powerful claimed the right to intervene in the\naffairs of the weak. The war in Kosovo resonated with such\nhistorical memories, thus adding to the discomfort.\nIt is a fact that sovereignty now coexists uneasily with\na different current of international law concerned with the\nrights of individuals. These trends have not yet been\nreconciled. But both trends are facts that cannot be wished\naway. In any case, their logical compatibility is not the real\nissue.\nNotwithstanding Kosovo, it does not appear that the\nmajority of States have much to fear if they treat their\ncitizens well. There are many countries that treat their\ncitizens badly without any suggestion of any sanction\nharsher than moral disapproval. Concern for human rights\nhas always been selective.\nThe more critical issue is related but different. The\nloss of territorial reference points engendered by\nglobalization's mismatch between economic and political\ngeographies and the loss of strategic meaning after the\nend of the cold war have made most international\nreactions ad hoc.\nWe lurch from crisis to crisis, with no clear sense of\ndirection or consistency. Why Kosovo or East Timor and\nnot Africa? Are the rights of humans everywhere not\nuniversal? How to choose when to intervene among the\nall-too-many conflicts? In his statement to the General\nAssembly this year, the Secretary-General has posed\nseveral thoughtful challenges for us: \u201cNothing in the\nCharter precludes a recognition that there are rights\nbeyond borders.\u201d What the Charter does say is that armed\nforce shall not be used, save in the common interest. The\nSecretary-General then asked, what is the common\ninterest? Who shall define it? Who will defend it? Under\nwhose authority? With what means of intervention?\nI agree with the Secretary-General that these\nquestions will need to be answered and criteria\nestablished. Rules and objective criteria for such\ninterventions are urgently needed. Failure to do so will\nbreed uncertainty and instability. If a new balance has to\nbe struck between sovereignty and other values, it should\nbe struck knowingly and with our eyes open. The\nalternative is to be led, one step at a time, with the best\nof intentions, by ad hoc solutions.\nThis will be a major challenge for the international\ncommunity if the United Nations is to remain relevant in\nthe coming century. This is because we can expect to face\nmany more situations which will pose the dilemma of\nreconciling State sovereignty with international\nintervention to redress violations of human rights.\nWe are all familiar with the pressures of the\ninternational media and non-governmental actors. These\nare realities but provide no satisfactory answers. It is not\npolitically acceptable that questions of international peace\nand stability should be decided on an ad hoc basis. It is\neven less acceptable that consensus on the need for more\npeaceful modes of international cooperation should reflect\nthe preoccupations of a few.\nWhat we need is to replicate on a global scale those\nconditions that have made the pluralistic societies in\nadvanced economies still capable of collective action. No\nGovernment anywhere can rule by coercion alone or lead\nlegitimately merely because it wields supreme power.\nResort to coercion or naked power is more often than not\ntaken to be a symptom of failure of government and not\nits defining feature.\n26\n\n\nWhat is required, therefore, on the international stage\nis what has already been accepted domestically \u2014 indeed,\ninsisted upon in the name of democracy: a modest\nacceptance of the reality of diversity and a nuanced\nappreciation of the difference between friends, friendly\ncritics and honest disagreements. Persuading those already\ndisoriented by globalization and rapid technological changes\nrequires patient and skilful diplomacy in the artful balance\nof competing interests.\nDespite the handicaps under which it laboured, and for\nall its imperfections, the United Nations has played a\ncritical role in some of the great world issues of the first\nfour decades of its existence. It eased the pangs of\ndecolonization. It provided a cathartic theatre to vent the\nmost dangerous passions of the cold war. It provided the\nmeans for the super-Powers to back down from unwanted\nconfrontations without grievous political costs to either.\nFrom time to time, it scored notable successes in\npeacekeeping operations around the world. At the same\ntime, the United Nations, through its specialized agencies,\ncontinues to play a vital developmental role for the majority\nof its Members.\nBut the United Nations experiences of the last decade\nhave been less happy. The United Nations has played at\nbest only a very marginal role in the great developments of\nthe closing years of the twentieth century that I have tried\nto describe. It risks becoming increasingly divorced from\nthe very international realities in which it is inescapably\nembedded.\nLike all organizations of sovereign States, the United\nNations can only provide a mechanism for its Members to\nuse for whatever purpose their agreements or disagreements\ndictate. But the United Nations cannot be just a tool of the\nfew, a repository for issues that no country is willing or\nknows how to confront, or a convenient scapegoat. The\nhard fact is that these are the roles that the United Nations\nhas been forced to play in recent years. It cannot continue\non this path without permanent damage.\nIn our century, the trend towards international\norganization, towards the development of a more\npredictable pattern of relationships between States and\ninternational regimes that transcend individual sovereignties\nis, I believe, established. There is no going back. Whether\nwe like it or not, the world has become too complex to be\ndealt with except multilaterally.\nBut this does not mean that any particular international\ninstitution will necessarily play an effective role in the\norganization of international life in the next century. The\nUnited Nations cannot assume that it will survive intact,\njust by clinging on to structures and processes conceived\nin 1945. The world has changed dramatically since then.\nIt will continue to do so. The United Nations has no\nchoice but to change in tandem.\nThis imperative is clear. What is unclear is how the\nUnited Nations should change. That is why I have posed\nmore questions than I have provided answers. The process\nof discussion must start now. The mechanism is at our\ndisposal. The responsibility to use it is ours. Whether we\nwill engage ourselves in this responsibility quickly\nenough to make a difference to the United Nations is for\nus to choose. I do not know how much time we have. I\nonly know that the time left is finite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my Government\nand on my own behalf, I wish to join previous speakers in\ncongratulating you, Sir, most sincerely on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. Your election to this high office is a matter of\nhonour to all Africans and to the United Nations family, for\nyou represent a nation whose plight remained on the agenda\nof this Organization for many years. The attainment of the\nindependence of Namibia, the last stronghold of colonialism\nin the African continent, and the subsequent political,\neconomic and social developments that have occurred in the\nlast few years, have indeed paved the way for the\nconsolidation of the process of political integration of\nsouthern Africa. We wish you well in your new\nresponsibilities, and are confident that this body will be\nwell served in the months ahead. We shall cooperate with\nyou in every way we can.\nA well-deserved tribute is also due to your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti of\nUruguay, for the exemplary manner in which he\nspearheaded the proceedings of the Organization during\nthe last session.\nI would also like to express my high regard to the\nSecretary-General for his continued commitment to\ninternational peace and security and for his leadership in\ndealing with an ever-increasing array of challenges\nworldwide. I wish to encourage him to continue on this\npositive path.\nMy Government welcomes the recent admission to\nthe membership of the United Nations of the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga. We are certain that the new Members will further\nenhance the universal nature of our Organization.\nI have come to the General Assembly first as a\nmessenger of a people \u2014 the Mozambican people \u2014 who\nhave embarked on a long process of political, economic\nand social stabilization, following years of instability. The\nprocess of consolidating Mozambique\u2019s young, multiparty\ndemocracy is making steady progress. Step by step, our\ncountry is returning to normalcy, though we are conscious\nof the hurdles still ahead.\n\n\nWe are currently preparing for the second multiparty\npresidential and parliamentary elections, to be held on 3\nand 4 December 1999. Periodic genuine elections constitute\nan important political exercise, which my Government and\nI are committed to pursuing vigorously with a view to\nensuring lasting peace and stability in Mozambique.\nIn the past five years of pluralistic democracy we have\nregistered important advances in the consolidation of\nnation-building through collective efforts involving all\nlayers of society. Taking advantage of its diversity and\nvitality, our Parliament has held fruitful discussion, which\nresulted in the adoption of new laws that are contributing\npositively to the revitalization of political, economic and\nsocial institutions as well as to the consolidation of peace\nand democracy.\nMore important, this forum has contributed to the\ncreation among parliamentarians of a new vision and\nunderstanding of the facts about our country and a vision of\na united nation pursuing peace, progress and prosperity for\nall Mozambicans, thus consolidating national reconciliation.\nThe period under review has equally witnessed significant\neconomic and social progress. We are proud that this has\nbeen highlighted and commended by well-advised outside\nobservers and by many of the most respected organizations\nand institutions as a good example of commitment to\nimplement economic reforms.\nThe Mozambican economy has grown at encouraging\nrates, resulting in the allocation of an increased share of the\nnational budget to the social sectors. The whole network of\nschools and health facilities destroyed during the years of\ndestabilization has been rebuilt, and most roads and bridges\nare under rehabilitation.\nMy Government has succeeded in creating a more\nenabling environment for private investment by redefining\nits role as facilitator. We have identified and established\nspecial incentive schemes in various areas with higher\npotential for development. These incentives are aimed at\nbringing new investments to a number of areas in order to\ndevelop internationally competitive economic zones, create\nemployment opportunities and promote sustainable\neconomic growth. They are also intended to bring about\nbalanced development of the whole country, bearing in\nmind that some areas were neglected during colonial times.\nThe streamlining of investment procedures, coupled\nwith political stability, has contributed to the attraction of\nlarge investments such as the Maputo Development\nCorridor project. The concept of development corridors is\nan initiative regarded as the cornerstone of the regional\nintegration strategy involving the countries of the\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC).\nOther transfrontier and national programmes in\npartnership with other countries of the region play a\nmajor role in this process. These include strategic projects\nsuch as the $1.3-billion Mozal aluminium smelter plant to\nbe completed within one year and the projected $2-billion\nMaputo iron and steel plant; both are part of the Maputo\nDevelopment Corridor project. The construction of\nanother $600-million iron and steel plant and the\nconstruction of a new port in Savane are envisaged as\npart of the Beira Corridor. Gas projects in the southern\nand central regions of Mozambique, as well as sugar\nplants and tourism, are other undertakings of great\nimportance being developed in Mozambique with the\nparticipation of other SADC countries.\nThe ambitious plan for the development of integrated\nprogrammes and projects in the Zambezi river basin, an\nextensive and potentially rich part of Mozambique,\ninclude the construction of a big hydroelectric dam at\nM\u2019panda M\u2019kua. The Zambezi valley covers more than\n200,000 square kilometres, nearly one third of our\nnational territory, and is endowed with a variety of\nresources of strategic importance, which we intend to\ndevelop in order to bring about sustainable development\nfor our country and for the SADC region. The Cabora\nBassa dam is already supplying electricity to Zimbabwe\nand to South Africa.\nMozambique will thus be in a position to use its\ngeostrategic location to make a greater contribution\ntowards the integrated development of the southern\nAfrican region; this is one of the building blocks of\ncontinental integration.\nWe believe that cooperative interaction involving\nvarious segments of society, including the private sector,\nis the key to the promotion of sustainable development\nthrough a smart partnership in which all stakeholders will\nbenefit.\nI come to this Assembly also as a messenger of the\npeoples of southern Africa, a region striving to develop as\na community of nations and peoples at peace with itself\nand with others and working towards balanced and\nintegrated development. Last month, the people and the\nGovernment of Mozambique were honoured to host the\nnineteenth Summit of Heads of State or Government of\nour community, the Southern African Development\nCommunity. The Maputo Summit was held on the theme\n2\n\n\n\u201cSADC in the next millennium: working together for peace,\nprogress and prosperity\u201d. It brought together heads of State\nor Government and other high-ranking representatives of all\nits 14 member States and, as guests, the heads of State of\nNigeria, Uganda and Rwanda, the Secretary-General of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the Executive\nSecretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, as well\nas other dignitaries representing a variety of other regional\nand international organizations.\nIn reviewing the progress made over the previous 12\nmonths, the Summit noted with satisfaction that the\neconomies of the Community continued to grow at in\naverage rate of 3 per cent, thanks to sound macroeconomic\npolicies implemented by member States and to the\nharmonization and coordination of activities towards\neconomic integration. However, in order to eradicate\npoverty, the region needs to grow at an average rate of 6\nper cent per year. To achieve this objective we need to\nmobilize more regional resources as well as to consolidate\nan enabling environment to increase the share of foreign\ndirect investment. We have once again resolved to commit\nourselves to ensure that all of our countries and peoples can\nbenefit as they must from the globalization process. To that\nend, efforts will continue to be made to consolidate peace\nthroughout the region, to harmonize sectoral policies and to\nimplement sound economic policies.\nDuring the Maputo Summit, the heads of State and\nGovernment signed three important documents: on wildlife,\non health and on productivity. They welcomed the recent\nentry into force of the SADC Protocols on Shared\nWatercourse Systems, on Energy, on Transport,\nCommunications and Meteorology, and on Combating Illicit\nDrug Trafficking, and the charter of the Regional Tourism\nOrganization of Southern Africa. The entry into force of the\nTrade Protocol on 1 January 2000 will bring additional\nopportunities and challenges to our region, and will enhance\nthe programme initiated a few years ago with the entry into\nforce of other protocols. All these legal instruments are,\nindeed, important steps towards regional integration leading\nto a better future.\nIn southern Africa, HIV/AIDS is spreading at an\nalarming rate. Governments in the SADC region, aware of\nthe far-reaching negative consequences, are seeking\ncollective and individual strategies to counter the spread of\nAIDS. In Lusaka, Zambia, we met at a regional level to\nlook into advisable approaches that can enhance awareness\nwithin each country and to consider measures that can help\nGovernments to mobilize financial and human resources to\nface this global threat. We have no choice: either we stop\nthe spread of AIDS or we risk putting the viability of our\nsocieties at stake, because in our region the most qualified\npeople are the ones at high risk.\nThis scenario foretells our future. Our economic,\nsocial and political development will remain on the\nhorizon, and the structures of our societies will be\nseriously undermined, unless effective, concrete steps are\ntaken. In this context, my Government very recently\nadopted a national strategy against HIV/AIDS.\nThe resolution on cooperation between SADC and\nthe United Nations to be adopted this year must reflect\nthe positive progress that has taken place within SADC,\nand stress the importance of greater interaction with the\nUnited Nations in all fields of common interest. At the\nsame time, our Community \u2014 which is built on\ndemocratic principles, equitable and sustainable\ndevelopment, improved living standards of citizens, free\nmovement of factors of production, goods and services \u2014\nremains equally committed to strengthening its\nrelationship with other regional organizations.\nThe search for a durable peace is still a constant\nobjective of the region. It is for this reason that we\nwelcome the progress made in the settlement of the\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The\nsigning of the agreement by all parties opens a new era\nfor the region and beyond. What is required now is for\nthe international community, particularly the United\nNations, to meet its responsibilities by sending, as\nexpeditiously as possible, peacekeeping forces with an\nappropriate mandate and adequate resources, under\nChapter VII of the Charter, for the achievement of lasting\npeace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\nWe hope that the progress to which I have referred\nto above will make a positive impact on the Angolan\nconflict. The people of Angola must be given the\nopportunity to live in peace and harmony. The\ninternational community has a moral and political\nobligation to assist the Angolans to reverse the\nhumanitarian tragedy which is unfolding in vast areas of\ntheir territory. At the same time, the international\ncommunity, while supporting the Government of Angola\nin restoring peace and stability in that country, must call\non Mr. Savimbi to abandon his aggressive and\nirresponsible action. In particular, the Security Council\nsanctions imposed on UNITA must be fully observed, in\norder to prevent further suffering in that SADC country.\nIn this context, we salute the positive work already done\n3\n\n\nby Ambassador Robert Fowler, Chairman of the Security\nCouncil sanctions committee, and we encourage him to\ncontinue with his work.\nThis is our vision of the future of Mozambique as an\nindividual country and also that of SADC as a whole.\nThe recurrence of conflicts in Africa has exacerbated\nthe plight of children as the main victims. The recent\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) summit, held in\nAlgiers, echoing the recommendations of the African\nConference on the Use of Children as Soldiers, held in\nMaputo in April this year, adopted a resolution calling,\ninter alia, for the elaboration of an international convention\noutlawing the use of children under 18 years of age in\narmed conflicts. We urge all members of the United\nNations to adhere to and support this initiative, which, in\nour view, must be associated with all other rights of the\nchild.\nWe believe that the implementation of that OAU\nresolution, together with the concept of \u201cchildren as zone\nof peace\u201d would constitute a valuable contribution to the\nprotection of children. In this regard, I commend the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary General on Children and\nArmed Conflict and non-governmental organizations for\ntheir relentless efforts to promote and ensure respect for the\nrights of the child.\nMoreover, the proliferation of small arms and light\nweapons, together with transnational crimes such as money\nlaundering and drug trafficking, constitute major sources of\ninstability for many countries, including my own. We in\nsouthern Africa are undertaking a coordinated action with\na view to addressing these challenges and bringing about\npeace and stability.\nIn May this year Maputo hosted the First Meeting of\nStates parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\nMines and on their Destruction. The Maputo Meeting was\nheld when thousands of innocent civilians were being\nmaimed in many parts of the world, including my own\ncountry. The Meeting adopted a Declaration calling upon us\nto rededicate ourselves in the struggle against these\ninsidious weapons, in fulfilment of our obligations under\nthe Ottawa Convention. More important, the Maputo\nMeeting offered a unique opportunity to remind the\ninternational community of the need to meet the targets set\nby the Convention. In four years we must destroy all\nanti-personnel mines in warehouses, and in ten years we\nmust complete the demining process in affected countries.\nAs we concluded in Maputo, these targets are\nnon-negotiable. What is negotiable is the ways and means\nfor the attainment of these objectives. We therefore call\nupon all States and organizations in a position to do so to\nensure that these goals are met. Failure to reach these\ngoals would undermine the credibility of the international\ncommunity and, above all, the universalization of the\nConvention. It is our earnest hope that the General\nAssembly will give additional impetus to the momentum\ncreated by the adoption of the Maputo Declaration.\nWe in southern Africa are disturbed about the low\nlevels of foreign direct investment in Africa. We are\ndeeply concerned about recent evidence presented by the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\nshowing a drastic reduction in official development\nassistance, in particular for Africa. More worrisome is the\nfact that the target of 0.7 per cent in official development\nassistance has never been entirely met, and, on the\ncontrary, it has reached only one third of the established\ntarget.\nLack of adequate funding has contributed to poor\nrealization of the goals set by major international\nconferences, including those contained in the Cairo\nProgramme of Action, which was reviewed during the\nrecently held twenty-first special session of the General\nAssembly on population and development.\nWithout political will there will be no sustainable\ndevelopment in the global economy, and the risk of the\nfurther marginalization of developing countries, with all\nof its negative consequences, will remain high.\nIn addition, the issue of external indebtedness\ncontinues to be the single most important obstacle to the\ndevelopment of many countries, particularly in Africa.\nEfforts must be made to ensure that the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative is accessible to the\ncountries in need.\nAs I speak on this issue, I must once again thank the\ninternational community for the assistance rendered to\nMozambique under this Initiative, as of last June. The fact\nof the matter, however, is that our debt burden continues\nto undermine our efforts to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment. We believe it is high time for the\ninternational community to start writing off the external\ndebt of those countries that have made visible and\n4\n\n\nsustainable progress in the implementation of tough\nstructural adjustment measures and political reforms. Such\na course of action would undoubtedly provide more\nincentives for other countries to undertake these measures\nand to redirect resources to the social sectors, in particular\nfor the provision of water and better education and to fight\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic.\nMy Government wishes to commend the 5 May\nAgreement signed by the Governments of Indonesia,\nPortugal and United Nations which culminated in the\nholding of a referendum in East Timor. We salute the\npeople of East Timor for the exemplary and orderly manner\nin which they participated in the referendum and for the\nclear and unequivocal way in which they decided for\nindependence. We are deeply saddened and gravely\nconcerned over the tragic developments that have followed\nthe announcement of the results of the referendum. We are\nparticularly distressed over the fact that massacres against\ninnocent civilians and indiscriminate destruction of property\nhave occurred, largely due to the failure by Indonesia to\nsecure order and by the international community to act\nexpeditiously.\nThe fact that the East Timor tragedy occurred when\nsimilar situations had been prevented not long ago leads us\nto believe in the existence of passivity and selectivity in\ndealing with issues that undermine international peace and\nsecurity. We nevertheless commend the decision taken by\nthe Security Council to send a mission to Jakarta and Dili\nand the subsequent actions taken with the cooperation of\nthe Government of Indonesia.\nAlong with restoring peace and stability, efforts must\nbe made to provide a speedy humanitarian response to\nassist the people who were displaced or became refugees as\na result of the unprecedented levels of violence we have\nwitnessed in that territory. The tragedy in East Timor\nunderlines the importance of translating into deeds the\nrelevant recommendations contained in the \u201cReport of the\nSecretary-General to the Security Council on the protection\nof civilians in armed conflict\u201d.\nMozambique has given its modest contribution to the\nUnited Nations Mission in East Timor and stands ready to\ncontinue to play a role in future efforts of the international\ncommunity.\nOn behalf of my Government and on my own behalf,\nI wish to seize this opportunity to convey our deepest\nsympathy to those who have lost their loved ones. It is our\nhope that their suffering will not be in vain, and that the\nUnited Nations and all parties will ensure the early\nimplementation of the results of the referendum.\nThe issue of East Timor reminds us of other people\nwho are striving for self-determination. We are\nencouraged by the latest positive developments that have\ntaken place in the Middle East. They confirm that, with\nthe necessary political will, taking into account the\ninterests of all parties to the conflict, peace is possible in\nthat region. Our task is to help the Palestinians and the\nIsraelis take maximum advantage of the momentum that\nhas been created as a result of the signing of the Sharm\nel-Sheik Memorandum, on 4 September 1999, following\nthe deadlock in the implementation of the Wye River\nMemorandum of 23 October 1998. Success in the\nimplementation of the current Memorandum depends on\nstrict observance of the principle of land for peace.\nRecent incidents along the common border between\nIndia and Pakistan are a source of great concern to all\npeace-loving countries. We call upon both Governments\nto exercise maximum restraint and to refrain from taking\nactions that might jeopardize further the already volatile\nsituation along their common border.\nIt is our earnest hope that the United Nations\nintervention in Kosovo will bring lasting peace and\nstability to that territory and the region. To this end\nMozambique is contributing with a small team of police\nofficers.\nWe equally hope that now that the Lockerbie issue\nis in the hands of justice, the Security Council will\nhonour its undertakings by lifting the sanctions on Libya.\nBoth the final settlement of this issue and the holding of\na referendum in Western Sahara will have a positive\nimpact on the development of Africa.\nWe are at the threshold of the next century, and the\nchallenges ahead are enormous. They require stronger\ncommitment and greater international cooperation. In this\nconnection, we wish to commend the Secretary-General\nfor organizing the Millennium Assembly and the\nmillennium summit for the year 2000. Indeed, there could\nbe no better way to inaugurate the new era than by\nassembling all world leaders to reflect on the strategies\nand policies that will govern our planet in the next\nmillennium. Whatever themes we choose to debate, they\nshould include the promotion of a culture of peace within\nnations, regions and throughout the world, for this will\nallow the realization of all other objectives, in particular\nthe eradication of poverty, promotion of development,\n5\n\n\nprotection of human rights and meeting the challenges of\nglobalization.\nIt is therefore our hope that the forthcoming historic\ngatherings will signal the beginning of the crystallization of\nthe process of building a better and safer world by\nproducing meaningful strategies, actions and policies that\nwill guide the United Nations of tomorrow. We agree that\nthese high-level events should not result merely in the\nadoption of declarations that cannot be translated into\nconcrete actions for both the United Nations and\nGovernments.\nWe should therefore aim at pragmatic, action-oriented\nand implementable decisions. Then, and only then, shall we\nmeet the aspirations of the founding fathers of our universal\nOrganization.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at\nthe outset to extend to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab the sincere\ncongratulations of my delegation on his election to the\npresidency of this session. We are confident that his well-\nknown experience and abilities will lead this session to a\nsuccessful conclusion. We assure him of the full\ncooperation of our delegation to achieve that objective.\nWe also wish to express our appreciation to his\npredecessor for his valuable efforts, which led to the\nsuccess of the previous session. By the same token, our\nappreciation also goes to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, for his efforts at the helm\nof the Organization.\nI also wish to welcome our newest Members \u2014 the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga.\nMr. President, heeding your appeal to be very brief,\nI will not touch on all the points detailed in my statement\nbefore the Assembly, and I ask that the edited version be\nplaced on record.\nSince I last spoke before the Assembly one year ago,\nthe Sudan has witnessed numerous developments in the\npolitical, economic and social fields. A permanent\nconstitution was endorsed by an overwhelming majority\nof the people in a popular and free referendum. This\nconstitution guarantees for the Sudanese people all\npolitical and civil freedoms and rights, including the right\n27\n\n\nto form political parties and social and cultural\norganizations.\nDespite the difficulties faced by Sudan, as a result of\nboth the war and natural disasters, it has been able, through\nits own efforts, to restructure its economy to meet the\nrequirements of the free market. All this took place in the\nnear-total absence of foreign aid. The Sudan has also\nstarted to exploit its natural resources, both agricultural and\nmineral, in particular oil, which we started exporting on 30\nAugust last. Oil revenues will contribute to strengthening\nnational efforts for socio-economic development.\nIn the economic field, these endeavours have\ncontributed to reversing a number of the short-term\nnegative effects of the economic liberalization policies.\nThese reform measures have so far helped to achieve an 8\nper cent total growth rate and to reduce the rate of inflation\nto 13 per cent, and have led the International Monetary\nFund to commend this remarkable achievement. In order to\nalleviate the economic burdens resulting from economic\nreform policies, our Government has adopted a number of\nmeasures to assist the more vulnerable groups and low-\nincome citizens through social assistance funds, the\nprovision of \u201csoft\u201d loans and the establishment of small\nproductive projects for youth and women.\nIn the search for peace in southern Sudan, the\nGovernment accepted the Declaration of Principles as a\nbasis for its negotiations with the rebels within the\nframework of the Intergovernmental Authority on\nDevelopment (IGAD). It also declared a partial ceasefire,\nas it had repeatedly done, in order to ensure the delivery of\nrelief assistance to its citizens affected by the war.\nSubsequently, we came to the conclusion that the most\neffective way to show our seriousness about arriving at a\ngenuine and lasting solution to this humanitarian tragedy\nwas to ensure the cessation of all hostilities. The\nGovernment therefore took its recent initiative to establish\na general and comprehensive ceasefire while continuing the\nnegotiations through IGAD, with the assistance of our\nIGAD partners. However, those efforts by my Government\nwere met by prevarication and were not taken seriously by\nthe other side. The failure of the rebel movement to accept\na comprehensive ceasefire is proof of its lack of interest\nand seriousness in searching for a solution to the problem,\nwhich has enriched its leaders at the expense of the\nSudanese people in general and of our southern citizens in\nparticular.\nThe Sudan looks forward to a more effective role by\nIGAD, the partners of IGAD and the Egyptian and Libyan\nconciliation initiative, in support of the peace efforts. The\ncall for a comprehensive ceasefire has also been endorsed\nby the United Nations and the international community.\nWe are grateful for and appreciate that support. Yet the\nprocess needs to be given further impetus and support if\nan environment conducive to the establishment of peace\nis to be created and all the obstacles in its way are to be\nremoved.\nIn this context, we call upon the international\ncommunity to take punitive measures against the rebel\nGarang similar to those taken against Savimbi in Angola,\nin order to persuade him to join the peace effort. We also\ncall for continued support for the Government initiative\naimed at achieving a comprehensive ceasefire, through\nbringing pressure to bear on the rebel movement to accept\nthat initiative and to show some seriousness in the\nnegotiations in order to find a solution to the problem.\nFurthermore, demands must continue to be made for the\nhanding over of the remains of the four relief workers\nmurdered by the movement last April.\nWith regard to the practices of the rebel movement,\nI should like to speak about developments in the\nhumanitarian situation, which continues to deteriorate in\nthe south of the country despite relative improvements in\nBahr el-Ghazal and other areas. From this rostrum, I\nwould like to express our thanks and appreciation to the\ncountries and organizations that continue to provide relief\nand humanitarian assistance to those affected in the\nSudan, whether directly or through Operation Lifeline\nSudan. We believe that there is a need for the gradual\ntransition from relief to development in the areas that\nenjoy stability, security and peace now that the Khartoum\npeace agreement and the Fashoda accord have been\nsigned.\nWe call upon the donor countries and organizations\nto make contributions to the consolidated appeal for the\nSudan for 1999, in view of the noticeable decline in its\nresources, which last June amounted to only 31 per cent\nof requirements. We also emphasize that it is important\nnot to allow political posturing to get in the way of\nhumanitarian and relief work. There is also a need to\navoid selectivity in dealing with humanitarian issues,\nwhich affect the lives of peoples and individuals.\nThe Sudan would like to inform the Assembly of its\nfull commitment to a general and comprehensive ceasefire\nthroughout southern Sudan for humanitarian reasons and\nas a means of paving the way for peace negotiations. We\nhope that the other party will respond positively so that\n28\n\n\nwe can begin to take practical steps to disengage the forces\nand monitor the ceasefire. The Government will allocate a\nlarge part of its oil revenues for humanitarian and\ndevelopment needs in the south. It will also allocate part of\nthis year's grain harvest for distribution by United Nations\nagencies to the needy population in the south. The war has\ncontinued for a long time, and we appreciate the role\nplayed by the international community in extending\nhumanitarian assistance. That situation cannot go on\nforever; the one and only solution to the crisis is a peaceful\none.\nThe conflicts in Africa have brought untold suffering\nand hardships, to the peoples of the continent. One of the\ngreatest problems is that of the more than 8 million\nrefugees who live under extremely difficult circumstances.\nIn its search to put an end to the suffering of the refugees\nand to find radical solutions to the problem, the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) decided to convene\nthe first ministerial meeting of the committee on refugees\nand internally displaced persons. That important meeting\nwas held last December in Khartoum with the active\nparticipation of the sisterly African States, the relevant\nUnited Nations bodies, the regional organizations\nconcerned, the International Committee of the Red Cross\nand other non-governmental organizations. The meeting\nadopted the Khartoum Declaration, which contained an\nassessment of the problems facing refugees and displaced\npersons with a view to addressing the underlying causes of\nthese problems and to establishing favourable conditions for\nthe restoration of peace and stability in order to encourage\nthe voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced\npersons to their homes in safety and dignity. From this\nrostrum, we appeal to the international community and the\nrelevant organizations to continue to provide support for the\nStates affected by these problems so as to ensure the\nprompt and effective implementation of the Khartoum\nDeclaration and its recommendations with regard to\nrefugees and internally displaced persons.\nWe call for the renunciation of selectivity in dealing\nwith the question of humanitarian assistance, human rights\nand democracy at the international level. We also appeal to\nStates to avoid politicizing these questions and using them\nas a pretext for interference in the internal affairs of others.\nWe are eager to see those lofty principles applied\neffectively while preserving the principle of the sovereignty,\nsecurity and territorial integrity of States. In this context,\nwe should like to draw attention to the cooperation of the\nGovernment of the Sudan with the United Nations in the\ndelivery of relief assistance to the affected population in the\nsouth, as well as to the recent visit of the United Nations\nmission to the Nuba Mountain region to assess the\nhumanitarian needs there.\nIn his report on the work of the Organization and his\nopening statement before this session, the\nSecretary-General reflected the international concern\nabout the expansion and intensification of civil wars and\nother conflicts in various regions and the human tragedies\nand physical and economic destruction that result from\nsuch wars. We share the Secretary-General's concern on\nthis matter. We reaffirm the importance of maximizing\ncollective efforts to eliminate the causes of conflicts\nbefore they erupt and of using all available means to put\nan end to them.\nWe believe, however, that any actions taken or\nmeans used must have the consent and agreement of the\nState concerned and must be within the framework of\ninternational laws and standards, particularly those of the\nUnited Nations Charter. In the absence of a transparent,\ndemocratic and just international order, moving outside\nthat framework and calling for interference in the internal\naffairs of States will only lead to chaos and the hegemony\nof the powerful over the weak.\nPresident Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the current Chairman\nof the OAU, summed up the fears and concerns of the\nsmall and weak States in this regard by saying that we\nremain very sensitive to any encroachment on our\nsovereignty, not only because it constitutes our last line\nof defence against the laws of an unjust world but\nbecause we do not participate effectively in the\ndecision-making process in the Security Council or in the\nmonitoring of the implementation of these decisions.\nModern history is full of examples of such unjust\ninterpretation and application of laws and resolutions. I\nwould like to highlight just one example: the unjust and\nunjustified attack by the United States on the al-Shifa\npharmaceutical factory and the inability of the Security\nCouncil to take a decision on Sudan's request to send a\nmission to investigate the American allegations\nconcerning the factory.\nThe ideas put forward by the Secretary-General in\nhis report require further consultations and consideration\nby the General Assembly and other United Nations\nbodies, with the participation of all Member States and\nwithin the framework of the Charter and international\nlaws and norms.\n29\n\n\nUndoubtedly, the continued imbalance in international\nrelations has strengthened the trend towards unilateral\nsupremacy and double standards. This imbalance has had\nnegative effects on international peace, security and\nstability. It has also created an unhealthy atmosphere which\npromotes the interests of certain States while ignoring,\nindeed belittling, the interests and rights of the weaker\nmembers of the international community. Hence, the Sudan\nhas always supported the call for the establishment of a\nbalanced and diverse international order, an order that\nrespects the specific religious, historical and cultural\ncharacteristics of peoples and that protects their natural\nright to choose their own social, economic and political\nsystems in harmony with their cultural attributes.\nThe fact that the Sudan is being targeted by the United\nStates Administration is not open to question. Indeed, the\nUnited States Administration itself does not deny this. It\nhas taken many measures aimed at destabilizing Sudan and\nits security, and has pursued a declared policy of isolating\nthe Sudan through the provision of military assistance to\nsome of its neighbours. It has consistently voted against the\nSudan in the international financial institutions and has\nsponsored resolutions condemning and denouncing the\nSudan at the United Nations and its specialized agencies. It\nhas also attempted to smear the Sudan\u2019s image in the\ninternational arena. It has made baseless accusations against\nthe Sudan, charging it with involvement in international\nterrorism and placing its name on its list of what it calls\nStates sponsoring terrorism. Furthermore, the United States\nAdministration imposed unilateral economic sanctions on\nthe Sudan despite the international community\u2019s clear and\ndeclared position on such coercive economic measures. All\nthese actions have been taken by the United States on the\nbasis of totally false and unfounded allegations and\naccusations. The United States Administration has never\nbeen able to produce a single piece of evidence to prove its\nallegations.\nThe unjust United States actions and accusations\nagainst the Sudan culminated last year in the bombing and\ndestruction of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in\nKhartoum. A whole year has elapsed since I addressed the\nGeneral Assembly from this rostrum about the flagrant\naggression by the United States of America against that\nfactory, which was privately owned and financed by the\nbank of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern\nAfrica (COMESA). Has any action been taken since the\nSudan explained to the international community the\nenormity of the mistake perpetrated by the United States\nagainst the Sudanese people, depriving them of a main\nsource of medication for their innocent children and for the\nmany refugees and displaced persons that are given\nshelter by the Sudan? The Sudan continues to demand\nand to expect justice and redress from the Security\nCouncil as the organ with the primary responsibility for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nImmediately after the bombing of the factory last August,\nSudan requested the Security Council to send a mission\nto ascertain the facts regarding the factory\u2019s ownership\nand output, and to verify the allegations invoked by the\nUnited States to attempt to justify its aggression. The\nnon-aligned countries, the Arab Group, the African Group\nand the members of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference all wrote letters to the Security Council\nsupporting the Sudan\u2019s request. Most regrettably, the\nCouncil remained unable to act. The United States\nprevented the Council from discharging its most basic\nduty in this regard, namely to investigate the allegations\nthat the United States used to try to justify its armed\naggression.\nSince I addressed the Assembly last year, dozens of\narticles and reports have been published in major United\nStates newspapers. Numerous statements have been made\nby United States congressional officials and former\nCentral Intelligence Agency experts, along with a number\nof academic studies by specialized institutes in the United\nStates and other countries, all of which affirm that the Al-\nShifa factory was a pharmaceutical factory producing\nhuman and veterinary medicines. They also affirm that\nthe United States made a terrible mistake by destroying\nthat factory, which had links to the United Nations: the\nSecurity Council had authorized the factory to export\nmedicines to Iraq within the framework of the oil-for-food\nprogramme. The Sudan referred all these studies, articles\nand declarations to the Security Council. This year, the\nowner of the factory hired some of the best known United\nStates experts in the field of chemical weapons to\nexamine the factory and ascertain the truth about its\noutput. The experts took samples, which were examined\nin the most sophisticated and advanced laboratories in\nEurope and the United States. The conclusion was that the\nfactory produced nothing other than medications for\nhuman and veterinary use. The Sudan also formed its own\nspecialized scientific committee composed of university\nprofessors in the Sudan to examine the factory. The\ncommittee issued a report affirming once again that the\nUnited States allegations about the factory had no logical\nor scientific basis.\nA most important development then followed: a\ndecision by the United States Departments of Justice and\nof the Treasury to unfreeze the assets of the owner of the\n30\n\n\nfactory in the United States. That reaffirms that the\njustifications put forward by the United States for the\nbombing of the Al-Shifa factory were baseless. There is no\nphysical evidence to prove them. Rather, they were based\non misleading intelligence information. The United States\nallegations that the factory is owned by terrorist groups are\nalso baseless and lack any supporting evidence or proof.\nThe United States decision to unfreeze the assets of the\nfactory\u2019s owner came after the United States Administration\nascertained that he had no connection with terrorism. This\nin itself is clear and irrefutable proof of what Sudan has\nbeen saying before the international community all along.\nWhen the matter was put before the Security Council\nlast year and when the Sudan requested the dispatch of a\nfact-finding mission, the United States objected on the\npretext that it would settle the question bilaterally with the\nSudan. A whole year has elapsed and all we have received\nis more procrastination. This led me last August to send\nanother letter to the President of the Security Council\nasking him again to dispatch a fact-finding mission. We\nappeal to the United Nations, as it represents all countries,\nbig and small, to prove its impartiality and objectivity; we\nappeal to the Security Council to send a mission to uncover\nthe facts about the destruction of the Al-Shifa\npharmaceutical factory. The United Nations should request\nthe United States not to object to the dispatch of such\nmission if it is confident of the information and the causes\nthat led it to bomb the factory.\nThe bombing of the pharmaceutical factory took the\nlives of a number of Sudanese. It deprived hundreds of\nworkers of their livelihood. It also deprived the Sudanese\npeople and the refugees from neighbouring countries of\ntheir main source of medication and vaccines. All this\nmakes the international community wonder about the\nsincerity of the United States commitment to human rights.\nIn their 1998 and 1999 ministerial declarations, the Group\nof 77 and China called for applying justice in this case in\naccordance with the United Nations Charter and\ninternational law. This act of aggression was a unilateral act\nunacceptable to the international community. The\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries condemned this act at\nits Durban Summit and at subsequent ministerial meetings.\nPersisting in targeting the Sudan, the United States\nAdministration recently appointed a special envoy for the\nSudan with specific objectives and terms of reference.\nSudan was not party to the choice of that envoy or to the\ndefinition of the objectives and terms of reference of his\nmission.\nClearly, the way in which the United States\nAdministration chose this envoy reflects a condescending\nattitude and is an act of cultural arrogance inconsistent\nwith the spirit of the United Nations Charter, which\ngoverns relations between States. At the time when the\nUnited States claims to be concerned with the problems\nof the Sudan, we find that it has blocked, to a large\ndegree, all channels of bilateral contact. When announcing\nthe appointment of the special envoy, the United States\nspokesman affirmed that his mandate would not include\nthe bilateral aspect of relations between the two countries.\nHere we would like to pose a question: how could a State\nappoint an envoy to another State without having his task\ninclude their bilateral relations? This is indeed bizarre,\nsince the basic disagreements between us and the United\nStates are of a bilateral nature. Such disagreements led\nthe United States to use force to destroy a pharmaceutical\nfactory, and then it refused international arbitration in the\nmatter. It is also bizarre that the United States\nAdministration has given its envoy to the Sudan the task\nof dealing with the questions of relief, human rights and\npeace in the southern Sudan. I say this is bizarre because\nthese questions are dealt with either in the United Nations\nor at the regional level. The first question, relief, and the\nsecond, human rights, are dealt with in the relevant\norgans of the United Nations, respectively, the Office for\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the\nCommission on Human Rights. The issue of peace in the\nsouthern Sudan is being dealt with at the regional level by\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\nwith the support of the Organization of African Unity, the\nUnited Nations and the group of IGAD partners, of which\nthe United States is a member. The Sudan will continue\nto follow closely the steps taken by the United States\nAdministration and will take the necessary measures to\nprotect its national interests. Here I would like to reaffirm\nthat the Government of the Sudan is willing to settle its\ndifferences with the United States of America through\ndialogue and the initiatives already taken in this regard,\nwith a view to breaking the stalemate. This interest\ncontinues even after the cruel American aggression\nagainst the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory. Yet this\ninterest of ours must be met with an objective response\nby the other party. Hence, we call upon the United\nNations and peace-loving countries to urge the United\nStates Administration to take positive steps towards the\nnormalization of relations with the Sudan and to desist\nfrom interference in its internal affairs, which only results\nin prolonging the civil war and death and suffering for the\nSudanese people.\n31\n\n\nThe Sudan believes that the United States, as a great\nPower concerned with world and regional peace, could play\nan important role in the settlement of the Sudan\u2019s problems.\nBut for the United States to play that role, we demand that\nit show neutrality and desist from injustice and aggression.\nThe delegation of the Sudan is of the view that the\nMillennium Assembly, in which all world leaders will\nparticipate, is an important occasion for the United Nations\nto enhance its role and its neutrality. In this regard, we\npropose that the Millennium Summit declaration contain the\nfollowing: a reaffirmation of the importance of peaceful\ncoexistence; respect for plurality and diversity and the\npromotion of dialogue between various cultures and\nreligions; a reaffirmation of the need to achieve security\nand stability by resorting to the United Nations for the\nsettlement of conflicts between States; a reaffirmation of\nthe need to coordinate international efforts for the\nachievement of development and the eradication of poverty;\nand a reaffirmation of the resolve of the international\ncommunity to combat terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations. In this regard, we would like to state our\nunderstanding that the adoption of a declaration by the\nMillennium Summit will not detract from the United\nNations Charter, which embodies lofty and noble principles\nvalid for all time.\nIn conclusion, most of the people of the Sudan are\nadherents of Islam and Christianity. Thus, the Sudan has a\nrich legacy of tolerance and coexistence between religions\nand cultures. Christianity, the religion of Jesus Christ \u2014\npeace be upon him \u2014 teaches fraternity, tolerance and\nsuccour for the weak. Islam, the last of the revealed\nreligions, has brought an integrated way of life that upholds\nthe value of freedom and thought. It also consecrates the\nprinciple of coexistence between religions and cultures. The\nHoly Koran states,\n\u201cInvite (all) to the Way\nOf thy Lord with wisdom\nAnd beautiful preaching;\nAnd argue with them\nIn ways that are best\nAnd most gracious.\u201d\n(The Holy Koran, XVI:125).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I\nwish first of all to express our satisfaction at your election,\nwhich has accorded you the privilege of conducting the\ndebate at this fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.\nI wish also to express our conviction that your recognized\ndiplomatic and political experience will lead to creative\nresults.\nI should also like to pay a tribute to the Foreign\nMinister of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, Mr. Didier\nOpertti, whose diligence at the helm of the Assembly last\nsession not only bore witness to his professional abilities,\nbut also confirmed the commitment of that American\nnation to the principles on which the United Nations is\nbased.\nExactly three years ago, on first taking the floor\nhere, I began by announcing that we were very close to\nachieving peace in my country. Today I return to this\nAssembly four months before my term of office expires\nto summarize all that has transpired during the past three\nyears of changes, many of which Guatemalans could not\nimagine when we signed the peace accords on 29\nDecember 1996.\nThe first and most fundamental change that has\ntaken place has been in the hearts and minds of\nGuatemalans, as can be seen in the way that the former\nguerrillas have been brought back in from the cold and\nare no longer outlaws, and in the return of the refugees.\nAfter over three decades of an internal armed\nconflict marked by extreme cruelty, a conflict which was,\namong other things, an expression of profound and deep-\nrooted political and ideological intolerance, all the\nindications were that reintegrating the former guerrillas\nwas going to be a complicated and dangerous process.\nNevertheless, against all expectations, from the moment\nthe ceasefire took hold until the former guerrillas took\npart in the electoral process, reintegration has taken place\nin an atmosphere not only of security but also of\nopenness and tolerance on the part of all sectors of\nsociety. I should also like to highlight here the attitude of\nthe Guatemalan army, which involved itself fully in the\nnegotiating process and made fundamental contributions\nto it and then, once the peace accords had been signed,\nnot only complied fully with their provisions but was also\npositive in its attitude towards them. By acting in\naccordance with the spirit of the accords and not just the\nletter, it encouraged reconciliation and peaceful\ncoexistence with its former adversaries.\nAt the local level, both the refugees and the former\nguerrillas have returned to their towns and villages and\ntoday, in many of those places, development committees\nhave been set up composed of returnees, former\nguerrillas, former members of the civil patrols and former\nmembers of the armed forces, all of them working\ntogether to improve the lot of their communities by\nstriking at the roots of their problems.\n9\n\n\nAlso, at the public policy level, peace has meant social\ninvestment on a scale and of a quality unprecedented in our\ncountry\u2019s history. That investment has been effected in\naccordance with the social ethic and the development logic\nof the peace accords, and have also met the specific targets\nset in those accords.\nThus we have gone farther than anyone has before.\nWe have gone as far as the most remote villages and\nhamlets and brought them education, health services, roads,\nelectricity and water, though we know that much remains\nto be done. What we have achieved so far has already\nshown that if we can consolidate the opening to progress\nwhich our country has made, we can quickly remedy the\neffects of so very many years of backwardness.\nWe are also investing in the infrastructure and\nfacilities needed for production in order to improve the\ncountry\u2019s competitive position in the globalized world of\ntoday. I would say that these two fundamental aspects I\nhave mentioned, the reintegration of the former guerrilla\nforces into society and social investment, contain the\nfundamental elements on which a new Guatemala will be\nbased.\nInherent to the processes through which the former\nguerrillas have been reintegrated and the refugees have\nbeen repatriated are reconciliation, tolerance, respect for\ndiversity and legal or otherwise agreed solutions to\nconflicts.\nThe main thrust of public investment embodies a\nsocial ethic based on the common good and a tangible\neffort to improve access to opportunities for the least\nregarded sectors. Thus both processes form the foundations\nfor maintaining and strengthening peaceful coexistence\nbetween Guatemalans, which has been the most significant\nqualitative result of the peace accords of December 1996:\non the one hand, a peaceful settlement to the conflicts and,\non the other, increasing efforts to redress the most serious\ninjustices and opportunities for development for all.\nNevertheless, our internal endeavours have taken place\nin an adverse world economic context. As in almost every\nother Latin American country, the economy in Guatemala\nis experiencing a slowdown and a financial squeeze.\nTogether with the effects of the crises in various regions\nand the persistent financial speculation that is constantly\nchipping away at productive, job-creating investment, the\nprices of our main export products have plummeted while\nthe cost of our imports, particularly oil, have gone up\nsubstantially.\nThe negative impact of this situation particularly\naffected the strata of our society who are least capable of\nfending for themselves. This trend which is mainly caused\nby external factors, has been compounded by the direct\nand indirect effects of hurricane Mitch, which struck our\nsister countries of Honduras and Nicaragua particularly\nhard but also brought serious destruction to our own\ncountry and seriously affected trade within the Central\nAmerican region, on which we are highly dependent.\nAs a result, the State\u2019s efforts to boost development\ncannot be as successful as they might otherwise be,\nparticularly when compared with our people\u2019s\nexpectations. We have created investment incentives,\nbeginning with political stability, and going on to\neducation and training, creation of infrastructure and\nprovision of basic services. What has been accomplished\nin the way of public works and public services has\ngenerated tens of thousands of jobs. The work done on\nthe roads and highways and on the electrical grid and\ntelecommunications has significantly expanded the main\nbases of our economy. As a result of all these and other\nendeavours, the effects in our country of the negative\neconomic developments taking place abroad have been\nless severe than in our sister countries that have stopped\ngrowing or have experienced negative economic growth.\nWe have created a foundation that will have a\npositive impact on the standard of living of the people,\nand especially of the neediest. These beneficial results\nwill continue if we stay the course.\nFor even if we must continue to swim against the\ncurrent of the world economy, which is temporarily\nimpoverishing us, we have available internal resources\nand can count on ongoing processes that are likely to\nproduce structural change, provided that the efforts made\nover the past four years are consolidated, sustained and\ncontinued.\nThe Peace Agreements are, for Guatemala, the\nstrategic elements of a profound, comprehensive and all-\nembracing effort to change our country. They represent\nthe basic guidelines for the fundamental transformations\nnecessary to build a different Guatemala, one that is\nprofoundly democratic and committed to the integral and\nsustainable development of its people.\nThe peace agenda is equivalent to the\ndemocratization of the country, which is conceived as a\nfunctional and participatory democracy encompassing the\npolitical and cultural domains. A functioning democracy\n10\n\n\ninvolves reform of the State, and its participatory character\nis what enables it to become a social democracy, which in\nturn strengthens its functionality.\nIn this respect, I cannot fail to mention the substantial\nincrease in opportunities for popular participation that has\nresulted from the establishment, as mandated in the peace\nagreements, of over 15 multi-sectoral commissions, as well\nas the measures taken to extend and complement structures\nfor the elaboration and adoption of public policy.\nAlso noteworthy are the efforts that have been made\nto decentralize the State and strengthen local institutions\nwith a view to a rapprochement between the Government\nand the people and to giving them a greater say in public\naffairs.\nAnother fundamental process consists in the efforts\nbeing made to build a multicultural, plurilingual and multi-\nethnic nation. This involves extremely complex work to roll\nback centuries of exclusion, discrimination and racism, and\nit presupposes profound cultural changes towards the\ntolerance and respect necessary for our cultural diversity to\nblossom and make the many contributions it can to our\nnational development without putting the unity of the\ncountry at risk.\nIt has also been essential to redefine national security\nand defence. This has involved re-examining principles and\nrethinking the public security, national defence and\nintelligence apparatuses. We have made progress in the\nestablishment of a new national civil police. This is a\nprofessional body that is trained to focus on the protection\nand defence of the individual and collective rights of\ncitizens and is sensitive to, and respectful of, ethnic,\ncultural and linguistic diversities.\nWe have also further reduced our military forces,\ncutting back the budget and dismantling bases and other\nimportant elements of the military infrastructure, as\nprovided for in the Peace Agreements, with the full\nconcurrence and participation of the army.\nThe progress made in various areas is a source of\nlegitimate pride for all Guatemalans as well as for the\nStates that, as the Group of Friends, have supported us, and\nin particular for the Organization, whose role as our partner\nhas enabled us to maintain optimism and hope in the\ndifficult task of building peace and development.\nGuatemala has been able to benefit from the essence\nof what the Organization does best: make available its good\noffices and serve as a facilitator in the various phases of\nthe management of a conflict, act as an impartial\nverifying agency, provide unconditional cooperation and\nact as a trusted partner in assisting Member States to\nresolve problems.\nI wish to stress the paramount importance of the role\nthat has been played in Guatemala by the United Nations\nVerification Mission in Guatemala, with a view to\nensuring progress in the implementation of the Peace\nAgreements. The United Nations presence in our country\nand the exercise of its advisory and verification functions\nwith impartiality and wisdom have contributed\nsignificantly to the implementation of the various phases\nof the commitments in the Peace Agreements.\nOur Government attaches similar importance to other\ninitiatives that the United Nations has undertaken in\nsupport of Guatemala\u2019s society. Our country is a testing\nground for a new assistance framework that aims, among\nother things, to impart greater consistency to the work of\nthe various agencies of the Organization. Our own\nevaluation of the assistance we have received is highly\npositive.\nThe number of activities the Organization is carrying\nout in Guatemala is quite high and increasing. It is\ntherefore only fair to emphasize that the various agencies\nhave been able to mobilize a considerable amount of\nadditional resources from external sources.\nAnother positive contribution of the cooperation in\nquestion is the tangible impact it has had, through both its\ndirect effects and its catalytic function in respect of public\nexpenditure and the policies carried out by the\nGovernment.\nI therefore wish to convey our deep appreciation to\nthe States Members of the United Nations, which have at\nall times supported the efforts of the various sectors of\nGuatemalan society to restore peace. Their political\nbacking has been fundamental to the success of those\nefforts. I also extend my gratitude to the Secretariat, and\nin particular to Mr. Kofi Annan, as well as to the\nexecutive organs of the various agencies of the United\nNations system, which have interpreted the mandates of\nthe Organization and have demonstrated efficiency in\ntheir execution.\nFinally, we fully appreciate the value of the work of\nother multilateral bodies such as the World Bank, the\nInternational Monetary Fund, the Organization of\n\n\n\nAmerican States, and in particular the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, which has played a dual role as direct\nsource of financial assistance and organizer of the\nConsultative Group for Guatemala.\nThe success achieved by intergovernmental bodies in\nconnection with the Guatemalan peace process is our basic\nreason for reiterating our conviction that cooperation\nbetween nations is indispensable in order to achieve peace\nand development for our peoples. That is why Guatemala\nremains firmly committed to the promotion of various kinds\nof multicultural and multi-ethnic undertakings, not only in\nthe framework of the United Nations but also with respect\nto various endeavours at the regional and hemispheric\nlevels.\nOne of the boldest and most challenging initiatives is\nthe one being undertaken by Central America to achieve the\neconomic and political integration of the region. Like the\nother States that compose the Central American Integration\nSystem, Guatemala is convinced that this strategic\nassociation strengthens the region in its relations with an\nincreasingly competitive world, and it reiterates its\ncommitment to continue promoting actions to enhance the\neffectiveness of Central American integration.\nFor those same reasons, Guatemala wishes to express\nits unreserved support for the strengthening of our\nOrganization. We are firmly convinced that the United\nNations must be the principal forum responsible for\nmaintaining world peace. That is why we welcome the\nSecurity Council\u2019s prompt response to the crisis in East\nTimor. We believe that United Nations involvement in such\nsituations confirms its functions as the sole organ\ncompetent to decide on the action to be taken in cases\nwhere the principle of non-intervention needs to be\ninterpreted with due regard to the existence of violations of\ninternational humanitarian law.\nIn order that such functions be performed adequately,\nwe need an Organization that is strong and flexible, with\nmechanisms and procedures that are capable of responding\nto the challenges of new world realities. We must\naccordingly reflect more deeply on the ideal design\nstructure of an Organization that must compensate for the\nregional imbalances of power that have arisen in the post-\ncold-war world. This also means that we should pursue the\nreform of the Secretariat and of the intergovernmental\nbodies of the United Nations, including the Security\nCouncil.\nWe believe also that the United Nations should\ncontinue to deal with the greatest unfinished task of the\ntwentieth century: wiping out world poverty. Together\nwith the multilateral financial agencies, our Organization\nshould play an indispensable role in ensuring that the\nbenefits of globalization are distributed on a democratic\nbasis, and that if we must all be exposed to the risks, we\nshould all be entitled to enjoy the benefits.\nGuatemala appreciates the Organization\u2019s\ncontributions to promoting an international climate\nenabling disputes between and within States to be settled\npeacefully. As a State Member of the United Nations,\nGuatemala has always resolved all its international\ndisputes in a peaceful manner and in accordance with\ninternational law.\nWe wish to reiterate to the Assembly our concern\nabout the situation of the 22 million inhabitants of the\nRepublic of China in Taiwan whose aspirations for\nrepresentation in international organizations have not been\nsatisfied.\nWe welcome the new impetus that has been seen in\nthe Middle East peace negotiations and we trust that they\nwill lead to a comprehensive resolution of all the\noutstanding issues there. After so many years of conflict,\nthe countries of the region, including a future Palestinian\nState, deserve to live in peace, security, harmony and\nprosperity.\nThis is the last statement that I will make to the\nGeneral Assembly as the representative of my country,\nand I should like to conclude by reiterating my people\u2019s\ngratitude for the solidarity shown to us in our efforts\ntowards peace and development. The support which the\npeoples and Governments represented here have bestowed\nupon us, together with the strenuous work of the United\nNations and its agencies, make us feel honoured, indebted\nand motivated.\nThe fruit that our peace process has manifestly borne\nin such a short time provides clear evidence of the\nvalidity and relevance of the system and of the\nfundamental, indispensable and inestimable importance of\nthe efforts of the Guatemalan people within the country\nand of the unquestionable effectiveness of international\nfriendship in the form of respectful, timely and effective\ncooperation in building a more democratic country and a\nmore equitable and united world.\n12\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Today, we look ahead to the\nnew millennium. And at this last General Assembly of the\ntwentieth century, we look back on a century that taught\nus much of what we need to know about the promise of\ntomorrow. We have learned a great deal over the last one\nhundred years: how to produce enough food for a\ngrowing world population; how human activity affects the\nenvironment; the mysteries of the human gene. An\ninformation revolution now holds the promise of universal\naccess to knowledge. We have learned that open markets\ncreate more wealth, that open societies are more just. We\nhave learned how to come together, through the United\nNations and other institutions, to advance common\ninterests and values.\nYet for all our intellectual and material advances, the\ntwentieth century has been deeply scarred by enduring\nhuman failures: by greed and lust for power, by\nhot-blooded hatreds and stone-cold hearts. At century\u2019s\nend, modern developments magnify greatly the dangers of\nthese timeless flaws. Powerful forces still resist\nreasonable efforts to put a human face on the global\neconomy, to lift the poor, or to heal the earth\u2019s\nenvironment. Primitive claims of racial, ethnic or religious\nsuperiority, when married to advanced weaponry and\n2\n\n\nterrorism, threaten to destroy the greatest potential for\nhuman development in history, even as they make a\nwasteland of the soul.\nTherefore, we look to the future with hope, but with\nunanswered questions. In the new millennium, will nations\nbe divided by ethnic and religious conflicts? Will the\nnation-state itself be imperiled by them, or by terrorism? Or\nwill we keep coming closer together instead, while enjoying\nthe normal differences that make life more interesting? In\nthe new century, how will patriotism be defined \u2014 as faith\nin a dream worth living, or as fear and loathing of other\npeople\u2019s dreams? Will we be free of the fear of weapons of\nmass destruction, or forced to teach our grandchildren how\nto survive a nuclear, chemical or biological attack? Will\nglobalism bring shared prosperity, or will it make the\ndesperate of the world even more desperate? Will we use\nscience and technology to grow the economy and protect\nthe environment, or put it all at risk in a world dominated\nby a struggle over natural resources?\nThe truth is that the twentieth century\u2019s amazing\nprogress has not resolved these questions. But it has given\nus the tools to make the answers come out right \u2014 the\nknowledge, the resources, the institutions. Now, we must\nuse them. If we do, we can make the millennium not just\na changing of the digits, but a true changing of the times \u2014\na gateway to greater peace, prosperity and freedom. With\nthat in mind, I offer three resolutions for the new\nmillennium.\nFirst, let us resolve to wage an unrelenting battle\nagainst poverty and for shared prosperity so that no part of\nhumanity is left behind in the global economy.\nGlobalization is not inherently divisive. While infant\nmortality in developing countries has been cut nearly in half\nsince 1970, life expectancy has increased by 10 years.\nAccording to the United Nations Human Development\nIndex, which measures a decent standard of living, a good\neducation, a long and healthy life, the gap between rich and\npoor countries on this measure has actually declined.\nOpen trade and new technologies have been engines\nof this progress; they have helped hundreds of millions to\nsee their prospects rise by marketing the fruits of their labor\nand creativity abroad. With proper investments in education,\ndeveloping countries should be able to keep their best and\nbrightest talent at home and to gain access to global\nmarkets for goods and services and capital.\nBut this promising future is far from inevitable. We\nare still squandering the potential of far too many. As many\nas 1.3 billion people still live on less than a dollar a day.\nMore than half the population of many countries has no\naccess to safe water. A person in South Asia is 700 times\nless likely to use the Internet than someone in the United\nStates. Forty million people a year still die of hunger,\nalmost as many as the total number killed in World\nWar II. We must refuse to accept a future in which one\npart of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new\neconomy, while the other lives at the knife edge of\nsurvival.\nWhat must we do? We can start by remembering\nthat open markets advance the blessings and\nbreakthroughs we want to spread. That is why we in the\nUnited States have worked to keep our markets open\nduring the recent global financial crisis, though it has\nbrought us record trade deficits. It is why we want to\nlaunch a new global trade round when the World Trade\nOrganization meets in Seattle this fall. It is why we are\nworking to build a trading system that strengthens the\nwell-being of workers and consumers, protects the\nenvironment and makes competition a race to the top, not\nthe bottom. It is why I am proud we have come together\nat the International Labour Organization to ban abusive\nchild labour everywhere in the world.\nWe do not face a choice between trade and aid, but\ninstead the challenge to make both work for people who\nneed them. Aid should focus on what is known to work:\ncredit for poor people starting businesses, keeping girls in\nschool, meeting the needs of mothers and children.\nDevelopment aid should be used for development, not to\nbuy influence or finance donors\u2019 exports. It should go\nwhere Governments invest in their people and answer to\ntheir concerns.\nWe should also come to the aid of countries\nstruggling to rise but held down by the burden of debt.\nThe G-7 nations have adopted a plan to reduce by up to\n70 per cent the outstanding debt of the world\u2019s poorest\ncountries, freeing resources for education, health and\ngrowth.\nAll of us, developed and developing countries alike,\nshould take action now to halt global climate change.\nWhat has that to do with fighting poverty? A great deal.\nThe most vulnerable members of the human family will\nbe hurt first and hurt most if rising temperatures devastate\nagriculture, accelerate the spread of disease in tropical\ncountries and flood island nations.\n3\n\n\nDoes this mean developing countries must sacrifice\ngrowth to protect the environment? Absolutely not.\nThroughout history, a key to human progress has been\nwillingness to abandon big ideas that are no longer true.\nOne big idea that is no longer true is that the only way to\nbuild a modern economy is to use energy as we did in the\nindustrial age. The challenge and opportunity for\ndeveloping countries today is to skip the costs of the\nindustrial age by using technologies that improve the\neconomy and the environment at the same time.\nFinally, to win the fight against poverty, we must\nimprove health care for all people. Over the next 10 years\nin Africa, AIDS is expected to kill more people and orphan\nmore children than all the wars of the twentieth century\ncombined. Each year diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis\nand pneumonia leave millions of children without parents\nand millions of parents without children. Yet for all these\ndiseases, vaccine research is advancing too slowly, in part\nbecause the potential customers are too poor. Only 2 per\ncent of all global biomedical research is devoted to the\nmajor killers in the developing world.\nNo country can break poverty\u2019s bonds if its people are\ndisabled by disease and its Government overwhelmed by\nthe needs of the ill. With United Nations leadership, we\nhave come close to eradicating polio, once the scourge of\nchildren everywhere. We are down to 5,000 reported cases\nworldwide. I have asked our Congress to fund a major\nincrease to finish the job, and I ask other nations to follow\nsuit. We have begun a comprehensive battle against the\nglobal AIDS epidemic. This year I am seeking another\n$100 million for prevention, counselling and care in Africa.\nI want to do more to get to those who need them most new\ndrugs that prevent transmission from mothers to newborns.\nAnd today I commit the United States to a concerted effort\nto accelerate the development and delivery of vaccines for\nmalaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and other diseases that\ndisproportionately affect the developing world. Many\napproaches have been proposed, from tax credits to special\nfunds for the purchase of these vaccines.\nTo tackle these issues, I will ask public-health experts,\nthe chief executive officers of our pharmaceutical\ncompanies, foundation representatives and members of\nCongress to join me at a special White House meeting and\nto strengthen incentives for research and development,\nworking with, not against, the private sector to meet our\ncommon goal.\nThe second resolution I hope we will make today is to\nstrengthen the capacity of the international community to\nprevent and whenever possible to stop outbreaks of mass\nkilling and displacement. This requires, as we all know,\nshared responsibility, like the one West African nations\naccepted when they acted to restore peace in Sierra\nLeone; the one 19 democracies in the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) embraced to stop ethnic\ncleansing in Bosnia and in Kosovo; the one that Asian\nand Pacific nations have now assumed in East Timor,\nwith the strong support of the entire United Nations,\nincluding the United States.\nSecretary-General Annan spoke for all of us during\nthe Kosovo conflict, and more recently in regard to East\nTimor, when he said that ethnic cleansers and mass\nmurderers can find no refuge in the United Nations, no\nsource of comfort or justification in its Charter. We must\ndo more to make these words real. Of course, we must\napproach this challenge with some considerable degree of\nhumility. It is easy to say \u201cnever again\u201d, but much harder\nto make it so. Promising too much can be as cruel as\ncaring too little.\nBut difficulties, dangers and costs are not an\nargument for doing nothing. When we are faced with\ndeliberate, organized campaigns to murder whole peoples\nor expel them from their land, the care of victims is\nimportant but not enough. We should work to end the\nviolence. Our response in every case cannot and should\nnot be the same. Sometimes collective military force is\nboth appropriate and feasible. Sometimes concerted\neconomic and political pressure combined with diplomacy\nis a better answer, as it was in making possible the\nintroduction of forces to East Timor. Of course, the way\nthe international community responds will depend on the\ncapacity of countries to act and on their perception of\ntheir national interests. NATO acted in Kosovo, for\nexample, to stop a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing\nin a place where we had important interests at stake and\nthe ability to act collectively.\nThe same considerations brought Nigerian troops and\ntheir partners to Sierra Leone and Australians and others\nto East Timor. That is proper \u2014 so long as we work\ntogether, support each other and do not abdicate our\ncollective responsibility. I know that some are troubled\nthat the United States and others cannot respond to every\nhumanitarian catastrophe in the world. We cannot do\neverything, everywhere. But simply because we have\ndifferent interests in different parts of the world does not\nmean we can be indifferent to the destruction of innocents\nin any part of the world. That is why we have supported\nthe efforts of Africans to resolve the deadly conflicts that\n4\n\n\nhave raged through parts of their continent. It is why we\nare working with friends in Africa to build the African\nCrisis Response Initiative, which has trained more than\n4,000 peacekeepers from six countries. It is why we are\nhelping establish an international coalition against genocide\nto bring nations together to stop the flow of money and\narms to those who commit crimes against humanity.\nThere is also a critical need for countries emerging\nfrom conflict to build police institutions accountable to\npeople and the law, often with the help of civilian police\nfrom other nations. We need international forces with the\ntraining to fill the gap between local police and military\npeacekeepers, as French, Argentine, Italian and other\nmilitary police have done in Haiti and Bosnia. We will\nwork with our partners and the United Nations to continue\nto ensure that such forces can deploy when they are needed.\nWhat is the role of the United Nations of in preventing\nmass slaughter and dislocation? Very large. Even in\nKosovo, NATO\u2019s actions followed a clear consensus,\nexpressed in several Security Council resolutions, that the\natrocities committed by Serb forces were unacceptable and\nthat the international community had a compelling interest\nin seeing them end. Had we chosen to do nothing in the\nface of this brutality, I do not believe we would have\nstrengthened the United Nations. Instead we would have\nrisked discrediting everything it stands for.\nBy acting as we did, we helped to vindicate the\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter to\ngive the United Nations the opportunity it now has to play\nthe central role in shaping Kosovo\u2019s future. In the real\nworld, principles often collide and tough choices must be\nmade. The outcome in Kosovo is hopeful.\nFinally, as we enter this new era, let our third\nresolution be to protect our children against the possibility\nthat nuclear, chemical and biological weapons will ever be\nused again. The last millennium has seen constant advances\nin the destructive power of weaponry. In the coming\nmillennium, this trend can continue or, if we choose, we\ncan reverse it with global standards universally respected.\nWe have made more progress than many realize. After\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus, Kazakhstan and\nUkraine courageously chose to give up their nuclear\nweapons. America and Russia have moved forward with\nsubstantial arms reductions. President Yeltsin and I agreed\nin June, even as we await Russian ratification of START II,\nto begin talks on a START III treaty that will cut our cold-\nwar arsenals by 80 per cent from their height. Brazil has\njoined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT), capping a process that has almost totally\neliminated the threat of nuclear proliferation in Latin\nAmerica. We have banned chemical weapons from the\nEarth, though we must implement that commitment fully\nand gain universal coverage. One hundred and fifty-two\nnations have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty and, while India and Pakistan did test nuclear\nweapons last year, the international reaction proved that\nthe global consensus against proliferation is very strong.\nWe need to bolster the standards to reinforce that\nconsensus. We must reaffirm our commitment to the\nNPT, strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and\nmake fast progress on a treaty to ban production of fissile\nmaterials. To keep existing stocks from the wrong hands,\nwe should strengthen the Convention on Physical\nProtection of Nuclear Materials. And today, again I ask\nour Congress to approve the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty.\nWe must stop the spread of nuclear weapons,\nmaterials and expertise at the source. Since 1992, we have\nworked with Russia and the other nations of the former\nSoviet Union to do that. We are expanding that effort\nbecause challenges remain, but thus far we can say that\nthe nightmare scenario of deadly weapons flowing\nunchecked across borders and of scientists selling their\nservices en masse to the highest bidder has been avoided.\nNow, we must work to deny weapons of mass\ndestruction to those who would use them. For almost a\ndecade, nations have stood together to keep the Iraqi\nregime from threatening its people and the world with\nsuch weapons. Despite all the obstacles Saddam Hussein\nhas placed in our path, we must continue to ease the\nsuffering of the people of Iraq. At the same time, we\ncannot allow the Government of Iraq to flout 40 \u2014 and\nI say 40 \u2014 successive United Nations Security Council\nresolutions and to rebuild his arsenal.\nJust as important is the challenge of keeping deadly\nweapons away from terrorist groups. They may have\nweaker capabilities than States, but they have fewer\ncompunctions about using such weapons. The possibility\nthat terrorists will threaten us with weapons of mass\ndestruction can be met with neither panic nor\ncomplacency. It requires serious, deliberate, disciplined\nconcern and effective cooperation from all of us.\nThere are many other challenges. Today I have\nspoken about just three: the need to do something about\n5\n\n\nthe world\u2019s poor and to put a human face on the global\neconomy; the need to do more to prevent killing and\ndislocation of innocents; the need to do more to ensure that\nweapons of mass destruction will never be used on our\nchildren. I believe they are the most important. In meeting\nthem, the United Nations is indispensable.\nIt is precisely because we are committed to the United\nNations that we have worked hard to support the effective\nmanagement of this body. But the United States also has a\nresponsibility to equip the United Nations with the\nresources it needs to be effective. As I think most Members\nknow, I have strongly supported the United States meeting\nall its financial obligations to the United Nations and I will\ncontinue to do so. We will do our very best to succeed this\nyear.\nWhen the cold war ended, the United States could\nhave chosen to turn away from the opportunities and\ndangers of the world. Instead, we have tried to be engaged,\ninvolved and active. We know this moment of unique\nprosperity and power for the United States is a source of\nconcern to many. I can only answer by saying this: In the\nseven years that I have been privileged to come here to\nspeak to this body, America has tried to be a force for\npeace. We believe we are better off when nations resolve\ntheir differences by force of argument rather than force of\narms. We have sought to help former adversaries like\nRussia and China become prosperous, stable members of\nthe world community because we feel far more threatened\nby the potential weakness of the world\u2019s leading nations\nthan by their strength. Instead of imposing our values on\nothers, we have sought to promote a system of\ngovernment \u2014 democracy \u2014 that empowers people to\nchoose their own destinies according to their own values\nand aspirations. We have sought to keep our markets open\nbecause we believe a strong world economy benefits our\nown workers and businesses, as well as the people of the\nworld who are selling to us. I hope that we have been and\nwill continue to be good partners with the rest in the new\nmillennium.\nNot long ago, I went to a refugee camp in Macedonia.\nThe people I met there, children and adults alike, had\nsuffered horrible, horrible abuses, but they had never given\nup hope because they believed that there is an international\ncommunity that stands for their dignity and their freedom.\nI want to make sure that, 20 or 50 or 100 years from now,\npeople everywhere will still believe that about our United\nNations. So let us resolve, in the bright dawn of the new\nmillennium, to bring in an era in which our desire to create\nwill overwhelm our capacity to destroy. If we do that, then,\nthrough the United Nations and far-sighted leaders,\nhumanity finally can live up to its name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of our Government and\nin my capacity as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, I\nwish to extend our sincere congratulations to you,\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly. I would also like to thank you for the\nkind remarks you made about my country as you assumed\nyour high position.\nWe have worked together for many decades. Thanks\nin good measure to your statespersonship, as neighbours we\nlive together in peace and have joined hands as equals to\nensure the all-round fulfilment of both our peoples. These\nexperiences convince us that you will discharge your\nresponsibilities as President of the General Assembly in a\nmanner that will help humanity make our common world a\nbetter place for all. We are pleased that you will be\nworking with the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, who has\ndemonstrated unquestionable commitment to the realization\nof the attainment of the goals of the Organization.\nThe Charter of this Organization and the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights provide all of us with the\nvision towards which we should strive. At the time these\ndocuments were adopted, they reflected the international\ndetermination to ensure that the catastrophe occasioned by\nthe rise of fascism and Nazism should never recur. We\nrecall them today because we believe that the time has\ncome for determined measures to be taken to ensure that\nthey inform what happens in the common world we all\nshare. The central message they contain is expressed in the\nwords of the preamble to the Declaration:\n\u201cthe peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter\nreaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in\nthe dignity and worth of the human person and in the\nequal rights of men and women and have determined\nto promote social progress and better standards of\nlife in larger freedom\u201d.\nWe believe that the time has come for all of us to\nensure that we work together to reconstruct human society\nin a manner consistent with this perspective. We further\nbelieve that what we have said constitutes a particular and\nhistoric challenge to those who occupy positions of\npolitical leadership in the modern era, those who, like us,\nwill have the privilege of addressing this General\nAssembly. Only time will tell whether we have the moral\nand intellectual courage to rise to this challenge.\nBut this we feel we can say: that conditions exist in\nthe world today for us successfully to pursue the vision\ncontained in the United Nations documents to which I\nhave referred. What may be in short supply is the courage\nof the politicians, as opposed to an abundance of good-\nsounding rhetoric. What are these conditions of which we\nspeak? The cold war has come to an end. There is no\nsign anywhere of an ideology-driven contest among\nsuper-Powers which dictates that each should seek to\ndestroy the other in order to protect itself. It is true that\na number of countries still possess weapons of mass\ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons, which constitute\na threat. The only logical way to address this is\nvigorously to sue for universal disarmament and the\ndestruction of such weapons.\nSecondly, I believe it would be correct to say that\nthe overwhelming majority of countries in the world have\nopted for democratic forms of government. Having\nlearned from their own experiences, the nations have\nturned their backs on dictatorship. Of course, we cannot\nsay that such dictatorships do not exist or that no attempt\nwill be made in the future to establish them. But we can\nmake bold to say that these exceptions prove the rule,\nrather than disprove the proposition we are trying to\nadvance.\nThe combination of these two factors should lead to\nthree conclusions, at least. The first is that there should be\nno need on the part of any country to seek to establish\nspheres of influence as a supposed necessary condition for\nthe advancement of its national interests.\nSecondly, the very sustenance of democracy across\nthe globe requires that in every democratic country the\nordinary people should feel that they actually do enjoy the\nright to determine their destiny. In other words, no\ncountry should be required to restrict its exercise of this\n8\n\n\nright simply because some other more powerful country\ndictates that this should be so.\nThirdly, these circumstances create the possibility for\na more democratic system of international governance, as\nwould be reflected by a correct restructuring of this very\nOrganization. In any case, the process of globalization\nnecessarily redefines the concept and the practice of\nnational sovereignty. The frontiers of that sovereignty are\nbeing pushed back, especially as regards the smaller\ncountries of the world, such as our own. As this happens,\ninevitably, so does it become necessary that a compensatory\nmovement take place towards the reinforcement of the\nimpact of these countries on the system of global\ngovernance through the democratization of the system of\ninternational relations.\nThe developments we have spoken of also suggest that\nperhaps, and depending on what we all do, humanity has\nnever had as bright a prospect for durable world peace and\nsecurity as it does today. The mere spread of democracy\nthroughout the world speaks of a greater commitment\namong the nations to the resolution of national and\ninternational conflicts by peaceful means.\nI am certain that when President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,\nthe current Chairperson of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), addresses the Assembly, he will report on the\nimportant decision recently taken at the Algiers summit of\nthe OAU to exclude from its ranks, with effect from the\nnext summit, all military regimes that may still exist on the\nAfrican continent. A further decision was taken to assist\nsuch countries resolutely to move towards a democratic\nsystem of government.\nThe developments on which we have commented\nwould suggest that the Organization has a responsibility to\nfocus especially on the objective contained in Article I,\nparagraph 1, of its Charter, which says,\n\u201cto take effective collective measures for the\nprevention and removal of threats to the peace ... and\nto bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity\nwith the principles of justice and international law,\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations which might lead to a breach of the peace\u201d.\nThis, we believe, imposes a solemn and supreme\nresponsibility on the United Nations to work for the\nprevention of conflicts and to endeavour to resolve them so\nthat a durable peace can be established. Sometimes, our\nresponse to conflicts has been to wait for them to develop\ninto violence, and even wars, and subsequently to\nintervene through costly peacekeeping operations. These,\nat times, serve to freeze those conflicts, perpetuate\npolarization and make their timely resolution more\ndifficult.\nMoreover, the requirement on the United Nations to\nmake such interventions to prevent the outbreak of\nhostilities imposes an obligation on the United Nations\nthat it should be seen by Governments and peoples as a\ntruly even-handed interlocutor and peacemaker. It can\nattain this only if it works genuinely to\n\u201cdevelop friendly relations among nations based on\nrespect for the principle of equal rights and self-\ndetermination of peoples\u201d,\nas stated in Article I, paragraph 2, of its Charter.\nIf indeed we are seriously committed to these critical\nobjectives of peace and democracy in the world, then we\nhave no excuse to permit the further postponement of the\nmeaningful restructuring of the United Nations. If we\nwere honest with ourselves, we would admit that what is\nblocking progress is the desire to accommodate what are\nperceived as new power relations, to reinstitutionalize\nrelations of inequality within the United Nations in an\namended form. This is based on the thesis that the\ninstitutionalization of such relations has precedence over\nthe Organization\u2019s founding principle of respect for the\nprinciple of equal rights among the nations.\nIn the situation of the cold war and the prevalence\nof dictatorship in many countries, the politics of power\nmight have been seen as the only path to survival. The\nmanagement of the world today through the exercise of\nsuch power, however modified, will itself subvert the\nobjectives of democracy and peace, spawning pretenders\nto the throne at global, continental and regional levels.\nSimultaneously as the United Nations focuses on the\ncritical question of the prevention of conflict, so must it\nattend to such issues as the elimination of weapons of\nmass destruction, the implementation of the ban on anti-\npersonnel mines, the removal of mines in those countries\nwhich face this problem and the control of the\nproliferation of small arms. Of course, none of these\nproposals gainsay the need for the United Nations to act\nwith all necessary vigour to help end all existing conflicts\nof which it is seized, including those in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Angola, Western Sahara, East\nTimor, Eritrea and Ethiopia, Kosovo and others.\n9\n\n\nWe started off with a quotation from the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which speaks of affirming\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, the promotion\nof social progress and securing a better life for all. We\nargued that conditions exist for movement towards the\nrealization of the objectives spelt out in the Declaration. It\nis a matter of common cause among all of us that the levels\nof poverty, ignorance and disease that continue to afflict\nbillions around the globe constitute a direct denial of the\ndignity and worth of the human person to which we have\ncommitted ourselves. I am certain that we would also agree\nthat the process of globalization has also been accompanied\nby growing inequality within and among countries. We\nhave also seen how movements of short-term capital have\nproduced disastrous economic consequences in some\ncountries.\nAs with the challenges of peace and democracy, it is\nour firm belief that sufficient resources exist within the\nworld economy actually to address the social progress and\nthe better life for all for which the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights calls. Further to this, science and technology\ncontinue to develop in such a way that it is difficult to\nbelieve that, taken together with the large concentrations of\ncapital that characterize the world economy, the means do\nnot exist within human society to make the required impact\non poverty, ignorance and disease. Indeed, it can be argued\nquite rationally that international peace, democracy and\nprosperity are a necessary condition for the further rapid\ngrowth of the world economy, and with it the further\nexpansion of the corporations, both small and big, which\nrequire global markets.\nSimilarly, the revolution in information and\ncommunication technology, a critical driver of the process\nof globalization, both enables and calls for higher levels of\neducation and standards of living among the billions who\nconstitute the human population. However, it is clear that\nthere is no automatic or inherent mechanism within the\noperation of the markets to enable both capital and\ntechnology to make the sort of impact we are talking about\non all countries of the globe. When we say this we should\nnot be taken to mean that we are contemptuous of all that\nhas been said about what each country needs to do to create\nthe conditions conducive to investment and technology\ntransfers. Nor should it be taken to mean that we are\nreopening the debate about the role of markets in the\nallocation of resources. What we are saying is that the\nfunctioning of the markets does not and cannot exclude\nconscious interventions being made, both to increase\neconomic opportunities and to raise the standards of living\nand the life possibilities of many in the world denied their\nhuman dignity by the scourge of poverty.\nIn his interesting book Living on Thin Air, the\nBritish author Charles Leadbeater, writes:\n\u201cThe new (knowledge driven) economy needs a\nmobilizing vision and institutions fashioned to make\nit real. Bit by bit, our institutions are changing\nthrough reform, reorganisation and restructuring \u2014\nbut the process is much too slow, haphazard and\npiecemeal \u2014 it must become more conscious,\nimaginative and radical.\u201d\nOnce more, the matter turns on the will of the\npolitical leaders actually to discover among themselves\nthe moral and intellectual courage to do what is correct\nand necessary. What is correct and necessary also requires\nthat in this field as well, which affects socio-economic\nmatters, we should review the functioning of all\nmultilateral institutions, including those that belong within\nthe United Nations family. This should be done to ensure\nthat these too reflect the very necessary imperative of the\ndemocratization of the international system of governance.\nThe United Nations documents to which we referred\nearlier give us a starting point. Accordingly, we believe\nthat there is no need for anyone among us to rediscover\na new vision that would inform our actions to build a new\nworld which affirms the dignity and worth of the human\nperson. What is necessary is that we match the beliefs we\nprofess with the necessary action.\nWe speak of action that will practically address the\nrelated issues of peace, democracy and development.\nI am certain that such a practical programme of\naction would meet the aspirations not only of the\nmembers of the Organization of African Unity and the\nNon-Aligned Movement, of which we are a member. It\nwould also respond to the most deep-seated feelings of\nthe peoples of the developed North, who can have no\ninterest in conflict, oppression and poverty, even if these\noccur beyond the borders of their own countries.\nIt also goes without saying that the democratic\nsystems in which we operate would also require that,\nthrough committed advocacy, we should secure the\nsupport of the electors for what should be a programme\nof action of the United Nations for the twenty-first\ncentury.\n10\n\n\nThe evolution of human society has presented the\nworld leaders who will stand at this rostrum with new\npossibilities to move our globe a giant step forward towards\na new actuality, of which the poor and the powerless dream\nevery day. We will be betraying those millions if we do not\nact to turn their dream into reality. Let future generations\nnot say that because of the force of inertia we failed to act.\n\n\n\n\n"

I wish him success in guiding the work of\nthe Assembly.\nIt gives me great pleasure to extend my thanks to his\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his effective work as\nPresident of the Assembly at its previous session. I wish\nhim similar success in his future endeavours.\nAllow me on this occasion to congratulate the three\nnew Members on their admission to the United Nations.\n4\n\n\nAllow me also, on behalf of my Government, to express\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, for his tireless work\nand laudable efforts in the midst of an international\nsituation that can be described \u2014 at best \u2014 as difficult and\ncomplicated.\nOf course the international situation is truly difficult\nand complicated. It is no coincidence that as we meet in\nthis forum to discuss the affairs and state of the world\ntoday \u2014 at this, the last session of the century, the\nbeginning of a new century, a new age that we once hoped\nwould be different from the old \u2014 we find ourselves\nobliged to discuss the same problems and the same disputes\nthat we have been facing for over half a century. Is this not\ntruly deplorable and even outrageous? Does not this reality\nconstitute categorical evidence that all of us \u2014 States,\npeoples and regional and international organizations \u2014\nhave failed to learn enough from the lessons of the past,\nthat we have not benefited from our past experiences\nenough and that we have not sought as much as we should\nhave, to overcome our past limitations and shortcomings?\nWhat do we see when we look at our world today?\nWe see bloody conflicts that we have not yet been able to\nstop and chronic crises that still await solutions that would\nend the spiral of violence and suffering. Moreover, we find\nthat the world remains reluctant or even unable to address\nproblems and crises that are far removed, in terms of\ncontent, from the course of daily politics but whose effects\nand ramifications are no less dangerous than the topical\ncrises and conflicts that threaten our existence. We must\nask ourselves: What have we done, as we stand on the\nthreshold of the third millennium, to prepare ourselves to\nmeet the challenges of poverty, misery, unemployment,\nilliteracy, disease, the spread of epidemics and the\nexploitation of children?\nWhat have we done to prepare ourselves to cope with\nthe dangers of organized crime, international terrorism and\ndrug trafficking? Have we really understood the threat of\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the\npossibility that they may be used at any time and\nanywhere?\nWhat of the real dangers besetting our planet as a\nresult of environmental degradation, climate change, the\nscarcity of water resources, the shortage of raw materials,\nthe deteriorating phenomena of drought and desertification\nand the increasing frequency of natural disasters?\nHave we at least begun to draft guidelines and\ncomprehensive universal plans to confront these global\nthreats, which do not differentiate between nationalities,\nraces, colours or creeds and which most certainly\nrecognize no political, geographical, economic and social\nborders among nations and peoples?\nSimply put, have we, as States, Governments and\ninternational organizations, begun adjusting our priorities\nso as to place the goals of development, progress,\neducation, health, high living standards and decent life for\nour peoples ahead of the aims of conflict, disputes and\nvengeance, no matter how historical, profound or\nsensitive?\nI cannot answer yes to any of these questions. There\nis nothing in this statement to criticize anyone or detract\nfrom their resolve or intentions. It is a sad universal\nreality that requires our cooperation and joint efforts if we\ntruly hope to prepare ourselves for the future and its tasks\nand changes. To that end, I see no better or more\ncomprehensive framework for this mission than this\ninternational Organization, which we believe to be the\nqualified and appropriate institution for defining the future\nof our world. All of us, regardless of our interests and\nour narrow, topical political calculations, must provide the\nUnited Nations and its agencies with all the means\nnecessary for it to play such an important role.\nWe are convinced that this can be achieved only\nwith universal will, for in the final analysis, the United\nNations is the sum total of its Member States. We are\nalso convinced of the need to reform the United Nations\nand to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of its\nbodies and agencies. Similarly, it is incumbent upon us,\nthe States Members of the Organization, to assume our\npolitical responsibility and respect our moral and financial\ncommitments to it. Furthermore, in this context, we\nsupport the idea of expanding the Security Council to\nmake it more democratic and representative of the\ninternational community in the modern world. We also\nsupport the idea of expanding the permanent membership\nof the Council so as to ensure greater universal\nrepresentation on it. The same applies to restricting the\nuse of the veto by the permanent members and to\nregulating the capacity to use this right under agreed and\nspecific terms and conditions.\nIt is perhaps not exaggerated optimism or\nexpectation on my part when I say that we consider this\nto be an essential and vital step towards consecrating the\nsound concept of globalization, as we see it and as it\nmust be in the twenty-first century. We believe that\nglobalization must be a comprehensive mechanism in the\n5\n\n\nservice of the general welfare of all nations and peoples. If\nits benefits are confined to certain States and societies, to\nthe exclusion of others, it will fail to achieve its objectives.\nOn this basis, we believe that globalization should be\nthe means by which we promote cooperation, interaction\nand openness among the peoples and societies of the world.\nWe can thus steer globalization away from the pitfalls of\nnarrow exploitation and short-term profit and towards a\nuniversal scope whose benefits and returns reach everyone.\nIt is here that we feel that a new and extremely vital role\nwill emerge for the United Nations in the twenty-first\ncentury \u2014 a role in which the Organization will assume\nleadership of the trend towards globalization and consecrate\nit, especially in the fields of cooperation, cultural and\neducational exchanges, social and economic development,\nthe defence of human rights, strengthening peace and\nstability and consolidating the bases of cultural openness\namong nations and peoples.\nWe will thus have taken the first essential steps\ntowards the establishment of the new international order\nthat we thought we had achieved at the end the cold war\nand the age of international polarization, which lasted 50\nyears after the end of the Second World War. The new\ninternational order to which we aspired did not materialize.\nUnfortunately, and in spite of the many initiatives and\nindications that had once seemed encouraging, the world\ninstead soon fell into a new spiral of disagreements,\ndisputes and regional, bilateral and internal conflicts. These\nseemed to be the direct results of the political vacuum left\nin the wake of the cold war. At the same time, new\nconflicts and disputes have joined the series of historically\nchronic crises that have plagued our world for decades and\nfor which no effective solutions have been found.\nWe may discuss the future and a new world in which\nwe seek to achieve the aspirations of all peoples to\nprosperity, progress and stability, but the priority of\nspending on arms and military purposes still prevails over\nall others, especially in the developing and poor regions of\nthe world, where the need for resources for social and\neconomic growth and development is paramount. In the\nmeantime, economic conditions in these regions continue to\ndeteriorate, social crises are exacerbated and living\nstandards are plummeting ever faster.\nNaturally, these are not the only problems. In the\nmidst of such a vicious circle, the political crises facing\nthese societies are intensified in turn and soon evolve into\nsignificant threats, not only to their security and internal\nfabric, but also to their neighbours. Particularly disturbing\nis the fact that this phenomenon has spread and expanded\ninto several regions of the world. In this regard, and on\nbehalf of my country, Qatar, I cannot but express\nsatisfaction at the results of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) operation in the Balkans.\nIn the same context, my Government has followed\nwith concern the events that have unfolded in East Timor\nin recent weeks. Qatar hopes for the success of the\ninternational efforts currently under way to restore peace\nand security. At the same time, we stress the hope that\nthe Republic of Indonesia will transcend this difficult\nordeal and reclaim its prominent position in South-East\nAsia and in the ranks of the international community as\na whole.\nWhile some recent developments have provided\nrelatively reassuring indications of the possibility of\nsettling regional and internal conflicts, given the resolve\nand the international will to do so, we find it necessary to\nrecall here that we would have preferred that such\ninternational endeavours had taken place in a pre-emptive\ncontext that would have prevented the crises and the\nensuing tragedies and suffering, instead of subsequent\nefforts aimed at salvaging whatever remained to be\nsalvaged.\nWe express this concern and call for further\ninternational efforts to settle crises and to put an end to\nwars and conflicts because we in the State of Qatar\nprofoundly believe in the right of peoples to live in\nfreedom and peace. We also believe in the need to\nestablish international relations on the basis of friendship,\ncooperation, mutual respect, common interests and good-\nneighbourliness. Proceeding from this, my country stands\nfirmly and unambiguously in support of the settlement of\ndifferences and disputes in the Gulf region by peaceful\nmeans and through dialogue, negotiations, or international\narbitration in order to consolidate security and stability in\nthe region.\nWe also wish to place on record my Government's\nsatisfaction at some of the positive developments and\nencouraging signs that we have noticed during the past\nmonths regarding the settlement of a number of questions\nthat have long been a source of concern in our region.\nWe welcome the progress made in settling the Lockerbie\nmatter and congratulate our Libyan brothers on that,\nhoping that this file will be closed and this matter\nconcluded as soon as possible and in a way that will\nensure the rights and interests of all parties.\n6\n\n\nNotwithstanding the positive indications and trends,\nwhich we welcome and hope will be strengthened, the\ngeneral regional situation is still, to our great regret, far\nremoved from the comprehensive peace, the lasting stability\nand the modes of cooperation, development and progress\nthat we seek and desire for our region. The Iraqi crisis and\nits continuous repercussions on security and stability in the\nGulf and the Middle East, and the cruel suffering of the\nfraternal Iraqi people, are all elements that cause great\nconcern and prompt us to do our utmost in order to put an\nend to this crisis. We believe it is high time that we\novercame the Iraqi crisis and found effective solutions to it\nso that the sanctions imposed against Iraq can be lifted and\nthe cruel suffering of its peoples can be terminated. We\nhave always resorted to diplomatic solutions, in accordance\nwith international resolutions, in order to ensure the\npreservation of the territorial integrity and national unity of\nIraq and to spare it and the entire region further dangers\nand agony.\nThere naturally remains the essential question, which\nin our view has been the main source of tension and crises\nin our region for more than half a century, and that is the\nquestion of Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict. I must\nsay that we in the State of Qatar, together with our Arab\nbrothers, have committed ourselves to peace as a permanent\nstrategic option, a commitment which still stands. However,\nthe peace process has regrettably failed to attain its\nenvisaged results. Rather, this process has suffered setbacks\nover the past years, the responsibility for which, in our\nview, lies with the former Israeli Government, which opted\nto retreat from its commitments and pursued policies that\nprevented any progress in the peace process and in\nnegotiations on its various tracks.\nWe welcome the changes that have taken place in the\nIsraeli Government as a result of the recent general\nelections and in light of the formation of the new\nGovernment under the leadership of Mr. Ehud Barak and\nhis stated intention to pursue peace more earnestly.\nHowever, we feel that such gestures must be coupled with\nconcrete steps that would demonstrate good faith on the\nIsraeli side and sincere readiness to meet its obligations by\nimplementing the agreements concluded on all tracks during\nthe previous stages of the negotiations, and to seek a\nresumption of the negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese\ntracks as soon as possible, on the basis of the resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy and the principle of land for peace.\nPerhaps it suffices here to recall the recent affirmation\nby His Highness, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the\nEmir of the State of Qatar, in explaining my country's firm\nposition on this matter. In our view, there can be no\nsolution to this conflict nor peace in the Middle East\nexcept through a permanent, just and comprehensive\nsettlement, based on the established principles that form\nthe foundations of the peace process. This means the\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978); full Israeli withdrawal\nfrom the occupied Syrian Golan Heights to the border of\n4 June 1967 and from southern Lebanon and its western\nBekaa valley, to the internationally recognized borders,\nand the regaining by the Palestinian people of their\nlegitimate national and political rights, foremost among\nwhich is their natural right to self-determination and to\nthe establishment of their independent State, with\nJerusalem as its capital: the city of peace, the land of\ntolerance and the cradle of divine revelations, where\nreligions have always coexisted in harmony and concord.\nWe must express concern over the continued\npresence of weapons of mass destruction in the region,\nespecially nuclear weapons that are available exclusively\nto one side, the Israeli side. In our view, this constitutes\na strategic imbalance and a threat to peace and security.\nTherefore, we believe in the need for the complete\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction from our\nregion, as an integral and complementary part of the\npeace process. We also call on Israel to accede to the\ninternational treaties providing for the limitation and non-\nproliferation of such weapons.\nPeace, in our view, cannot be one-sided, nor can its\nbenefits accrue exclusively on one side. Therefore, we\nsincerely look forward to the day when a balanced, just,\ncomprehensive and genuine peace reigns in our region.\nThen we can speak of such advantages and benefits of\npeace as security, cooperation, stability, prosperity and\nprogress for all the States and peoples in our region\nwithout exception.\nWe look forward to that day because we truly yearn\nto see a new Middle East, which enters the new\nmillennium in a climate of peace, security and\ndemocracy; a climate in which we all respect pluralism of\nopinions, diversity of approaches and the right of peoples\nand States to self-determination, to better living standards\nand to living in freedom, prosperity and dignity, in\nconformity with their lofty beliefs and values. This is one\nof the basic human rights we cherish. Our belief stems\nforemost from our profound belief in God Almighty and\nin His divine revelations with which He blessed all\nmankind.\n7\n\n\nThis process of working for a better future and for our\npeoples imbues us with the utmost hope that we will be\nable to achieve the objective of building a new world\nworthy of our young generations which will inhabit it in the\nthird millennium. As we are about to draw the curtain on\nan old century and welcome the dawn of a new one, we\nmust pledge to our children that we will do our utmost so\nthat their world will be a better world, more capable and\nbetter equipped to respond to their ambitions and\naspirations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to\ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its final session of the twentieth\ncentury and would like to assure you of the fullest\ncooperation of the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago as\nyou discharge the duties entrusted to you by the Member\nStates of the United Nations. We would also like to\ncommend your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay,\nfor the very capable and distinguished manner in which he\nguided the Assembly\u2019s work during its fifty-third session.\nThere is only one real purpose to government. It is\nto serve the people, to protect them and to improve the\nquality of their lives. In their enlightened self-interest,\nnations also come together to serve that end by trying to\ncreate a better world, one in which their own citizens can\ninteract with others and benefit from relationships in the\npursuit of their fulfilment. At both the national and global\nlevels, the human being is supposed to be at the centre of\nthe purpose, processes and policies of governance. It is\nthe foundation of democratic civilization to create the\nconditions that give the individual the opportunity for\nfulfilment.\nWe need to assess our nations and our world in the\nlight of that original intention as we approach the twenty-\nfirst century.\nThe present global picture proves that much went\nwrong during this century. The economic models of the\ncentury have failed to create economic and social justice.\nThe central planning of Communism was disastrous,\nsuffocating human development by stifling initiatives and\nfreedoms and creating oppressive authoritarian regimes.\nThe Big Government of the centre-left era was bungling\nand bureaucratic, killing entrepreneurial initiative and\ngenerating a dependency syndrome, and was imperfect in\nits delivery as the major social and economic actor. Now\nwe are in the era of the market, of deregulation and\nborderlessness, and the question still is: what have we\nachieved?\nAt the turn of the century, we have 1.3 billion\npeople in the category of the poor, earning less than $1\ndollar per day. More than 880 million people lack access\nto health services, 2.6 billion people lack access to basic\nsanitation and 1.5 billion people are not expected to\nsurvive to age 60. The number of malnourished is 840\nmillion people, nearly 20 per cent of whom are children.\nOne of the most tragic situations as we approach the end\nof the century is that 70 per cent of the world\u2019s poor are\nwomen. From 1990 to 1997 the number of people\ninfected with HIV/AIDS more than doubled, with the\nmajority of victims in the developing world.\nIronically, in this much-heralded information age, 75\nmillion people are estimated to be illiterate, with the\nmajority also in the developing world. In addition to the\nproblem of illiteracy, the education system in most\ndeveloping countries is producing unskilled and\nunemployable young people.\n6\n\n\nFive billion of the world's 6 billion people live in the\ndeveloping world, but most of the resources are\nconcentrated in the developed countries. Twenty per cent of\nthe world's richest countries share 86 per cent of the world's\ngross domestic product, 82 per cent of exports of goods and\nservices and 68 per cent of foreign direct investment.\nIf there is any demonstration of the inequality that\nexists and how most human beings have been marginalized\nas we approach the end of the twentieth century, the\nfollowing is a striking example: the assets of the three\nrichest people are more than the combined gross national\nproduct of all of the least developed countries; the assets of\nthe 200 richest people are more than the combined income\nof 41 per cent of the world's people; and a yearly\ncontribution of 1 per cent of the wealth of the 200 richest\npeople could provide universal access to primary education\nfor all.\nThere is an even darker side to the picture. As we\nspan the far reaches of history, and especially in this\ncentury, we see that very often the individual in society has\nbeen the victim of political and economic forces beyond his\ncontrol. He has suffered the horrendous consequences of\nethnic, cultural and religious intolerance. It is the individual\nand the family that have suffered the most from the\ndevastating effects of wars, genocide and ethnic cleansing.\nIn our century alone, we have witnessed the tragedy\nof two world wars, which have resulted in the loss of a\ncountless number of lives, the separation of families and the\nloss of hope for many. We have seen the untold human\nmisery and pain of the Holocaust, the injustices and\nsuffering of apartheid and the callousness of regimes which\nhave unleashed acts of unspeakable horror on their citizens.\nThroughout this century, we have been shocked by news\nand television images of the harsh realities endured by the\nvictims of such horrors in Europe, Cambodia, Rwanda,\nBosnia and the former Yugoslavia, to name a few. And,\nsadly, we have realized that the very scientific and\ntechnological advances which were intended for the service\nof humanity can be turned to evil ends in the service of the\ndestruction of humanity.\nNevertheless, in the midst of one of the darkest\nchapters of the twentieth century, there is hope in the fact\nthat such evils have stirred the conscience of the\ninternational community to strengthen the rule of law, to\naddress situations such as these and to ensure respect for\nfundamental human rights.\nIt is because of this recognition that we have today\nthe most recent instrument, the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. This Statute is the result of\na call made in 1989 by Mr. Arthur N.R. Robinson,\nPresident of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, for the\ninternational community to renew its focus on the\nquestion of the establishment of an international criminal\njurisdiction to deal with these atrocities, and also with\ncrimes associated with the illicit drug trade, all of which\nhave such a heavy impact on a Government's ability to\naddress the fundamental needs of its citizens.\nIn addition to the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court, there is hope in the fact that the United\nNations has made advances in the area of human rights.\nWe have seen the adoption of several instruments, such\nas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\nwhich guarantee fundamental human rights, the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen and the International Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. These\nreflect the commitments and obligations of the\ninternational community to improving the quality of life\nof the individual in the various sectors of society. But we\nmust not pay lip-service to the principles enshrined in the\ninternational instruments that we have adopted; there is\ntoo much of a trend of paying lip-service. We need to\ntake concrete action now.\nAlbert Camus, one of the distinguished writers of\nmodern times noted that,\n\u201cProbably every generation sees itself as charged\nwith remaking the world. Mine, however, knows that\nits task will not be merely to remake the world. Its\ntask is even greater: to keep the world from\ndestroying itself.\u201d\nThere is no doubt that the task in the new century is\nto save the world from self-destruction, and the question\nis, what type of economic arrangement will ensure that\nsalvation? Surely it cannot be one in which the few feast\nat the table, leaving mere crumbs for the majority. No one\ncan be insulated from the catastrophe inherent in such a\nsituation. Disease, terrorism, the drug trade, human\nenslavement, child labour and ecological disaster will\ncontinue to be produced by a world bereft of economic\nand social justice. No fortress, whether economic or\nmilitary, will be strong enough to insulate any country\nfrom the effects of such a situation. Some may not like it,\n7\n\n\nand some tend to forget it; but it is one world that we live\nin, one globe that we share. We should take a lesson from\nnature itself, whose hot winds emanate from the Sahara in\nAfrica, become hurricanes in their journey across the\nAtlantic and eventually devastate and desolate countries as\nfar away as the Caribbean and North, Central and South\nAmerica.\nIn this era of globalization, we have excellent\nopportunities to put in place new and innovative global\nstructures that would make possible global solutions to\nensure the social, economic and cultural security of the\nindividual. The World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting\nin Seattle this year, the South Summit, the special sessions\nof the General Assembly to follow up of the World Summit\nfor Social Development and the Fourth World Conference\non Women and, indeed, the Millennium Assembly next\nyear, provide ideal opportunities for the international\ncommunity to respond to this coming crisis of mankind.\nIn the upcoming WTO Seattle meeting, it must be\nrecognized that many of the measures which were supposed\nto be put in place in the new global trading system ushered\nin by the Uruguay Round have not been realized. Giving\neffect to those matters must therefore be the priority in any\nnew round of WTO negotiations. In other words,\nimplementation of commitments already made must be the\nemphasis.\nIn that process, we must recognize that a special\ncategory of States face peculiar disadvantages arising from\nthe policy actions of the international community. These are\nthe small and vulnerable States, of which the States of the\nCaribbean region make up a significant part. For these\ncountries, the need to maintain the provisions for special\nand differential treatment in the present WTO Agreement\nis fundamental.\nThe liberalization of international trade under the\nWTO is a dynamic force for accelerating growth and\ndevelopment. The challenge for the next Ministerial\nConference is to ensure resolute progress towards an open,\nfree and fair international trading system in which benefits\nare equitably distributed. Developed countries must\ndemonstrate an unequivocal commitment to opening their\nmarkets to exports of developing countries to enable them\nto achieve sustained levels of economic development. The\ndisconnection between developments in the WTO and the\ndevelopment process at the national level in developing\ncountries must be arrested. The rules-based system of the\nWTO, which aims to promote free and fair trade, must do\njust that. The idea of the level playing field, we must\nremember, is a dangerous myth, and if it is allowed to\nhold sway it will further the pauperization of hundreds of\nmillions of people all over the world.\nPolicies developed and promoted by international\nfinancial and monetary institutions such as the World\nBank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must\nhave as their ultimate goal the transformation of societies\naimed at achieving a higher degree of social equity and\njustice within the global economy. The World Bank and\nthe IMF must apply a set of criteria broader than per\ncapita income when considering finance and development\nassistance, in view of our susceptibility to external\neconomic shocks and natural disasters.\nWe are heartened by the highly successful\nCommonwealth ministerial mission on small island States\nundertaken by the Heads of Government in July 1998,\nfrom which an agreement has been secured for the\nestablishment of a Commonwealth/World Bank task force.\nThe World Bank is now developing a strategy, which we\nhope will be approved by its board of Executive\nDirectors, to reorient its assistance for small States on the\nbasis of a strategic assessment of their vulnerability,\nconstraints and needs. Other financial institutions and\ndevelopment institutions should adopt similar initiatives.\nThe governance of the supranational global actors\ntherefore has to be reinvented with human development\nand equity as imperatives.\nA new global partnership of developing countries\nmust be forged with the financial institutions and the\ndeveloped world to place financing for development on a\nsound and predictable level. The economic foundation laid\nby the policy prescriptions of structural adjustment\nremains questionable in terms of their potential to\ngenerate and sustain long-term economic growth. The\ninternational financial architecture must therefore be\ncompatible with and complementary to real development.\nNational Governments cannot be exonerated from\ntheir responsibilities. There are too many countries in the\nworld whose major problem is the imperfections of their\nown Governments. Many who speak about\nmarginalization are themselves alienating their own\npopulations, and some who lament global poverty are\nthemselves pauperizing their own citizens through their\nown inadequacies. We cannot call for a reformation\nwithout reforming ourselves. Do we all place our people\nat the centre of governance? Are we using our resources\nwell and for the benefit of our populations who elected us\nto serve? We have a responsibility to re-invent our\n8\n\n\ngovernance at home as part of the global transformation\nthat we demand.\nThe key question that the Member States of the United\nNations face in the twenty-first century is whether the\nUnited Nations will become an Organization that can deal\neffectively with all forms of injustices to humankind. We\nrecall your words, Sir, in your opening statement to the\ncurrent session of the General Assembly:\n\u201cThe aspirations, hopes and expectations of the\nworld's peoples are high as they anticipate the\nfuture. They yearn for a world that is peaceful,\nhumane and prosperous for all. Without the United\nNations, such an inclusive world, led by i n s p i r i n g\nleaders, cannot come about.\u201d (A/54/PV.1)\nTrinidad and Tobago is committed to working with\nother countries of the world through the United Nations to\nfashion a global civilization that would, in the final\nanalysis, be its own salvation and protection. We believe\nthat the struggle for economic and social justice must start\nwith ourselves and that democracy in each country must be\nan ever-deepening process which eventually liberates every\nsingle individual from want and places him or her in a\nposition to pursue his or her own fulfilment while\nrespecting the rights of others.\nFor us in Trinidad and Tobago everyone matters;\nevery life is precious. This is the approach with which we\ncome to the United Nations. All nations are important to us\nbecause every life in every country is precious. Trinidad\nand Tobago believes that the United Nations must come to\nunderstand again that it has been made for people \u2014 real\npeople with flesh and blood and dreams; people who suffer\npain and long for joy; people in cars on the street, in\nhouses and hovels, in the cold or in sweltering heat,\nlabouring in fields or offices, giving birth in hospitals and\nelsewhere; real people, Sir, who may never see you in that\nchair or me standing here, and if they do see us through the\ndistance of television may be surprised and even disbelieve\nthat we are doing this for them.\nIs it not amazing how ritual and ceremony often\nbecome ends in themselves and either replace or obscure\nthe real purpose? Trinidad and Tobago is heartened to sense\nthat the United Nations is on a path of rediscovery of itself.\nIt remains for us the only Organization where every\nindividual may be represented and every voice heard, and\nwhere every opinion or idea could contend. Trinidad and\nTobago pledges to work with others to take this\nOrganization back to the people, to ensure that it works\namong them, in our collective efforts to save the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your great country, Namibia, and its\nillustrious leader, President Sam Nujoma, have been very\ngenerous indeed in allowing us to benefit from the\nprodigious knowledge and experience you command on the\nworkings of the United Nations, having spent the better part\nof your life in this institution. We are confident that under\nyour seasoned leadership the fifty-fourth session will serve\nas a fitting climax to a tragic century. My delegation is\nready to render you all the support you will no doubt need\nin carrying out your onerous responsibilities.\nYour predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, has earned our\nadmiration and gratitude by the exemplary manner in which\nhe presided over the fifty-third session of the General\nAssembly. We thank his country, Uruguay, for allowing us\nto tap his wisdom and benefit from his leadership skills.\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his team\nin the Secretariat have continued to discharge their\nresponsibilities with unstinting devotion. The problems they\nhave to deal with, and/or seek solutions to, are enormous,\nand yet they remain undaunted. We owe them an immense\ndebt of gratitude.\nWe warmly welcome in our midst three new members\nof our Organization, Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga. We wish\nthem the best and assure them of our friendship and\nsolidarity.\nDespite the many horrors of the twilight of this\nturbulent century \u2014 the civil wars, the rampant terrorism\nin many places and other acts of savagery committed\nagainst millions of our fellow human beings all over the\nworld \u2014 we have made commendable progress in the\npast few years in the maintenance of global peace and\nsecurity and the consolidation of freedom and democracy.\nAn increasing number of the world's nations have\norganized successful elections in the past few years, many\nwith the help of the United Nations. In two weeks\u2019 time,\nmy own country, Botswana, will for the seventh\nsuccessive time in a generation afford its citizens another\nopportunity to exercise their democratic right to choose\ntheir leaders.\nPolitical pluralism may not have taken root in all the\ncorners of the globe, but it has undoubtedly enthralled the\nimagination of all peoples yearning for freedom. It has\nbecome the weapon of choice, a powerful one at that,\nagainst tyranny. Democracy is, of course, not necessarily\na foolproof panacea against all the societal imperfections\nthat are our natural inheritance as human beings, but we\nbelieve that only in societies where the rights of all\ncitizens, their fundamental freedoms, their beliefs, their\nculture, are protected and allowed the fullest expression\npossible under the law, can peace prevail. Peace is a\nprerequisite for development, for sustainable development.\nAt independence in 1966 Botswana was regarded,\nand rightly so, as an abject basket case, the poorest of the\npoor of the emerging African nations. Our desire to be\nfree in those inauspicious economic and political\ncircumstances was derided by those who did not wish us\nwell as nothing more than a suicidal wish.\nToday, a mere generation later, my country prides\nitself on having one of the fastest growing economies in\nthe world, thanks to the peace and stability we have\nenjoyed since independence and the wise utilization of the\nfew resources with which our desert- scarred and drought-\nprone country is, thankfully, endowed.\nDemocracy has been a way of life and second nature\nto Botswana. We attribute our peace and stability to it.\nWe cannot, of course, forget the support we were given\nby the international community, particularly during the\nearly years of our independence.\nThis is why we welcome the end, at long last, of\nmilitary rule in Nigeria, a country whose importance to\nour continent and to the world at large cannot be gainsaid.\nA vibrant democracy in Nigeria will have a powerful\neffect not only on the west African region, but also on the\ncontinent as a whole.\n5\n\n\nWe pledge our support to our Nigerian brothers and\nsisters in their struggle to nurture their democracy and to\nreconstruct their economy as well as to rehabilitate their\ninstitutions. We reiterate our aversion to coups and military\nrule, and laud the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nAlgiers decision to the effect that from now on those who\noverthrow Governments by means other than democratic\nelections will face isolation by our African community.\nWe welcome the signing in Togo recently of a peace\nagreement between the democratically elected Government\nof Sierra Leone and the rebels. We understand fully the\ncircumstances which compelled President Kabbah to sign\nthis peace agreement. We hope the agreement will bring\npeace to Sierra Leone. We urge the international\ncommunity to contribute generously to the rehabilitation\nand reconstruction of that devastated country.\nThe Great Lakes region in Central Africa remains\nunstable, despite the signing recently of an Agreement to\nend the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe signing of the Agreement by its Government and its\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) allies\nand the rebels is the first step in a difficult journey to peace\nin Central Africa.\nThe Agreement will, however, amount to nothing\nwithout the full support of the international community, in\nparticular that of the United Nations. We therefore urge the\nSecurity Council, in collaboration with the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU), to become actively involved in the\nfull implementation of the Lusaka Agreement. Time is of\nthe essence.\nThe case of Angola is a very sad one. The departure\nof the United Nations from that war-ravaged country has\nleft a void, which has abetted one of the deadliest conflicts\nthat has ever afflicted Africa. In the absence of the United\nNations Angola Verification Mission, it is not possible to\nassess accurately the magnitude of the slaughter, the\nstarvation and the general mayhem caused by disease and\nlandmines in Angola. Nevertheless, we call upon the\ninternational community to intensify its efforts to end the\ntragedy, and we firmly believe that the tragedy can be\nended only by the full implementation of the Lusaka\nProtocol.\nWe further call upon those among us who continue to\ngive Savimbi\u2019s rebellion sustenance to cease doing so. We\nmust all cooperate in ensuring that sanctions imposed\nagainst UNITA are effective.\nWe welcome, in this regard, the Security Council\u2019s\nrecent establishment of panels to investigate violations of\nthe sanctions imposed against UNITA and to find\neffective ways of tightening them. It is our fervent hope\nthat the panels will not only be able to reveal the\nidentities of UNITA\u2019s merchants of death, but will also\nadvise on how such violators of United Nations sanctions\ncould be deterred from defying the will of the\ninternational community.\nThe bloody war that has been raging between the\nEast African neighbours of Eritrea and Ethiopia may be\nexperiencing a lull as we meet here, but the fact, in our\nview, continues to be that this terrible war does not make\nsense. It is a war of brothers who, more than anyone else,\nshould have found it easy to sit down to discuss whatever\ndifferences might have arisen between them. We urge our\ntwo fellow African countries to embrace each other under\nthe OAU-brokered peace agreement and to make peace.\nThe question of Western Sahara has been on our\nagenda for too long. We urge the parties to redouble their\nefforts to conclude the identification process so that a\nreferendum can be held to decide the future of Western\nSahara once and for all, as called for by the OAU summit\nin Algiers.\nThe decision by Indonesia last year to allow the\npeople of East Timor to decide their future as they saw fit\nwas hailed by my country \u2014 and, I am sure, by many\nothers across the globe \u2014 as a momentous and wise one.\nWe lavished praise on Indonesia for this decision, fully\nconscious of the fact that it could not have been an easy\none to make.\nThe decision was quickly followed by the equally\nmomentous Agreement signed in May this year between\nthe Governments of Indonesia and Portugal, on one hand,\nand the United Nations, on the other, by which the people\nof East Timor were to decide their future through a\nreferendum. We were therefore disappointed, to put it as\nmildly as I can, by the tragic events that followed the\nholding of the referendum. The unleashing of militias on\nan innocent population \u2014 which had, with so much\ndignity and calm, voted in a referendum, as invited to do\nby Indonesia and the United Nations \u2014 deeply\ndisappointed Indonesia\u2019s friends, including my own\ncountry. The destruction of Dili, the capital of East\nTimor, and its environs by the militias ennobled no one,\nincluding Indonesia, and deserves our censure.\n6\n\n\nNow that the East Timorese have unequivocally stated\ntheir preference, which is independence, they should be\nafforded all the assistance they need to fulfil their national\naspirations without hindrance. Relations between the soon-\nto-be independent State of East Timor and the Republic of\nIndonesia should be cordial, and it is our hope that this will\nbe the case.\nThe resuscitation of the Wye River Memorandum and\nits implementation recently have given a needed fillip to the\npeace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\nThis gives us hope for the final phase of the negotiations\nthat have just begun. We urge the Israeli authorities and the\nPalestinians to persevere in the quest for peace in the\nMiddle East.\nIn the past few years we have witnessed a\nproliferation of summits and major conferences aimed at\nbuilding a consensus on issues as diverse as women and\ndevelopment, youth, the environment, human rights,\npopulation and social development, human settlements,\neducation and health. We have also convened conferences\nto address the dangers of weapons of mass destruction and\nto intensify the campaign against landmines. If summitry\nand conferences alone were the solution to the world\u2019s ills,\nour planet would by now have become a wonderful place\nto live. But this is not at all the case.\nThe cold war may have ended, but the old danger or\nthreat posed to the security of humankind by weapons of\nmass destruction remains. This is, as always, exacerbated\nby the build-up of conventional weapons beyond the\nlegitimate requirements of self-defence. Once again we urge\nthose concerned to show political will and commitment by\ntaking progressive measures to reduce nuclear weapons\nglobally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating them.\nThe adoption by the OAU of the Pelindaba Treaty and\nthe establishment of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free\nZone has demonstrated Africa\u2019s commitment to an early\nconclusion of a legally binding instrument to avert the\ndangers posed by nuclear weapons. We will continue to\nwork assiduously with our partners in the developing world\nto pursue efforts aimed at ridding the southern hemisphere\nof all weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear\nweapons.\nLandmines have continued to maim and kill innocent\npeople. We must redouble our efforts to ban their\nproduction, stockpiling and use. We must all become party\nto the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction.\nThe challenges of development have become more\nformidable in today\u2019s globalizing world. Increased\nintegration of markets and the rapid transfer of technology\nand of other innovations, as well as a wide array of\neconomic, social and political relationships, band our\nnations together and dictate a common destiny for our\npeoples. To survive the global competition, we in the\ndeveloping world must timeously and adequately respond\nto the opportunities and challenges facing us. In order to\ndo so we need to vigorously pursue strategies that will\nincrease trade prospects. We need also to raise the\nproductivity of our labour force and the quality of our\nhuman resources. It is crucial that in our pursuit of\nsustainable economic development, the basic tenets of\ndemocracy and good governance be upheld at all times\nand never be sacrificed.\nAt the Algiers summit of the OAU, our leaders had\nsubstantive discussions on how to harness the forces of\nglobalization for the benefit of the African region and for\nthe prosperity of our peoples. They solemnly committed\nthemselves to striving to ensure that globalization does\nnot transform Africa into a marginalized bystander. We\nrecognize, however, that to move forward, the entire\ninternational community has to be fully engaged. This\nwould by no means be merely a charitable act, but rather\nan investment in global peace and security.\nThe United Nations, as a universal forum, is\nuniquely placed to promote international cooperation by\naddressing the challenges of development in the context\nof interdependence. However, this can be achieved only\nif the United Nations is provided adequate financial\nresources. We note with deep concern that the last five\nyears have seen a steady decline in the resources of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the leading\noperational arm of the United Nations.\nFar too many of our people live in abject poverty.\nFar too many die of preventable diseases such as\ntuberculosis and malaria. Unemployment remains\npervasive, especially among the young.\nAfrica\u2019s economic recovery and growth potential\ncontinue to be frustrated by the mounting foreign debt.\nDespite the numerous relief efforts, a durable solution to\nthe problem has remained unattainable. My delegation\nacknowledges the efforts being made through the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative in 1996.\n7\n\n\nBut while the HIPC Initiative can be a catalyst in the\nsearch for the solution, it cannot be the solution itself. To\nreach the heart of the debt problem, it is imperative that the\ndebtors and the creditors acknowledge the seriousness of\nthe problem and work together to strike a compromise that\ncould yield long-term results.\nWe appreciate the efforts being made by the Bretton\nWoods institutions and the donor Governments to address\nthe debt problem, particularly the seminar recently held in\nthe Kenyan capital of Nairobi, chaired by the President of\nBotswana, Mr. Festus Mogae, whose results we hope will\nbe followed up. We still believe, however, that the\npermanent solution to Africa\u2019s debt problem should go\nbeyond the mere rescheduling of the debt-payment period\nto outright cancellation and debt forgiveness.\nThe alarming rate of the spread of the HIV/AIDS\npandemic is undoubtedly the most worrisome and urgent\nproblem facing sub-Saharan Africa, Botswana being one of\nthe hardest-hit countries. My Government is responding\nwith an aggressive national information and education\ncampaign to combat this destructive disease. The\nachievements made so far in the health sector and the\neconomy are in jeopardy.\nThe advancement of women and the elimination of all\nforms of discrimination and violence against them in many\nsocieties are yet to be achieved. Women and young girls\nare still subjected to all manner of brutalities.\nThe plight of millions of children who are conscripted\ninto armies in various parts of the world is an outrage. The\nimages of children being conscripted and trained to\nparticipate in senseless wars caused by the folly of adults\ndehumanizes us all. Everything must be done to discourage\nthis evil practice and to punish those who insist on\nperpetrating it. The Government of Botswana fully supports\nthe work of the Special Representative of General\nAssembly for Children and Armed Conflict and remains\nfully committed to upholding all the international legal\ninstruments on the rights of children. My delegation\nattaches great importance to these issues and urges the\ncommunity of nations here gathered to join their efforts in\nthe search for solutions to these socio-economic problems.\nIn turning now to the reform of the United Nations, let\nme briefly say the following: A wise man adapts to\ncircumstances, as water shapes itself to the vessel that\ncontains it. So says a Chinese proverb. That the United\nNations, particularly its Security Council, needs to adapt\nitself to the era in which it exists today, I think is\naxiomatic. The fact that the Security Council\u2019s\nundemocratic composition is an insult to the\noverwhelming majority of the Members of this\nOrganization is also, I think, self-evident and recognized\nas such even by those who would, if allowed, keep this\nimportant organ as it is.\nAfrica, demands to be properly represented in the\nSecurity Council in both categories of representation. We\nwill never tire of insisting on our demand for three\nadditional non-permanent seats and at least two permanent\nseats.\nLet me conclude by once again wishing you well,\nSir, in your tenure of office as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We can assure you\nthat our commitment to the United Nations remains as\nstrong as ever. This Organization, I am sure we all agree,\nis irreplaceable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The\nRepublic of Haiti finds it a source of genuine satisfaction\nthat the fifty-fourth regular session of the General\nAssembly is being presided over by Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\na man for whom we have a great deal of admiration. With\npositive results, he has competently and responsibly served\nhis country, Namibia, which is quite rightly considered one\nof the symbols of the success of our Organization. We take\nthis opportunity to wish him every success in the\ntremendous and noble task he has undertaken.\nWe pay tribute to Mr. Didier Opertti, Foreign Minister\nof Uruguay, who so effectively conducted the proceedings\nof the fifty-third session.\nWe also take this opportunity to convey our most\nsincere greetings to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nwho, at a time when our world is facing many challenges,\nhas known how to use his intelligence and the wisdom of\nhis great experience to help the community of nations face\nup to the inevitable changes of the twenty-first century.\nWe also welcome, with great satisfaction, the\nadmission of the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tanga as full-fledged Members\nof our Organization. They will strengthen the universal\nnature of the Organization and enrich its diversity of points\nof view.\nWe take the floor this 1 October, one day after the\nanniversary of the bloody coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 1991, a genuine\nact of assassination of democracy and of the dream of an\nentire people. Without the determined action of the United\nNations and its Members, contemplating this sad and\ndeadly event would have been even more painful for the\npeople of Haiti today. We would therefore like to express\nonce again our gratitude to the international community\nfor having ensured the restoration of democratic\nconstitutional order in Haiti.\nSince that restoration of democracy, the Government\nand the people of Haiti, helped by the international\ncommunity, have worked zealously to ensure an\nenvironment favourable to the blossoming of democracy\nand economic progress. This effort has not yet yielded the\nresults we had hoped for, because over the last five years\nthe Republic of Haiti has had to confront problems arising\nfrom the complexity of its situation. But through the will\nof our people and its Government, the Haitian dream of\ndemocracy will become a reality.\nAbove all, the Government of the Republic is still\nconvinced of the critical importance of the renewal of its\ninstitutions, in particular of the Parliament, most of whose\nmembers had their term of office expire on 11 January\n1999. To this end, fair, honest, democratic elections will\nbe organized in the next few months. The head of State,\nMr. Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, has repeatedly and solemnly affirmed\nhis determination to create the conditions to make it\npossible for the elections to be organized by the\nProvisional Electoral Council. Of course, as guarantor of\nthe functioning of the institutions, the President of the\nRepublic has considered that the most important thing is\nthe establishment of the physical conditions necessary for\nwell-organized elections, rather than hasty elections the\nresults of which might be called into question because of\norganizational shortcomings. For President Pr\u00e9val, the\nholding of the elections must lead to a solution to our\ncrisis and not its perpetuation, or even the creation of yet\nanother crisis.\nIn order to work to consolidate its achievements, the\nGovernment hopes that a consensus will be found to\ncontinue technical assistance for professionalizing the\nNational Police, in strict compliance with Haitian law.\nThe Government of the Republic wants to avoid any\ninterruption of the effort to thoroughly reform the judicial\nsystem and to promote full respect for all dimensions of\nhuman rights.\n18\n\n\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is\nundoubtedly a highly symbolic moment. As the last session\nof this century, it ought to come up with a vision that\nwould make our Organization an essential and efficient\ninstrument for meeting the challenges that await us in the\ntwenty-first century. We know the contours of this vision,\nas they were sketched after the Stockholm Conference on\nthe Human Environment, the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment in Copenhagen and the Rio Earth Summit.\nThe sketch is filled in by the ideal of the peoples of the\nwhole world, as expressed in our Charter: to save future\ngenerations from the scourge of war, to ensure respect for\nfundamental human rights, to promote social progress and\nto establish better conditions of living in greater freedom.\nThus, our task at this fifty-fourth session should be to fully\nwork out, by means of our discussions and the work of the\nvarious committees, the concept and ways of implementing\nthis vision.\nThe fifty-fourth session will also be an opportunity for\nthe United Nations to give deeper thought to its mission of\nensuring international peace and security and of promoting\neconomic and social development. In this regard, the\nRepublic of Haiti is happy to note that the situation in East\nTimor is improving following the actions of the\ninternational community and its cooperation with the\nIndonesian authorities. We hope that the presence of the\nmultinational peace force will help bring the country out of\nthe chaos into which it has been plunged. We urge the\nIndonesian Government and its allies in East Timor to fully\nrespect the decision of the ballot box and to take measures\nto ensure East Timor\u2019s peaceful transition to independence\nand democracy.\nThe Republic of Haiti also welcomes the end of the\nstate of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The\nAgreement signed in Lusaka, under the aegis of President\nFrederick Chiluba, between the protagonists in this conflict\nis clear evidence that Africa is in the process of providing\nitself with the means to become master of its diplomatic\nand geographical destiny.\nThe Republic of Haiti calls upon India and Pakistan to\ndo everything possible to find a permanent solution to the\nKashmir conflict and to put an end to their nuclear arms\nrace, which is indeed a frightening process that diverts\ntremendous financial resources and brainpower to\ndestruction when they could be put at the service of\nsurvival and development.\nOnce again the Haitian Government reiterates its\ncondemnation of all forms of terrorist activities that might\ncause material and human damage. We reaffirm our faith\nin the fundamental rights of man and in the general\nprinciples of international law as the basis of norms that\ngovern the relations among States.\nIn the face of the conflicts that threaten international\npeace and security, it is reassuring that the Director-\nGeneral of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization, Mr. Federico Mayor, has had the\nidea of promoting throughout the world the culture of\npeace, which is so vital to good relations within and\nbetween nations. The promotion of a genuine culture of\npeace is inseparable from the democratization of the\ninternational order. One of the fundamental aspects of this\ndemocratization lies in the solution to the question of\nequitable representation in the Security Council. It is time\nfor this Assembly to reach a consensus on this subject of\nsuch crucial importance for the future of our\nOrganization.\nAn equally important point for establishing a\ngenuine culture of peace is the implementation of United\nNations resolutions in the realm of international security.\nMany resolutions have not been implemented when their\nimplementation would be decisive, not only in the context\nof North-South relations, but also in the context of the\nindispensable relationships to be developed between\nStates, international institutions and non-governmental\norganizations.\nOver the last two months, the Government and the\npeople of Haiti have observed with sadness and\nhelplessness the destruction wreaked and the terrible toll\ntaken by the natural disasters that have struck Turkey,\nTaiwan, Greece, the Bahamas and the United States. We\nwish to reiterate to the people of these countries that we\nshare their pain and offer our heartfelt solidarity, having\nourselves, unfortunately, experienced such disasters.\nWe take this opportunity to repeat that the Haitian\nGovernment is following attentively the evolution of\nrelations between the two countries on the Taiwan Strait.\nOur Government notes with satisfaction that the two sides\nare undertaking measures to establish a climate of\nconfidence, respect and prosperity, which will be of the\nutmost benefit to the peoples who live there.\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, the fight for the\nelimination of poverty remains one of the most noble\ntasks of the United Nations system, in order to establish,\nas we are bidden by our Charter, better living conditions\nfor the human beings living on this earth.\n19\n\n\nPresident Gurirab recently echoed the feelings of the\nvast majority of developing countries when he noted that\nglobalization might open the floodgates of competition in\nsuch a way that certain States would be wiped off the map.\nTherefore it is up to the United Nations and to each country\nto examine attentively the means of remedying the ill\neffects of globalization on the social and economic\nstructures of every country \u2014 and particularly its effects on\nsmall developing countries. Certainly globalization has its\npositive side, bringing human communities closer together\npolitically, socially and culturally. But it must not be used\nas a pretext for a standardization that might neutralize the\ndiversity that is the very strength of humanity.\nOn the eve of the third millennium what should unite\nus more than ever, beyond our differences and often highly\ndivergent interests, is the laying down of foundations to\nbring about the security of all and the elimination of\npoverty as the initial phase of a planetary process of true\nsustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I sincerely\ncongratulate Mr. Gurirab on his election as President of\nthe General Assembly at this session, the last to be held\n37\n\n\nbefore the start of the new millennium, and I wish him\ngreat success in the performance of his duties. At the same\ntime I wish to thank his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for\nthe effective way in which he presided over the previous\nAssembly.\nSpain subscribes fully to the statement made by the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Finland on behalf of the\nStates members of the European Union and should like to\ncontribute to this general debate by presenting my\ndelegation\u2019s point of view with regard to the complex\nproblems facing the United Nations at this time.\nI should also like to welcome the Republic of Kiribati,\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Spain\noffers them its full cooperation in the tasks that await them\nas new Members of the Organization.\nThis has, indeed, been a difficult year for the\nOrganization. Serious crises have arisen in different parts of\nthe world and, at times, the role played in them by the\nUnited Nations has been questioned. We are all aware of\nthe efforts made by the Secretary-General to enable the\nOrganization fully to play the role for which it was founded\nin 1945. However, in certain sectors of international public\nopinion the idea has taken hold that the United Nations has\nbeen incapable of assuming its central and proper role in\nsuch situations.\nLike any human institution, the United Nations has\nhad its successes and its failures. Nevertheless, it has been\na key factor in international relations throughout the second\nhalf of the twentieth century and it continues to be so on\nthe threshold of the twenty-first. It fulfils an essential\nfunction, which will have to be progressively strengthened\nas the phenomenon of globalization develops. It is indeed\na unique instrument for the international relations we are\nsharing for the twenty-first century.\nIt is obvious that, while acknowledging the unique\nvalue of the United Nations, we must revise some aspects\nof the way in which it operates. That is why the process of\nreform undertaken by the Secretary-General is so important.\nWe must continue to make further progress in that\ndirection.\nI should like to stress that Spain does not think of the\nreform of the United Nations as an exercise whose sole and\nessential objective is to save money. Rather, we consider\nsuch reform to be a way of enabling it successfully to meet\nthe challenges of the new century.\nA key aspect of this process is the reform of the\nSecurity Council. Spain believes that such reform must\npursue three basic goals. First, there must be greater\ntransparency in its working methods, with an increase in\nthe number and the quality of the consultations, both\nbetween the countries that make up the Council and\nbetween those countries and other Member States.\nSecondly, it should be more efficient, for which purpose\nit would be advisable to limit the exercise of the right of\nveto. There are instances in which the exercise of this\nright, or even the more or less veiled threat to exercise it,\nhas blocked the functioning of the Security Council and\nprevented the adoption of essential decisions that enjoyed\na broad consensus within the international community. To\na large extent, that has promoted the image of the United\nNations as inefficient and impotent in the eyes of some\nsectors of public opinion. Thirdly, it should be made more\ndemocratic, which would mean adapting the Council\u2019s\ncomposition to recent developments in the international\ncommunity. In current circumstances, and given the split\nbetween Member States, it seems possible to reach a\nsufficient consensus only with regard to the idea of\nincreasing the number of non-permanent members. Spain\nis in favour of increasing the representation on the\nSecurity Council of all regional groups.\nDelays in the payment of contributions by some\nStates are unjustifiable and endanger the very operation of\nthe Organization at the very time when it is called upon\nto carry out increasingly complex tasks. It is not possible\nto tolerate the current level of non-payment and at the\nsame time require the United Nations to set up the United\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, to\norganize the transition to independence in East Timor, to\nestablish international criminal courts, to deal with the\nplight of refugees, to send peacekeeping forces to various\nparts of the world, and to allocate sufficient resources to\nits numerous development programmes.\nI would like my Government\u2019s position on this\nsubject to be properly understood. Spain is the eighth-\nlargest contributor to the Organization\u2019s regular budget,\nand as such has a very direct interest in matters such as\nbudgetary discipline and the effective use of resources.\nMoreover, Spain considers that all matters of concern to\nMember States on this issue can and must be thoroughly\ndiscussed. What is not acceptable, however, is for anyone\nto make payment conditional on the granting of unilateral\ndemands.\nThe coming Millennium Assembly will provide a\ngood opportunity to reflect on all these issues, as well as\n38\n\n\non the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\ncentury. That Assembly, in the preparation of which civil\nsociety will participate, must likewise encourage vigorous\ndebate yielding concrete results. That debate must, in my\nopinion, focus on two main issues: the elimination of\npoverty and the consequences of globalization.\nA policy to eliminate poverty involves, inter alia, a\nstrategy of conflict prevention, sustainable development\npolicies, good governance and the regular provision of\nfunds for development financing. All these mean that\nefforts must be pooled and responsibilities shared by\ndeveloped and developing States alike.\nGlobalization is a phenomenon that involves risks, but\nthat also creates opportunities. The risk is that the weakest\ncountries and the most defenceless sectors of the population\nwill be marginalized from its benefits. Clearly, decisive\naction by Governments is needed, along with international\ncooperation. Threats to cultural and linguistic plurality\nlikewise require decisive defensive measures.\nAt the same time, globalization also generates\nopportunities and benefits: economic growth, better\ncommunications and greater access to information, as well\nas possibilities for bringing different peoples and cultures\ncloser together. It is especially here that the unique value of\nthe United Nations is most striking. In the face of all these\nnew global problems, which go far beyond the capacity of\nStates for individual action, only a multilateral response\nwill suffice, the result of dialogue and international\ncooperation. The United Nations is the most appropriate\nforum for this.\nWith regard to peacekeeping operations, only the\nUnited Nations, in the final analysis, has the legitimacy\nnecessary to authorize them. This year Spain has doubled\nthe number of troops that it contributes to these operations;\nthey are currently deployed in United Nations missions in\nGuatemala, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and East\nTimor. To this should be added the large number of troops\nthat my country has placed at the service of missions\nauthorized by Security Council resolutions, such as the\nStabilization Force (SFOR) and KFOR. Spain participated\nin the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola\n(MONUA) until its recent termination, and is now\ncooperating with the project to strengthen African\ncapabilities for peacekeeping operations.\nAs a reflection of my country\u2019s commitment, Spain\nwill in the next few weeks sign a memorandum of\nunderstanding on placing a rapidly deployable\npeacekeeping force at the disposal of the United Nations.\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, it is no longer\ntolerable to mankind\u2019s ethical conscience that atrocities\nand war crimes should go unpunished. But until recently\nthe international community had not channeled these\ngeneralized feelings into a course of concrete action. Yet\nagain, it was the United Nations that did this, by\nconvening the Rome Conference at which the Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court was adopted. Spain\nsigned the Statute, and the ratification process is now at\nan advanced stage. Moreover, Spain has taken initiatives\nto promote the signing and ratification of the treaty in\norder that it may enter into force as soon as possible.\nThe United Nations has made a vital contribution to\nthe universalization of human rights. Having been elected\na member of the Commission on Human Rights for a\nthree-year period, Spain will continue to cooperate with\nthe United Nations in the defence of these rights in line\nwith one of the basic tenets of its foreign policy.\nClosely related to this issue is the concept of human\nsecurity. At a previous session of the General Assembly,\nSpain took the initiative to propose a draft resolution on\nthe safety and security of international humanitarian\npersonnel, which was ultimately adopted as resolution\n52/167. The activity of the Special Committee on\nChildren and Armed Conflict is especially important at\nthis time, as is the significant work of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Special Representative on this matter, Mr. Olara\nOtunnu. The recent Security Council resolution 1261\n(1999) is a major step forward in the approach to this\nproblem.\nDevelopment cooperation is undoubtedly one of the\nmain global issues on the United Nations agenda. The\nspecial meeting on development financing planned for\n2001 must be properly prepared, and the follow-up of the\nmajor conferences must continue.\nSpain attaches special importance to the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative, whose\nscope and depth must be enhanced. In the wake of\nhurricane Mitch, Spain initiated debt-cancellation\nprogrammes for the most harshly affected countries of the\nCentral American region.\nMy country has made a substantial effort in recent\nyears in respect of its development cooperation\nprogrammes. Not many years ago Spain was an aid\n39\n\n\nrecipient, while it now stands above the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development average in the\npercentage of its gross domestic product devoted to\ndevelopment. In 1998, official development assistance funds\ngrew by 14 per cent, placing Spain among the three\ndeveloped countries which had most increased these funds\nduring the year.\nWith regard to disarmament, the United Nations and\nthe Conference on Disarmament will continue to prepare\nfor a conference on small arms to be held in 2001, and will\nattempt to offset recent reversals in the non-proliferation\nregime. It is essential that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty should speedily enter into force, and that\ndifficulties in the preparation of the next review conference\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nbe overcome.\nIt is also necessary to conclude negotiations on a\nverification protocol to the Convention on the Prohibition\nof the Development, Production and Stockpiling of\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\nTheir Destruction, and to address the issue of fissile\nmaterials.\nThere are many other global issues on which the\nUnited Nations plays a vital role, such as the fight against\nterrorism, drugs and organized crime. However, I should\nlike to dwell for a moment on another matter to which my\nGovernment attaches great importance: problems of ageing\nand of older people. Spain wishes to contribute to the\ndebate on an international strategy on older people based on\nthe existing model in my country. Spain has also submitted\nits candidacy as the venue for the second World Assembly\non Ageing, which could be convened in 2002.\nFinally, allow me to refer to the problem of\ndecolonization. At the conclusion of this Decade for the\nEradication of Colonization, my country continues to\nendure the presence of a colonial enclave on its territory.\nGibraltar was occupied by British troops in 1704, during\none of the European wars of succession. The Territory was\nturned into a military base and the Spanish population was\nexpelled. Until very recently Spanish citizens in Gibraltar\nsuffered grave discrimination in the exercise of their rights.\nGeneral Assembly resolution 2353 (XXII) backed the\nSpanish views on the decolonization of the Territory,\nrecognizing that Gibraltar\u2019s colonial situation should be\nsettled not through self-determination, but, rather, through\nthe restoration of Spanish territorial integrity. Unfortunately,\nits terms have been ignored by the colonial Power. Spain\nand Great Britain began a process of negotiation on all\nthe issues, including sovereignty, based on the 1984\nBrussels Declaration, but no significant progress has been\nmade. Spain has made a proposal to the United Kingdom\nthat takes into account the interests of the inhabitants of\nthe colony and would allow for the recovery of\nsovereignty over the Territory after a lengthy period, so\nfar without reply. My Government will continue both its\ndialogue with the United Kingdom and cooperation with\nthe decolonization Committee in following up on this\nissue.\nFrom the crises the world has lived through this\nyear, we must learn certain lessons. One is without doubt\nthat the political resolution of the crisis in Kosovo has\nonly been possible thanks to the United Nations, which\nfaced an urgent challenge, and on the success or failure\nof its response depends to a large extent the public image\nof our Organization.\nIn the Western Sahara Spain has supported with\nconcrete measures the action of the United Nations\nMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\n(MINURSO), and also the Secretary-General\u2019s settlement\nplan. It is willing to increase this support if asked to do\nso by the Organization and if the parties directly involved\nagree.\nThe new possibilities in the Middle East after the\nsigning of the Sharm-el Sheikh Memorandum are seen by\nmy country with great hope, and we are firmly committed\nto continue cooperating with all sides so that the process\nbegun in Madrid continues on track.\nOther regions of the world have suffered particularly\nduring this past year. Unfortunately, this is especially true\nof Africa, and therefore I wish to emphasize my country\u2019s\nsupport for the integrated approach taken by the\nSecretary-General in treating the causes of the conflicts\nand promoting peace on that continent.\nFinally, the most recent challenge to the United\nNations is the situation in East Timor. Spain welcomed\nthe adoption of Security Council resolution 1264 (1999),\nand is willing to contribute to the multinational force to\nguarantee security in the Territory. My country, likewise,\nhas announced a special contribution to the fund\nestablished by the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees(UNHCR) to deal urgently\nwith the acute humanitarian situation and the refugee\nproblems on the island.\n40\n\n\nThe Organization\u2019s undertakings are sometimes\nvisible, at other times hidden, but they are always\nindispensable. The citizens of our countries must value\nthem so that the United Nations may enjoy the backing that\nit needs in order to perform its important duties effectively.\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, Spain\nreiterates yet again its firm commitment to the Organization\nand its willingness to put its capacity for external action at\nthe service of the purposes and principles enumerated in the\nCharter."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish, on behalf of the Islamic\nRepublic of Mauritania, to congratulate His Excellency\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I am\nconvinced that his experience and his wisdom will enable\nhim to guide the work of the session to a successful\nconclusion. My delegation assures him of its complete\ncooperation in that noble task.\nI take this opportunity also to express my thanks to\nhis predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the distinguished\nmanner in which he has conducted the session just\nconcluded.\nI would also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his tireless efforts in reforming and\nrestructuring the Organization, and in improving its\nfunctioning and strengthening its role in all areas so that\nit can adapt to the requirements and challenges of the\nday. In this regard, we welcome the valuable report on\nthe work of the Organization that he presented at the\nbeginning of these proceedings.\nMauritania welcomes the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to the\nmembership of our Organization. We would like to\nexpress our readiness to work with them to achieve the\nobjectives of the United Nations.\nWe have to undertake immediately the reform of the\nUnited Nations and the restructuring of its organs in order\nto serve the world\u2019s common interests. No one can deny\nthat the circumstances in which the Organization was\nfounded more than 50 years ago have changed a great\ndeal, and that important new changes have occurred in all\nareas since then. This only makes a re-examination of the\nstructures and working methods of the Organization more\nimperative. It is in this spirit that my delegation supports\nthe expansion of representation in the Security Council in\naccordance with the principles of democracy, transparency\nand equity in order to ensure equitable geographical\nrepresentation in that body, and to reflect the universal\nnature of our Organization, as laid down in the Charter.\n18\n\n\nAs we meet at the threshold of the third millennium,\na large portion of humanity still lives in conditions that do\nnot enable people to satisfy their legitimate hopes and\naspirations to live in a world where peace, justice and well-\nbeing reign. In spite of some encouraging indicators in\ncertain developing countries, the general tendency is that of\na widening gap between developed and developing\ncountries. The latter are going through profound changes\nover which they have no control, affected by, among other\nthings, their debt burden, deterioration of commodity prices,\npoor access to international markets and weakness of\nforeign investment. This situation should alert the\nOrganization of the need not to limit its actions to the\ntraditional maintenance of international peace and security.\nThe situation calls for the Organization to strive to lighten\nthe heavy burden under which the developing countries\nlanguish in the economic and social fields. The United\nNations must also help these countries step up the pace of\ntheir economic growth. In this regard, donor countries\nshould increase their official development assistance,\nincrease their foreign investment and open up their markets\nto the products of developing countries in order to help\nbring about a new world order based on dialogue,\ncooperation and solidarity.\nIn this context, and since debt constitutes a burden that\nthe developing countries are incapable of bearing, it is\nimperative to give the question of debt the attention it\ndeserves. We express the hope that initiatives taken to help\nthe most heavily indebted poor countries will make it\npossible to eliminate the obstacles that are neutralizing and\nfrustrating their development efforts.\nToday the world faces many troublesome situations,\nthe consequences of which are felt beyond the frontiers of\nthe countries immediately involved. Such situations threaten\nsecurity, nationally, regionally and internationally, and call\ninto question the progress achieved towards economic and\nsocial development. We are required to find proper\nsolutions for such problems. By way of example, I would\nmention terrorism, human rights violations and poverty.\nIn this regard, my country reiterates its condemnation\nof terrorism, whatever its origin and form. It calls on the\ninternational community to strengthen cooperation and\ndialogue in order to combat this phenomenon with\ndetermination and firmness.\nLast year the General Assembly commemorated the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, which coincided with the fifth anniversary of the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights in Vienna. That was\nan opportunity to evaluate the results of the\nimplementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme\nof Action and the remaining obstacles in this area, and to\nidentify necessary measures for the full implementation of\nthe recommendations that the World Conference on\nHuman Rights had adopted and that my country is\nstriving to translate into reality.\nWe should also mention the special session on\npopulation and development held by the General\nAssembly in this very Hall at the end of last June at\nwhich the Programme of Action of the Cairo International\nConference on Population and Development was\nreaffirmed. We hope that the results of that meeting will\nhelp improve the standard of living of all peoples and will\nhelp bring about sustainable development thanks to the\nstrengthening of the correlation between questions of\npopulation and those of development. In this area, I\nwould like to point out that my country has stepped up its\nefforts to promote the status of women and to combat\nilliteracy in all its forms, and it has produced programmes\nwith beneficial effects for the family, for children in\nparticular and for society in general.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania has adopted a\nforeign policy based on immutable principles of\npromoting good-neighbourly relations, peaceful\ncoexistence and the enhancement of regional and\ninternational cooperation. On the basis of these principles,\nmy country attaches particular importance to\nstrengthening stability and to containing the numerous\nsources of tension throughout the world, which are likely\nto jeopardize international peace and security and\ncompromise the development efforts of nations.\nWhile reaffirming its whole-hearted support for the\npeace process, my country believes that no just,\ncomprehensive and lasting peace can be brought about in\nthe Middle East without the application of the principle of\nland for peace as agreed at the Madrid Conference, and\nthe comprehensive implementation of Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), which\nguarantee Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Palestinian\nterritories, as well as from the Syrian Golan Heights,\nsouthern Lebanon and West Bekaa, and the restoration to\nthe Palestinian people of all their legitimate rights, first\nand foremost their right to self-determination and to the\ncreation of their independent State with Jerusalem as its\ncapital.\nToday, as we embark on a new era, the international\ncommunity is looking forward to reviving the peace\n19\n\n\nprocess and to restoring it to its proper track. In this regard,\nwe believe that a resumption of negotiations on all tracks\nbetween all parties concerned is a most urgent measure. We\ntherefore invite the two sponsors of the peace process to\nshoulder their responsibilities and to exert greater efforts to\npreserve the opportunity of a comprehensive, just and\nlasting peace in this region.\nIn the Gulf region, we hope to see a combination of\nregional and international efforts that would restore stability\nand concord to the region. In this regard, my country\nreaffirms its commitment to and respect for international\nlegality and the resolutions of the United Nations, and\nrepeats its rejection of anything that may be prejudicial to\nthe independence and the territorial integrity of Kuwait.\nWe also reaffirm our repudiation of any measure\nlikely to threaten the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.\nWe call for lifting the embargo that for eight years now has\nbeen inflicted on the Iraqi people, who have suffered\nenormously, especially children, women and the elderly.\nIn the Maghreb region, my country is working\ntogether with its brothers in the Arab Maghreb Union to\nestablish cooperation and dialogue in order to fulfil the\naspirations of the peoples of the region.\nAs regards the Western Sahara, my country welcomes\nthe positive steps taken towards the implementation of the\nUnited Nations plan to resolve the dispute. We reaffirm our\nreadiness to do everything in our power to promote the\nimplementation of this plan.\nWith regard to the Lockerbie incident, my country\nwelcomes the efforts undertaken to achieve a final\nsettlement of this question, including the suspension of the\nsanctions imposed against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\nAlthough we are pleased by the success of certain\ndiplomatic d\u00e9marches, we nevertheless feel that it is time\nfor the Security Council to take the necessary steps to lift\nthis embargo once and for all.\nAs regards Guinea-Bissau, my country welcomes the\nsettlement that was achieved within the framework of the\nAbuja and Lom\u00e9 Agreements, and we support the\ntransitional Government. In particular, we support the\nimplementation of commitments entered into at the Geneva\nround table and aimed at organizing pluralistic elections and\nat the reconstruction of the country.\nFurthermore, while expressing our profound concern\nabout the persistence of conflict in Somalia, we hope that\nour Somali brothers will engage in constructive dialogue\nand in a spirit of responsibility and patriotism so that a\npeaceful settlement can be reached and Somalia will again\nbe united and will regain its national sovereignty in an\natmosphere of stability and concord.\nMy country also welcomes the Peace Agreement\nreached between the legitimate Government of Sierra\nLeone and the Revolutionary United Front, and fervently\ncalls for stability and reconciliation in that country, which\nsuffered tremendously during eight years of devastating\nwar.\nMy country also notes with satisfaction the gradual\nreturn of peace to the Republic of the Congo and urges\nour Congolese brothers to continue their negotiations,\nwith a view to bringing about a peaceful settlement of\ntheir dispute so that that fraternal country can once again\nlive in peace and harmony.\nAs regards the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nwe welcome the diplomatic efforts of the fraternal\ncountries of the region, in particular South Africa and\nZambia, as well as the important role played by the leader\nof the Libyan revolution, Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi,\nin containing the crisis. In this regard, we welcome the\nsigning of the Lusaka Agreement.\nAs to Angola, my country expresses its profound\nregret at the resumption of fighting between the\nGovernment forces and the UNITA movement. In this\nregard, we reaffirm our wholehearted support for Security\nCouncil resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997) and 1173\n(1998) and urge UNITA to respect the obligations it\nentered into under the Lusaka Protocol to restore peace\nand security.\nOn the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, we\nurge the two parties to respect the ceasefire and to try to\nfind a peaceful settlement, on the basis of the plan of the\nOrganization of African Unity. In this context, we place\ngreat hope in the good-offices mission of Mr. Abdelaziz\nBouteflika, current Chairman of the OAU, to bring about\na peaceful and equitable settlement of the conflict.\nOn Kosovo, my country notes with satisfaction the\nprogress achieved in putting an end to the violence,\nrestoring confidence and reconstructing what was\ndestroyed over the long period of war.\nThe United Nations was created in order to achieve\nobjectives shared by all humanity: the maintenance of\n20\n\n\npeace, security and stability throughout the world. The letter\nand the spirit of the Charter of our Organization provide for\na just balance between the rights and obligations of all and\naim at achieving these common interests of the international\ncommunity. Therefore, today, as we are about to enter the\nthird millennium, we are duty-bound to devote our efforts\nto honouring the commitments laid down in the Charter and\nto work together to build a new world order based on\njustice and directed towards preserving international peace\nand security.\n\n"

        "file_text": "By way of introduction,\nlet me congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President\nof the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly and\nwish you every success in the execution of your important\nfunctions. I would like to use this opportunity also to\nexpress thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of\nUruguay, for his responsible work and for the efforts he has\ndevoted to United Nations activities throughout the year.\nThe Czech Republic is very pleased that after five\nyears the Assembly again has an opportunity to welcome\nnew United Nations Members \u2014 Nauru, Kiribati and\nTonga. This further expansion of the United Nations family\nis evidence of its increasingly universal nature, which the\nCzech Republic unequivocally supports.\nThis year marks an important milestone for the Czech\nRepublic, which this past spring became a member of the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), together with\nHungary and Poland. Recalling Article 1 of the Washington\nTreaty, which refers to the United Nations Charter and\ncommits its members to address international conflicts by\npeaceful means, we believe that this historic first\nenlargement of the Alliance following the end of the cold\nwar will contribute to the enhancement of stability and\nsecurity, and do so not only in our region. We support\nNATO\u2019s continued enlargement through the inclusion of\nother countries, and we are convinced that this first step\nwill also have a motivating and mobilizing character for\nthem.\nNATO\u2019s new strategic concept emphasizes its broad\napproach to security issues; it envisages the necessity of\nnot only facing military risks but also of monitoring\neconomic, social, environmental and political issues that\nmay disrupt security and stability. NATO has\ndemonstrated that it has both the functional mechanisms\nfor crisis management and the capacities to manage\nhumanitarian crises. However, there is an obvious need\nfor the Alliance\u2019s potential to be fully utilized by an\neffective cooperation with the United Nations, which has\nthe ability to oversee the restoration of civil\nadministration and infrastructure. It is this close\ncooperation that underlines the fact that our commitment\nto peace is as strong as our will to challenge gross\nviolations of human rights by military means. And, of\ncourse, the concept of regional security in Europe cannot\nbe imagined without NATO\u2019s cooperating also with the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), the Western European Union or the Council of\nEurope.\nBecause development in Europe is profoundly\ninfluenced by ever-deeper integration, the successful\ncompletion of the long-term process of our country\u2019s\nentry into the European Union is currently the highest-\npriority goal for Czech foreign policy. Having started\naccession talks in the spring of last year, the Czech\nRepublic is promoting political dialogue with the\nEuropean Union member States and associated countries.\nThrough our active involvement in the Common Foreign\nand Security Policy, we are assuming our share of\nresponsibility for development in Europe and the world,\nobviously, to date, within the restrictive framework of our\nstatus as an associated country. We attach major\nimportance to the social and environmental dimensions of\nEuropean integration. We are fully aware that the\nimportance of these dimensions will continue to increase\nin order to keep up with the advancement of\nglobalization.\nThe disintegration of the bipolar world has brought\nabout a transition from confrontation to cooperation given\nrise to efforts to create a new security architecture, and\nled to integration processes, particularly on the European\ncontinent. However, it has also brought about the\nresurgence of dormant threats and the emergence of new\ncentres of instability. The Kosovo tragedy and other crises\nhave brought us closer to recognizing the importance of\nthe principle of the personal security of human beings and\nits guarantees as a precondition of peace and security in\nthe world. The fact that the worst atrocities, which have\nnothing in common with the civilized world, are still\n46\n\n\nbeing committed at the end of the twentieth century makes\nthis recognition all the more sad and alarming. In this\ncontext, the Czech Republic would express its appreciation\nand support for the work of the International Tribunal for\nthe Former Yugoslavia. The Czech Republic is convinced\nthat the international community\u2019s efforts should result in\njust punishment for all the atrocities committed.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Secretary of State for Foreign\nand Commonwealth Affairs, Robin Cook, correctly argued\nhere that we must counter the culture of impunity. All\ncriminals should be held to account. As Secretary- General\nKofi Annan said, massive and systematic violations of\nhuman rights should not be allowed to stand, wherever they\nmay take place.\nKosovo will be the benchmark for the success\nachieved by international institutions. Kosovo is now in a\nperiod when it is necessary to defend peace, a period in\nwhich to achieve political stability and democratization,\neconomic stabilization and a gradual development of the\nregion. The Czech Republic is interested in the region\u2019s\nstability in all respects. That is why it participated, in its\ncapacity as the currently presiding country of the Central\nEuropean Initiative, in the Stability Pact Summit meeting at\nSarajevo and why it will be working towards\ndemocratization, economic reconstruction and security in\nthe region. We are, of course, fully aware that this is far\neasier said than done. The obstacles on the road are\nnumerous and enormous.\nThe United Nations plays an irreplaceable role in\nproviding for international peace and security. The peaceful\nresolution of disputes will undoubtedly continue to be one\nof the main priorities of the United Nations. The Czech\nRepublic therefore attaches great importance to the use of\npeacekeeping operations in dealing with crisis situations and\nsupports the efforts directed towards their greater efficiency,\nparticularly as regards their rapid deployment. Speed\nappears to be the key aspect in many cases. However, the\nUnited Nations must also have adequate funding to carry\nout this demanding role effectively; unfortunately, its\nfinancial resources are considerably limited at present\nbecause of the fact that some Member States fail to honour\ntheir financial obligations. The United Nations Interim\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has been\nmarked by these problems: the Mission was not financially\nsecured to the degree which would have corresponded with\nthe security situation at hand and with the very difficult\ntask of restoring the civil administration in Kosovo. On the\nother hand, it was probably the most rapidly deployed\nmission in the history of the United Nations.\nThe importance of UNMIK is shown by the fact\nthat, as the highest civilian authority in Kosovo, it\ncoordinates activities of international regional\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations. The\nCzech Republic greatly appreciates the positive\ncooperation between UNMIK and KFOR, although it is\nevident that the international security forces cannot in the\nlong term replace civilian administration and police\nforces.\nA major degree of responsibility lies on the\nshoulders of the United Nations, and especially on those\nof the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative, Mr.\nBernard Kouchner, in Kosovo. I had an opportunity to get\nto know his difficult task at first hand during my visit to\nPristina a few days ago. The Secretary-General\u2019s Special\nRepresentative needs the full support of the international\ncommunity in his efforts, including the transformation of\nthe UCK into a non-military Kosovo protection corps.\nThe Czech Republic obviously supports all steps and\nmeasures which may bring about the establishment of a\ndemocratic and multi-ethnic society in Kosovo as\nstipulated by the Washington North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) Summit. Unfortunately, during my\nstay in Kosovo I did not come across any convincing\nevidence that that vision could really be implemented in\nany foreseeable future \u2014 just the contrary. The\ndiminishing number of Serbs in Kosovo, the continuous\nthreats of murder \u2014 even to very old Serbian ladies \u2014\nthe rising influence of a mafia, which Mr. Kouchner told\nme about, the ever-present spirit of revenge, the lack of\ntrained police forces, the absence of local civil\nadministration, the disease of corruption and rivalry\nbetween different sectors of the Kosovo Albanians are\njust some of the obstacles which have to be dealt with\ndecisively in order to prevent the vision of the future\nfrom becoming nothing but a never-fulfilled dream.\nI wholeheartedly agree with the Secretary-General\u2019s\nunequivocal statement that commitment to humanitarian\naction must be universal if it is to be legitimate. This\nmeans not only that our commitment to peace and\nstability cannot end with the cessation of hostilities but\nthat we have to be seen to be objective and even-handed\ntowards all ethnic groups, as well as towards all regions.\nI am glad to note that the recent argument that \u201cEast\nTimor is not Kosovo\u201d was quietly dropped. The\nSecretary-General has said that humanity, after all, is\nindivisible; we have to wholeheartedly agree with him.\nThe Czech Republic intends to continue its\ninvolvement in peace operations under the leadership of\n47\n\n\nboth the United Nations and regional organizations, as\nborne out by, among other actions, the operation of Czech\nunits under NATO command in Bosnia and Herzegovina as\nwell as in Kosovo. The first Czech policemen should arrive\nin Kosovo to join the UNMIK police force within the next\nfive days. The number of police necessary to maintain civil\norder in Kosovo is now more than double the figure\noriginally estimated, Mr. Kouchner told me. Police officials,\nnot the military, are trained to investigate murders or, even\nmore importantly, to take measures to prevent murders or\nother grave challenges to law and order. The Czech\nRepublic is also prepared to consider sending military\nobservers to the United Nations peace missions in Sierra\nLeone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, of\ncourse, following a recent request we received from\nAustralia and the agreement on the Security Council\nmandate, also to East Timor.\nThe Czech Republic is concerned about the\ndevelopments in East Timor. We welcome the fact that\nafter decades, the people of East Timor were given an\nopportunity to implement their right to self-determination,\nand we feel very shocked that the results of the referendum\nled to bloodshed and indiscriminate killings. Indonesia\u2019s\nacceptance of the United Nations military peacekeeping\nforces has made us confident that the United Nations will\nsucceed in ensuring peace in that area.\nPeace and security in crisis-ridden areas are also\nclosely related to humanitarian relief, which is provided as\na rule to afflicted civilian populations. A radical\ndeterioration in the security situation may cause a\ndevastating humanitarian crisis, as we have seen in Kosovo.\nHere, too, there is a need to look at the possibilities of\nsimplifying the United Nations decision-making\nmechanisms. It is disturbing that, for example, the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees did\nnot have sufficient resources and capacities to tackle the\nhumanitarian crisis in that region, which was due mainly to\nsomewhat rigid procedures.\nOne of the most important tasks of the international\ncommunity is undoubtedly to prevent the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and to eliminate them\ncompletely. Our aim is still a world without any nuclear\nweapons. With regard to the forthcoming Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to be held in\nthe year 2000, the Czech Republic calls for overcoming the\nstagnation in negotiations on the relevant treaties supporting\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and for developing\nmore positive attitudes, particularly on the part of nuclear\ncountries, which will create a more favourable atmosphere\nin the disarmament process and lead to the adoption of\nclear, practical and implementable nuclear disarmament\nmeasures in the new millennium.\nThere is no question but that early ratification of the\nSTART II Treaty between the United States and Russia\nwould help considerably to revive the disarmament\nprocess. We consider the achievement of universal\napplicability of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and their speedy\nratification a very urgent task. In this respect, we\nparticularly appreciate the CTBT ratification by France\nand by the United Kingdom. The Czech Republic hopes\nthat the conference of CTBT countries, to be held at\nVienna in October this year, will help to accelerate\nratification in other countries.\nWe welcome efforts to improve the effectiveness of\nthe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\nWeapons, and we continue to express our support for\nearly negotiation of a verification protocol to the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)\nand Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction.\nRegarding conventional arms, the Czech Republic\nsupports all measures that contribute to greater\ntransparency. It consistently fulfils its obligations to notify\nthe relevant registers and supports the efforts for an\nexpansion of their procedures which would cover\nadditional types of weapons. The Czech Republic also\nfully shares the international community\u2019s grave concern\nover illegal transfers of hand-held and light weapons, and\nsupports all measures required to stop such activities. In\nthe context of the international efforts to limit and ban the\nuse of anti-personnel landmines, I can inform the\nAssembly with satisfaction that, following last year\u2019s\nratification of Protocol II to the Convention on\nProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain\nConventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be\nExcessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects,\nthe Czech Republic has completed the process of ratifying\nthe Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction and will soon deposit our\nratification instrument with the Secretary-General. We\nsupport all efforts towards achieving universal\napplicability of that Convention. We continue to be\ninvolved in international activities focused on demining\nand on providing help to landmine victims.\n48\n\n\nThe Czech Republic welcomed the enlargement of the\nConference on Disarmament by another five countries, to\nwhich I extend warm congratulations. At the same time we\nexpress our hope that the Conference on Disarmament will\nsucceed in overcoming the current stagnation and will start\ntalks not only on a treaty banning the production of fissile\nmaterials for military purposes but also on other topical\nproblems of arms control and disarmament, including\nnuclear disarmament, and on security guarantees for non-\nnuclear countries.\nThere is no doubt that this year has been a real test for\nthe United Nations, as well as a critical test of transnational\ndecision-making during crises. This test, so crucial for the\nfuture of the United Nations, has not yet been concluded\nand properly evaluated. It is not only Kosovo that has\nrevealed that the United Nations in its present form does\nnot make full use of its potential to be an irreplaceable\nvehicle for achieving the goals set out in the Charter. At the\nthreshold of the third millennium, the Organization\ntherefore looks for an answer to the question of how the\ninternational community can become a truly responsible\ncommunity and what role the United Nations will play in\nthis process.\nIn our view, the United Nations must first of all\nrespond to the changed substance of conflicts in today\u2019s\nworld. These are not classical conflicts between States but,\nin most cases, internal conflicts rather similar to civil wars.\nThe United Nations and the international community in\ngeneral face the need to clearly define the relationship\nbetween national sovereignty and the protection of human\nrights and ultimately to engage in a discussion on how they\nshould support sensible civilian Governments that keep\narmed forces under control. In this context, we should\nclearly focus on the Secretary-General\u2019s argument about\nindividual sovereignty and the right of every individual to\ncontrol his or her own destiny.\nSecondly, the urgency of a radical acceleration of the\nprocess of United Nations reform, particularly reform of the\nSecurity Council, is becoming increasingly evident. The\nCzech Republic fully supports the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreform efforts, and I would like to share the optimism\nconcerning early substantial progress in reform negotiations\nwhich Mr. Annan expressed to me during our talks in\nPrague last July. I have to admit that we consider the\nresults of this year\u2019s negotiations, especially those on\nSecurity Council reform, to be inadequate. This, of course,\ncorresponds to the role of the United Nations during the\ninitial stages of the Kosovo conflict. The composition of the\nSecurity Council requires change. The Czech Republic\nbelieves that the number of both permanent and non-\npermanent members of the Security Council needs to be\nincreased, while representation of developing countries\nhas to be strengthened.\nThirdly, conflict-prevention mechanisms need to be\ncreated, and attention should be devoted to questions such\nas discrimination, poverty, access to raw materials and the\narms trade. The arms trade does not include only\nextensive, elaborate weapons systems. It is the excessive\naccumulation of hand-held and other small arms which\nabove all requires our tough response, because these\npersonal weapons play a key role in most conflicts. I\nwould like to express my full support for the call by the\nUnited Kingdom Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, to halt\nthe illegal trade in small arms. Cooperation with regional\norganizations such as the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe and the Organization of African\nUnity, which may be more successful in dealing with\nconflicts, should also play a role in preventing conflicts.\nI very much welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s emphasis\nhere on moving from a culture of reaction to a culture of\nprevention.\nFourthly, the role of the United Nations in the area\nof human rights and as part of a broader concept of\nhuman security should be considerably intensified. We\nwelcomed the Secretary-General\u2019s personal statement in\nhis address at this year\u2019s session of the Commission on\nHuman Rights, in which he said, \u201cI have made human\nrights a priority in every United Nations programme\u201d.\nThis, it seems to me, accurately reflects the importance\nwhich the United Nations should give human rights issues\nin the future. The United Nations should ensure that the\nuniversal nature of human rights is accepted and projected\nas a leading principle for the conduct of the international\ncommunity. By our joint efforts we should guarantee a\ndignified and complete life for every individual in the\nnext millennium. It is unacceptable at the threshold of the\nnew millennium to claim that human rights are relative\nand that their violation by sovereign States on their own\nterritory is solely their internal affair and as such may not\nbe a subject of interest to other members of the\ninternational community. If the United Nations were\nunable publicly to defend the existence of human rights,\nit would be unable to defend its own existence.\nAt the same time, let us not forget the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s warning about the need to ensure universal\nlegitimacy, which he issued in connection with the\nbombing campaign against Yugoslavia. Incidentally, the\nnew Czech Government has adopted a foreign policy\n49\n\n\nconcept which regards human rights as one of its main\npillars and which at the same time stresses the desirability\nof United Nations mandates for peace-enforcing operations.\nFifthly, it is in the vital interest of the United Nations\nfor the world to step into the twenty-first century under the\nrule of law in international relations. The situation in the\nformer Yugoslavia, including developments in Kosovo,\nclearly shows the extremely important role already played\ntoday by international judicial bodies in enhancing the\nprestige of international law and its gradual integration into\nthe political decision-making processes. The implementation\nof international law by the United Nations international\njudicial bodies has considerable positive influence on how\nglobal public opinion perceives the United Nations itself.\nLet me now touch briefly on one more serious\nproblem. Recent earthquakes in Turkey, Greece and Taiwan\nhave underlined the need for the world to be prepared to\nprovide coordinated help to an area hit by a massive natural\ndisaster. This experience should, in our view, lead to the\nfurther strengthening and deepening of the idea already\npresented some time ago, namely, the idea of the \u201cWhite\nHelmets\u201d. The challenge is to extend \u201cWhite Helmets\u201c into\nregular international rescue forces under United Nations\nleadership, capable of coordinated action on the spot \u2014\nnaturally, with the consent of the countries receiving such\nassistance. The ultimate goal could be the formation of rapid-\nresponse international forces, formed of national\ncontingents and permanently available, well-equipped expert\ngroups which could be dispatched to the stricken area in a\nmatter of minutes or hours.\nIn conclusion, let us remind ourselves once again that\nthe future of the United Nations is primarily a matter of the\npolitical will of its Member States. Finding answers to the\nquestions which have been raised at this year\u2019s session of\nthe General Assembly is therefore not only up to the United\nNations, but up to the entire international community. The\nMillennium Assembly should give us a major opportunity\nfor finding answers to these questions. I also hope that the\nMillennium Assembly will contribute decisively to the\nacceleration of work on the United Nations reforms, the\nneed for which was so clearly highlighted by the Kosovo\ncrisis. I am sure that the recovery of the commitment to\nmultilateralism and to the leading United Nations role in the\nstruggle to uphold basic Charter values, such as democracy,\nhuman rights and the rule of law, is now in sight.\nMy traditionally cautious optimism was, I admit,\nslightly strengthened in this respect by listening here to\nsome politicians representing countries with far more\nresources than the Czech Republic has at its disposal. Our\nresources are, unfortunately, fairly limited. Nevertheless,\nwe will continue to support the United Nations and, as I\nhave said, to participate in its missions to pour millions\nof dollars into humanitarian and development aid, and so\non. The point I wish to make clear in this speech, even so\nlate in the evening, is that we will always be ready to\nhelp.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, on\nbehalf of my delegation, I congratulate you on your election\nto preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. I bring you warm greetings from His Excellency\nPresident Imata Kabua of the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands. He asks that I bring to the attention of the General\nAssembly the various concerns that we wish to see\naddressed this year.\nAs the Assembly knows, the Marshall Islands was\nchosen for nuclear testing activities for the good of\nmankind. It did not turn out to be so fortunate for many of\nour people. The testing displaced many, and many were\naffected by the contamination. The Marshall Islands\ncontinues to be haunted by a legacy of nuclear testing and\nthe destruction that accompanied it. My own home island,\nUtirik, was severely affected, and as I speak today we feel\nthat there has not been a full reckoning of this dreadful part\nof our history. We have spoken about the medical effects,\nthe high costs of treating the victims and the costs of\nrehabilitating the affected areas. A recent study has proved\nthat the thyroid cancer rate in the population alive at the\ntime of the testing is very high. We are experiencing the\neffects of these ailments decades after the end of the tests.\nThe medical and social problems that were caused do not\nseem likely to go away.\nThat being said, there are some positive developments\narising from our talks with our former Administering\nAuthority. Recent discussions have highlighted the need to\nmove forward with positive measures, and this is something\nwe fully support. The problems we face are, however, very\ndifficult, and the international expertise we require is\nsimply not forthcoming. We therefore reiterate the call we\nmade at the 1995 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review\nConference that such expertise for medical measures, as\nwell as scientific and technical assistance, must be made\navailable. We have sought to have the year 2000 Review\nConference fully reflect this concern. If these issues are\nnot addressed, it is our considered view that\nnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament in general will\nbe a hollow achievement.\nI am grateful, Mr. President, for the efficient manner\nin which you conducted the proceedings of the twenty-\nsecond special session. That session will serve as a\nhighlight among our achievements this year, and I hope\nthat it will usher in a new dawn of international\ncooperation with the small island developing States.\nThe concerns that were raised at the special session\nneed not be repeated here. However, we must now look\nat how to integrate these concerns into other work of the\nUnited Nations in the field of sustainable development. It\nwould be counterproductive if the outcomes from last\nweek were not fully reflected in our other deliberations.\nThe full agenda before the Second Committee is\nindicative of the continued concern with these issues. We\nwill seek to ensure full reflection of the special session at\nthe appropriate time. At the national level we will do our\npart through the National Commission on sustainable\ndevelopment. At the regional level we will cooperate with\nthe other organizations of the Pacific island countries.\nThe interlinkages between various conventions and\nsustainable development efforts have always been clear to\nmy delegation. We are deeply concerned with climate\nchange and the devastating effect it may have on our\nlivelihood, culture, natural resources, the economy and\nour very existence. Climate change is with us now. It\nmust be stressed that bad weather is not climate change.\nHowever, the extreme events that have been observed in\nrecent years are indications of what is to be expected\nfrom climate change. Climate change is the disease, and\nwhat we are observing are the symptoms.\nIn the Pacific we have experienced a number of\nsevere weather events and changes to our normal climate.\nKiribati and the northern Cook Islands have become\nwetter, while Fiji and Tonga have become drier. In Samoa\nthe difference between daytime and night-time\ntemperatures has decreased. The southern Cook Islands\nand Tonga have also become warmer. The drought that\nhit the Marshall Islands last year was so bad that\nhouseholds could not get even two hours of fresh water\nper week.\n36\n\n\nFor small island developing States it is not just a\nquestion of waiting to see what the research will say. We\nhave to take action now. What happens to the small islands\nwill impact on the rest of the world sooner rather than later.\nWe also expect that the industrialized countries will take\nprecautionary measures. Anything less is an invitation to\nthe genocide of island peoples around the world.\nThe industrialized countries should urgently reduce\ntheir emissions, and others should follow suit. We ourselves\nare taking steps to limit our already very small emissions.\nPart of our effort is to develop our renewable energy sector.\nIn this regard, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the\nGovernment has approved a solar energy policy. The first\nstage will be a project to install solar panels on all the outer\nisland health centres and one of the high schools. With the\nsupport of the United Nations Trust Fund for New and\nRenewable Sources of Energy and the Government of Italy,\nwe hope to begin implementing this project very soon, as\nwell as the overall policy. The policy will assist us in\ngenerating sustainable livelihoods in the outer island\ncommunities.\nThe Marshall Islands was honoured to host the\nAlliance of Small Island States workshop on climate change\nthis year, and we commend the outcome to all\nGovernments. We would like to express our appreciation to\nItaly, Norway, the United States, Canada and Switzerland\nfor supporting the workshop and the United Nations Trust\nFund for providing the experts.\nAs the custodian of three-quarters of a million square\nmiles of ocean, the Marshall Islands is continuing its\nendeavours to seek equitable solutions for the governance\nof the oceans. We are cognizant that the activities that take\nplace in our neighbouring seas will have an effect on the\nsustainable development of the marine resources within our\nexclusive economic zone.\nUnsustainable fishing practices such as the use of drift\nnets and small mesh sizes must therefore be banned\nforever. The Marshall Islands has been working together\nwith the Pacific island countries to develop a regional treaty\nthat would address implementation of fisheries conservation\nand their sustainable management. Various aspects of\nimportance include the need for data collection, vessel\nmonitoring systems, and greater support for our patrol\nboats. We also need to look at limiting the fleets permitted\nto fish in our waters; this would also assist us in further\ndeveloping our domestic fleet.\nMy Government applauds the efforts of the Pacific\nForum, in particular the Permanent Representative of\nPapua New Guinea who, in cooperation with the Rio\nGroup, has brought this matter forward. We will continue\nto seek common-sense solutions to the vexing problems\nthat confront us in ocean matters.\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Marshall\nIslands has responsibility for and is predominantly\nfocused on the social development and improvement in\nthe lives of our people in the outer island communities.\nOne such example is the solar power project I mentioned.\nWe are constantly engaged in seeking solutions to address\nthese concerns, one such event being national economic\nand social summit. Through the outcome of that summit,\nwe are striving to bring about the partnerships that these\ncommunities require for their economic and social\ndevelopment. Many exciting new ideas have come\nforward, especially for the development of agriculture,\nfisheries and sustainable tourism. What is lacking is\nconcerted donor support, but we are hopeful that with\ndetailed and pragmatic proposals this situation will\nchange.\nEarlier this year, at the Preparatory Committee for\nthe follow-up to the Copenhagen Social Summit, I\noutlined some of the problems we face and the possible\nsolutions we proposed. Those ideas are still valid. My\ndelegation will continue to stress the need for support for\nthese efforts during this session and at the special session\non social development next year.\nWomen\u2019s rights are a cornerstone of the Marshall\nIslands Constitution. As a matrilineal society, we have a\ncultural attachment to the promotion of the rights of all\npeople, but especially for the women of our society. We\nhave in place a unit in the Ministry of Internal Affairs to\nassist in the implementation of our policy on women and\nto address the achievements of women in our society. I\ncan inform the Assembly that a national caucus of women\nwas recently established to increase further their\ninvolvement in the political decision-making process. My\ndelegation will actively participate in the preparatory\nwork for the special session on the implementation of the\nBeijing Conference to be held next year.\nEqually important to the Marshall Islands are human\nrights in the general sense. We have tried to give practical\nimplementation to the ideals that we all hold dear. The\nMarshall Islands Constitution defines respect for human\nrights as the fundamental obligation of the Government.\nIt sets out the basic parameters for the holding of free\n37\n\n\nelections, the right of free speech and thought, and the right\nto economic and social development. We hold these\nprinciples in high regard, and indeed we are currently in the\nprocess of holding general elections to the Parliament and\nto the local governments. The elections are free and fair,\nand open to the most stringent oversight to ensure there is\nno interference in the free choice of the people.\nIn line with our efforts to consolidate our democracy\nand our free institutions, we are looking at the opportunities\nin the various human rights instruments of the United\nNations. I hope to be able to report soon that we will\nbecome party to the most important of these instruments,\neven though I would contend that our Constitution already\ngives full voice to these rights. In this regard, we were very\nheartened to hear what the Secretary-General had to say on\nthe subject. We think that he pinpointed the real issue here:\nthat it is people who are the most important, that it is\nadherence to human rights that we must safeguard. We will\nsupport all efforts to see to it that new initiatives are given\nproper consideration.\nAs a small but determined democracy, the Marshall\nIslands supported the inclusion of the agenda item on the\nneed to examine the exceptional international situation\npertaining to the Republic of China on Taiwan and ensure\nthat the fundamental right of its 22 million people to\nparticipate in the work and activities of the United Nations\nis fully respected. We hope to achieve a resolution of this\nmatter in the near future. There is still a need for an ad hoc\ncommittee to be established to examine the matter further.\nThe United Nations has come a long way on the path\nto reform, which we all know is an ongoing process, never\na single event. My delegation congratulates the Secretary-\nGeneral for his outstanding efforts: he deserves our full\nsupport and thanks. But the reforms so far made are in\njeopardy because of the continued non-payment of\ncontributions by certain Members. This is intolerable and\ncannot continue: the support from Member States cannot\nfalter. We must all pay our dues on time, in full and\nwithout conditions.\nAs part of this reform process, we too have noted the\nanomalies in the regional groupings here at the United\nNations. We think it is high time to review this matter, as\nAustralia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and\nSamoa have all eloquently pointed out.\nThere is also a need to finalize the reform of the\nSecurity Council. In this regard, I wish to thank the\ndelegation of Italy for its reasonable and logical\ncontribution to our debate on this matter.\nWe must also ensure that the United Nations\nagencies are responsive to the special needs of the\ndeveloping countries. The Marshall Islands has benefited\nto some extent from various United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) projects. We feel that more can be\ndone, and we look forward to increasing our cooperation\nwith United Nations agencies, such as UNDP, the United\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO) and others.\nIn conclusion, Mr. President, you can count on the\nfull support and cooperation of the Marshall Islands\ndelegation to assist you in bringing our deliberations to a\nfruitful conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly. Canadians are proud to have\naccompanied you and your people on their journey to join\nthe community of nations.\nOn behalf of Canada, allow me also to welcome the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga as new Members of the United Nations.\n\nMr. President, your election is a tribute to your\nwisdom and your dedication to the goals of the United\nNations. I am convinced that you will guide us well in\ncarrying out the work that we are gathered here to do on\nbehalf of all of the world's people.\n\nIndeed, it is we the people for whom the United\nNations was founded and its purposes forged. We the\npeople, not we the nation States, or the ministers, or the\nambassadors, or the Secretariat. Let us recall these lines\nfrom the United Nations Charter:\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from the\nscourge of war, ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental\nhuman rights, ... to establish conditions under which\njustice ... can be maintained, and to promote social\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom,\n... have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish\nthese aims\u201d.\nThese are noble words and compelling goals. But do\nthey still ring true, or is there a need for new meaning and\nnew commitment?\nHow would we the people assess the handiwork of the\nUnited Nations to date and judge the world scene today\nwhen we have seen in the last year alone the brutal ethnic\ncleansing of Kosovo, the slaughter and maiming of\ninnocents in Sierra Leone, Angola, both Congos and Sudan\nand the cruel suppression of the independence agreement in\nEast Timor? Or when we see kidnapping and terrorism\nplaguing virtually every region, the growing, powerful\ninfluence of the drug-traffickers and criminals, the return of\nthe slave merchants and the emergence of modern warlords\nwho brutalize and exploit communities for economic\ngain? Or when we are all subject to the darker side of\nglobalization, where international commerce brings new\nbut poorly distributed wealth, where helpless children are\nrecruited into armies or sold on the internet for exploitive\npurposes, where environmental degradation inflicts a high\ncost on the smallest countries, which can least afford it?\nOur world on the eve of the millennium is\nincreasingly shaped by these and a variety of other direct\nthreats to people. If we the peoples were to have the\nchance to rethink the Preamble to the Charter, we might\nwell say that we are determined to save existing\ngenerations from the grave new risks to their personal and\nfamily security.\nIt is true that there is another perspective, one that\ngives a glimmer of hope. We could point with some\nsatisfaction to the fact that, through the combined efforts\nof people working together across borders, there is an\nemerging sense of accomplishment in responding to these\nnew threats to human security.\nAs of today, 86 nations have ratified the Convention\non antipersonnel mines, ushering in a legal regime and a\nplan of action that will save the lives of thousands.\nWorking together last year, 120 nations voted in\nfavour of an International Criminal Court, which will\nestablish individual accountability for crimes against\nhumanity.\nIn the field of conflict, the United Nations is now\nattempting to rebuild the broken fields of Kosovo after an\nunprecedented intervention for humanitarian reasons. And\nin East Timor, peacekeepers are bringing order to that\nlong-troubled land.\nSo we the peoples have not given up in the face of\nthe confusion, turmoil and misery which beset our world;\nand we still search through the corridors of this building\nfor words of cooperation and acts of consensus.\n(spoke in French)\nBut it is not easy, because many forget that it is we\nthe peoples, all the world's people, whom we are here to\nserve, not just their particular national interests. Too many\nprotect their prerogatives, engage in exclusive power\npolitics or refuse to pay their bills, thereby paralysing the\ninstitution and rendering it incapable of meeting the\nchallenges to our collective well-being.\n16\n\n\nIt is difficult to promote an agenda for the security of\npeople when some stand opposed, on the basis of a desire\nto protect at all costs the sovereignty of the State. Of\ncourse, State sovereignty remains a fundamental tenet of\npeace and security; but it is not absolute, and it is not a\nshield behind which the most egregious violations of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms can be hidden.\nIt is time, therefore, for we the peoples represented in\nthis Assembly to reassess our influence and make our\nvoices heard.\n(spoke in English)\nThere is a new road map to lead the way. Last week\nthe Secretary-General tabled a report on the protection of\ncivilians in armed conflict (S/1999/957) in which he\ncaptures many of today's challenges and sets out 40\nrecommendations for action.\nThe heaviest burden falls on the Security Council. The\nsearch for global peace increasingly turns on issues of\npersonal safety. Modern conflict takes a huge,\ndisproportionate toll on civilians. In this world, the\nprotection of civilians must be central to the Council's\nwork. It must provide the subtext for our future collective\naction and the impetus behind our efforts to prevent\nconflict, keep the peace, enforce sanctions and support the\ncollective will of the United Nations.\nThe way ahead is not without obstacles. There are\nlegitimate questions about the purposes, limits and\nstandards for Council engagement for humanitarian ends,\nwhich itself also present difficult contradictions with regard\nto the principle of non-interference. Clear and consistent\ncriteria are needed against which the necessity or otherwise\nof humanitarian intervention \u2014 including enforcement \u2014\ncan be judged and applied. These tests must be very\ndemanding: the basis must be the existence of fundamental\nbreaches of international humanitarian and human rights\nlaw.\nThe human dimension makes it imperative that the\nCouncil adapt the blunt instrument of sanctions into a\ntargeted tool so that they hurt where they are supposed to\nhurt. The Council needs also to show the resolve to\nimplement sanctions once they are in place. This is\nCanada's objective as chairman of the Council's Angola\nsanctions Committee established pursuant to resolution 864\n(1993) \u2014 to develop tougher measures to constrain the\ntrade in arms and diamonds, thereby making it more\ndifficult for UNITA to wage war. It is time to tackle the\nnew war economy in which a direct relationship exists\nbetween certain businesses, mercenaries and warlords, a\nrelationship that perpetuates misery, conflict and the\nvictimization of innocent people.\nA human security agenda highlights the urgent need\nto face clearly the issue of the Council's representation\nand its decision-making processes, especially the\ninappropriate use and persistent threat of the veto where\nit can compromise, complicate and slow down\ndetermined, urgent international action to protect people.\nThe Council needs to come to grips with these challenges\nif it is to maintain its credibility in the eyes of the people\nit serves. Membership in the Council is a trust, and\nCouncil members need to demonstrate their capacity to\nmaintain that trust.\nThe issues raised by the Secretary-General in his\nreport on the protection of civilians in armed conflict are\nissues that plague all peoples. The Secretary-General's\nproposals in fact go beyond the purview of just the\nSecurity Council; the onus for taking action lies with all\nMember States. For that reason, I strongly urge that the\nGeneral Assembly should begin consideration of this\nreport and move quickly to establish mechanisms to give\neffect to its recommendations, including a system of\nreporting to review implementation. Towards this end,\nCanada looks forward to working with the Secretary-\nGeneral and fellow Member States to establish a \u201cfriends\nof civilians in armed conflict\u201d group to help guide these\nefforts.\nTo protect civilians in armed conflict, the Assembly\nhas the means to enable the United Nations to act more\nquickly; the moral authority to establish universal\nstandards that hold us all accountable; and the legitimacy\nto direct efforts into new areas of global endeavour. The\nability to respond rapidly when the security of civilians is\nthreatened is essential. Giving the United Nations a rapid\nresponse capability \u2014 particularly through the creation of\na United Nations headquarters for rapid deployment \u2014\nwould be an important step. How much more effective\ncould the United Nations have been in East Timor or in\nKosovo if such a capability had existed?\nThe civilian side of peace operations \u2014 the police\nand the judges, the civil servants and the human rights\nexperts \u2014 is also of growing importance, but insufficient\ncapacity for rapid deployment is a problem here too.\nClearly the \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d are as critical to building\npeace as the Blue Helmets, and they deserve no less of\nour attention. Those of us who are able might start by\n17\n\n\nimproving our respective national capacity to make\ncontributions to be put at the service of the United Nations.\nThis is something my Government has begun and is\nworking to improve. Globally binding humanitarian and\nhuman rights standards for behaviour and practical\nmechanisms to hold transgressors accountable would also\nadvance the security of people subjected to the horrors of\narmed conflict.\nThe adoption of the Statute of the International\nCriminal Court was a qualitative step forward. It will help\nto end the culture of impunity and protect all people against\nthe most egregious violations of humanitarian law. The\nAssembly's priority now should be to bring the Court to\nlife. This means continued cooperation from us all in\nbuilding the technical underpinnings of this Court. It also\nmeans ensuring prompt and widespread ratification of the\nCourt's Statute.\nStrengthened standards and strategies are needed\nelsewhere. For example, negotiating the strongest possible\noptional protocol on the involvement of children in armed\nconflict, which should be accompanied by a comprehensive\naction plan, will help to confront one of the most heinous\naspects of modern warfare and other conflict.\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that more must\nbe done to protect humanitarian workers who risk their\nlives to help the victims of war. That is why Canada will\nbe seeking an additional protocol to the Convention on the\nSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel to\nprovide legal protection to all personnel working in\nsituations of armed conflict, including a broader range of\nnon-governmental organizations and locally employed\npersonnel.\nFinally, the Assembly can direct its efforts towards\nmaking the safety of people the emphasis in a wider range\nof global endeavours.\n(spoke in French)\nThe greatest threat to human safety remains the\npossibility of annihilation by nuclear or other weapons of\nmass destruction. Yet the non-proliferation regime that we\nhave painstakingly built over the past 50 years remains\nfragile. We should now ensure that the obligations under\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are\nrespected, and we should implement the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and reduce the risk that nuclear\nweapons pose to our collective security.\nHuman security is also the impetus behind efforts to\naddress the problem of small arms, which kill in conflict\nzones as well as on neighbourhood streets. This is a\nglobal challenge that requires a global solution. We\nshould therefore convene a conference on the illicit traffic\nin small arms, with a comprehensive agenda.\n(spoke in English)\nTransnational crime, including the illicit drug trade,\nterrorism and human smuggling, is a closely related\nchallenge. It has a direct impact on the safety of all our\npeople. The conclusion of an effective United Nations\ntransnational organized crime convention and its protocols\nwould be a start to providing that protection.\nTaken together, those efforts would be a strong\nbeginning to orienting the Assembly to meet the real\nsecurity needs of people today. I must be very blunt:\nimprovement in human security is a necessary condition\nfor success in the other important actions that we take to\nadvance human, economic, aid and trade development.\nFarmers cannot work fields strewn with mines. Children\ncannot learn when they are abused and brutalized by war.\nInvestors will not send money to regions racked by\nconflict. Societies cannot flourish when resources are\npillaged to fuel violence and people are victimized by\nterror.\nUltimately, freedom from fear is intimately\nconnected to the freedom from want. And it is freedom\nfrom fear for all peoples \u2014 which is at the heart of the\nSecretary-General's report and his recommendations \u2014\nthat provides the United Nations with a clear, defining\nrole at the century's close. Our collective efforts towards\nthat end will give concrete expression to the hopes and\ndreams of the generation that first made \u201cwe the peoples\u201d\nthe basis for this Organization. Next year's Millennium\nAssembly and summit offer an opportunity to articulate a\nvision of the United Nations that places the safety of\npeople at the centre of its agenda.\nThe United Nations cannot do it all. The challenges\nto advancing human safety are complex. Regional\norganizations play an important role. Practical cooperation\nbetween countries can address specific problems and the\nparticipation of members of civil society and non-\ngovernmental organizations is also imperative. But\nsecurity for all of us begins and ends with a strong,\neffective United Nations focused on this goal. We the\npeoples should resolve to work together to achieve this\nend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With the disintegration of\nborders, the evolution of means of communication and the\nspread of globalization in the financial and technological\nfields, the universality of the issues affecting mankind has\nbecome the most distinctive characteristic of international\nrelations, and the problems of the age have become too\ndifficult for individual countries to resolve.\nThe tragedies witnessed over the last few years,\nincluding ethnic cleansing and blatant defiance of the\nuniversal human conscience, call more than ever before for\npooling the efforts of the international community and\nconsolidating the role and the efficiency of the United\nNations, which is indeed the best-suited forum for settling\ninternational disputes. This would make it possible for the\nOrganization to fully shoulder its responsibilities and keep\nabreast of current challenges, while displaying a political\nwill that would enhance its credibility and strengthen its\nability to achieve its goals.\nAs regards the Security Council, current events on the\ninternational scene require that we reconsider its working\nmethods and its composition in order to enhance its\ncredibility, promote its ability to preserve international\npeace and security and ensure balanced representation in its\nmembership on the basis of equitable geographical\ndistribution.\nEconomic and social conditions in the world still\nrank high among the concerns of mankind. Indeed, as\nillustrated by widely divergent indicators between the\nNorth and the South, the world is suffering from a\nwidening gap in economic and social conditions and\nstrong disparities in human development. Those ever-\nincreasing disparities constitute a basic factor in the\ninstability that characterizes our world today. This\nimbalance has led to a proliferation of poverty in various\nparts of the world, as well as to the spread of illiteracy,\nunemployment and several other social ills that now\nthreaten world peace and security.\nWe recall with appreciation the distinguished role\nplayed by the United Nations, as it has developed over\nthe last few years a special interest in various economic\nand social development issues.\nMorocco is fully aware of the importance of social\ndevelopment as a fundamental means of achieving\ncomprehensive development. This awareness was the\ncornerstone of several pioneering initiatives taken by\nMorocco to overcome social problems, especially the\nplague of poverty. To that end, an institution known as\nthe Mohammed V Solidarity Foundation was set up, and\nis now under the supervision of His Majesty King\nMohammed, to fight poverty by mobilizing the active\ncomponents of civil society.\nIn keeping with its firm belief that individual and\ncollective prosperity cannot take place outside the\npurview of democracy and respect for human rights,\nMorocco has taken keen interest in the consolidation of\nhuman rights and democratic practices. Hence, Morocco\nhas undertaken some pioneering initiatives in the area of\npromoting human rights, disseminating a human rights\nculture, and protecting them against any violation or\ntransgression. It has enhanced the role of the various\ncomponents of civil society, including institutions that\npromote the role of women, in various political,\neconomic, social and cultural fields. Opting for the\nmultiparty system and democratic alternation of\ngovernment as a political system, Morocco has made\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms an individual and\na collective principle that is considered a strong pillar of\nthe Moroccan political system. This, in turn, has made it\npossible for Morocco to hold a distinguished position\namong the countries that have adopted democracy as a\nsystem and as a way of life.\n26\n\n\nConvinced of the absolute necessity of coexistence\nwith its neighbours, in keeping with the strong historical\nties between Morocco and Spain, and given the desire of\nboth countries to further enhance their cooperation and\ngood neighbourliness, Morocco has been calling for the\nimplementation of the initiative of the late King Hassan II\naimed at setting up a joint Moroccan-Spanish working\ngroup to reach a final settlement of the current status of the\ntwo cities, Ceuta and Melilla, and the neighbouring islands,\nin a way that ensures Morocco\u2019s sovereignty over those\nregions while guaranteeing Spain\u2019s economic interests. We\ndo hope that the deep historical ties between the two\ncountries, the solid and privileged relations that exist\nbetween them, and the ambitions of both peoples to achieve\nfurther rapprochement and cooperation, will be a strong\nincentive towards reaching a final solution to this problem,\nsatisfactory to both parties.\nEver since their independence, Arab Maghreb\ncountries have believed in the inevitable necessity to\nachieve regional integration in order to counter the\nchallenges of development and to ensure the progress and\nprosperity of their peoples. In keeping with those\nobjectives, the Arab Maghreb Union was set up as a\nreflection of the region\u2019s age-old shared history and an\nembodiment of its peoples\u2019 unity of faith, language, history\nand common destiny. Given the blocs and groupings that\ncharacterize the world today and the challenges imposed by\nthe current economic situation, we believe that it is\nnecessary to pursue efforts to give fresh impetus to the\nArab Maghreb Union as well as a new dynamism to its\nvarious organs, while strengthening cooperation among its\nmembers so that it may discharge its mission by taking up\ndevelopment challenges and building an integrated Maghreb\neconomy.\nMorocco welcomes with deep satisfaction the positive\ndevelopments witnessed on the Lockerbie issue, which have\nled to the suspension of the sanctions imposed on the\nsisterly Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Because of its solidarity\nwith that country, a founding member of the Arab Maghreb\nUnion and one of the pioneering leaders among Arab and\nAfrican countries, Morocco notes with deep regret the long\nlasting hardships and the grave tragedy endured by the\nLibyan people due to the embargo imposed on them. We\nhope that sanctions applied to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\nwill be completely and definitively lifted as soon as\npossible, on the basis of the principles of justice and equity,\nand that the sisterly Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will resume its\nconstructive role, within the international community, for\nthe establishment of security, stability and peace.\nThe international community has followed with\nsatisfaction the beginning of a comprehensive settlement\nof the Middle East crisis. This has been achieved through\nvarious agreements reached by the parties concerned, the\nlatest being the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum. Those\naccords rekindled the hopes of the peoples of the region\nin building a new future based on security, stability and\ncoexistence. The agreements that have been signed \u2014\nwhich are founded on the principle of land for peace \u2014\nset the stage for a new era based on international law, as\nattested to by the commitments made by the parties\nconcerned. The accords uphold the right of all peoples of\nthe region to live in security and stability, and the right of\nthe Palestinian people in particular to exercise self-\ndetermination and to establish its independent State.\nThe brotherly Iraqi people have been suffering for\nyears from the impact of an economic embargo that has\nhad pernicious effects on them, especially children,\nwomen and the elderly. As it voices full solidarity with\nthe fraternal Iraqi people, Morocco calls for the pooling\nof international efforts in order to lift the embargo and to\nfind a peaceful settlement to this problem within the\nframework of international law and in compliance with\nSecurity Council resolutions. In this respect, we stress the\nneed to preserve the sovereignty of Iraq, its security and\nits territorial integrity.\nSolving the many problems affecting Africa requires\nthat the international community seriously tackle the\neconomic and social conditions and the various conflicts\nthat beset most African countries, conditions that have\nhad a negative effect on the hopes of African peoples, as\nwell as on their legitimate right to achieve comprehensive\ndevelopment and to live under stable and safe conditions.\nBeing deeply committed to our ties of brotherhood\nand solidarity with all African countries, Morocco has\nconsistently placed African issues at the forefront of its\nconcerns. As a token of its unwavering solidarity with\nAfrican countries, Morocco devotes 95 per cent of its\nannual international assistance appropriations to African\ncountries.\nMorocco has followed with keen interest the\ninternational endeavours aimed at restoring peace in\nKosovo and at putting an end to the bloody conflict and\nethnic-cleansing campaigns that have claimed the lives of\nthousands of innocents Kosovars, in blatant violation of\ninternational law and of the most fundamental principles\nof human rights. Given its keen desire to strengthen peace\nin the region, Morocco has expressed its readiness to\n27\n\n\nparticipate in KFOR and has made all possible humanitarian\nefforts to provide material assistance to Kosovar refugees.\nTo this end, it also set up, at the initiative of Her Royal\nHighness Princess Lalla Meryem, a fund to collect\ndonations for Kosovar children.\nBecause of its geographical location, its historical ties\nand its economic and cultural relations with Mediterranean\ncountries, Morocco believes that the consolidation of\nsecurity and stability and the promotion of cooperation in\nthe region are an absolute necessity. Thus Morocco took\npart in the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, from the\nBarcelona conference to the Stuttgart conference, which\nprovided an opportunity to assess the Barcelona process\nthree years after its inception. During the Stuttgart\nconference Morocco voiced its conviction that for security\nand stability to prevail in the Mediterranean basin there has\nto be an effective partnership between the countries of the\nregion that takes into consideration the political, economic,\nsocial and cultural dimensions.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco has always taken a great\ninterest in the question of disarmament, because it is linked\nboth to international peace and security and to economic\nand social development. In this respect, we reiterate the\nneed to ensure that all the countries of the Middle East\nregion join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and submit their facilities to the safeguards\nsystem of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This\naction, along with making the Middle East region a nuclear-\nweapons-free zone, would be a decisive contribution to\nrestoring confidence and peace in that region.\nAs regards the question of the referendum in our\nsouthern desert provinces, Morocco reiterates its full\nsupport for the efforts of the United Nations, especially\nthose of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, aimed at\ncompleting the process as soon as possible and under\nconditions most conducive to transparency, justice and\nsuccess. As a contribution towards that objective, Morocco\nhas endeavoured, from the start of the process, to inform\nthe United Nations of any deviations that might affect the\nlegitimate rights of the potential participants in the\nreferendum. Thus, following the publication of the first part\nof the preliminary lists of the Sahraouis that have been\nidentified, Morocco expressed concern over practices that\nhave affected the identification process and have led to the\nelimination of thousands of names of people of Sahraoui\norigin, despite the fact that they had met the agreed criteria\nand conditions.\nIt is our dearest hope that the United Nations will\ncome up with equitable solutions that take into\nconsideration our concerns and those of thousands of\nSahraoui candidates who, had they not been compelled to\nleave the region because of the fight they were waging\nagainst colonialism, would have been covered by the\ncensus and therefore been accepted directly by the\nIdentification Commission.\nThe phenomenon of economic globalization has been\nswiftly developing and expanding. It has led to a\nliberalization of markets, swifter exchange relations,\nenhanced global productivity and greater financial flows.\nThe economic changes affecting the international arena\ncall for a comprehensive review of the rules of\ninternational economic interactions in order to adapt them\nto those changes and to the development needs of all of\nhumanity. This aspect was at the forefront of the concerns\nof His Majesty King Mohammed VI in the address he\ndelivered, when he was Crown Prince, on the occasion of\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the multilateral trading system,\ncelebrated in Geneva in 1998. His Majesty pointed out\nthat\n\u201cthe comprehensive project advocated by the\nfounders of our system remains fragile because of\nthe fate of hundreds of millions of people who will\nnot accept indefinite marginalization while\ntremendous progress and prosperity are being\nenjoyed by the advanced countries of the world.\u201d\nIn future negotiations, and within the framework of\nthe World Trade Organization, Morocco is of the view\nthat the adoption of a global and balanced approach\nreflecting the legitimate interests of all countries, while\ntaking into account the developmental dimension of\nadvanced countries, should be the best means to achieve\na just and balanced international trade system. Morocco\nbelieves that effective solutions to the debt problem\nshould not be restricted to partial alleviation of the debt\nburden of some countries only, but should, rather, take\nthe form of a comprehensive policy to stimulate the\neconomic activity of debt-ridden developing countries\nthrough promoting their exports and encouraging direct\nforeign investments in them.\nFollowing the ninth ministerial meeting of the Group\nof 77 and China \u2014 which I had the honour of chairing\nand which was held in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 13 to\n16 September 1999, in preparation for the tenth session of\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\n28\n\n\nDevelopment \u2014 the Group of 77 and China adopted the\nMarrakesh Declaration, which pointed out that\n\u201cthe disparities in the scope and impact of\nglobalization have led to economic disharmony, both\nat the international and national levels. This translates\ninto new challenges to our development ambitions.\nMany developing countries are facing difficulties in\ntheir attempts to effectively integrate with the world\neconomy and are suffering the consequences of\nglobalization.\u201d\nIn conclusion, we believe that, as we stand on the\nthreshold of the new millennium, the international\ncommunity should exert greater efforts to create a political,\neconomic and social environment conducive to further\ncooperation and rapprochement among peoples, so that all\nof mankind can enjoy the fruits of peace and live in\nprosperity and tranquility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It\ngives me pleasure, Sir, to extend to you on behalf of the\nState of Kuwait our warm congratulations on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nfourth session. Given your extensive experience in\ninternational affairs and your personal skills and ability,\nwe are confident that you will be able to guide the\ndeliberations of the Assembly effectively. Let me assure\nYour Excellency that our delegation will cooperate with\nyou in a diligent and constructive spirit in order to reach\nour common goals.\n16\n\n\nI wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti, who demonstrated good\nstewardship in his efforts to enhance the role of the\nAssembly.\nLet me take this opportunity to express once again our\ndeep gratitude to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless endeavours to reform the\nstructure and streamline the functioning of the Organization\nwith a view to bringing it more in line with the ever-\nchanging realities of modern times.\nKuwait welcomes the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to\nmembership in the United Nations. Our wish is that these\nnew Member States will enhance the role and effectiveness\nof our Organization in the fulfilment of the objectives and\npurposes of the Charter.\nThe wheel of time is now bringing us closer to the end\nof the twentieth century and entry into the third millennium.\nAgainst the backdrop of this truly historic benchmark, we\nthink that the world community should renew its resolve to\nachieve higher standards of living and political stability and\nsecurity, all of which are essential factors for progress.\nWith a deeper and greater sense of resolve, humankind's\nfuture can be better than our present.\nTragically, the twentieth century has seen two bitter\nworld wars, in addition to numerous bilateral, regional and\ncivil conflicts that claimed the lives of millions and millions\nof innocent human beings. Those innumerable wars put too\nmany spikes in the wheels of growth and progress of many\ndeveloping nations.\nOur cherished hopes and aspirations were always\ndirected towards fulfilling the long-standing human dream\nof using the immense scientific and technological\ndiscoveries and know-how acquired especially in the past\nfew decades of the twentieth century to address or solve the\nmajor and pressing global problems and phenomena facing\nthe human race. However, about one fifth of the human\nrace suffers from hunger; hundreds of millions of people\nlive below the poverty line; the arms race, for reasons of\nsecurity or territorial expansion, consumes enormous\nproportions of national budgets or assets to the detriment of\neconomic and development programmes; massacres driven\nby ethnic or political motives have become excuses for\nliquidating opposition forces and consolidating political\ndictatorships; human rights violations persist under different\njustifications; and the phenomenon of terrorism, which is\nbecoming increasingly intertwined with drug abuse and\nillicit trafficking in drugs, imperils the stability of\nsocieties and States, with the potential risks of\njeopardizing security and stability far beyond national\nborders. In our view, the international community must\ncope with these devastating dangers in a more serious\nfashion in order to rid the world of their evil.\nAlso, the millennium has seen many devastating\nnatural disasters that resulted in vast human losses and\nextensive property damage. The most recent tragic\nexample is the earthquake that struck the friendly Turkish\nRepublic in August. We are confident that Turkey will\neventually overcome the dire consequences of that\nnational catastrophe. Along with many other countries and\ninternational relief and aid organizations, Kuwait hastily\nresponded by airlifting basic human relief assistance and\nsupplies. Our response emanated from humanitarian\nmotives and our sense of good neighbourliness. In this\nregard, I wish to recall the decision by the States of the\nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to donate $400 million\nto alleviate the impact of that severe quake.\nIn the same vein, we wish to extend our warm\ncondolences and sympathy to the friendly Government\nand people of Greece and to the families of victims of the\ntremor that hit there earlier this month. In order to draw\nsome lessons from the recurrence of such disasters,\nKuwait calls for expanding and reinforcing the role and\neffectiveness of the United Nations disaster relief organs.\nSuch a role would help coordinate the contributions of the\nvarious States in order to fulfil their desired and optimal\ngoals, to the best of their capabilities.\nMy delegation now strongly feels that the\ninternational community should not underestimate the role\nand achievements of the United Nations system. Its\noutstanding track record over the past five decades\nshould, in our view, deepen our appreciation for the\nvaluable and credible manner in which the United Nations\nsystem addressed and resolved many conflicts and\nproblems across the globe. Indeed, the Untied Nations\nsaved mankind many potential tragedies. Hence, one\ncannot really imagine our contemporary world without\nthis Organization, to which Kuwait is honoured to belong.\nAgainst the backdrop of the legacy inherited by the\npresent generation and the possible challenges that will\nface us in the future, preparations are under way to\nconvene the Millennium Assembly session here in New\nYork in September next year. Given its historical context\nand the level of global participation, we hope that the\nsession will prove to be a true benchmark in the history\n17\n\n\nof humanity. Kuwait feels that such an historic occasion\nrequires proper and adequate preparation to ensure a truly\nmeaningful outcome in terms of sketching the future path\nof the Organization in the new century.\nThe issues on the global agenda are all serious and\npressing, and some new vision is needed to deal with them.\nIn any case, we are convinced that international cooperation\nand coordination and consolidation of human efforts will\nremain crucial to any viable endeavours to address those\nobstinate and interlinked problems within the framework of\nthe United Nations. Therefore, continued support to ensure\nreinvigoration of the United Nations remains in order.\nAs we look forward to the millennial summit as an\nunprecedented event, we think that the forthcoming historic\noccasion should not be a replay of the United Nations\nfiftieth anniversary celebrations, which were a largely\nceremonial and symbolic event. The gathering of world\nleaders should go beyond the usual ritual of delivering\nspeeches and photo sessions. Rather, our objective should\nbe charting out a meaningful path for the future in a\npragmatic, action-oriented fashion. The new vision should\nfocus on business-like treatment of universal issues such as\njustice for all, equality, harmonious co-existence,\ncooperation, inter-cultural dialogues and promotion of\nrespect for human rights, and advancing economic and\nsocial development to the top of our global agenda.\nAt this juncture, allow me to highlight the fact that the\nState of Kuwait has been ranked number one in the Arab\nworld and number thirty-five in the world in the United\nNations Development Programme(UNDP) Human\nDevelopment Report of 1999. Kuwait will, God willing,\ncontinue its steady efforts towards the improvement of the\neconomic and social conditions across the country, guided\nby, among other factors, the Human Development indices.\nIn the same vein, I wish to recall the recent initiative by\nHis Highness the Amir of the State of Kuwait, who\nproclaimed a decree granting the women of Kuwait full\npolitical rights to participate in parliamentary elections and\nto run as candidates for the national assembly. This\ninitiative is yet another example of the keen interest on the\npart of His Highness the Amir to consolidate the\ndemocratic system in Kuwaiti society and to expand public\nparticipation in civil life. Indeed, it is a testimony to and\nrecognition of the prominent role and the valuable\ncontributions by Kuwaiti women to our society.\nAnother important goal we hope the Millennium\nAssembly will achieve is the expansion of the membership\nof the Security Council and the display of more\ntransparency in the Council's procedures and methods of\nwork. The question of reform of the Security Council has\nbeen exhaustively discussed over the past six years. Time\nhas indeed come for proper action with a view to\nallowing all United Nations Member States to participate\nin the decision-making process in a more representative\nand equitable manner, under controls that would ensure a\nbalance between effectiveness and larger membership.\nThe reform should also ensure the special responsibility\nand ability of the Council members to maintain\ninternational peace and security.\nFollowing the end of the cold war, the world has\nwitnessed many challenges that threatened international\npeace and security in various regions. As a result of the\ngeneral ease in international relations and the growing\nrapprochement between East and West and the mounting\ndesire for global cooperation and coordination, the Untied\nNations system, through the Security Council, the primary\norgan responsible for the maintenance of international\npeace and security, sought to address and manage those\ncrises according to the ways and means that were set\nforth in the Charter. Yes, the United Nations has achieved\nsubstantial progress, though in varying degrees, and\nsometimes at a very heavy price in terms of losing\ndedicated personnel and peacekeepers on behalf of the\ncause of peace and in the service of humanity. Even when\nthe United Nations might appear to be faltering in\nperforming its mission, sometimes perhaps in a rather\nembarrassing way, the theoretical question that always\narises in our minds is: would that situation have been\nbetter had the United Nations not intervened? And the\nresultant answer that we arrive at is invariably: absolutely\nnot. Lapses, setbacks and failures are all, unfortunately,\nan inevitable tax that has to be paid in our pursuit of\nexcellence and progress, good intentions notwithstanding.\nThe sanctions system, under Article 41, Chapter VII,\nof the Charter, is one of the tools and methods that the\nSecurity Council found itself impelled to resort to in\ndealing with a number of States. The objective was to\nmake them change their behaviour and dissuade them\nfrom the pursuit of policies of aggression, which run\ncounter to the fundamental norms and principles of\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations.\nExperience on the ground has proved this method to be\neffective. On two occasions the Council suspended the\nsanctions imposed against some States once they had\ncomplied fully with their obligations under the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. This proves in no uncertain\nterms that the sanctions were not an end in themselves,\n18\n\n\nbut a means used to impose respect for the Charter and the\nSecurity Council resolutions.\nActing within the terms of its responsibilities, the\nSecurity Council established at the end of last January three\nseparate panels to evaluate the extent of Iraq's compliance\nwith its obligations under Security Council resolutions\nrelating to Iraq's invasion of the State of Kuwait. The\nSecretary-General himself participated in the selection of\nthe members of those panels, eminent, internationally\nknown persons who were efficient and neutral experts. The\npanels met for a period of two months. They also sought\nthe expert advice of many specialists and heard the views\nand presentations of many witnesses. Following extensive\nmeetings and intense deliberations, the panellists reached a\nset of conclusions and recommendations that I shall briefly\nsummarize as follows.\nFirst, the panel concerned with disarmament concluded\nthat there were still a number of important and serious\nmatters that had not yet been resolved. It emphasized the\nneed for the return of the inspection teams to Iraq as soon\nas possible under an integrated and reinforced monitoring\nand verification system based on relevant Security Council\nresolutions.\nSecondly, with regard to the humanitarian situation the\npanel submitted several constructive proposals and\nrecommendations which, if implemented, would improve\nthe humanitarian conditions in Iraq. Perhaps the most\nimportant recommendation was the call to improve the\noperational mechanisms of the oil-for-food programme.\nAlso, the panel invited the Government of Iraq to ensure\nequitable distribution of humanitarian goods and to pay due\nattention to meeting the needs of the vulnerable groups of\nthe Iraqi population.\nThirdly, the panel concerned with Kuwaiti and third-\ncountry prisoners of war and the return of stolen property\nto Kuwait, the panel thought that in regard to the prisoners\nof war issue, cooperation by Iraq with the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Tripartite\nCommission had so far been below expectations. The panel\nwas not satisfied with the Iraqi explanations of why Iraq\nhad failed to provide information on the files submitted to\nit by the ICRC. The panel urged the Government of Iraq to\nreconsider its decision not to participate in the Tripartite\nCommission and its technical subcommittee. With regard to\nthe return of Kuwaiti property, the panel concluded that\nIraq had not fully complied with paragraph 2 of Security\nCouncil resolution 686 (1991), which demands that Iraq\nreturn all stolen property to Kuwait.\nAlthough those panels were established by the\nSecurity Council mainly to explore the possibility of\nmitigating the impact of the sanctions regime and\nimproving the humanitarian conditions in Iraq, it is deeply\nregrettable that Iraq itself has declined to participate in\ntheir work. Iraq has also rejected the conclusions and\nrecommendations reached by these panels. In this context,\nthe Secretary-General, in paragraph 81 of his report\n(A/54/1) on the work of the Organization submitted to the\ncurrent session of the Assembly, referred to Iraq's failure\nto fulfil its obligations and set the humanitarian\nrequirements that Iraq must meet. The Secretary-General\nstates:\n\u201cRelations with Iraq took a turn for the worse during\nthe year, despite a brief period of compliance with\nthe Memorandum of Understanding signed by\nDeputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and myself in\nFebruary 1998. In the face of continuing Iraqi non-\ncompliance, the use of force by two Member States\nand the division in the Security Council that\nfollowed it was predictable. Our principal demands\nremain unchanged, however: Iraq must fully comply\nwith all relevant Security Council resolutions; the\ninternational community must be assured that Iraq\nno longer has the capacity to develop or use\nweapons of mass destruction; missing Kuwaiti and\nthird country nationals must be accounted for; and\nKuwait's irreplaceable archives must be returned.\nMeanwhile, the people of Iraq continue to suffer the\neffects of sanctions\u201d.\nFor purely humanitarian reasons enjoined by our\nIslamic religion and by all other religious as well as\ninternational principles and norms, the State of Kuwait\nurges Iraq to put an immediate end to the plight of\nKuwaiti and third-country prisoners, returning them to\ntheir families or fully accounting for them. Iraqi\ninsistence that there are no such prisoners inside Iraq and\nthat these people should be considered as missing persons\nis not an answer. What is at stake are the lives of people,\nwho should be treated as trusts in our collective\nconscience. Since last January, Iraq has been boycotting\nthe meetings of the Tripartite Commission and its\ntechnical subcommittee, bodies that operate under the\naegis of the ICRC with the objective of locating and\nidentifying those innocent victims.\nThe following questions arise here. Is Iraq indeed\nserious in dealing with this important humanitarian\nmatter? Does Iraq's attitude show any good faith? Would\nanyone safely claim that Iraq is working on implementing\n19\n\n\nrelevant Security Council resolutions while boycotting the\nmeetings of ICRC-sponsored humanitarian bodies?\nOnly internationally established institutions can handle\nthis issue. We believe that earnest and sincere cooperation\nwith the Tripartite Commission is the key to the resolution\nof this humanitarian problem, which really does not tolerate\nany further delay.\nAn intensive effort is currently under way within the\nSecurity Council to pass a new resolution related to the\nremaining obligations on Iraq, taking into consideration the\nrecommendations made by the three aforementioned\nevaluation panels. While Kuwait concurs with the good\nintentions underlying the current efforts by members of the\nSecurity Council, which take the form of a draft resolution\nput forward by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands,\ntogether with some other related views, we would like to\nreaffirm the important need to maintain the unity of the\nSecurity Council in dealing with this issue. Also, we\ndemand assurances that Iraq will remain committed to all\nthe requirements of Security Council resolution 687 (1991),\nwhich should be treated as one indivisible political and\nlegal unit.\nIn the meantime, Kuwait reiterates its full sympathy\nwith the suffering of our brotherly people of Iraq. The\nGovernment of Iraq alone bears full responsibility for the\nperpetuation of those hardships. Kuwait, for its part,\nconfirms its support for and endorsement of all Security\nCouncil resolutions aimed at easing those travails through\nthe oil-for-food programme. Furthermore, we wish to\nreiterate our firm commitment to the need for the\npreservation of the independence, sovereignty, unity and\nterritorial integrity of Iraq.\nOut of concern for and interest in bolstering the\nunderpinnings of security and stability in our region, the\nState of Kuwait confirms its support for all efforts aimed at\nresolving the dispute between the United Arab Emirates and\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran over the Emirates' three islands\nby peaceful means. These would include the referral of the\nmatter to the International Court of Justice. In the\nmeantime, Kuwait welcomes the willingness of the friendly\nIslamic Republic of Iran to start direct negotiations with the\nUnited Arab Emirates. We hope the tripartite ministerial\ncommission formed by the Cooperation Council of the Gulf\nArab States will be able to initiate working mechanisms for\nbeginning direct negotiations that could lead to the peaceful\nresolution of the dispute over the three Emirates' islands:\nthe Lesser and Greater Tunbs and Abu Musa. This avenue\nwould indeed contribute to confidence building and to the\npromotion of security and stability throughout the region.\nIt would also expand and deepen cooperation between the\nIslamic Republic of Iran and all States in the region.\nKuwait welcomes the Sharm El-Sheikh\nMemorandum recently signed between the Palestinian\nAuthority and Israel, which sets forth specific steps for\nthe implementation of the Wye River accords. However,\nwe demand that the new Administration in Israel do its\npart on reviving the peace process and resuming\nnegotiations on all tracks. Israel must demonstrate honest\ncommitment to the principles and operational framework\nof the overall peace process, which is anchored in\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)\nand the land-for-peace formula. This includes fulfilment\nof all obligations and agreements signed with the\nPalestinian Authority within the peace process, with a\nview to reinstating all legitimate Arab rights, including\nthe restoration to the brotherly Palestinian people of their\nfull national rights, especially the establishment of their\nindependent State on their national territory, with\nJerusalem as its capital. The Government of Israel must\nalso cease forthwith its illegitimate settlement-building\nand land-confiscation policy. It should also end its\nunilateral measures to create de facto realities on the\nground, especially in the city of Jerusalem. Furthermore,\nPalestinian refugees must be reassured of their right to\nreturn to their homes in accordance with relevant United\nNations resolutions.\nWe are baffled by, and accordingly reject, the\nreferences, declarations and insinuations recently made\nthat promote the notion of resettling the Palestinian\nrefugees outside their own ancestral homeland. Such a\nnotion represents a stark violation of the fundamental\nprinciples of international law, United Nations resolutions\nand the inalienable right to self-determination.\nFurthermore, a resettlement plan would be an\ninfringement on the sovereignty of other States and an\ninterference in their domestic affairs.\nIsrael's withdrawal from the occupied Syrian territory\nin the Golan Heights back to the 4 June 1967 lines is\nindeed the litmus test of Israel's genuine commitment to\nthe land-for-peace principle. Moreover, we demand that\nIsrael end once and for all its repeated acts of aggression\nagainst the sovereignty and independence of our sister\nState, the Lebanese Republic. We stress the need for an\nimmediate Israeli pull-out from southern Lebanon and\nWest Bekaa in accordance with Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978), which must be implemented\nwithout any restrictions or conditions. In this context,\n20\n\n\nKuwait emphatically notes that the Syrian and Lebanese\ntracks must be recognized as organically interconnected if\na just and lasting peace is to be established.\nIn addition, while Kuwait endorses and appreciates the\nefforts of the two sponsors of the peace process, together\nwith the European Union, to revitalize that process, we call\nupon all of them to redouble their efforts at this critical\nstage of the peace process.\nAt the regional level, and given the long-standing\nhistorical and human bonds, as well as the close economic\ninterests fashioned by the geographic location of the\nArabian Gulf region and its proximity to India and\nPakistan, with which the State of Kuwait maintains friendly\nrelations, we appeal to both countries to resolve their\nbilateral dispute over Jammu and Kashmir by peaceful\nmeans and in accordance with United Nations resolutions.\nWe sincerely hope that India and Pakistan will engage in a\nmeaningful dialogue and draw on the deep and rich\nreservoir of wisdom available to the leaderships on both\nsides of the divide. We think that their economic resources\nwould better be utilized for the development and welfare of\ntheir peoples and for enhancing security and stability in that\nsensitive region. Mutual confidence and cooperation should\nprevail over intense rivalry in the arena of terror.\nKuwait welcomes the outcome of the popular\nconsultation held under United Nations supervision in East\nTimor late last month. The ballot gave the East Timorese\nthe chance to determine their future freely, with the\nguarantee and cooperation of the friendly Government of\nIndonesia. Kuwait has followed with sadness and pain the\nbloody events that have taken place in East Timor.\nHowever, we welcome the Security Council resolution to\nestablish a multinational force to put an end to violence and\nto restore security and public order to that Territory. We\nwish that force full success in its mission. We also call\nupon neighbouring countries to respect the mandate of the\nforce and to help the people of East Timor fulfil their\nlegitimate aspirations. In this regard, Kuwait wishes to give\ncredit to the friendly Government of Indonesia for its\ncommitment and efforts at putting an end to the violence,\nthe killing and destruction that ravaged East Timor in the\nwake of the referendum. Credit is also due Indonesia for\nagreeing to the formation and peaceful reception of the\nmultinational force.\nStill on the international scene, Kuwait welcomes the\npeace accord reached between the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on\nKosovo as a first step towards the resolution of the dispute\nand the return of displaced persons to their homes in\nKosovo. This will eventually put an end to the conflict\nand restore peace and security to the people, who have\nthe right to live in freedom and dignity.\nThe Balkan crisis, which was precipitated by the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, has demonstrated once\nagain that the United Nations role is indispensable to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and for\nlending legitimacy and credibility to any solutions\nreached, be it in a regional context or an international\none. Kuwait supports and encourages the United Nations\nto continue its role until all aspects of the crisis have\ndefinitively resolved.\nThe world today is living through a communications\nrevolution that has helped to shorten distances between\nStates and to speed up global connections, thus turning\nour planet into a village where people instantly react to\nevents that take place anywhere across the globe.\nInternational economic integration has become part and\nparcel of development plans and programmes that aim at\nachieving progress and prosperity for nations. Unilateral\nisolationist policies have become relics of the past and\nuntenable under a new world order that is becoming\nincreasingly and rapidly universal.\nThe new order, known as \u201cglobalization\u201d, requires\njoint efforts in order to lay down the principles,\nregulations and arrangements that seek to ensure progress\nand well-being by creating new prospects for the flow of\nfinancial and technical aid to help national States project\ntheir ability to contribute to the building of a better future\nfor humanity. Hence, developed countries are expected to\nincrease their economic and technical assistance to\ndeveloping States and to expand the exchange of\ninformation and technical know-how in an attempt to\nnarrow the ever-widening gap in the fields of technology\nand communications.\nMoreover, international efforts must be invigorated\nin the face of a new emerging challenge posed by the\ndwindling sources of fresh water. Water reserves should\nbe utilized on a just basis and with a sense of sharing in\nthe use of this main artery of life itself. Bearing that\nvision in mind, Kuwait is pursuing its efforts to support\ndevelopment projects in many developing countries. The\nKuwait Fund for Economic Development offers long-term\nfinancial loans at concessional interest rates. Also, my\ncountry contributes, within its means, to many\ndevelopment projects and programmes that are jointly\nfinanced by international financial institutions, regional\n21\n\n\norganizations and the United Nations agencies. Kuwait\nintends to pursue this path out of its conviction that\ndevelopment is the key to progress and a main incentive for\nbuilding security and stability. Furthermore, reaching out\nwith assistance to those in need is a moral obligation on\nthose who are more privileged. This would indeed\nstrengthen international cooperation, openness and mutual\nrespect among nations.\nNow, as our world is about to bid farewell to the\ncurrent century, good-hearted and decent people nurture\nvarious hopes and ambitions for serving humanity and\nbuilding a better life on this small planet. We all hope to\ncreate and conserve a safe and healthy environment, free of\nthreats to the security of all life. As we look down the road\nto the future, we can hopefully see a fulfilment of the\ndivine prophecy of justice for humanity when we heed\nGod's words, calling on us to feed the hungry and to ensure\npeace of mind and security for all human beings. We wish\nworld leaders who will be assembled in this Hall in\nSeptember next year success in defining a road map for the\nfuture, in setting a new vision and in renewing our common\nresolve to establish peace, justice and development for all\npeoples of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the\noutset to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia, on his election as\nPresident of the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly. His talent, skills and experience in international\naffairs guarantee the wise conduct and direction of this\nsession.\nOur gratitude goes to the outgoing President, His\nExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti.\nSince the beginning of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly, my country, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nhas achieved remarkable progress in implementation of\nthe Dayton/Paris Peace Accords \u2014 progress, I might even\ndare to say, that is encouraging. The progress is visible in\nthe further strengthening of peace, improvements in\nefficiency and the stabilization not only of common\ninstitutions but also of the institutions of both Entities as\nwell as of local government bodies. This progress is also\nevident in the further promotion and affirmation of\ndemocratic values, human rights and freedoms and even\nin the return of displaced persons and refugees.\nThis progress has also been noted in numerous\nreports by authoritative international representatives and\ninstitutions from the Council of Europe, the European\nUnion, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE), the High Representative and participants\nin the Stability Pact Summit. All of them confirmed that\nwe have been moving in the right direction.\nI do not want to suggest that the progress that has\nbeen made is spectacular and that we in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, or the international players involved in my\ncountry, are filled with great joy. Nonetheless, despite all\nthe criticism and all of the shortcomings, progress is\nobvious, and that is a fact worthy of our attention, if for\nno other reason than that it is proof that Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is starting slowly and surely to move away\nfrom political, humanitarian, economic and almost every\nother form of stagnation. It is also proof that Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is moving away from the state of deep\ninternal mistrust, doubt and reservation which has for a\nlong time existed between the two Entities and different\nconstitutive people, and between their political leaders and\nrepresentatives in common institutions. It is also a\nreflection of the state of mind and general mood among\nthe citizens. I believe that it would not be too optimistic\nto claim that those positive results and developments are\nevidence of a higher potential and the growing will to\nfind a way out of the difficult and depressing state in\nwhich Bosnia and Herzegovina was a prisoner for almost\na whole decade.\nOf course, there are still many issues which we need\nto work on regarding the Peace Agreement\nimplementation and the implementation of the conclusions\nof the Peace Implementation Council contained in the\nBonn and Madrid documents, although it also cannot be\ndisputed that, unfortunately, we have reached unbalanced\nresults in the two Entities.\n36\n\n\nHowever, this year the common institutions of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina have been working with greater\neffectiveness, intensity and coordination. Furthermore,\n272,000 displaced persons and 343,000 refugees have\nreturned to both Entities. However, the return remains one\nof the most difficult and painful humanitarian, economic\nand political issues, especially the so-called minority return.\nOn different levels, the minority return is still being slowed\ndown, manipulated, blocked and politically exploited.\nHowever, we are not accepting the situation. Minority\nreturn is not coming off our agenda; rather, it is\nincreasingly becoming an indicator of success,\ndemonstrating the capabilities and responsibilities of many\npolitical leaders from the local to the State level. The public\nat large \u2014 the voters \u2014 are monitoring and assessing this\nprocess daily. The return of refugees under conditions set\nby us is the barometer of reconciliation, respect for human\nrights and stability in general.\nReform of the judicial system has also been initiated,\nand it is aimed at the complete professionalization,\nmodernization and independence of judges and prosecutors,\nin accordance with the norms and standards of the\ndemocratic societies of contemporary Europe and the world.\nThe reconstruction of the Ministry of the Interior is also\nunder way, as well as the modernization, professional\ntraining and education of local police. The recruitment of\npolicemen and policewomen reflects the demographic\npicture of the population. Finally, there has also been\nprogress in cooperation with the International Criminal\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia, although such\ncooperation is still not complete in the region as a whole.\nStarting with the current school year, children in the\nschools of Bosnia and Herzegovina are attending classes in\naccordance with new programmes which reflect the present\ntime and look to our common future. The school\nprogrammes exclude contents which, according to the\ncommon multinational commissions and international\nrepresentatives, could represent a threat and a danger to the\nfragile confidence and understanding of the young\ngenerations.\nSignificant results have been achieved through a\nprogramme of economic and infrastructural reconstruction.\nBut the restoration of industrial capacity has brought it up\nto only one third of its pre-war level. We still have a high\nnumber of unemployed and socially dependent categories.\nThat is why Bosnia and Herzegovina will need international\nassistance for a longer period of time. However, that would\nbe an investment not only in our future but in the future of\neveryone.\nActivities are under way in regulating the sensitive\nbut vital field of public information in both Entities. A set\nof regulations on the organization and functioning of\nbroadcasting is in the process of being drawn up.\nSignificant measures have been undertaken in the sphere\nof economic reform. In addition, the customs law has\nentered into force, the reform of the banking system and\nfinancial transactions has been launched and the first\nresults have been achieved in the privatization of small\nenterprises. Preparations for the privatization of larger\npublic enterprises and industrial conglomerates, which\nwere an inheritance from the socialist period, are under\nway.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is speeding up its activities\nin these and many other areas as a reflection of its strong\norientation towards the building of democracy and civil\nsociety, an open market economy and the enlargement of\nhuman rights and, by doing so, it is meeting the\nconditions for admission to the Council of Europe and\ngetting closer to the European Union and trans-Atlantic\ninstitutions. Bosnia and Herzegovina has increased its\ncooperation with the European Union and North Atlantic\ngroupings, at the same time benefiting from the various\nforms of support and assistance that those institutions\nhave provided to us. In that regard, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina was particularly encouraged by the adoption\nlast year of the European Union Declaration on special\nrelations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Consultative\nTask Force established pursuant to that document has\nintensified its work in assisting us to overcome a number\nof technical, legal and organizational problems in the\nrelationship between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the\nEuropean Union. This has strengthened the functioning of\nState and Entity institutions and is enabling us to\ncooperate more successfully with the European Union.\nFor these and many other results which cannot be\nmentioned because of the time limitations, we have to\nthank the international community, which gave direct and\nindirect assistance, and we are especially grateful to the\nHigh Representative, who used his right to impose\nsolutions when we in Bosnia and Herzegovina were\nunable to reach agreement through the normal democratic\nprocess. All of those efforts should warn us that the\npresence of the international community and its role in\nBosnia and Herzegovina is still indispensable; it remains\na guarantor that life in Bosnia and Herzegovina will move\ntowards normalization. I believe that one of the most\nconvincing pieces of evidence of the progress which we\nare witnessing in Bosnia and Herzegovina was its\norganization and hosting of the Summit of the Stability\n37\n\n\nPact for South-Eastern Europe, which took place on 29 and\n30 July this year in Sarajevo. As the Assembly may recall,\nSarajevo has hosted leaders of the States members of\nEuropean Union, the Russian Federation, Canada, the\nUnited States of America, Japan, the Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries, the most important multilateral\ninstitutions, such as this one, and, of course, the countries\nof South-Eastern Europe \u2014 the very members of the\nStability Pact.\nAt that historic event, the common institutions of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the bodies and organizations from\nboth Entities and many individual actors of all nationalities,\nconfirmed not only their abilities and their capabilities, but\nalso their belief in and readiness to make joint endeavours\nin their respective and common interests. I am deeply\nconvinced that the numerous offers of congratulations and\nrecognition which were forwarded to us on that occasion\nfrom the many prominent European and world heads of\nState gathered in Sarajevo were more than a simple\nexpression of diplomatic courtesy.\nAs a unique contribution to the objectives of the\nStability Pact, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia have\nsigned the border agreement, thereby removing this\nsensitive issue from our respective agendas. We are\nconvinced that the Stability Pact and the declaration\nadopted in Sarajevo have opened new perspectives to\nBosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to all the other\ncountries in the region. This has given birth to a stable and\ndefinite solution to a series of catastrophic events of\nBiblical proportions and the fast recovery of peoples and\ncountries that have paid an extremely high price for\nignorance, for political and military adventurism and for\nflagrant violations of the norms of international relations\nand international humanitarian law.\nThe guarantees of the success of the goals of the\nStability Pact \u2014 peace, prosperity and security for our part\nof the world \u2014 indeed depend upon the determination and\npreparedness of the European Union, the OSCE, the\nCouncil of Europe, the United Nations and the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as other\ninternational organizations, institutions and regional\ninitiatives. The guarantee of their accomplishment also\ndepends upon the fact that the European Union and the\nUnited States of America have made the Stability Pact a\npriority in their new trans-Atlantic programme, and the\nEuropean Union and the Russian Federation have made the\nPact the priority in their political dialogue.\nBearing all of this in mind, we in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina are determined to embrace the Stability Pact\nin its entirety, to build on it and to accomplish our\nobjectives through concrete contributions to its success,\nthrough our own initiatives and creative activities and\nthrough the development of regional cooperation within\nthe framework of multilateral and bilateral agreements.\nIn that context, I wish from this podium once again\nnot only to reaffirm the indispensable role of the\nOrganization in the implementation of the Dayton/Paris\nAgreement and the Stability Pact, but also to reiterate my\ngratitude for all the efforts, contributions and many\nsacrifices made for Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have\nwitnessed in this past decade the capabilities and\nefficiencies of international organizations, and especially\nof the United Nations. At the same time, unfortunately,\nwe have noticed some weaknesses and imperfections that\nendanger the role of the Organization as a vital and\nirreplaceable Organization for the twenty-first century.\nI believe that none of us has any doubts that the\nUnited Nations is ready and able to pursue its noble\nmission to continue to strengthen and develop its purpose\nand ideals in the coming century. Even if the United\nNations has not achieved all of its goals, it was able to\nsafeguard global peace, initiate and make possible\nsustainable development, appease many injustices\nworldwide and, on top of all that, to come to very clear\nvisions about its own reforms.\nThe United Nations started reforming itself several\nyears ago but has not yet finished this task. This path\nshould indeed be vigorously pursued. I am of the view\nthat if the United Nations had the courage to change the\nworld, it can and must find the determination to change\nitself more quickly and to adapt itself to face the\nchallenges of the next century. The millennium summit\ncould be envisaged as a great opportunity for heads of\nState and Government of Member States meeting in the\nyear 2000 to verify and adopt a large part of these\nreforms.\nBosnia and Herzegovina has thus far been to a\ngreater or lesser extent an object of consideration within\nmany international organizations and forums. The time\nand the context that dictated such a position are\nfortunately coming to an end. We are now becoming\naware of the necessity of\n38\n\n\ntaking a more active, creative and responsible role in\ninternational relations. That is why we observe with a more\ncritical eye the duties that we have taken on as a full\nmember of the family of nations, but that we have not yet\ncarried out or accomplished fully. Such an orientation is\nmore a result of the fact that we feel more self-confident\nand are more and more trustful towards our friends and\npartners in the United Nations and other international\norganizations, forums and initiatives. An expression of this\nis the decision taken by Bosnia and Herzegovina to reduce\nits military expenses by 15 per cent in the hope of giving\nan example to other nations.\nAllow me to conclude this statement by quoting a\nbrilliant diplomat who once said, \u201cPeople and States act\nwisely only after they have exhausted all other\nalternatives.\u201d"

        "file_text": "I wish to extend to you, Sir,\nmy sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly and to assure\nyou of the full support and cooperation of the delegation\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran in the discharge of your\nresponsibilities. I should also like to thank your\npredecessor for his tireless efforts during his tenure.\nMay I also express the profound gratitude of my\nGovernment to our Secretary-General, who, with\nunsurpassed wisdom and sagacity, has played an immense\nrole in advancing the objectives of the United Nations.\nThe twentieth century we are leaving behind has\nbeen one of invaluable experiences, both positive and\nnegative. On the positive side, the rejection of force as an\ninstrument of policy has emerged as a fundamental\nprinciple of international behaviour; the promotion and\nprotection of human rights as universal concepts have\nattained priority on the global agenda; astonishing\nprogress in science and technology has brought\nunprecedented welfare to humanity; knowledge has\nbecome the common heritage of humanity; previously\ncolonized countries have been empowered to determine\ntheir own destiny; dictatorship and despotism have been\nseriously challenged by the universal demand for\nparticipation; and the technological revolution in the field\n10\n\n\nof communications has fundamentally changed human\ninteraction.\nAlongside these positive developments, the twentieth\ncentury has also witnessed various negative phenomena and\ntrends. The totalitarian mentality continues to prevail at the\ndomestic and international levels; poverty persists in its\nmaterial, spiritual and cultural manifestations; the gap\nbetween rich and poor has widened; the world has never\nfreed itself from conflict and bloodshed; the destructive\nterritorial wars of the past have turned into tragic ethnic,\nracial and sectarian rivalries; extremism survives in its\nvarious forms and manifestations, causing irreparable\ndamage; and terrorism continues to challenge humanity with\nits ruthless recurrence in various parts of the world.\nA hallmark of the twentieth century has been the\nworldwide emergence of demands for individual and\ncollective participation, defying totalitarianism and\nauthoritarian rule everywhere. Decision-making is no longer\nan autocratic or even elitist enterprise. It is a participatory\nprocess demanding collective contribution. Totalitarian\ntendencies and ideologies in various countries and at the\ninternational level are finally learning that their time is long\npassed.\nThe global surge of democracy and popular\nparticipation as the sole guarantors of stability and the\nlitmus tests of good-governance is indeed a development of\nhistoric proportions. Self-determination, collective\nparticipation and consent of the governed represent valuable\nand time-tested rational alternatives.\nIn this century, Iran has undergone fundamental\nchanges in the pursuit of independence, liberty, justice,\nparticipation and good governance. Since time immemorial\nand throughout its tumultuous history, Iran has been the\nlocus of innovation. It has proudly preserved its genuine\nnational and religious heritage, and yet, in keeping with the\nbest traditions of that very culture, it has never failed to\nembrace modernity, new ideas and new ways.\nIn today's Islamic Republic, the democratization\nprocess is marching forward on the solid foundation of\ndemocratic Islamic principles. The Government is resolutely\ndetermined vigorously to pursue the implementation and\nconsolidation of its reform programmes. The cornerstones\nof these reform policies are the promotion and protection of\nconstitutional liberties; upholding the rule of law;\nstrengthening democratic norms and institutions; the\ninstitutionalization of the culture of participation; the\nenhancement of the role of people in government; the full\naccountability of public officials; increasing transparency;\nstrengthening the institutions of civil society; the\npromotion of tolerance, a pluralistic society of multiple\nvoices and domestic trends, coupled with confidence-\nbuilding and the breaking of old barriers in foreign\nrelations.\nUndoubtedly, open, dynamic and democratic\nsocieties are by definition susceptible to dissension and\neven rivalries. This has historically accompanied the\nprocess of reform, constituting an inescapable ingredient\nof this path. The sound and successful approach of\nPresident Khatami's Administration in dealing with these\nsocial and political challenges, which has enjoyed the full\nsupport of the leadership, has been to promote and protect\nfundamental democratic values and ensure the rule of law\nand due process, as well as security and stability, which\ntogether form the foundations of a flourishing and open\nsociety.\nCollective participation extends beyond local and\ndomestic decision-making, and is becoming increasingly\na global requirement for an effective presence in\ninternational decision-making. The full participation of all\nStates is a necessary but not sufficient response to this\nneed. It requires the effective contribution of civil society\norganizations in all aspects of the global decision-making\nprocess.\nDuring this century, exclusion often surfaced as a\nparadigm of global interaction, in which the world is\nviewed in terms of modes of loyalty, countries are viewed\nas belonging to coalitions or not and are divided,\nrewarded and blamed accordingly. Today, the utility of\nthis paradigm is being seriously questioned, as is the\nvalidity of some of our basic assumptions.\nThe cold war was the last episode of exclusion. It\nhas undoubtedly left its negative imprint on international\naffairs, but more regrettably it has permanently scarred\nthe mentality of global actors and international relations\ntheory.\nOne of the most horrifying manifestations of\nexclusion has been the global arms race. It literally aims\nat marginalizing others through the accumulation of\nconventional and mass-destruction agents of death, the\nformation of rival military blocs and the unbridled race to\nexpand spheres of influence and domination.\nThe persistence of this paradigm is largely\nresponsible for the most serious threat to the Middle East\n\n\n\nregion. Exploiting this mode of global interaction, Israel,\nwith impunity, has trampled the most fundamental rights of\nthe Palestinian people, including their right to self-\ndetermination, has driven millions of people into diaspora,\nhas illegally occupied territories of others in the Syrian\nGolan and southern Lebanon and has even gone as far as to\ncommit extortion for partial fulfilment of its obligations.\nThis has impeded the realization of the legitimate right of\nthe Palestinian people, and indeed the entire Islamic world,\nto establish an independent Palestinian State in the occupied\nterritories, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. The same\nregime has posed a grave threat to regional and global\npeace and security through the acquisition of nuclear\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction and the\nrejection of universal non-proliferation regimes.\nThe global culture of violence and exclusion, which\npartially emanated from justification of violence as an\nacceptable means to achieve coalition objectives, has\nunwittingly nurtured global menaces ranging from ethnic\nsuppression to terrorism.\nTwo decades of fratricide and devastation in\nAfghanistan has been the fruit of an illusion of total\ndomination of one group or ethnicity at the expense of the\nexclusion of others. This has stalled the constructive and\ntireless efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special\nEnvoy, Ambassador Brahimi, to bring about a peaceful\nsolution through the establishment of a broad-based\nGovernment. Thus, today peace and stability in Afghanistan\nand respect for the most fundamental rights of Afghan\nwomen, men and children in Taliban-controlled areas have\nall but become distant dreams, turning Afghanistan, with its\nproud and rich heritage, into a bastion of narcotics,\nterrorism and regional instability.\nAllow me to refer to terrorism, which has become a\nserious menace and a global challenge. It, of course,\nvictimizes innocent human beings. But its real targets are\nthe rule of law, popular participation and institutions of\ncivil society. In fact, to have fertile ground, terrorists need\nand seek to cultivate and entrench a culture of violence. It\nis for this very reason that, as the Iranian people and\nGovernment have forged a national consensus to\ninstitutionalize the rule of law and participation, known\nterrorist groups have significantly intensified their campaign\nof terror against them. It is even more regrettable that they\nstill find foreign benefactors and sanctuaries. The people\nand the Government of Iran have no doubt that the aim of\nthis treacherous terrorist campaign is to undermine the\nnational determination to reject violence in all its forms,\nand we are all determined to prove the terrorists wrong.\nTerrorism can and will be contained and eradicated\nif we all join hands with firm and resolute determination.\nBut we need to recognize that the application of double\nstandards seriously undermines such a global campaign.\nAcquiescence to terrorists of whatever stripe impedes the\nemergence of a unified, transparent and non-\ndiscriminatory universal machinery to combat and root\nout all forms of terrorism. Iran, while condemning\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, is fully\nprepared to engage actively in such global cooperation.\nIt is thus necessary to work collectively today to lay\nthe foundations of a new paradigm of inclusion and\ndialogue on participation, tolerance, understanding and\ncollective cooperation. The initiative of a dialogue among\ncivilizations, presented last year by President Khatami, is\na proposal to move away from a world driven by\nexclusion and monologue and to begin the new\nmillennium with a gentler, more civilized approach for a\nbetter tomorrow. The overwhelming reception by the\ninternational community and the designation of the year\n2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\nCivilizations indicate a common longing of humanity for\na different approach to interactions in the next century.\nIn our view, the designation of the Year of Dialogue\namong Civilizations is not a mere recognition of the self-\nevident necessity for dialogue at the global level. It is in\nfact a declaration of readiness to try a new model of\ninteraction. The fundamental assumption of this proposal\nis that the prosperity, welfare, development and security\nof one group, in spite of, or at the expense of, the\npoverty, hunger, underdevelopment and insecurity of\nothers are simply deceptive and short-lived, and thus they\nneed to be abandoned. In certain fields, this underlying\nprinciple has been universally accepted, whereas in many\nother fields, we have a long and arduous way to go.\nToday, no one has the illusion that the environment\ncould be defined in terms of political or geographic\nboundaries. Neither can the eradication of narcotics be a\npurely national enterprise. We in Iran are particularly\ncognizant of that fact, as we have had to endure a heavy\nhuman, social and financial toll in our campaign against\ninternational narcotics traffickers.\nIn the field of human rights, it appears that the\ninternational community is gradually embracing a more\ncooperative approach based on constructive engagement\nand understanding. Pluralism, acceptance of diversity and\ndialogue among cultures and civilizations in this pivotal\narea of international affairs will undoubtedly enhance the\n12\n\n\nuniversality of human rights instruments, making them\nmore readily acceptable and globally implementable.\nDialogue is the product of concurrent acceptance of\ncommonality and diversity. From this perspective,\ninternational endorsement of dialogue illustrates recognition\nof the diversity of cultures and civilizations and the\nreaffirmation of the cultural rights of all peoples and\nnations, so that all human beings can engage members of\nother civilizations from the standpoint of their own culture,\ncivilization and historical background, and not by simply\nechoing the mentality of a totally alien culture. Only such\ninteraction can be mutually enriching and indeed\nmeaningful. The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believes\nthat the recognition and reaffirmation of cultural rights of\nnations is a first step for the promotion of sustained\ndialogue.\nIn the field of peace and security, we need to truly\naccept the reality that security is an indivisible need and\ndemand of the entire human race. Thus we need to set aside\nthe residuals of the bipolar system and replace bloc security\numbrellas with a new and innovative concept of global\nsecurity networking, an inclusive and participatory system\nwhich uses the existing mechanisms in a complementary\nrather than competing scheme.\nAttainment of this objective can be immensely helped\nand expedited by empowering civil society organizations to\nparticipate actively in global disarmament and security\nforums and debates. This valuable role has hitherto been\nmostly limited to the social and human rights fields, and the\nsecurity and disarmament arena has been more or less\ndeprived of its contribution and insight. This deficiency\nneeds to be rectified.\nMeanwhile, short- and medium-term measures include\nconfidence-building at the regional and global levels,\ntransparency in the field of armaments, a steady reduction\nof military expenditures, the elimination of weapons of\nmass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons\nin the interim. The Islamic Republic of Iran has itself\nadopted these measures, and has based its foreign policy on\nconfidence-building and the removal of old barriers, with\nparticular emphasis on its immediate neighbourhood.\nAs the Chairman of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, we have also made significant progress in\ndeveloping mechanisms and instruments to enhance\nconfidence among Member States and to institutionalize\ndialogue and coordination with other bodies, such as the\nEuropean Union.\nThe United Nations has an indispensable pivotal role\nin shaping the new world of the next millennium. The\npreservation and extension of its achievements, coupled\nwith revitalization of the moral authority and political\nrelevance of the United Nations in the coming\nmillennium, require restoration of the fundamental\npurposes and principles of the United Nations, as well as\na rational, transparent and participatory process of\nreassessment of the existing institutions.\nEnhancement of the relevance of the United Nations\nrequires, first and foremost, strengthening the role and\nincreasing the efficiency of the General Assembly, by\nfocusing its deliberations on contemporary challenges and\nproblems facing our world today, engaging it in timely\nand effective decision-making to address global economic\nand political issues, and enabling it to seriously examine\nand effectively react to the reports of other organs of the\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council, as\nmandated by the Charter. In this context, we believe that\nthe General Assembly, as the sole democratic, universal\nand transparent organ of the United Nations, is the proper\nforum to carry out an in-depth analysis of the implications\nof the emerging debate on collective action to address\nhumanitarian catastrophes. The imperative of maintaining\nthe integrity of the Charter system is the common point\nof departure in this exercise.\nI firmly believe that the success of next year's\nMillennium Summit rests on an innovative approach to\nprepare the United Nations system to march \u2014 and\nindeed to lead the world community \u2014 towards a new\nparadigm of international affairs. Outdated approaches\nand old remedies have failed to rectify the main problems\nafflicting humanity, even at times exacerbating and\naggravating them. In our collective quest for fundamental\nsolutions, we all need to discard old perceptions,\nassumptions and conceptual frameworks. This is the very\npremise, as well as the primary goal, of dialogue between\ncivilizations.\nVital change in human societies requires brave and\nbold leadership by statesmen and the elite to question old,\nineffective ways and open the arena for the participation\nof thinkers, intellectuals and civil society organizations in\nthe search for a kinder and gentler tomorrow. We hope\nthat our Assembly will have such bravery and foresight.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the United Nations\nis no foreign territory to you. For 14 difficult and\nchallenging years, you valiantly waged a diplomatic\nstruggle at the United Nations for the freedom of our\npeople and the independence of our country. Your sterling\npersonal efforts and unflinching commitment could not be\nbetter crowned. The people of the Republic of Namibia are\nvery proud to see you preside over the fifty-fourth session\nof the General Assembly. On their behalf and indeed on my\nown, I express our deep gratitude to all United Nations\nMember States for electing you President at this session.\nMr. President, as you assume this very important\noffice, you follow in the memorable footsteps of Mongi\nSlim of Tunisia, Alex Quaison-Sackey of Ghana,\nAngie E. Brooks of Liberia, Abdelaziz Bouteflika of\nAlgeria, Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania, Paul J. F. Lusaka\nof Zambia, Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria and Amara Essy of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These distinguished sons and daughters of\nAfrica presided over the General Assembly between 1961\nand 1994. They did Africa proud and they served the\ninternational community well. You should heed the views\nof all United Nations Member States, large and small, rich\nand poor. In that way, you will have maintained and\nadvanced even further the integrity and importance of this\nmost representative organ of the United Nations, the\nGeneral Assembly. I assure you, Mr. President, that you\ncan always count on the loyal and unqualified support of\nthe Namibian delegation.\nDuring your term of office, you will be flanked by\nanother illustrious and committed son of Africa, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, one who hails from Ghana, a country which lit\nthe torch of Africa\u2019s decolonization. To you,\nMr. Secretary-General of the United Nations, I express\nmy Government\u2019s fullest support. The Government and\nthe people of Namibia particularly commend you for your\ndetermined efforts aimed at promoting the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts and bringing relief to the needy in\nAfrica and elsewhere in the world.\nI wish to add my voice to that of the current\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nmy brother and colleague, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika\nof the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria. He\nplaced the demands and expectations of the African\npeople before this body, as well as their resolve to face\nup to the challenges which confront Africa. Guided by the\nspirit of the recent OAU summit held in Algiers,\nPresident Bouteflika talked about a continent which is\nconfronted by development constraints, but whose people\nhave not lost hope: a people who are industrious, but\nwhose efforts to make Africa achieve its potential are\nbeing impeded by social and economic problems. It is\nsome of these challenges that I wish to address.\nToday, economic disparity, debt burden, social\ninjustice, unemployment, refugee problems and\nenvironmental degradation have become unacceptable\nhardships in various regions of the world. One may ask\nwhether these burdens of deprivation have become a\nstatus quo for the majority of people in the developing\ncountries? Have we concluded that there are not enough\nresources to educate every woman, man and child in this\nworld and to keep them healthy and productive? Can all\nthe technological achievements that are now at our\ndisposal not be put at the service of all humanity? Words\nof reason have been spoken, saying that those who are\naffluent today owe their tomorrow to those who live in\ndeprivation.\nIt has been argued that the solution to\nunderdevelopment is globalization and liberalization of\nthe world economy. This forces all of us to be equal,\nwhile, in fact, we are not. I believe that for globalization\nto work it must be transformed from a mere concept into\nreality. It must be a collective undertaking for the benefit\nof all. It is only logical and, indeed, morally right that no\nman, woman or child should go hungry while others are\n16\n\n\nbasking in prosperity. Globalization should not amount to\nprotected and selective prosperity. If so, international peace\nand stability will be jeopardized. As long as over a billion\npeople live in abject poverty, lack access to clean drinking\nwater and do not know how to read and write at all, the\nbenefit of globalization will not be universal. And the\nreality of inequality of States must be at the centre of any\ndiscussions of the world economy. The United Nations can\nand should help developing countries to maximize the\nbenefits from a globalized economy.\nThe biggest menace of the twentieth century has been\nthe unacceptably high and ever-increasing poverty that\ndenudes humanity of its dignity. I wish to recall that among\nthe commitments made during the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen in 1995, was the\ncommitment to halve poverty levels by 2015. Sub-Saharan\nAfrica requires a growth rate of 7 per cent annually if we\nare to achieve those levels. The future looks bleak, but the\ndetermination is strong to overcome all odds and succeed.\nAfrica carries 10 per cent of the world\u2019s population,\nbut produces only 1 per cent of the world\u2019s gross domestic\nproduct. Foreign direct investment in sub-Saharan Africa is\nestimated at a meagre 3 per cent of all total foreign direct\ninvestment. With most of the least developed countries\nbeing in Africa, this vast, rich but underdeveloped continent\ncontinues to challenge our Organization. Poverty and\ndisease have all become much talked about to depict the\nsituation in many parts of Africa. Armed conflicts in\nvarious parts of Africa continue to strip our continent of its\nhuman and natural resources. This overshadows the overall\nachievements that Africa continues to make. Africa today\nis democratizing and undertaking economic reform to\nmaximize social and economic prosperity for its people.\nAnd, indeed, some significant economic growth has been\nrecorded in a large number of countries.\nHowever, political and economic reforms in\nthemselves will not deliver sustained economic growth.\nIncreased foreign direct investment is very important to\ncomplement these reforms and to sustain the current growth\nrate. Only then can the lives of the African people improve.\nLet me emphasize that foreign direct investment should not\nreplace official development aid. In the short term, foreign\naid will be a necessary complement to Africa\u2019s own efforts\nfor recovery and development of its people.\nIn 1990 I attended the World Summit for Children,\nhere at the United Nations, as the newly elected President\nof the Republic of Namibia. I feel proud to say that we\nwere among the first countries in Africa to complete our\nnational programme of action for the implementation of\nthe Summit\u2019s outcome. Our Parliament ratified \u2014 and, in\nfact, most of Africa has ratified \u2014 the Convention on the\nRights of the Child, whose tenth anniversary we are about\nto commemorate. This embodies the legal standard with\nwhich we should comply in ensuring that children reach\ntheir fullest potential. Yet, to our dismay, too many\nchildren are being denied their childhood.\nWhen a child is subjected to armed conflict, with\neach and every right being taken away, then that child is\nplaced on an equal footing with adults. And when that\ncourse takes effect, then, regrettably, society has stooped\nto its lowest and the rest of humanity cannot and should\nnot stand idly by. We can and must prevent conflicts\nfrom occurring, so as to create an environment in which\nall children can live, play and grow up under safe\nconditions. Only through a culture of peace can we\ncombat all forms of child exploitation and, in particular,\nput an end to the phenomenon of child soldiers.\nI would therefore like to stress that if every square\nmetre of land that is inaccessible because of landmines\ncould once again become productive, many children,\nespecially in Africa, would be spared from hunger. And\nif every child soldier in Africa carrying a gun can be\nturned into a student, Africa\u2019s future will have been\nsecured.\nOn the eve of the new millennium, we can all look\nback with pride on the fact that humankind has made\nmajor strides towards the betterment of the living\nconditions of millions across the world. The information\nsuperhighway has changed for ever the way we do\nbusiness. Much of the world is now fully connected\nthrough the Internet.\nNotwithstanding all this, much of Africa is still\nstruggling to gain meaningful access to knowledge and\ninformation. In addition to our efforts to become more\n\u201cwired\u201d, we are now faced with the enormous challenge\nof ensuring that our countries are all Y2K-compliant\nbefore 31 December 1999, in order to avert disaster.\nNamibia calls on all those countries which have the\nresources and the necessary know-how to assist\ndeveloping countries in dealing with this problem. The\ninternational community needs to share knowledge\nbecause it is mutually beneficial. Developed countries\nhave nothing to lose and everything to gain by sharing\ninformation technology with the developing countries.\n17\n\n\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is eroding the socio-\neconomic and developmental gains that many African\ncountries have made. HIV/AIDS has been rated the\nnumber-one killer in many countries, including Namibia.\nMy Government adopted a National Strategic Plan on\nHIV/AIDS for the period 1999-2004. The aim of our\nnational plan is to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS\nsignificantly by strengthening efforts towards prevention\nand control. In addition to the existing Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) regional programmes,\nwe have also undertaken other measures to ensure that there\nis no discrimination against all those living with HIV/AIDS.\nThe international community should assist the efforts of the\nAfrican Governments in the implementation of their\nnational programmes to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.\nNext June, we shall convene two special sessions of\nthe General Assembly to review the progress made by\nGovernments in the implementation of the commitments\nmade at the Fourth World Conference on Women and the\nWorld Summit for Social Development, respectively. Let us\nuse those opportunities to make equality among people a\nreality and social integration the norm, so that men and\nwomen can live together in equality and as partners.\nIn recent years, we have witnessed a number of\npositive developments in the field of disarmament.\nHowever, despite these developments, we remain concerned\nat the lack of tangible movement on the core issue of\nnuclear disarmament. The central problem is the\ndetermination by nuclear-weapon States, despite their\nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, to retain nuclear weapons indefinitely.\nThis is being done under the pretext that nuclear weapons\nare essential for national security. To make such a claim is\na clear invitation to other States to acquire nuclear weapons\nunder the same pretext, as by nature every State has its\nvital national security to protect. In practice, nuclear\nweapons have also become a means of exerting pressure on\nand blackmailing other countries. No State or group of\nStates should have a monopoly on nuclear weapons. This\nis a new type of apartheid, which is unacceptable today.\nIn this century, international peace and security have\nbeen challenged by the barbaric conduct of a few\nindividuals who have offended the very conscience of\nhumankind by committing heinous crimes. Namibia wishes\nto record its firm stand against all acts, methods and\npractices of terrorism and reiterates its unequivocal\ncondemnation of such acts. At the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) summit in Algiers, the African leaders\nadopted the OAU Convention on the Prevention and\nCombating of Terrorism. Its elimination therefore requires\nthe close cooperation of all United Nations Member\nStates. However, international cooperation in combating\nterrorism, and the measures adopted to combat it, must be\nbased on international law, the relevant international\nConventions and, above all, conducted in conformity with\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe reform of the Security Council constitutes one\nof the important components in the efforts to strengthen,\nrevitalize and democratize the United Nations. The\ncomposition of the Security Council does not reflect the\nsubstantial increase in the membership of the United\nNations. Furthermore, it does not respect the principles of\nequitable geographical representation and the sovereign\nequality of States. In the existing Security Council,\nparticularly in the permanent members\u2019 category,\ndeveloping countries are grossly under-represented. To\nmaintain such a situation is to erode the principle of\ndemocracy and fairness. Equally, a selective or partially\nreformed Council which overlooks the principles of equity\nand balance is against the spirit of the Charter.\nMy Government is therefore strongly in favour of\nthe position that we must correct the existing imbalances\nin the composition of the Security Council. It must\nbecome a democratic and truly representative institution,\nunfettered by the unfair tendencies and practices of the\npast.\nWe support the expansion of the Security Council in\nboth categories, permanent and non-permanent.\nDeveloping countries must adequately be represented in\na reformed and democratized Security Council. Africa\ndeserves at least two permanent seats and additional non-\npermanent seats in the expanded Council. Namibia, being\na member of the Non-Aligned Movement, supports a\nreformed Council of no less than 26 members. We do not\nsupport those who advocate a lesser number on the\nground of effectiveness.\nExperience has shown that the ineffectiveness or\ninaction of the Security Council has been due to the threat\nof veto by those who possess it, and not to the Council\u2019s\nsize. As a matter of policy, Namibia is opposed to the\nveto, because of its undemocratic nature. It cannot even\nbe overridden by law or by procedures, as is the practice\nin democratic countries. The exercise of the veto\nperpetuates differences between members of the Council.\nIn some instances, it has greatly contributed to division\nand inaction in the Security Council. In other instances,\nit has even prolonged conflicts and human suffering. If\n18\n\n\nthe veto cannot be abolished now, its application should be\nprogressively curtailed until it is removed altogether.\nThe question of Palestine remains at the core of the\nproblem of the Middle East. Only when the inalienable\nrights of the Palestinian people are restored can there be\nlasting peace. We welcome the resumption of the peace\nnegotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. I\nreaffirm my Government\u2019s unwavering political and\ndiplomatic support for the Palestinian people under the\nleadership of President Yasser Arafat.\nWith the end of the cold war nearly 10 years ago, we\nall expected to share in the peace dividend. In this\nconnection, it is regrettable that Cuba continues to be\nsubjected to a cruel economic, financial and commercial\nembargo, which must be lifted forthwith. Namibia calls for\nthe end of the embargo so that the people of Cuba can live\nin peace and prosperity with all their neighbours.\nThe people of East Timor have long yearned for their\nright to self-determination, freedom and independence. On\n30 August 1999 their dream to determine their own future\nwas overwhelmingly expressed in a referendum. The\ninternational community should assist the people of East\nTimor to complete the process towards statehood, peace,\nsecurity and development. We welcome the decision of the\nGovernment of Indonesia to invite the international\ncommunity, through the deployment of a United Nations\npeacekeeping force, to East Timor. We call on Indonesia to\ncooperate fully to ensure the success of that operation.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, my Government notes\nthe progress made towards the holding of a free and fair\nreferendum. We call on the parties, in particular the\nKingdom of Morocco, to cooperate with the United Nations\nso as to enable the Sahraoui people to exercise their right\nto self-determination.\nDespite the difficulties of the United Nations, my\nGovernment regards the Organization and its various\nagencies as the best possible instruments we have to\npromote world peace, international trade and increased\ncooperation. The admission of the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga has further\nstrengthened our Organization. Namibia congratulates them\nand welcomes them into our fold.\nIn the current international climate, the United Nations\nis the only voice which can bring peace to strife-torn areas,\nbring development to those regions where is it needed most\nand settle disputes between States. However, to carry out its\nmanifold tasks and duties effectively and efficiently, the\nUnited Nations needs money and resources from all\nMember States, without exception. In short, the United\nNations must embody the hopes and aspirations of\nhumankind and still reflect the realities of our times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "A little over two decades ago I\naddressed this Assembly as head of a military Government\nin Nigeria. On that occasion the focus of my statement was\nthe urgent need to terminate colonial rule in Namibia and\nRhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and dismantle the racist\napartheid South Africa. Today it is a great source of joy for\nme and my delegation that a distinguished son of Namibia\nis presiding over the affairs of the fifty-fourth session of\nthe United Nations General Assembly. My delegation\nassures you, Sir, of its full cooperation and unwavering\nsupport throughout your tenure.\nMay I also convey through you, Sir, our deep\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of\nUruguay, for the able and efficient manner in which he\nconducted the proceedings of the fifty-third session.\nOur appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his visionary leadership and the\ninvaluable work of the Secretariat under his stewardship.\nPermit me also to warmly welcome, on behalf of my\ncountry and delegation, the Republic of Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga, which\nhave just joined this family of nations.\nI stand before this Assembly today very proud to be\nthe leader of a Nigeria that has successfully managed the\ntransition to democracy after a decade and a half of\nmilitary rule. I would like to seize this opportunity to\nexpress the profound appreciation of all Nigerians for the\ninternational support and encouragement which combined\nso effectively with the relentless determination of\nNigerians themselves to reconstruct and transform their\ncountry into a vibrant democracy.\nOur Administration has raised the hopes of\nNigerians, and their expectations are correspondingly\nhigh. We are well aware of the enormity of the challenges\nthat we face. But we are fully resolved to tackle our\nnumerous social, economic and political problems head\non. And, by the Grace of God, we will not fail.\nSince assuming office some four months ago our\nadministration has put in place an institutional framework\nfor the purpose of reconciling competing interests and\ngroups in our society. Our democratic institutions are now\noperating effectively within the system of checks and\nbalances enshrined in our Constitution. Furthermore, we\nhave opted for a policy of inclusiveness in all our\npolitical appointments, with a Cabinet, for instance, in\nwhich all registered political parties are represented, thus\nmoving away from the divisive practice of winner takes\nall.\nOur Administration has initiated policies aimed at\nrevitalizing the economy in order to create an enabling\nenvironment for investment and economic growth. We\nhave also put in place an appropriate legal framework for\n8\n\n\nthe protection of foreign investments and repatriation of\nlegitimate profits.\nOther measures that we have taken include a vigorous\nanti-corruption campaign; the promotion of transparency\nand accountability in public life; the abolition of decrees\nand regulations which hindered the inflow of foreign\ninvestment; the generation of opportunities for employment\nand income savings for domestic investment; and the\nprivatization of key State enterprises, such as electricity and\ntelecommunications; legislation and other measures to\nredress obvious cases of neglect and injustice done to ethnic\nminorities, particularly in the oil-producing areas of the\nNiger delta region, and to deal with the problems of the\nenvironment; investigation of past human rights violations,\nwith a view to promoting and protecting fundamental\nfreedoms; and strengthening the capacity of the law\nenforcement agencies to promote law and order, as well as\nsecurity, and to deal more effectively with the problem of\ndrug trafficking.\nAfrica is indeed proud and glad to see the end of this\ncentury coincide with the total elimination of colonialism\nand the twin menace of constitutionalized racism in the\nsouthern part of the continent. The United Nations deserves\nour warm commendation for the crucial role it has played\nin this process.\nLet me also pay tribute to the thousands who lost their\nlives in the struggle for freedom so that those of us alive\ntoday can proudly say we have the destiny of the continent\nin our own hands. It is, however, a destiny which poses\nmonumental challenges in our effort to improve the quality\nof life on our continent. We must strive to alleviate the\ngrinding poverty and material deprivation that has\npersistently remained a feature of our political freedom.\nAs we approach the dawn of the new millennium, the\ndefining feature of our increasingly interdependent world is\naccelerated globalization, and the liberalization of\nproduction, trade, investment and finance.\nBut for us in the developing world the reality today is\nquite different. Globalization, in its various manifestations,\nis already experiencing a troubled relationship with the\nimperatives of development.\nIt is rather tragic that Africa, the least developed of all\nthe regions and the least able to cope with external shocks,\nhas borne the brunt of the adverse effects of globalization\nof the world economy. There are grim statistics which\nindicate that the well-known marginalization of the\nAfrican continent has turned into delinkage from the\nglobal scene.\nSince 1992 Africa's exports and imports as a share\nof world trade has declined from 4 per cent to 2 per cent.\nAfrica's development is presently straitjacketed by a debt\nburden of around $300 billion. The continent is\nexperiencing import compression, weak productivity and\nlow output. On the average, factories that are still\noperating do so at less than 30 per cent of installed\ncapacity. Africa's share in total foreign direct investment\ninflows to developing countries has dropped from 11 per\ncent in the late 1980s to less than 5 per cent in the second\nhalf of the 1990s, and to a meagre 1.2 per cent of world\nforeign direct investment flows in 1997.\nThis trend has continued, despite the efforts of\nAfrican countries to implement far-reaching economic\nreforms and maintain macroeconomic stability,\nparticularly through the introduction of a more open and\nbusiness-friendly investment environment, and the\nprovision of incentives to attract foreign investment.\nIn the quest for a better and fairer management of a\nglobalized world economy, it is now incumbent upon us\nto direct our searchlight on the unsatisfactory evolution of\nthe multilateral trading system. In participating in the\nhistoric Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade\nNegotiations that ushered in the new rules-based trading\nsystem, the developing world had hoped that the new\ntrading regime would enhance their trading fortunes,\nfacilitate their effective integration into the world\neconomy, and arrest their marginalization from the global\ntrading system.\nUnfortunately, however, the vast majority of\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, have so far\nbeen unable to reap the benefits arising from their\nmembership of the World Trade Organization. Africa's\ntrade prospects continue to be hampered by the non-\nimplementation of the special and differential provisions\nthat favour developing countries, and the increasingly\nprotectionist measures that are being imposed against their\nexport products. Besides, the paucity of technical and\nfinancial assistance that would have enabled the\ndeveloping countries to take advantage of the limited\nmarket access opportunities that exist continues to deepen\nAfrica's marginalization in the globalized world economy.\nWithout doubt, the biggest monetary and financial\nobstacle confronting developing countries is the chronic\n9\n\n\ndebt overhang. According to United Nations figures, the\nglobal debt of all developing countries stood at $567 billion\nin 1980, and $1.4 trillion in 1992. In that 12-year period\nthese countries made foreign debt payments totalling $1.6\ntrillion. Now, out of the 41 countries which the World Bank\ndescribes as heavily indebted poor countries, 33 are African\ncountries, a group that some believe is richly deserving of\nits own special category: severely indebted low-income\ncountries. Today in sub-Saharan Africa every man, woman\nand child owes $357. This is a continent where millions\nlive in abject poverty, earning around $100 a year, or 27\ncents a day. Some African countries now spend as much as\nfour times on servicing debts as they do on education and\nhealth care. Some countries spend up to 40 per cent of their\nnational budgets on debt servicing. Furthermore, it is\nreliably estimated that for every dollar given in official\ndevelopment aid, $3 go back to the rich countries in debt\nservice payments.\nI make bold to assert that calling for debt relief for\ndeveloping countries is not a plea for charity, but is an\nurgent matter of social and economic justice. It has to be\nredressed if there is to be peace and stability in the twenty-\nfirst century. Therefore, we propose definitive debt\ncancellation, not just reduction or rescheduling of the debt\nservice regime. Eligibility should be limited to unpayable\ndebts, which for Africa means the bulk of the $300 billion\ncurrent stock of debt. There should be debt remission that\nis not predicated on the institutionally harsh conditionalities\nof structural adjustment programmes. There should be\nrecognition on both sides of the bargaining table that\nlenders and borrowers share joint responsibilities for debts\nincurred in circumstances that are morally questionable in\nthe first place. Debt cancellation should benefit ordinary\npeople.\nNigerians rightly expect democracy to yield\nperceptible dividends in their lives. Our Administration will,\nhowever, find the task of meeting this expectation virtually\nimpossible without substantial reduction of our debt burden,\nespecially as we call on the same citizens to make the\nsacrifices that are implicit in the recent measures aimed at\nprudent management of our national economy.\nI wish to invite the attention of the Assembly to the\nrelated issue of illegal capital flight from Africa. It is an\nopen secret that much of Africa's wealth has been\nillegally siphoned out of the continent by corrupt regimes\nand unpatriotic individuals working in collaboration with\nforeign partners. Nigeria and many African countries\nwould be able to pay off large portions of their debts if\nonly they could recover some of the capital illegally\nstashed abroad. We thus believe that now is the time to\ncollectively deal with this issue.\nIn this regard, Nigeria calls for a concerted effort by\nthe international community, through an international\nconvention, for the repatriation to Africa and the\ndeveloping world of all capital illegally transferred from\nthese countries. Such an international convention or\nagreement is legally feasible and morally sustainable. It\nwill compel participating banks to disclose the source of\nthe illegal accounts they hold, repatriate them to the\ncountries of rightful ownership and subject the guilty\nparties to the full weight of national and international law.\nIt is with a heavy heart that I raise the issue of the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic throughout Africa. Our continent is\nbearing the brunt of this terrible disease that now kills\naround 2 million Africans annually, thus officially\novertaking malaria as Africa's number one primary health-\ncare problem. This situation is even more frightening in\nthat it has now left 6 million children orphaned in the\neastern and southern parts of Africa. In West Africa the\ndisease has been spreading just as rapidly. Unlike malaria,\nwhich is location specific, HIV/AIDS knows neither\nclimatic nor regional boundaries. Global cooperation is an\nimperative if we are to succeed in dealing with this\nscourge.\nAmong the immediate challenges facing Nigeria and\nAfrica today is resolving the many conflicts raging on the\ncontinent. Today, as many as 19 sub-Saharan countries\nare engaged in armed conflicts. The negative impact of\nthese conflicts in human, social, economic and\nenvironmental destruction does not need to be described\nhere. Nigeria and indeed the entire West African\nsubregion have devoted considerable human, material,\npolitical and diplomatic resources to the resolution of\nthese crises in the subregion, starting with Liberia and\nsubsequently Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. Similarly,\nefforts are being made in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and in Angola towards peaceful resolution of their\nconflicts.\n10\n\n\nIndeed, African leaders at the recent summit of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) in Algiers, and at the\nurging of the Nigerian delegation, agreed to declare next\nyear as the Year of Peace, Security and Stability in Africa.\nBy this declaration, we have dedicated ourselves to making\nthe year 2000 the year when Africans direct all their efforts\ninto effectively eliminating armed conflicts on their\ncontinent. We hope to build on the fresh momentum for\npeace occasioned by the budding peace initiatives in Congo,\nSierra Leone, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Angola.\nWe are also agreed on the overriding need to uphold\ncodes of decency, ethics and minimum standards of\ndecorum among African Governments and their leadership.\nGone are the days when the OAU turned a blind eye to the\nexcesses and abuses of power by member Governments.\nForceful and undemocratic changes of Governments will no\nlonger be overlooked or tolerated. We intend to condemn\nin absolute terms all violations of these codes and to\nostracize their perpetrators. It is our duty and moral\nresponsibility to treat our citizens decently and humanely.\nMy country has always believed that the threat to\ninternational peace and security from any corner of the\nglobe should be considered a threat to the peace and\nsecurity of the world as a whole. While the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security remains the primary\nresponsibility of the Security Council, the Charter provision\nfor the complementary role of regional and subregional\ngroups has also proved to be critical to the maintenance of\npeace at the regional and global levels. The establishment\nof the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) is a clear\ntestimony of our commitment to subregional peace. As the\nrecord shows, ECOMOG succeeded in putting an end to the\nLiberian war in 1997, reinstating the democratically elected\nPresident of Sierra Leone in 1998, and bringing about the\ncurrent Peace Agreement for Sierra Leone signed in Lom\u00e9\nin July 1999.\nThe time has come, however, for the Security Council\nto assume its full responsibility, specifically in Sierra Leone\nand other conflict flash points in Africa. For too long, the\nburden of preserving international peace and security in\nWest Africa has been left almost entirely to a few States in\nour subregion. The non-implementation of the Peace\nAgreement and Nigeria's continual burden in Sierra Leone\nis unacceptably draining Nigeria financially. For our\neconomy to take off, this bleeding has to stop. The United\nNations needs to do more in providing logistics and\nfinancial support to assist regional peacekeeping and peace-\nbuilding efforts, as well as enhancing the welfare of\nrefugees worldwide without discrimination.\nMy delegation believes that it has never been the\npurpose of the United Nations Organization to prescribe\ndemocracy and change for its members and yet make\nlittle or no progress in the democratization of its own\norgans, such as the Security Council. My delegation\naccordingly urges the General Assembly, during this\nsession, to conclude deliberations and reach agreement on\nthe modalities for the reform and expansion of the\nSecurity Council so that the Millennium Assembly will\nadopt them next year \u2014 and not later.\nHow can the United Nations continue to perpetuate\nand justify a situation where Africa is the only continent\nwithout a permanent seat in the Security Council? In\norder to promote reform and democratization of the\nSecurity Council, Africa, with 53 Member States, should\nbe allocated at least two permanent seats \u2014\ncommensurate not only with the continent's size and\npopulation, but with its track record also of contributing\nto the maintenance of international peace and security.\nI wish to reaffirm our belief that the United Nations\nis the most universal body ever designed for collectively\nresolving humankind's common problems. Our\nOrganization has come a long way since its establishment\n54 years ago. Although created in a different era and\nunder different circumstances, and in spite of numerous\nconstraints, the United Nations has continuously sought to\nadapt itself to the changes in the international political\narena. It has been able to accomplish this to some degree,\nbut it remains an institution whose working methods,\nprocedures and administrative structure have in many\nrespects become outdated.\nYet the world as we know it today without the\nUnited Nations would be inconceivable. For it has come\nto symbolize hope for a better and more secure future for\nmany, particularly in the developing areas of the world.\nIndeed, though a majority of our countries could not be\nmembers when the Organization was created, we are\ntoday its strongest defenders and advocates of the ideals\nfor which it stands. We believe in the family of nations,\nand within that family the strong members have the\nresponsibility to protect and strengthen the weaker\nmembers.\nAt the close of the twentieth century and the\nbeginning of the third millennium, there is a need for\nstock-taking and for proper assessment of the\n\n\n\nimplementation of previous resolutions emanating especially\nfrom the major world summits and conferences which took\nplace in this decade. Such an effort would bring us closer\nto the realization of the purposes and objectives of our\nOrganization. In this regard, I stand before the Assembly\nand pledge Nigeria's continued contributions and positive\ncommitment to the ideals of the Charter of the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to be\nafforded this opportunity to extend my delegation\u2019s\ncongratulations to Mr. Gurirab and his country, Namibia, on\nhis election to the high office of President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. His considerable\ndiplomatic experience is well known, and there is little\ndoubt that the affairs of this session will be conducted with\nexpeditiousness, skill and competence. At the same time, I\nwish to express my delegation\u2019s appreciation and gratitude\nto his immediate predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the\nable manner in which he presided over the fifty-third\nsession.\nLet me extend my delegation\u2019s thanks to our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the excellent and\nexemplary leadership qualities he has displayed during this\ncritical period for the United Nations and the international\ncommunity. The Commonwealth of Dominica welcomes\nand congratulates the three new Member States \u2014 Kiribati,\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga \u2014 on their admission to\nthe United Nations. We pledge to work with them on\nmatters of mutual interest.\nI take this opportunity to convey my country\u2019s deepest\ncondolences to the Governments and the people of the\nBahamas and the United States for the loss of life and\ndestruction of property caused by hurricane Floyd. I also\nexpress my Government\u2019s sentiments regarding the victims\nof the earthquakes in Greece, the Republic of China on\nTaiwan, Turkey, and, just recently, Mexico. Our sympathy\nis also extended to the victims of the nuclear accident in\nJapan.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is supportive of the\nongoing United Nations reform programme, the intent of\nwhich is to create a system geared to eliminating waste and\nduplication and making more efficient use of the\nOrganization\u2019s resources. At its creation the United\nNations was charged with responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and the\nnumerous United Nations missions currently in place\naround the globe are testimony to the Organization\u2019s\nefforts to meet its Charter obligations in this regard.\nHowever, we continue to maintain that the restructuring\nand revitalization process should result in creating an\nOrganization with the capacity, compassion and\neffectiveness to meet the many serious economic, social\nand humanitarian problems confronting the majority of\ncitizens in the global village.\nWe are not unmindful of the great contributions that\nthe United Nations system has made to the improvement\nof health, the eradication of diseases and the rising levels\nof education and living standards in various parts of the\nworld. Additionally, the United Nations has been at the\nforefront of efforts to focus international consciousness on\nhuman rights abuses, while it continues to be the last\nhope for the many thousands displaced each year as a\nresult of political, religious or ethnic conflict.\nBut poverty eradication remains an unfulfilled\npromise. Today, increasing numbers of people live in\nconditions of poverty, with no access to adequate medical\ncare, basic education or even clean drinking water. We\nrecognize that poverty eradication is a task to be\nundertaken not by the United Nations system alone, but\nin partnership with the international community, which\nmust come to the realization that improvement in social\nand economic conditions is less costly than having to deal\nwith the consequences of sustained economic deprivation\nand social degradation. The time for engaging in that\npartnership is now.\nAs for the reform of the Security Council, the\nCommonwealth of Dominica supports the work of the\nOpen-ended Working Group and its efforts at reconciling\nthe many outstanding issues and differences among\nMember States. We believe that any meaningful reform\nof the Security Council should reflect present-day\neconomic and geographical realities and must provide for\na reasonable expansion of its membership and equitable\nrepresentation for regional groupings, with no\ndifferentiation regarding the rights of permanent members.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica applauded the\ndecision of the people of East Timor, as expressed in the\npopular consultation of 30 August 1999. We must\ntherefore deplore and condemn the acts of violence visited\nupon the people of East Timor by those determined to\n21\n\n\nnullify the results of the consultation and maintain the\ncolonial status quo. We commend the United Nations for its\nwork in making the consultation possible and we strongly\nsupport the decision of the Security Council to authorize the\nestablishment of a multinational peacekeeping force to\nprotect the people of East Timor as they seek to assert their\nright to self-determination.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to address\nonce again the issue of legitimate representation for the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan and its people in the United\nNations. The Republic of China on Taiwan, a model of\ndemocracy in the Asian region, is able and willing to carry\nout the obligations contained in the Charter of the United\nNations. Over the past few decades, the Republic of China\nhas made tremendous strides in economic development,\nthus enabling it to make a contribution to poverty\nalleviation through economic assistance programmes in\ndeveloping countries. Dominica is concerned that an\nindustrialized country, with a democratically elected\nGovernment, that exercises sovereign authority over a\ndefined geographical area with a population of 22 million\npeople, is denied membership of the United Nations. This\nsituation must be addressed in order to ensure that the\ncitizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan have a\nrepresentative voice in the United Nations and its related\nagencies.\nThe recently concluded special session of the General\nAssembly on small island developing States provided an\nopportunity to review the 1994 Barbados Plan of Action.\nThe recognition of small island developing States in that\nregard is a significant milestone in the history of the United\nNations. The follow-up action and the importance which the\ninternational community places on the implementation of\nthe many proposals and recommendations will serve to\ndetermine not only the success of the special session, but\nalso the credibility of the United Nations and the usefulness\nof these conferences.\nAs a small island developing State which has always\nrecognized the importance of conservation of the\nenvironment, Dominica made a commitment at the Rio\nSummit to vigorously pursue sustainable development. Two\nyears later, Dominica participated in the Global Conference\non the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates in Barbados and has tried at the national level to\nimplement the Plan of Action within the limits of our\nresources.\nThe Barbados Plan of Action recognizes the\nimportance of coastal and marine resources to the\nsustainable development of small island developing States.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is acutely aware of that\nimportance. Prudent use of our coastal and marine\nresources over many years has contributed immensely to\nthe economic well-being and sustenance of our citizens.\nMoreover, the successful implementation of our\neco-tourism development programme relies heavily on the\nmaintenance and preservation of the marine and biological\nresources present in the seas around our island State.\nThose resources are under constant and serious threat\nfrom a number of sources, such as illegal waste-dumping\nwith impunity by foreign-owned ocean liners; overfishing\nby non-indigenous fishing fleets; and the use of the\nCaribbean Sea for the transshipment of nuclear waste and\nother hazardous substances.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica, together with\nother members of the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM), continues to view the dangerous practice of\nthe transshipment of nuclear waste and hazardous\nsubstances through the Caribbean Sea as a potentially\nserious threat to the fragile ecosystem and to the\nlivelihood and well-being of the people of the region, and\nwe call upon the States engaging in that practice to\ndemonstrate some regard for our justifiable concerns. We\nearnestly seek the support of the international community\nin our ongoing effort to halt the shipment of these\ndangerous materials through the Caribbean Sea. Further,\nmembers of CARICOM call upon the General Assembly\nto recognize the Caribbean Sea as a special area in the\ncontext of sustainable development and urge the\ninternational community to support the concept and its\ndevelopment.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is appreciative of\nthe United Nations for paying special attention to the\nissue of small island developing States at the special\nsession of the General Assembly. One sincerely hopes\nthat this same recognition and support will be in evidence\nduring the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial\nConference later this year, when small island developing\nStates seek to address their particular concerns and\ncircumstances.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica, like most small\nvulnerable States, faces increasing challenges from\nglobalization; particularly in the area of multilateral trade\nnegotiations. Due to resource constraints, developing\ncountries are having difficulties in meeting the\ncommitments which they made at the Uruguay Round.\nYet we are on the eve of making further commitments at\nthe new round of WTO negotiations to be launched in\n22\n\n\nSeattle in December. The negotiating process itself exposes\ndeveloping countries to the growing disparities of the\nmultilateral trading system. We run the risk of developing\ncountries being further marginalized unless these\nnegotiations give full recognition to their special\ncircumstances, and in particular to those of small vulnerable\neconomies. Small vulnerable economies will continue to\nrequire differential treatment for some time as a means of\nfacilitating their integration into the world economy.\nMy country\u2019s experience with the WTO has not been\na positive one. The economy of Dominica and those of the\nother Caribbean banana-producing countries are heavily\ndependent for their export earnings on this single crop. The\nWTO banana ruling has contributed to a significant decline\nin our banana exports. Our bananas are cultivated by small\nfarmers whose main source of income could be wiped out\nas a result of the WTO ruling, resulting in increased\nunemployment and poverty in the rural areas.\nWe need to find a solution to the banana dispute that\nwill allow our farmers to continue to earn a living. There\nis a growing recognition of the need for a tariff rate quota\nas the most acceptable solution. However, the North\nAmerican multinational banana companies are insisting on\na simple tariff, which will ultimately lead to the demise of\nthe small banana producers in the Caribbean and other\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific States. We continue to\nreceive assurances that it is not the intention of our\nneighbours to the North to hurt the Caribbean producers,\nbut their actions indicate otherwise. Moreover, they insist\non applying a strict interpretation to the multilateral trading\nrules, which displays a callous disregard of the plight of\nsmall banana farmers. The rules of the WTO must not be\napplied in a manner which is detrimental to the\ndevelopment process of small vulnerable States.\nMy focus on issues presently facing the region would\nbe incomplete without a brief but sincere appeal to this\nbody to address the plight of the citizens of our sister island\nCuba. As we progress to a new century, the United Nations\nmust continue to condemn the prolonged economic\nblockade of Cuba.\nThis unjustifiable action is unconscionable,\nunreasonable and a direct infringement on the rights of the\npeople of Cuba to pursue a peaceful existence, economic\nprosperity and self-determination. Dominica therefore joins\nother members of the international community in calling for\nan end to this blockade. We should all seek more amicable\nmethods of settling bilateral disputes.\nAs a nation preparing to celebrate its twenty-first\nanniversary of independence on 3 November 1999,\nDominica will continue to equip itself and its citizens to\nmeet the challenges of the global environment and the\nnew millennium. The Government of the Commonwealth\nof Dominica has endeavoured to ensure that its policies\nand programmes continue to provide the leadership,\ninstitutions and infrastructure necessary to attain that goal.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nStrengthened by our rich cultural heritage, as\nmanifested in our Creole music, dance and other forms of\nexpression, we are convinced that the world would be a\nsafer and better place if the people of the world learned\nto respect and tolerate each other\u2019s culture, religion and\ntraditions.\nIt is in this spirit that Dominica reaffirms its\ncommitment to the ideals of the United Nations and\npledges to do all in its power to support the efforts of all\nStates, particularly those of the vulnerable small island\ndeveloping States. The challenges facing Dominica are\nmany, but I am confident that with the support of all\nMember States and with the help of God we shall prevail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "In electing\nyou unanimously to preside over its at the fifty-fourth\nsession, Sir, the General Assembly paid a well-deserved\ntribute to your country, the sister Republic of Namibia,\nwhich in November 1989, under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations Transition Assistance Group, organized\nthat land's first free and fair elections, which marked the\nsuccessful culmination of the legitimate, heroic struggle\nof the Namibian people for independence, under the\nleadership of the South-West Africa People's Organization\n6\n\n\n(SWAPO) and its President, His Excellency Mr. Sam\nNujoma. Now, following this happy sequence of events, we\nare now pleased to see Namibia at the helm of this historic\nsession of the General Assembly, represented by you\nyourself. On behalf of the delegation of Senegal, Sir, I\nconvey to you our warmest, fraternal congratulations; we\nwish you every success in your high post.\nI wish also to convey my sincere and warm\ncongratulations to your predecessor, Minister Didier Opertti,\non the competent, committed and authoritative way in\nwhich he guided the work of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nFinally, I wish once again to offer Secretary-General\nKofi Annan my encouragement as he continues, with\nenergy, intelligence and vision, to carry out his delicate\ntasks authoritatively and successfully in a particularly\ndifficult global context. I feel bound to say that his election\nto head the Secretariat of the United Nations was a source\nof pride for Africa and a source of satisfaction for all\npeace- and justice-loving countries. During the Secretary-\nGeneral's visit to Senegal, Mr. Abdou Diouf, President of\nthe Republic of Senegal, made it clear that the Senegalese\nGovernment was committed to and actively supported the\nSecretary-General.\nI take genuine pleasure and great joy in welcoming\namong us the delegations representing the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga,\nwhich have just been admitted as full-fledged Members of\nthe great United Nations family. These admissions attest to\nand bolster the universal character of our Organization, thus\nhelping strengthen its aims and principles.\nAllow me to use the idea of universality to explain\nand justify, if that is necessary, my country's unreserved\nsupport for the admission of the Republic of China, with its\n22 million inhabitants, as a full Member of the United\nNations and its specialized agencies. The Republic of\nChina \u2014 a democratic country concerned with safeguarding\nand promoting human rights, a world economic Power\nrecognized by nations, and, last but not least, a nation that\nmaintains trade relations through commercial delegations \u2014\nshares with deep conviction our common faith in the noble\nideals of peace, solidarity and cooperation enshrined in the\nCharter. That country, for the sake of the principle of the\nuniversality of our Organization, should take its place once\nmore. Simple justice requires this, and the ideals embodied\nin our Charter dictate it, because it is in the name of these\nprinciples that other States are admitted as Members of this\nOrganization, which I welcome.\nOur fifty-fourth regular session, we must all agree,\nis an event of great historical and political significance.\nHistorical, because it is the penultimate session \u2014 or the\nlast, depending on how you look at it \u2014 of the twentieth\ncentury, the century in which it was born, after two world\nwars and other great calamities for humankind, the\nconsequences of which are still being felt.\nThis century has also been one of light, with\ntremendous advances achieved by the human race in\nvarious fields, particularly in science and technology. This\nsession takes on special political importance because it is\nan irreplaceable tool in the service of peace, international\nsecurity, cooperation and the promotion of human rights\nand is a timely opportunity for dialogue, reflection and\npreparation for the great encounters of the coming\nmillennium.\nAt the threshold of the third millennium, we should\nwonder and think together, in the framework of this\nOrganization, about what kind of peace, development and\nsolidarity we should build in the coming century. It is a\nrecognized fact that current changes, the range of whose\neffects in the political, economic and social spheres\ncannot be foreseen, call inevitably for a deep-going\nreform of the United Nations and impose a need to adapt\nthe Organization to the demands of the times. Thus, we\nneed to be clear-sighted, creative and realistic and make\ninnovative, broad-ranging and constructive proposals that\ncan be translated into concrete actions taken solely in the\ninterests of all our peoples and all our nations, which\nmake up the family that we call humankind.\nIn this respect, reform of the Security Council is a\nmajor test of our resolve to modernize this important\nbody, which we need to endow with greater transparency,\ngreater democracy, greater authority and greater\nlegitimacy \u2014 in short, greater credibility.\nMany proposals have already been made, but in\nrestructuring this key organ of the system, we need to go\nbeyond them, demonstrating creativity and a willingness\nto compromise, considering only the interests of this\nOrganization at the service of humanity. From this\nstandpoint, in the Algiers Declaration, the States of Africa\nunanimously recalled the legitimate demands embodied in\nthe Harare Declaration adopted by the Conference of\nHeads of State and Government of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU).\nThe pressing need to adapt the United Nations\nsystem to the realities of the coming century should,\n7\n\n\nnonetheless, not obscure current acute needs associated with\nthe maintenance and promotion of peace in the world. In\nthis spirit, as the international community celebrates the\n100th anniversary of the Hague Peace Conference, I wish\nto say how much we welcome certain significant advances\ntowards peace in Africa.\nWe commend the Peace Agreement signed in Lom\u00e9\non 7 July 1999, thanks to the tireless efforts of the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\nand President Eyadema, in the context of the Sierra Leone\nconflict. We also commend the Abuja Peace Agreement and\nthe additional protocols in the context of the Guinea-Bissau\nconflict, thanks to the mediation of ECOWAS, under the\nchairmanship of Nigeria and Togo. Senegal strongly\nsupports the Governments of Sierra Leone and\nGuinea-Bissau in their efforts to build peace, to move\nresolutely towards national reconciliation and to implement\na policy of economic and social recovery in their countries.\nIn the same spirit, the signing last 10 July, in Lusaka, of\nthe Ceasefire Agreement among the principal parties to the\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is another\ncause for satisfaction and hope.\nI would also like to touch on the Lockerbie affair in\nthe hopes that the attitudes of the countries offer the\npossibility of a successful outcome.\nLast, but not least, my country expresses the warmest\nhope that the referendum process under way in Western\nSahara will be completed as early as possible in accordance\nwith the letter and spirit of the United Nations settlement\nplan adopted in 1991, as well as that of the Houston\nagreements, with full respect for the inalienable rights of all\ninhabitants of Western Sahara to participate in the\nreferendum. Allow me \u2014 and I think this is the right place\nto do so \u2014 to pay humble tribute to the memory of\nKing Hassan II.\nFinally, we hope that with the assistance of the great\nPowers and the cooperation of Indonesia, the situation in\nEast Timor will be brought under control by the United\nNations in order to ensure that the legitimate rights of the\nTimorese people prevail.\nThese significant breakthroughs should not make us\noverlook the situations in Angola and Somalia, or the\nconflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, where, in spite of the\npraiseworthy efforts of the OAU, there has been no serious\nsign of a final settlement. We must therefore continue our\nefforts because our only salvation lies in peace and in\nreconciliation.\nIn this sense, the evolution we have witnessed in the\nMiddle East gives us grounds for hope, the hope of\nfinally seeing a climate of complete trust and confidence\nand a sincere resumption of negotiations between Israelis\nand Palestinians and between Israel and the Arab\ncountries, with the rights of the peoples of the region\nrespected. My country, having presided over the\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of\nthe Palestinian People ever since its creation, reaffirms its\nsupport for and solidarity with the fraternal people of\nPalestine, the Palestinian Authority and its head, President\nYasser Arafat, which have been struggling now for more\nthan half a century for the creation of an independent and\nsovereign Palestinian State.\nWe solemnly reaffirm our support for the Bethlehem\n2000 project which has the objective of celebrating in\nBethlehem, on Palestinian soil, the second millennium\nsince the birth of Christ.\nFurthermore, the Israeli Government seems now to\nwant to work resolutely for peace. We urge it to continue\non this path. It is the only approach that responds to the\nsituation of the peoples of the subregion and to the\nhardships connected to the constraints imposed by\nglobalization.\nBefore concluding the subject of peace and security,\nI would like to state that my country supports any move\nto protect, safeguard and promote the rights of women\nand children. Its legal code has been modified to translate\nthat choice and those convictions into its own domestic\nlaw.\nI should like now to deal with the other dimension\nof peace: development cooperation. The United Nations,\nresponding once again to its mission to serve the peoples\nof the world, has, during the major conferences of the\ndecade, provided a framework for the definition of a\ncoherent set of programmes based on consensus. These\nprogrammes continue to inspire our common efforts\ntowards sustainable development.\nBut a careful review of the realities of this century\nnow coming to a close lead us to note that our\nachievements have been seriously undermined by the\ncontradictory tendencies that are a hallmark of humanity\nas it enters the third millennium. The lack of sufficient\nsustained growth in the world as a whole means that the\nglobal economy is facing great risks in the years to come.\nIndeed, because of a lack of sufficient growth, trade\ntensions are threatening to increase between\n8\n\n\nunderdeveloped countries and around them, and thus the lag\nin development can only increase, increasing the mob of\nuncontrolled emigration.\nIn addition, the gap that has been emerging over many\nyears is becoming increasingly clear. On the one hand we\nsee a small number of regions enjoying a high standard of\nliving or rapid development. In these countries the volume\nof trade, of interdependence and competition is increasing.\nOn the other hand, there is a group of countries \u2014 more\nnumerous and more populous \u2014 in which the standards of\nliving are poor and stagnating. They are for the most part\nnot involved in this ever-tighter network of commercial,\nfinancial and industrial exchanges. It is difficult for them to\nfind markets for their products, they suffer from capital\nflight, and businesses avoid setting up in these countries.\nHowever, over the last four years, the gross national\nproduct of Africa has grown at an annual average rate of\n4.5 per cent, resulting in a year-on-year increase in per\ncapita incomes. This is particularly remarkable because the\nprogress is attributable, above all, to internal adjustment\nefforts rather than to external phenomena. Nevertheless,\ndespite this macroeconomic performance, most African\ncountries do not possess the basic means for ensuring\nsustainable growth in a future of a kind that would enable\nthem to achieve their poverty-reduction objectives in\nkeeping with the medium-term goals set at the World\nSummit on Social Development in Copenhagen, because the\nrequired rate of growth is in the order of 8 per cent per\nyear.\nWhile it is true that the slow pace of integration of\nAfrican economies into the global economy has protected\nmost of these economies from the most violent shocks of\nrecent financial crises, the other side of the coin is that\nAfrica is not in a position to take full advantage of\nglobalization, which could increase the resources available\nfor productive investment. However, the developing\ncountries will not and cannot escape the effects of\nglobalization. We would therefore like to stress here \u2014 in\nparticular to our African partners in various initiatives such\nas the second Tokyo International Conference on African\nDevelopment (TICAD II), the United States/Africa forum\nand the negotiations between the European Union and\nAfrica, the Caribbean and the Pacific \u2014 the need to\nencourage the efforts that have been undertaken,\nparticularly in the elimination of the rigidities and\nimbalances that persist in the global economy.\nIn this regard, it might be worthwhile to reaffirm the\ncommitment that joins the developing and the developed\ncountries within the World Trade Organization and\ninvolves recognition of the need to make significant\nefforts so that the developing countries \u2014 the least-\ndeveloped in particular \u2014 are assured of a share in the\ngrowth in world trade in keeping with their development\nneeds.\nBut also, an examination of the way the principles\nof the multilateral trade system created at the Uruguay\nRound have been implemented reveals that commitments\nhave not been honoured: many obstacles impede access\nby products from the South in general, and from African\ncountries in particular, to Northern markets. Tariff\nbarriers, sliding-scale increases in duty rates, anti-\ndumping measures and animal and plant hygiene\nmeasures all represent acts and attitudes that impede trade\nand that affect our exports \u2014 and, thus, our trade\nsurpluses. That is why we venture to hope that the Seattle\nRound in November this year will take into greater\naccount not only the concerns of the developing countries\npositions by removing obstacles to their complete\nparticipation in world trade on the basis of the principles\nof justice and equity \u2014 particularly by working to reduce\nand eliminate the restrictive and distorting effects that the\naforementioned barriers, laws and measures have on\ntrade \u2014 but will also take into consideration social rights\nand sustainable development as inalienable elements in all\nworld trade.\nGiven the significant efforts by the African countries\nto achieve their recent economic performance levels, it\nwill be a Herculean task in terms of resources for them to\nachieve and maintain 8 per cent annual growth in their\ngross domestic product, in order to reduce poverty. We\nshould like to take this opportunity to welcome the new\ninternational climate for finding a solution to the African\ndebt crisis, particularly given that the total of this debt \u2014\nestimated at $350 billion in 1998 \u2014 represents 300 per\ncent of Africa's export earnings.\nTo this end, the proposals by a some G-8 countries,\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment and other organs of the United Nations, as\nwell as the recent studies by the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, are signs of a new realism, i.e., that most of\nthe debt cannot be repaid, that the debt is a major\nobstacle to balanced growth in African countries, and that\nthe current machinery for debt settlement, in particular the\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative,\nis too slow, too selective and imposes too many\nconditions. The principal members of the World Bank and\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) must accept the\n9\n\n\nidea, among others, of increasing the resources for the\nHIPC significantly by selling gold reserves.\nFurthermore, despite the pressures within the donor\ncommunity to reduce aid volumes, the economic\nperformance of Africa and the continent's commitment to\nstructural reform can be maintained only on the basis of\nexpansion, not contraction: increased development\nassistance is essential if we are to achieve the fundamental\nobjectives of development.\nFinally, despite the praiseworthy efforts of our various\ncountries to implement economic and financial reforms,\ninflows of direct foreign investment remain marginal.\nIn highlighting these major factors in the current\nglobal economic situation, I am far from wishing to shirk\nan enduring truth: sustainable development is the individual\nresponsibility of each State. The need for the international\ncommunity to find a more global and more judicious\nsolution to the debt problem in no way detracts from the\nneed for African countries to manage their economies\nbetter.\nThis attitude towards debt will be put into practice by\nthe definition and implementation of a high-quality\nmacroeconomic framework; by a significant intensification\nof efforts towards national thrift to accompany international\nfinancing; and by respect for the state of law, transparency,\ncontrol and responsibility in the management of public\naffairs. Thanks to the guidance and choices of Mr. Abdou\nDiouf, President of the Republic, my country subscribes to\nthese fundamental principles, on which the policy of the\nGovernment of Senegal is based.\nI have particularly stressed questions of peace and\ndevelopment because we live on a continent where peace is\nthreatened every day by underdevelopment and where\ndevelopment efforts are made precarious by the absence of\npeace. It is therefore important that efforts to consolidate\npeace in Africa be accompanied by extraordinary efforts to\nincrease the quality and quantity of development assistance\nin order significantly to reduce our debt and increase the\nflow of productive investment to our continent and to\nestablish, if not a Marshall Plan for Africa, at least a plan\nfor financing its development.\nMy delegation fervently hopes that, at the dawn of the\ntwenty-first century, the opportunity will be found to revive\ninternational cooperation for development in order to build\na more humane world. I am convinced that we have the\nmeans and the intelligence; we must also summon the\npolitical determination to do so. Thus, in order to improve\ninteraction, Africa for its part has agreed to promote\neconomic integration and to go one step further by\ncreating a union of African States. This was the sense of\nthe Syrte Declaration adopted on 9 September 1999 at the\nFourth Extraordinary Summit of heads of State of the\nOrganization of African Unity, convened on the happy\ninitiative of Mr. Al-Qadhafi.\nI am convinced that the wealthy nations are clearly\naware of their various and diverse responsibilities and that\nthey will not shirk their obligations. Indeed, should they\ndo so, God forbid, the eternal night of hideous poverty\nwill blanket almost the entire world. I express the genuine\nhope, willingly undertaken and profoundly shared by all\nnations, that we cannot remain indifferent to anything that\nis human. I am therefore convinced that, together, we can\nsave humanity.\n\n\n\n"

We congratulate the\nSecretary-General for his report (A/54/1) outlining the\nactivities of the Organization over the past year and\ncontaining his vision for its future work.\nJamaica welcomes the three States that this year have\njoined the membership of the United Nations: the Republic\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\nTonga. Their presence will enrich our deliberations as\nthey bring their particular experiences and perspectives to\ninfluence the direction and work of the Organization.\nTheir admission coincides with the holding of the special\nsession of the General Assembly on small island\ndeveloping States which over the last two days addressed\nthe particular vulnerabilities of these States, which merit\nspecial attention within the international community.\nThe three nations we welcome today are also linked\nto Jamaica through the Commonwealth of Nations. This\nyear the Commonwealth celebrates its fiftieth anniversary,\nand we salute its achievements in cooperation \u2014\nespecially in promoting the development objectives of its\nmembership \u2014 including the recent initiatives to address\nthe special problems of smaller States.\nThe widening of the gap between rich and poor and\nthe increasing marginalization of a large number of\ndeveloping countries within the world economic\nframework are urgent matters demanding the attention of\nthe international community. The reasons for these trends\nare well-known: superior endowments of natural\nresources; early advantages in modernizing production\nprocesses; high levels of capital accumulation and\ntechnological development \u2014 all have helped consolidate\nthe dominance of the developed countries in world\nproduction and trade. Countries which started later in the\nday will not find it easy to close the gap.\n\n\nAnd it is not true that the developing countries have\nonly themselves to blame. Most of us have implemented\nprogrammes of structural adjustment and stabilization\npolicies, but we have found that the current orthodoxy of\nfree markets and a development model based on\nliberalization, deregulation and privatization is not providing\nthe promised benefits in trade and investment flows. There\nis evident need to review the prescriptions and to promote\na development policy which takes into greater account the\nspecific socio-economic context of developing countries and\nto devise more equitable arrangements in international\neconomic relations.\nIn an interdependent world, the human dimension of\nthe development equation, especially the growing incidence\nof poverty and all its manifestations, must continue to be a\nmatter of concern to the entire global community. It is\ntherefore essential that we seek to establish a better\nframework for development cooperation and to implement\nan agenda for development as a matter of priority within\nthe United Nations system.\nCurrently, what we are seeing is a withering of interest\nand diminished commitment on the issue of cooperation for\ndevelopment and a hardening of attitudes in an atmosphere\nwhich preaches competitiveness and the survival of the\nfittest. It is clear to us that special arrangements are needed,\nnot only in relation to special categories of countries, but\nalso in relation to commodities, where serious problems\nwould result from the rigorous application of the dogma of\nfree trade. Regrettably, even where such special\narrangements exist they are under threat.\nThe challenge to the banana regime established within\nthe framework of the Lom\u00e9 Convention and the ruling of\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) panel, which has\nnow led to negotiations for an amended regime, sends a\nmessage which is particularly discouraging and signals the\nindifference of some countries to the plight of others. The\nend result is not yet determined, but at this time the\neconomies of some Caribbean States face a danger not just\nto their prospects for economic stability and growth, but to\ntheir very survival. Many appeals have been made which\nhave gone unheeded. More than anything else, the banana\ncontroversy has signified the extent to which the interests\nof small producers are at the mercy of those in a position\nof dominance in the world economy and world trade.\nAnother discouraging trend is the diminished\nsignificance and reduced contributions of donor countries in\nthe area of development cooperation. At a time of the\nincreasing incidence of poverty and a looming threat of\nmarginalization, levels of official development assistance\nhave been steadily decreasing at both the bilateral and the\nmultilateral levels. In the case of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), technical assistance\nhas been shrinking, especially over the last five years. In\n1994, contributions to UNDP were in the region of $1.1\nbillion. This has steadily declined to the current level for\nthis year of $718 million.\nWe have been supporting initiatives for reform in\norder to promote better coordination and greater\nefficiency and cost-effectiveness in the delivery of\ntechnical assistance in the operational activities of the\nUnited Nations. What we have seen, however, is that the\nreform process seems more directed at generating cost\nsavings and achieving a pooling of resources without\nincreasing the quantum of funding available for\ndevelopment cooperation under the auspices of the United\nNations. The process under way is one of contraction of\nUnited Nations-related development activities at the\ncountry level and a withering-away of the role of the\nUnited Nations in an area of critical importance for\ndeveloping countries. The reduced impact of the United\nNations at the country level is already significant and\ncomes at a time when the needs are greater than ever.\nWe call for a new commitment to development\ncooperation, a new global partnership between the\ndeveloped and the developing countries and a new\ndialogue to review the policies and principles directing\ninternational economic relations, and for a new\ndispensation with regard to policy prescriptions affecting\nthe development process. Without this, developing\ncountries will be engulfed in the perils of globalization\nwith consequences not just for economic welfare, but for\nthe viability of political structures and social stability.\nThere are also other, more insidious dimensions of\nglobalization, especially those which impinge on the\nsecurity of States, which we must consider. Within the\ngrowing internationalization of markets facilitated by\nimproved technology and policies of liberalization, the\nspectre of transnational crime has grown to significant\nproportions, especially in the illicit trade in narcotics and\nsmall arms. Together, these instruments of death and\ndestruction represent a significant danger to the internal\nsecurity of many countries, fostering criminal activities\nwhich serve to destabilize and corrupt the social order, to\nundermine democratic institutions and to increase\nlawlessness.\n2\n\n\nWe believe that this growing trade in weapons, which\npromotes organized crime, terrorist activities and drug\ntrafficking, requires the urgent attention of the international\ncommunity. Jamaica therefore welcomes the arrangements\nfor the holding of the first international conference on small\narms, which is to take place in the year 2000. We look\nforward to this as a good opportunity to develop a\nprogramme for implementation by Member States to control\nthe scale and distribution of these weapons.\nOn reviewing the broader issue of international\nsecurity, we have to note developments which give rise to\nconcern and anxiety about the future of the world order and\nthe role of the United Nations. The Organization should\nbecome engaged wherever international peace is threatened\nand where conflicts break out. Although the danger of\nglobal conflict arising from ideological confrontation has\nnow, in large measure, receded, the world is still full of\nthreats to peace.\nWars continue to be waged at the regional level,\nprimarily as a result of regional rivalries and unresolved\nterritorial disputes. At the national level, ethnic strife and\npolitical divisiveness have continued to fuel internal\nconflict, leading to heavy loss of life and economic\ndisruption and affecting regional stability from the\nspill-over of refugees to neighbouring States.\nWe endorse the Secretary-General's strategy of quiet\ndiplomacy and urge him to use his influence wherever\npossible to forestall the outbreak of conflict and to promote\npeace and reconciliation between disputing parties. In\naccordance with the principles of national sovereignty, he\nwill need the cooperation and support of Member States in\nhis efforts for the maintenance of peace, as delicate\nproblems can arise in relation to any process of diplomatic\nintervention with respect to the role to be undertaken by the\nUnited Nations and appropriate regional organizations.\nDuring the past year, events in the Balkans have raised\nprofound questions about the principle of intervention, the\nuse of force, the scale of military enforcement and the role\nof the Security Council. The debate on these questions has\nrevealed differing perspectives, elements of consensus and\nvarying positions on the applicable principles of\ninternational law. In recent times, we have witnessed\natrocities committed as a result of the practice of ethnic\ncleansing as communities rise up against each other to\nsettle old grievances. We all must continue to condemn\nthese practices and understand the need for some kind of\naction to halt such excesses which violate international\nhumanitarian norms.\nHowever, the principles of international law affecting\nthe sovereignty of States and the use of force should not\nbe brushed aside. We believe in the adoption of an\napproach which has the confidence of the international\ncommunity whereby diplomatic and any necessary\nenforcement action is taken or authorized by the\nmultilateral institutions entrusted with safeguarding\ninternational peace and security. The Security Council has\nthe primary responsibility. It should not be ignored and\ndisregarded in favour of unilateral action on the part of\nany State or group of States.\nWhile the situation in the Balkans has dominated\ninternational attention over the past year, more attention\nshould be given to the situation in Africa, where even\nmore serious problems have arisen involving ethnic strife\nand political turmoil, affecting neighbouring States and\ncreating humanitarian emergencies. As the\nSecretary-General has observed in his report, too little\nattention has been given to the conflicts arising in Africa\ndespite the enormous toll in loss of life and in disruption\nand suffering resulting from armed insurgencies and\ninter-State conflict. However, we are encouraged by the\nprocess taking place in the West African region affecting\nLiberia and Sierra Leone. We must pay tribute to the\nwork of the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), which has shouldered the burden of peace-\nbuilding in these two States so battered by civil conflict.\nWe also note with appreciation the efforts of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) in regard to the\nsituation in the Great Lakes region and hope that the\nLusaka Agreement will form the basis for reconciliation\nand peace. The situation in Angola remains a tragic one\nfor the country, and the international community should\nremain united in support of measures taken against the\nUNITA insurgency and to bring an end to the nightmare\nwhich has for so long impeded the progress of that\ncountry.\nWe are distressed by the continuing problems in the\nHorn of Africa. We continue to support regional efforts\ntowards peacemaking between Ethiopia and Eritrea and\nwelcome the OAU framework agreement which has been\nworked out to assist the parties to reach a settlement. We\nurge the Secretary-General to continue to maintain close\ncontact with the parties in all the areas of tension, with\nthe aim of promoting peace and stability, and to foster a\nspirit of reconciliation so that African States may be able\nto concentrate their efforts in confronting the critical\nchallenges of economic and social development.\n3\n\n\nIn the Middle East, while the situation still remains\ntroublesome, there are some signs of renewed hope with the\nrevival of the peace process and the emergence of a more\npositive climate for making progress towards a settlement.\nWe welcome the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh\nMemorandum earlier this month and urge the parties to\nmove towards accommodation, to seek to realize the\nlegitimate rights of all parties as the basis for a just and\ndurable peace. The challenge is formidable and the solution\nwill require statesmanship and courage.\nIn South-East Asia the outbreak of violence in East\nTimor is a matter which has caused deep concern. As there\nis an obvious need for ensuring the safety of the inhabitants\nof the territory, we fully support the deployment of the\ninternational force which is now in the territory to maintain\norder. It is necessary now to contemplate the next step,\nwhich will be to devise arrangements for the political future\nof the territory.\nIn our area of Latin America and the Caribbean there\nremain a number of unresolved territorial disputes but our\nexpectation is that States in our region will use available\nmechanisms to resolve such disputes by peaceful means. In\nthe Caribbean our efforts are directed towards developing\ngreater integration both within the Caribbean Community\nand within the wider ambit of the Association of Caribbean\nStates, ACS. This is part of our regional effort towards\nestablishing a regime of peace and cooperation in the\nCaribbean Sea. In this regard, I should express our ongoing\nconcern over the remaining remnants of cold war politics in\nour region. The continuation of the embargo against Cuba\nis a source of tension and carries the risk of conflict, which\nis particularly troubling for neighbouring States. In the\nspirit of the friendly relations we enjoy with Cuba and the\nUnited States, we call for dialogue, the normalization of\nrelations and an end to policies of confrontation and\nexclusion.\nSmall countries have an important interest in ensuring\nthat peace and stability is a permanent feature of the world\norder. In the absence of military power we depend on\ndiplomacy and on the United Nations and its machinery and\ninternational adherence to its principles to safeguard and\nprotect those who are militarily weak. It is in our interest\nto seek to strengthen and uphold all the multilateral\ninstitutions dedicated to this effort. The Security Council,\nwhich has such an important role in this structure, should\nbe given the fullest support in meeting its responsibilities.\nThis is best achieved through the democratic participation\nof the United Nations membership in the work of the\nCouncil, which serves to strengthen its effectiveness and to\ngive it greater credibility within the international system.\nJamaica supports that process and aspires for\nmembership of the Council for a two-year period\nbeginning next year. We do so out of a motivation to\nmake our contribution as a small State in the management\nof international peace and security. We are driven by a\nstrong commitment to multilateralism and to upholding\nthe principles of the Charter and by a determination to\nexercise a careful and balanced judgement in relation to\nall issues affecting peace and security which may come\nbefore us. It will be our goal to assist the Security\nCouncil to work effectively and to act decisively. We will\nseek to involve the broader membership in its\nconsultations and to influence the discharge of the\nCouncil's responsibilities with fairness and with full\nrespect for the legitimate interests of all parties, within\nthe broader interest of international peace and security.\nThe work of the United Nations in the area of\nhumanitarian relief has always been an important part of\nits operations, and this is the area in which its work has\nhad the most direct impact and practical meaning at the\nlevel of the people. This is particularly so in the delivery\nof emergency relief in natural disasters. The increase in\nthe scale and intensity of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods\nand famine in recent times has increased the demands on\nthe system, and there is an obvious need to maintain\ncapability and readiness in the relevant agencies. At the\nsame time, we should support the various initiatives for\ndisaster prevention, including the enforcement of stricter\nbuilding codes, improved drainage systems, the exchange\nof scientific knowledge, increased monitoring and the use\nof early-warning systems to protect ourselves and mitigate\nthe damage.\nMuch more can be done to avert disasters in those\nareas where members have greater control and power.\nMan-made disasters create a tragic problem of refugees,\nwhich otherwise is often the result of war, persecution or\npolitical turmoil. The tragic plight of refugees uprooted\nfrom their homes and forced to flee is a sad and\ndisturbing picture, and even more so for the neighbouring\nStates, which are often poor countries that do not have\nthe means to handle heavy inflows.\nAs we have seen from the Secretary-General's report,\none of the distressing practices in recent conflicts has\nbeen the deliberate targeting of civilians and humanitarian\nworkers. This unacceptable flouting of humanitarian\nnorms is a matter of serious concern for us and indicates\nthe need for further elaboration of principles of\ninternational humanitarian law applicable in time of war.\n4\n\n\nOur review of the state of the world in the economic,\npolitical and humanitarian dimensions suggests the need for\ngreater effort in building political commitment and\ninvesting resources for achieving common goals. Too many\nof the old problems remain unresolved, and our unity of\npurpose is too often compromised by political differences\nand considerations of narrow economic interests. At a time\nof increasing globalization, the reality of interdependence\nshould be leading us in the other direction \u2014 towards\nmutual respect, tolerance, understanding and partnership in\na world of diversity, for these are the true foundations of\nmultilateralism.\nAs we close this century and approach the new\nmillennium, we should do so in the hope of reaching\ngreater achievements by acting in concert to uphold our\nideals of humanity and to fight the common enemies of\nmankind: war, poverty, human suffering and injustice. This\nshould be our firm resolve.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am\npleased to convey to you, Sir, the assurances of my\ngreatest esteem on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at this session. On behalf of the\nGovernment of the Republic of Yemen, I congratulate\nyou on your assumption of this high office. We are\ncertain that under your distinguished and capable\n21\n\n\nleadership the work of the General Assembly will be\ncrowned with success.\nThe democratic process in our world today is\nundergoing real expansion and is receiving the attention of\nall nations, whatever their creeds, races or regimes. It is\nfurther consolidated by being increasingly linked to human\nrights, in particular the rights to sustainable development,\nglobal knowledge, equality, justice, peace and stability.\nThe Republic of Yemen has linked itself in complete\nunity to the democratic process and has made it a\ncontinuous process towards comprehensive development.\nBoth State and society are tirelessly struggling to make\ndemocracy in our country a firm and established system,\nevolving daily in order to ultimately form an integral\nsystem for the conduct of political, social and economic\nlife.\nOn 23 September 1999, the Republic of Yemen, for\nthe first time in its history, held free and direct elections for\nthe presidency of the Republic, reflecting the credibility of\nthe country\u2019s political regime and its constitutional\ncommitments requiring the holding of direct elections for\nthe presidency for five-year terms. This is proof that\ndemocracy in Yemen has become established as a firmly\nrooted principle and a unique and unrestricted option for\nachieving a peaceful change of government respect for\nhuman rights, and for enhancing people\u2019s role and\nparticipation in sustainable development and cultural\nprogress.\nDemocracy in Yemen appeared in its highest form in\nthe direct presidential elections, which reflected the free\nwill of the people and the need for development and\nstability. The results of the direct secret ballot showed\nparticipation in all parts of the country by 66 per cent of all\nregistered voters. The President-elect of the Republic of\nYemen for the forthcoming term, Ali Abdullah Saleh,\nobtained 96 per cent of the votes. A new term and a new\nera will begin on 3 October this year, when the directly\nelected President will take the constitutional oath before the\nYemeni Chamber of Deputies.\nThe wish of the people to achieve democratic progress\nreflects their need for stability and for an end to states of\nemergency in their lives. This goes hand in hand with their\ndesire for a future that embodies radical change in the\neconomic, social and cultural fields. It also requires serious\npractical action on the part of Governments and\ninternational and regional organizations to support\ndevelopment in emerging democracies, and to supply\nthem with means of growth and the transfer of\nknow-how. Sustainable development would then\naccompany and safeguard democracy, and the linkage\nbetween development and democracy would be a\ncondition for progress and a motivating force for\ncooperation and human integration among all nations of\nthe world.\nSixteen States convened the Forum on Emerging\nDemocracies in Sana\u2019a, the capital of Yemen, and issued\nan important instrument called the Sana\u2019a Declaration,\nwith a view to intensifying the concepts, framework and\napplications of the democratic process in real life, and to\nachieving broad popular participation and the affirmation\nof human rights in those countries.\nI wish to reaffirm here the announcement of\nPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh that the Republic of Yemen\nwould like to host the International Conference of New or\nRestored Democracies to be held in Asia in 2003.\nOur world today is witnessing profound changes that\nessentially represent the remnants of the cold war and that\nare, at the same time, new harbingers of hope that\nforthcoming changes will be in the interest of peace,\neconomic progress and development, and that the people,\npolitical leaders and intellectuals have absorbed the\nlessons to be derived from ideological and racial conflicts,\npower politics and their tragic clashes. The only way to\nprepare the way for peace and stability is through the\nlanguage of dialogue, the rule of law, stable relationships\nand the absence of fear, doubt and uncertainty. Dialogue\nwill for ever remain the only way to extinguish fires,\nspread the spirit of tolerance and coexistence and promote\nthe values of cooperation, solidarity and integration\namong all active forces and actors in the cause of peace.\nThe position of the Republic of Yemen regarding\nworld events consists of our commitment to the principles\nof peaceful coexistence, non-interference in the internal\naffairs of other States, non-use or threat of force in the\nsettlement of disputes and peaceful negotiations and\ndialogue in the settlement of all issues, including border\nissues between States on a no-fault basis.\nAs a member of the international family and an\nactive participant in regional organizations, Yemen\nunequivocally affirms its sincere desire to contribute to\nthe maintenance of security and stability in the Arabian\n22\n\n\nPeninsula, the Gulf, the Red Sea, the Horn of Africa and\nthe Indian Ocean. The Republic of Yemen calls upon all\nStates and peoples to continue their sincere and diligent\nefforts to achieve tangible progress in the ongoing dialogue\nbetween all parties concerned in these regions. The desired\ngoal is to arrive at mutual understanding, balanced\nrelationships and firm bases for the achievement of\ncoexistence and harmony among States and peoples, the\nconsolidation of peace and the securing of the necessary\nconditions for development and cooperation.\nThe Republic of Yemen demonstrated in practice the\ncredibility of its positions of principle, its respect for\ninternational law, its wholehearted desire for stability and\npeace in the region and its awareness of the importance of\nsuch peace for international economic, commercial and\nmaritime relations. Yemen proved that when it accepted\nunconditionally the decision of the arbitration tribunal\nregarding the sovereignty dispute over the Yemeni island of\nGreater Hanish, which lies in the Red Sea between Yemen\nand the neighbouring State of Eritrea, thereby furnishing a\nprime example of how peaceful solutions to differences and\ndisputes between States can be achieved by international\narbitration.\nWe hope that the island-related dispute between the\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran will\nbe settled peacefully in accordance with internationally\nrecognized principles and rules relating to the settlement of\nsuch disputes, and in keeping with the desire to achieve\npeace, stability, development and cooperation in our region.\nIn accordance with these firm premises and guidelines,\nthe Republic of Yemen will remain faithful to the principle\nof the rejection of violence and the combating of terrorism\nin all its forms, whatever its motives and sources, and\nregardless of whether it involves individuals, groups or\nStates. Our country is combating this phenomenon with all\nits might. It believes that terrorism has become a worldwide\nphenomenon meriting investigation at the international level\nand the creation of integrated mechanisms and rules to\ncontain it and to counter its effects, with a view to\nultimately eliminating it.\nThe Assembly might agree with me that there is now\nan urgent need to review the policy of imposing\ninternational embargoes and sanctions. Experience has\ndemonstrated their ineffectiveness in achieving the goals\nand purposes for which they were adopted and the\ntremendous harm they have visited upon people, not\npolitical regimes, especially the middle and lower strata of\nthe population and vulnerable social sectors such as\nchildren, women and the elderly.\nThe situation in Iraq attests to this. The need for a\ntotal and final lifting of the sanctions imposed on the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya has also become self-evident,\nafter recent developments and the Libyan leadership\u2019s\ncompliance with the Security Council resolutions\nconcerning the Lockerbie affair. We also call for the\nlifting of the sanctions imposed on the Sudan, which is\ncurrently holding an internal democratic dialogue for the\nachievement of unity and national concord.\nWars and clashes result only in human tragedies, in\nthe form of displacement, imprisonment, forcible\ndetention and flight from war zones in search of refuge\nand safe havens. In this context, my country emphasizes\nthe need to deal in a humane and civilized manner with\nthe question of prisoners, the missing and those who are\nforced into hiding as a result of wars, conflicts and\nclashes of all kinds.\nIn this regard, we have great hope that the issue of\nKuwaiti and other prisoners will meet with a humane and\nobjective solution that will help to create an atmosphere\nconducive to reconciliation and to the achievement of\nharmony, peace and stability in the region.\nIt is known that societies that host refugees fleeing\nfrom areas of war and oppression bear heavy burdens and\nsustain tragic consequences, and that their peoples face\nserious environmental and health hazards. Those societies\nalso face considerable economic and financial hardships\nas a result of hosting refugees. It is indeed regrettable that\nthe humanitarian work done for refugees by certain\ncountries should have disastrous, tragic results for those\ncountries. This is what is happening today in the Republic\nof Yemen as a result of the steadily increasing daily\ninflux of refugees from the Horn of Africa, which is\nablaze with regional and civil wars and local dissension.\nThe Republic of Yemen calls upon the international\ncommunity to assume its responsibility with regard to this\nhumanitarian issue, which weighs heavily on the Yemeni\nState and society, by increased efforts on the part of the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees and a more concerted international alliance\namong all donor countries able to provide emergency and\nlong-term assistance. Allowing the persistence of such\ninhumane phenomena and conditions reflects a tragic\ndeterioration in human rights and an alarming regression\nin the values of civilized nations. We undoubtedly need\n23\n\n\nto develop mechanisms and devise the necessary means for\ncoping with such situations. This is the very essence and\nsubstance of the work of the United Nations.\nAt the same time, we wish to emphasize that the time\nhas come for renewed solidarity and efforts on the part of\nthe United Nations, the international community and all\nparties concerned with a view to finding practical solutions\nto the situation in Somalia that will help restore the unity\nand territorial integrity of Somalia and bring security and\nstability to the region.\nThe peoples of the world seek a peace that is based on\njustice, equality, respect for human rights and the absence\nof tyranny, abuse and double standards. Accordingly, the\nRepublic of Yemen, which has supported and given its\nblessing to the efforts towards a peaceful settlement in the\nMiddle East, believes that a comprehensive, just and lasting\npeace must be based on the restoration of all legitimate\nrights to the Palestinian people, first and foremost of which\nis its right to establish its independent State on its national\nsoil, with Jerusalem as its capital, and likewise the\nrestoration of Israeli-occupied territories to the Syrian and\nthe Lebanese peoples.\nAt a time when we are positively and with renewed\noptimism discussing the peace process in the region, Israel\nmust realize that a just, comprehensive and lasting peace\nis a genuine goal for the people of the area. Furthermore,\nit is a regional, international humanitarian goal that will\nhelp open a new page in the life and relations between\npeoples and help end the tragedies of the past. It will\nhopefully assist in overcoming all rancour and grudges and\nin providing opportunities for tolerance between creeds,\ncultures and races. All this would constitute a genuine\nstarting point for stability, trust and mutual understanding\namong the States and peoples of the region.\nAs we approach the end of the second millennium, we\nare confronted with a reality exemplified in the increased\nspeed and movement of political, economic and social\nvariables, whose ramifications and relationship with other\ncontrasting factors are becoming increasingly more\ncomplex, in terms of time and space.\nWe are all therefore called upon to cooperate and to\nrespond responsibly for the creation of a healthy climate for\nthe building of a new world order based on justice, freedom\nof choice, tolerance and genuine partnership in all\ngovernmental and non-governmental activities at the\nregional and international levels. The ultimate goal is to\npermanently ensure a balance of interests and a sense of\ninvolvement in all that is humane and noble and, in\nconcrete terms, in a productive and useful life for all\nmankind.\nSince one of our primary goals is the reform of the\nUnited Nations and, in particular, the Security Council\nand the international institutions, we are giving this goal\nour full attention and support. At the same time, we\ncommend the Secretary-General for the initiatives and\nmeasures he has taken towards the goal of reforming the\nUnited Nations, its mechanisms and its methods of work,\nwhich would broaden democratic practices and achieve\ntransparency of work and effectiveness of participation.\nIn this context, we reaffirm our welcome and\nsupport for the Open-ended Working Group established\nfor this purpose. We call for the continuation and early\ncompletion of its work, taking into full account the\nimportance of a full understanding of the essential\nvariables in international relations in recent years.\nI reiterate my esteem for the President of the\nAssembly, and I thank all those participating in the\ncurrent session. May peace and God\u2019s mercy and blessing\nbe upon you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI join other delegations in\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly. Your experience and\ndiplomatic skills will undoubtedly guide us successfully\nthrough the fifty-fourth session. I would also like to express\nour gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, who\ndisplayed such competence and ability in conducting our\nwork during the past year. We would also like to express\nour deep sense of satisfaction and gratitude to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his incessant\ndiplomatic intervention to help resolve conflicts in various\nparts of the globe.\nMay I also take this opportunity to offer our most\nsincere congratulations to the three new Members of this\nOrganization, the Republic of Nauru, the Kingdom of\nTonga and the Republic of Kiribati. I should also add that\nMalta already cooperates closely with these three new\nMembers through our joint membership of the\nCommonwealth.\nFor over half a century the United Nations has been\ninstrumental in fostering a culture of partnership among\nStates. The foundation and survival of a universal\nOrganization entrusted with the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and the promotion of\nsocial justice, freedom and human rights is an\nunprecedented achievement in the history of mankind.\nUndeniably, great strides have been made by this\nOrganization in helping forge swords into ploughshares\nthrough enhanced cooperation between its Member States.\nWe have striven individually and collectively, painfully at\ntimes and imperfectly at others, towards a process of\npolitical, social, economic and technological evolution.\nGlobalization has become a central concept in the way we\nview the world. Interdependence has consequently become\nthe norm.\nOvershadowing such progress, however, are the\narmed conflicts, economic imbalances and social\ndislocation that we still face. Events in our days show that\ngross violations of human rights and disregard for\nhumanitarian principles continue to plague us. The\natrocities that human beings are capable of inflicting on\none another defy the noble aspirations that inspired the\nbirth of our Organization. The irony of such a situation\ncannot be lost on anyone. Even less can the tragedy of\nsuch a predicament be ignored.\nVicious armed conflicts, such as those we have been\nwitnessing in parts of Africa and in the Balkans, not to\nmention the atrocities recently perpetrated in East Timor,\ncontinue to destroy an untold number of lives, disrupting\nentire societies, traumatizing tens of thousands of men,\nwomen and children and diverting precious resources\naway from development.\nThe international community cannot afford to be\ncomplacent about the humanitarian crises that we are\n23\n\n\nwitnessing today. It is incumbent on each of us to rise to\nthe challenge of securing a world free from deprivation,\nfear and oppression. Strengthening the United Nations to\nbecome better equipped to address contemporary needs and\nto meet the challenges of the future thus becomes more\nurgent. The role of the United Nations in the promotion of\npreventive diplomacy must increasingly assume particular\nimportance if, collectively, we are to defuse and resolve\npotentially destructive situations.\nPeace and security are intimately intertwined with\ndevelopment and prosperity. Too often, lack of development\nprecipitates conflict. Promoting development helps prevent\nwars and acts as a means of creating channels of\ncooperation within, as well as among, nations. This was the\nessential message emanating from the International\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo and\nthe Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development. It\nwas a commitment to consolidate the partnership of nations,\na commitment restated and underscored during the review\nconferences held within the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nDemocracy, good governance, respect for human\nrights and the rule of law are essential foundations for the\nattainment of peace and development and for upholding the\ndignity of the human person. Where these are absent, our\nefforts to implement post-conflict peace-building,\nrehabilitation and reconstruction programmes in war-torn\nareas must be intensified. The importance of cementing\nceasefire agreements with stable political and economic\ninstitutions, while simultaneously creating partnerships\nbetween Governments and civil society, cannot be\nunderestimated.\nOne of the main thrusts of the work of the United\nNations has been aimed at the equitable and long-lasting\nreform of the Security Council, especially given the\nexpanded membership of the Organization. It is in the\ninterest of all to find a solution to the Council's reform that\nwill ensure its smooth functioning, transparency and\nenhanced relevance.\nWhile the root causes of conflicts are complex, the\nillegal proliferation and trafficking of weapons clearly has\na destabilizing effect on society and only serves to prolong\nconflicts. Increased global efforts are warranted to monitor\nand control the illicit transfer of small arms and light\nweapons. The emerging global consensus on the issue is\nencouraging. Malta looks forward to the eventual convening\nof an international conference on the illicit arms trade in all\nits aspects. Addressing this disruptive phenomenon becomes\nmore urgent when it is compounded by its complex\nlinkages with other equally destabilizing activities, such\nas international crime, drug trafficking and terrorism.\nResponsibility for the plight of peoples cannot be\nshirked by national Governments. Accountability by\nindividuals for their actions must be enforced. The\ninternational community's outrage at shocking, massive\nviolations of human rights has found expression in the\nStatute of the International Criminal Court. The adoption\nof the Statute last year in Rome constituted an important\nmilestone. It is Malta's hope that it is only a matter of\ntime before the Court begins to function.\nHeinous crimes against humanity are an affront to\nthe intrinsic values of civilization. They cannot be\ntolerated. Likewise, the shameless disregard for human\nrights that have been enshrined in various international\ninstruments cannot go unheeded. Effective protection of\nthose rights should not be allowed to fall victim to\nexcuses of national sovereignty. This is even more\ncompelling given that only last year we commemorated\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\nThe international community has made great\nheadway in the way it deals with the world's resources to\nsafeguard the heritage of future generations. Since it\njoined the Organization 35 years ago, Malta has played an\nactive role in this field. It would be remiss of me today\nnot to pay tribute to Professor Arvid Pardo, Malta's first\nPermanent Representative to the United Nations, who\nsadly passed away recently. His diplomatic skills and\njudicious acumen, as well as his vision, were instrumental\nin developing the concept of the common heritage of\nmankind. This concept, so ably launched by Professor\nPardo on behalf of the Malta Government, was the key to\nthe process that eventually led to the adoption of the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nIn a similar vein, during the last session, my\ndelegation was active in promoting the idea of a better\nand more substantive discussion on oceans through\nimproved coordination among the various organs dealing\nwith the subject. In this regard, it is our hope that a\nworkable solution to this issue will be reached.\nMalta's readiness to play an active and positive role\nin the furtherance of international peace and cooperation\nhas led to the reactivation of our application for\nmembership in the European Union. In September of last\nyear, following elections and a change in Government,\n24\n\n\nMalta reactivated its application, which had been frozen for\nthe previous two years. The application had been submitted\nin 1990, and by the time it was suspended in 1996, Malta\nwas widely considered as a prime candidate for early\nmembership of the European Union. The 1998 reactivation\nwas therefore generally seen, both within and outside Malta,\nas a resumption of unfinished business, rather than as a new\nbeginning.\nThe contractual basis of our present relationship with\nthe Union remains the Association Agreement signed in\n1970, as subsequently amplified and amended. Until it is\nsuperseded by membership, we expect this Agreement to\nremain in force and to continue to be complemented by\nadditional measures in both traditional and new areas of\ncooperation, including the areas of justice and home affairs.\nWe see our objective to join the European Union as\nthe most appropriate response to Malta's historical and\ncultural heritage, as well as to the economic, social and\nsecurity requirements of our national development. The\naccession negotiations that we hope to be conducting in the\nnear future will be guided by this perception. The outcome\nof these negotiations will then be submitted to the\njudgement of the Maltese people in a referendum.\nSince independence in 1964, Malta has been\nsteadfastly committed to the critical role that multilateral\ncooperation, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter, is\nincreasingly playing in the endeavour towards progress,\njustice and stability within and among nations.\nOver the years, notwithstanding constraints imposed\nby its size and resources, Malta has engaged itself in many\nUnited Nations-sponsored initiatives related to the\npromotion of human rights, economic and social\ndevelopment, disarmament, the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes and safeguarding the environment. As members of\nthe European Union, we expect to find increased\nopportunities, as well as to benefit from an increased\ncapacity to pursue these and related objectives at both the\nglobal and regional level.\nThis certainty springs from our conviction that the\nEuropean Union is at the forefront of endeavours to\nstrengthen international understanding and cooperation. Its\npolicies towards enlargement and regional cooperation, the\npromotion of economic and social development, conflict\nresolution and peacekeeping provide a constant gauge of its\nrelevance in this regard.\nMalta views the enlargement of the European Union\nnot so much as an option but rather as a fulfilment. Each\nenlargement step constitutes fulfilment for the Union\nitself, and that contributes to the completion of an\nhistorical process that reverses the age-old conflict and\nthe fragmentation of the European continent. It is also a\nfulfilment for a candidate country like Malta in that\nmembership assures it of a continuing role in the political\nand economic life of the continent where most of its\nhistory and culture were, and continue to be, forged.\nThe unfolding of events in Europe over the last\ndecade highlights this fundamental dimension of the\nUnion's enlargement process. As they emerged from\npolitical suppression and economic stagnation, the Central\nand Eastern European States immediately defined their\nnational aspirations within the framework of European\nintegration. For its part, the European Union recognized\nthat the objective of membership for all the Central and\nEastern European States was a vital ingredient in\nsustaining stability and progress throughout the continent\nin the shorter and the longer term. Significantly, in spite\nof the complexities involved, there is already a marked\nreadiness by the Union to contribute both assistance and\nfunds towards reconstruction in the Balkans while\nsimultaneously pursuing enlargement through Central and\nEastern Europe and with the two Mediterranean\nislands \u2014 Malta and Cyprus.\nCooperation with the neighbouring regions and\naround the world is, for the European Union, an\nindispensable accompaniment to enlargement. Be it in the\ntraditional transatlantic domain, on the still-evolving\nEastern border or on its historical southern, Mediterranean\nborder, the Union provides a constant and credible\nreassurance of the outward-looking dimension embedded\nin the European integration process.\nStraddling, as it does, both the horizontal and the\nvertical axes of the Mediterranean, Malta attaches\nparticular importance to the promotion of cooperation in\nthis area. It is as much for regional and global\ngeostrategic reasons as it is in our own national security\ninterests for the Mediterranean to be considered as a\nmeeting place, rather than as a dividing line between\npeoples and cultures.\nOf particular importance to us is the Euro-\nMediterranean partnership launched in 1995 by the\nEuropean Union in Barcelona. This partnership provides\nstrong support for our belief that membership in the\nUnion will reinforce Malta's traditional role in the\n25\n\n\npromotion of Mediterranean security and cooperation. One\nof Malta's contributions to the Union will be the added\ninsight into, and the commitment to, Euro-Mediterranean\ncooperation that Malta will bring with it. At the regional\nlevel, as much as at the broader international level, Malta\nsees its membership in the European Union as an element\nof further involvement in the process of multilateral\ncooperation for peace and prosperity in the Mediterranean.\nMalta has welcomed, and is wholeheartedly involved\nin, the Barcelona partnership because of its intrinsic merits\nin promoting a concrete and effective programme of\ncooperation in the Mediterranean. In this regard, at their\nlast meeting in Stuttgart, the foreign ministers of the Euro-\nMediterranean partnership agreed to reinforce\ncomprehensive stability in the region through the conclusion\nof the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and\nStability \u2014 an initiative in which Malta has been active\nfrom the outset and which it is keen to see take shape.\nDespite the many challenges faced by the\nMediterranean, it is our firm view that lasting solutions may\nbe found. We sincerely believe that an early settlement of\nthe Cyprus question along the lines of the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions can be achieved.\nMalta has been encouraged by the positive overtures\nsignalled by the major protagonists in the Middle East\npeace process in recent months. What appeared to be for so\nlong an intractable problem has been slowly but steadily\nunfolding towards the path of reconciliation and peace.\nTrue cooperation within the region demands that the spirit\nof reconciliation prevail. Recent events \u2014 most especially\nthe Wye II Agreement \u2014 carried forward by all those\nworking for peace in the region bode well for continued\ndialogue and cooperation between the parties of the region.\nIt is in this light that we hail the progress achieved on\nthe question of Lockerbie and the resulting suspension of\nsanctions on Libya. The satisfaction expressed recently by\nboth the Security Council and the European Union General\nAffairs Council in respect of positive developments in\nLibya also augurs well for the inclusion of Libya in the\nEuro-Mediterranean process as soon as it adopts the\nBarcelona acquis. We welcome this development.\nMay all these efforts lead to widespread cooperation\nfor the Mediterranean as a whole, bringing peace and\nprosperity for its people in the years to come.\nTo many the new millennium is a time of promise and\nexpectation, a period of change and transition. Yet, to many\nothers \u2014 indeed too many \u2014 it is a time of difficulty and\ntrepidation, of unfulfilled promises. Poised as we are on\nthe brink of a new era, it is vital that the United Nations\nprevails to safeguard the well-being and prosperity of\nfuture generations.\nEven our best efforts can be brought to nothing in an\ninstant, by the sheer force of nature. The recent\ndevastating earthquakes that hit the peoples of Turkey,\nGreece and Taiwan have galvanized the international\ncommunity. Shocked by the loss of so many lives, the\ndisplacement of whole communities and the pain of\nthousands, the international response to alleviate the\nsuffering was generous and expeditious. It was yet\nanother instance where the expression of solidarity\ntowards the victims of a natural disaster unveiled the\nhuman face of the international community.\nThat same spirit also inspires us when challenged by\nman-made disasters. It was that same spirit that gave birth\nto the United Nations.\nWe acknowledge that the United Nations cannot be\nthe perfect panacea for the ills of the world. Yet it\nremains the unique platform from which to promote and\nprotect the inherent rights of all peoples to live in peace,\nfreedom and dignity. By focusing on human security in\nits manifold dimensions \u2014 political, economic and\nsocial \u2014 the United Nations will continue to be a beacon\nof hope to all nations.\nThe General Assembly has always shown that it is\nfully conscious of the need to invest in the future \u2014 an\ninvestment that also requires the consolidation of a culture\nof peace. This was the essence of the resolutions that\nproclaimed the year 2000 as the International Year for the\nCulture of Peace and the next decade as the International\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the\nChildren of the World.\nIt is our fervent hope that the Millennium Assembly\nnext year will generate the necessary political will and\nsolidarity to ensure that our efforts on the international\nscene bear fruit to safeguard the values on which this\nOrganization was founded. We must move the process of\nintrospection and deliberation forward to a process of\ncommitted implementation and action. Strong political\nwill and conviction are needed to fulfil our common\ngoals.\n26\n\n\nWe should not aim for short-term remedies, but should\nrather pool our collective efforts in order to achieve\nlong-lasting solutions to the challenges we face today \u2014\nthe eve of a new era.\nThis is Malta's pledge for the new millennium. This\nis what we aim to ensure \u2014 that our efforts, both at the\nnational and international level will be achieved."

        "file_text": "First of all,\nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. I am fully confident that your experience and\ncompetence will contribute to the success of this session.\nWith the end of the cold war, there was a feeling\nthat the world would see balanced international relations,\ncharacterized by peace, stability and well-being. But the\nstate of affairs has proved otherwise; the international\nimbalance continues and is being used to place the logic\nof hegemony above all else in order to perpetuate it in the\nworld and its international organizations, particularly the\nUnited Nations.\nBecause of this situation, the world has witnessed a\nseries of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to\nthe emergence of many areas of political and military\nconflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the\nhuman, economic and social conditions of many regions\nin the world. These conflicts have claimed the lives of\nhundreds of thousands of innocent civilians and have\ncaused the huge squandering of material and human\nresources.\nThe world will enter the new century in this fashion.\nThe picture before us demonstrates the tyranny of force,\nthe imposition of hegemony and the aggravating\neconomic problems by which the States of the South are\nincreasingly marginalized to the extent that their entities\nand elements of survival are about to be eliminated. This\n27\n\n\nwill lead to economic subordination, inevitably followed by\npolitical subordination. In this context, there has emerged\na new phenomenon of imposing various kinds of embargoes\nand economic sanctions, withholding development and\ndepriving States of the exercise of their economic rights as\nenshrined in international law and covenants. The\ncatastrophic effects of this imbalance are reflected in the\nsocial conditions of many regions in the world. These\neffects are demonstrated by an increase in the intensity of\npoverty, the spread of illiteracy, deterioration of the health\nsituation and degradation of living standards. It can also be\nseen in the marginalization of many social segments of\nsociety, especially youth, because of lack of jobs; the same\ngoes for the increase in crime and the prevalence of drugs,\nas well as other serious social problems which can hardly\nbe controlled.\nIt is no secret that one of the main reasons for the\naggravation of this situation is the arbitrary imposition of\ncomprehensive sanctions and embargoes on many States in\nthe world for political purposes, without any sound\nfoundation in international law. It is obvious that this policy\nhas resulted in tragic effects on the economic and social\nstructures of the targeted States and on third countries. It\nconstitutes a flagrant violation of the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the principles\nof justice.\nThe most dangerous phenomenon witnessed during the\npresent decade, which in the course of this session has\nbecome an endeavour orchestrated by a group of Western\nStates, is the advocacy of so-called humanitarian\nintervention. This doctrine, which has no place in\ninternational law, stems from an organized infringement of\nthe most fundamental rules of the present international\norder, such as sovereignty, political independence, territorial\nintegrity and non-interference in internal affairs. These\nprinciples cannot provide a protective shield for grave\nviolations of human rights or for intervention, sometimes\nwith the use of force, in order to protect those rights. No\none should be deceived by this doctrine as the new\nframework for a modern forum of neo-colonialism based on\nthe logic of power.\nFirst of all, we should realize that no situation used as\na justification for this doctrine is free from the external\npolitical interventions that led in the first place to the\nemergence of such a situation. Accordingly, it could not be\nclaimed that international responsibility for the situation\nrests exclusively with the targeted Government. On the\nother hand, we should also realize that the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the\nmechanisms of the Organization are not devoid of\nmodalities to deal with any situation of the type advanced\nto justify this doctrine.\nThe problem does not lie with the principles, rules\nand procedures. Rather, it rests with the selfish and\nunilateral policies of the controlling Powers, whose\ninterests cannot be served by using the United Nations\nmechanisms established for the correct application of the\nprinciples and rules of the Charter, which reflect the joint\nwill and collective interests of the members of the\ninternational community.\nThe logic of this Western doctrine is not unknown\nto Iraq. At an early date, President Saddam Hussein drew\nattention to the dangers of the policy of might and\nopportunism in international relations that is carried out\nat the expense of the balance between rights and\nobligations and joint responsibility, as reflected in the\nCharter and in international law.\nIt is not justifiable to consider the role of the United\nNations as marginalized after it has become captive to the\nviews of the controlling Powers in international relations\nand their selfish interests. Regardless of what the Charter\nprovides in terms of rights, duties and procedures, we are\nconvinced that the doctrine of presumed humanitarian\nintervention represents a dangerous destructive tool that\naffects the gains that have accrued through joint efforts in\nfavour of the general international interest, as evidenced\nby the records of this Organization. The universalization\nof the concepts of this doctrine would mean the complete\ndenial of the will of the vast majority of States, with the\nresult of destroying the present international order. Iraq\njoins all delegations which have declared a position\ncontrary to this Western doctrine. We call for joint efforts\nto confront it.\nI wish here to refer to a live example of the logic of\npower experienced in Iraq in 1998, at around this time of\nyear, when the Security Council was discussing the\narrangements for conducting a comprehensive review of\nthe implementation by Iraq of its obligations under\nSecurity Council resolutions, especially those relating to\ndisarmament, with a view to considering the lifting of the\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq since August\n1990. While the Security Council was convened to\ndiscuss the Secretary-General's report on Iraq's\ncooperation in the field of disarmament, the United States\nand British forces stationed in the Gulf region launched\na large-scale military aggression against Iraq, from 16\nDecember through 20 December 1998, using the lies and\n28\n\n\nfabrications of Richard Butler as a pretext for their\naggression. That aggression claimed the lives of a large\nnumber of innocent civilians, in addition to destroying\nmany infrastructure sites, as well as much industrial\nequipment which had already been subject to a strict\nmonitoring system established by the former Special\nCommission, which did not detect any violation of Security\nCouncil resolutions at those sites.\nIn spite of this gross violation of the Charter and\nmechanisms of the Organization, the Security Council, the\nmain organ concerned with the situation, remained\ncompletely crippled and did not take any immediate\ncollective action. The international condemnation of the\nAmerican/British aggression against Iraq last December did\nnot come from the Security Council. Rather, it came from\nGovernments and peoples of Member States on a larger\nscale after a noticeable lull. As the Assembly will recall,\nthe Security Council was preoccupied with a bare-faced\nprocess for gaining time through mandating panels to assess\nthe special situation concerning Iraq's implementation of its\nobligations under the resolutions of the Security Council.\nThose panels began their work unilaterally, without\nany advanced consultation with the Government of Iraq and\nwithout listening to its point of view. This process resulted\nin reports reflecting the political balance within the Security\nCouncil, which distanced it from the real substance of the\nsituation. At that point the process reached the stage of the\npresentation of draft resolutions ignoring the rights and\nobligations provided for in the resolutions of the Council\nitself. In fact, those draft resolutions added new obligations\nfor Iraq, not contained in the relevant resolutions of the\nSecurity Council that Iraq had already implemented.\nWhile the Security Council resolutions imposed\nvarious obligations on Iraq, they in turn imposed a specific\nobligation on the Security Council, stipulating that the\ncomprehensive embargo was to be lifted once Iraq fulfilled\nits obligations under the same resolutions. But what has\nhappened in the course of the last nine years is that the\nCouncil, during 40 sessions held to review Iraq's\nimplementation of its obligations, has failed to take a\ndecision to lift the comprehensive embargo, much less to\nease the situation even by 1 per cent, despite the fact that\nall countries, even Iraq's enemies \u2014 for example, the\nUnited States of America \u2014 have attested that after nine\nyears of intensive implementation under the severest\ncircumstances and threats of continued aggression against\nIraq nothing important has been left unfulfilled.\nWhy then has the Council failed to lift the embargo\non Iraq? The reason behind all this is the American\nhegemony over the Council, which prevents the Council\nthrough various means from properly implementing its\nresolutions. We have seen for several months intensive\nendeavours in the Security Council, particularly by the\nfive permanent members, to adopt a unified position on\nIraq.\nThe correct position that conforms with the\nresolutions of the Security Council is very clear and\nuncontroversial. Once the logic of law and justice is\nadhered to, Iraq demands its clear and legitimate rights \u2014\nnamely, the lifting of the iniquitous sanctions imposed on\nit in accordance with the Council's resolutions. These\nresolutions were agreed upon by the five permanent\nmembers and have been implemented by Iraq over the\nlast nine years. Now it is the turn of those five States to\nhonour their obligations. Iraq's position should be clear to\nall. To gain Iraq's approval, any proposal or resolution \u2014\nor consequences, if there are any \u2014 should be based on\ninternational law and non-selectivity, otherwise the results\nwill meet with a definite rejection and we will continue\nour struggle to lift the sanctions comprehensively and\nfinally in order to achieve all our legitimate demands.\nIt has become clear to all, through public, personal\nand official testimonies, that the former Special\nCommission \u2014 a panel unfortunately bearing the name of\nthe United Nations and acting nominally under its flag \u2014\nhas been used by the United States and Great Britain to\nachieve their aggressive objectives against Iraq's people,\nsovereignty and security. In order to achieve the ultimate\nend of its main mission, the former Special Commission\nhad adopted two methods for its work in Iraq: first,\nconducting espionage activities for American, British and\nIsraeli intelligence so as to enable them to realize their\nobjectives of destabilizing Iraq politically and removing\nits patriotic regime; and, secondly,keeping the embargo in\nplace by reporting to the Security Council that the Special\nCommission had not yet fulfilled its mandate of disarming\nIraq.\nDuring its work in Iraq, the former Special\nCommission resorted to dubious methods to falsify facts\nand present them in a manner that was in line with the\nAmerican approach, which is hostile to Iraq. The last of\nthese had to do with the issue of VX vials found in the\nCommission's headquarters at Baghdad. Those samples\nwere used by the Commission to contaminate the missing\nwarheads that were sent to American laboratories for\nanalysis. That was in order to enable the United States\n29\n\n\nAdministration to find evidence supporting its allegations\nregarding Iraq's weapons programmes. The Commission's\ndubious practices were not limited to this, but went as far\nas hastily destroying the VX samples in order to conceal\nthe irrefutable evidence of the Commission's involvement\nin the American conspiracy against Iraq.\nThe American attempts to distort and pervert the\nrelationship between Iraq and the Security Council have not\nbeen limited to exploiting the former Special Commission.\nThey reached their ugliest forms in the open obstruction of\nany efforts to ease the effects of the comprehensive\nembargo imposed on Iraq, which has resulted in bitter\nsuffering for the people of Iraq, particularly its children.\nThe obstacles experienced during the implementation\nof the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraq\nand the United Nations regarding the oil-for-food\nformula \u2014 which all reports and realities indicate cannot\nmeet the essential humanitarian needs of the people of\nIraq \u2014 are striking evidence of the American\nAdministration's insistence on harming the people of Iraq\nand depriving them of their fundamental humanitarian\nrights, as enshrined in all international covenants.\nIt is worth mentioning that the total value of the\nsupplies that arrived in Iraq for the five initial phases of the\nimplementation of the Memorandum of Understanding is\nalmost equal to the funds deducted from the revenues of\nIraqi oil sales to cover the expenses of the Special\nCommission, the expenses of the United Nations in Iraq\nand the costs of the United Nations Compensation\nCommission. The total value of the supplies that have\narrived in Iraq from the beginning of 1997 to the present is\n$4,948,300,000, while the funds deducted for the Special\nCommission, the United Nations services and the\nCompensation Commission are $4,041,185,000.\nA cursory look at these two figures clearly shows the\nfailure of the Memorandum of Understanding to meet the\nessential humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq. The\nmethods the United States and Britain use in dealing with\nthe contracts that are related to humanitarian needs, and the\ndeliberate delay in processing these contracts, make the\nmain goal of the Memorandum of Understanding the\nfinancing of the expenses of the United Nations instead of\nsecuring the essential humanitarian needs of the Iraqi\npeople and stopping the deterioration of their humanitarian\nand health situation.\nThis also exposes the intentions of the American and\nBritish Governments to strip the Memorandum of its\nhumanitarian substance by putting on hold the contracts\ndirectly related to the health situation of the people of\nIraq. For example, while the value of the contracts signed\nfor water, sanitation and electricity has amounted to $352\nmillion, the value of the supplies that have arrived in Iraq\nso far is only $64 million \u2014 that is, only 18 per cent of\nthe total value of those contracts. The rest has been put\non hold by the British and the Americans.\nThe most striking evidence of the suffering of the\nchildren of Iraq as a result of this unjust, comprehensive\nembargo is the 12 August 1999 report of the United\nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which contains\nstatistics on child mortality resulting from malnutrition,\nshortages of medicines and the deteriorating economic\nand nutritional situation of Iraqi mothers. The report has\nproved decisively that the embargo imposed on Iraq is the\nmain reason for the huge increase in the child mortality\nrate.\nThe United States Administration has spared no\ncosts to distort the facts about the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding, or spared any tendentious lies and\nallegations about the distribution of food and medical\nsupplies. The Secretary-General's reports on the Iraq\nprogramme, which are based on the reports of United\nNations observers deployed throughout Iraq, have proved\nthe accuracy, regularity and equity of the distribution\nprocess of all humanitarian supplies received under the\nMemorandum of Understanding.\nThe United States of America deliberately works to\nmaintain the embargo and to double the suffering of the\npeople of Iraq, despite the disappearance of all the\nreasons linked to the imposition of the embargo. This\nAmerican objective has become quite clear through the\nmany statements made by American officials that make\nthe embargo a tool to achieve the hostile American\npolitical policy against Iraq.\nOne of the basic pillars of the hostile\nAmerican/British policy against Iraq is the imposition of\nthe two no-fly zones on Iraq. This constitutes a violation\nof the United Nations Charter and international law. We\nhave already mentioned the evidence about this in a letter\nto the President of the Security Council dated 15 January\n1999. This has also been confirmed by the views\nexpressed by some permanent members and by others\ninside and outside the deliberations of the Council.\nIt is well-known that the continuation of these no-fly\nzones is a means to perpetuate the aggression with a view\n30\n\n\nto achieving the purposes of the Anglo-American political\nscheme against Iraq. American officials do not hesitate to\nindicate their real intentions of using these daily\nbombardment operations to achieve the United States\nAdministration's goals against Iraq's independence and\nsovereignty and to destabilize its patriotic Government.\nThe Washington Post published on 31 January 1999 an\narticle quoting a senior official of the United States\nAdministration describing a certain attack as a means of\nreaching the goal in a way that satisfied all objectives\nwithout any loss, and saying that if the United States were\nto carry out a massive campaign, people would inquire\nabout what had provoked such attacks.\nProceeding from this policy of partitioning the\naggression, the American and British warplanes have been\ncarrying out daily exercises in a show of power that\nviolates Iraq's airspace. In this way they launch savage\nbombardment operations against civil and economic sites in\nIraq, including communication stations, oil pumping stations\nand private houses. Even mosques and churches have not\nbeen spared these continued savage attacks; the churches\ninclude the Church of Mar Matti, which goes back to the\nfourth century AD and which the American and British\naircraft bombed on 11 August 1999.\nFrom the aggression of December 1998 to the present,\nthe total number of sorties carried out by American and\nBritish aircraft amounted to 12,143, of which 9,830,\nlaunched from Saudi and Kuwaiti territory, were carried out\nin southern Iraq. Two thousand three hundred and thirteen\n(2,313) sorties were carried out in northern Iraq from\nTurkish territory.\nThe United States Administration is seeking to find\ninconsistent pretexts for these daily acts of aggression, to\nwhich hundreds of innocent civilians fall victim. It claims\nthat the bombing of civilians is in legitimate self-defence\nagainst Iraqi air force attacks.\nLet us ask this: where does the United States derive\nthe right to defend an act that lacks any kind of basic legal\nlegitimacy? Who gives the American aggressors the right to\nact in self-defence, as they claim, in Iraqi airspace? The\nacts carried out by the United States Administration\nrepresent a declared war waged against the people of Iraq.\nThis is a charade \u2014 no more, no less. A senior Pentagon\nofficial, in describing these operations in the The\nWashington Post on 2 September 1999, admitted that this\nwas a low-level war.\nProceeding from its legitimate right to self-defence,\nwhich is guaranteed in all international instruments and\ncovenants, Iraq will not hesitate to counter all American\nand British acts of aggression that aim at violating the\nintegrity of its airspace and territory and threaten its\nsecurity as well as that of its people.\nIraq will continue to confront American and British\naggression by all available means and potential. It will not\nyield to American blackmail. The hostile policy of the\nUnited States towards Iraq, which runs counter to the\nCharter of the United Nations and international law, has\nbeen made clear in official statements by senior officials\nin the United States Administration that stress that the\nUnited States is determined to unseat the patriotic\nGovernment of Iraq and dismember its national unity.\nIn addition, the highest American legislative body\nhas enacted laws that allow the Administration to interfere\nin Iraq's internal affairs, to allocate huge sums of money\nto carry out acts of terrorism, sabotage and assassination\ninside Iraq and to appoint high-ranking officials in the\nAdministration to oversee these immoral and illegitimate\ntasks.\nThis American policy has contributed to encouraging\nTurkish forces to carry out large-scale military operations\ninside Iraqi territory on the pretext of chasing elements of\nthe Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). These Turkish\nmilitary operations have caused instability and disorder in\nnorthern Iraq and pose a threat to Iraq's national security\nand territorial integrity. Iraq has regularly reported these\nrepeated Turkish acts of aggression to the United Nations\nSecretary-General and to the President of the Security\nCouncil. These acts constitute a violation of the principles\nof good-neighbourliness and a threat to international\npeace and security in the region. But the United Nations\nhas taken no action to curb these operations, and the\nreason is very clear: it is a reflection of the United States\npolicy aimed at maintaining the abnormal situation in\nIraq.\nThe continued United States hegemony and\ngovernance of the destinies of the peoples of the world,\nas well as of international economic and political\norganizations, confront the United Nations with its most\nserious challenge ever. The United Nations should stand\nup to this domination and prove its ability to restore\nequilibrium so as to realize the purposes set out in the\nCharter, primarily the achievement of peace, security and\nstability, the promotion of friendly relations and the\nencouragement of economic cooperation between States.\n31\n\n\nIn a speech delivered by President Saddam Hussein on\n17 January 1999, Iraq called for an assembly of various\ninstitutions to be established by interested States to agree\nupon statutes and charters with a view to achieving serious\ncooperation in the economic, political and military fields in\norder to preserve balance and bring about peace, starting\nwith Asia and questions related to it. That assembly would\nnot be directed against anyone, but would be aimed at\nprotecting its members and at legitimately defending their\nsecurity and interests as well as international security, in\naccordance with established humanitarian norms. From this\nrostrum we call upon the peoples and States of the world\nthat have faith in the values, culture, freedom,\nindependence, justice and equity of the nations and peoples\nof the world, to consider President Saddam Hussein's\nproposal with a view to initiating a dialogue aimed at\nturning the proposal into a reality that would help achieve\nbalance, peace and security throughout the world.\nMoreover, many States, including permanent members of\nthe Security Council, have explicitly called for a multipolar\nworld in which political, economic and military balance\nprevails, in the interest of maintaining international peace\nand security.\nThe United Nations adherence to the principles set out\nin its Charter and the full and fair implementation of its\nresolutions, without selectivity and discrimination, is the\nbenchmark of its credibility in restoring the trust of States\nin its ability to achieve justice and peace and to\nencourage States to comply with and implement the\nprovisions of its resolutions.\nThe United Nations, in particular the Security\nCouncil, should implement its resolutions on the Middle\nEast, primarily those relating to the question of Palestine,\nand should support the legitimate struggle of the\nPalestinian people to regain their legitimate and\ninalienable rights to live on their national soil in Palestine.\nIt should also support their struggle against the Zionist\ncolonization of their territory and their fight to establish\na sovereign independent State on their national territory,\nwith Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe United Nations must implement its resolutions\non making the Middle East a zone free from weapons of\nmass destruction. In particular, it should implement\nparagraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991),\nwhich considers Iraq's disarmament a step towards\nestablishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons\nof mass destruction. So far the United Nations has taken\nno steps in that direction.\nIn conclusion, the realization of the concepts of\njustice, democracy and development throughout the world\nis subject to the fair democratization of international\norganizations, in particular the United Nations. These\nconcepts can be achieved only through carrying out an\ninterrelated series of administrative, structural and\npolitical reforms of the United Nations, its agencies and\norgans so that it can shoulder its responsibilities under the\nCharter, primarily its responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security."

        "file_text": "Let me first extend sincere\ncongratulations to you, Sir, as the new President of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that your rich\ndiplomatic experience and the reputation you enjoy will\nplay an important role in leading the Assembly\u2019s work.\nI would also like to give credit to Mr. Didier Opertti\nof Uruguay for the great skill and persistence he showed\nin presiding over the work of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nMay I also welcome the three new Member States of\nour Organization, Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga. The United\nNations is richer for their membership.\nWe are only one year away from the Millennium\nAssembly, an event whose symbolism should inspire us\nto strive harder to achieve all the goals of the\nOrganization. In looking forward to the challenges of the\nfuture, our countries also realize that the world continues\nto hold many dangers. It has been rightly said that\nglobalization has two faces. While accounting for an\nincreasingly complex web of linkages across the full\nspectrum of human endeavour, it has also led to increased\nalienation and, in some cases, disparity. Quite clearly, the\nUnited Nations is at the forefront of efforts to address and\nreconcile these complex processes. The struggle to raise\nand improve the quality of life of the hundreds of\nmillions who continue to suffer the anguish of poverty,\nthe protection of our precious environment, the\nstrengthening of democracy and the protection of human\nrights, responding effectively to natural disasters, further\n13\n\n\nprogress in disarmament and dealing properly with security\ncrises as they arise all continue to occupy us.\nHaving mentioned the issue of security, allow me to\nobserve that the situation in South-Eastern Europe has come\nfull circle with the return of the epicentre of the crisis to\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Kosovo, where it\nstarted more than a decade ago. The military intervention\nof the international community, supported by all the\ncountries of the region, including Croatia, must now be\nfollowed up with an appropriate political response. Just as\nwe joined the international community in condemning\nviolations of human rights, it is clear that energies must\nnow be concentrated on building a lasting and just peace.\nWith regard to the security issue of Prevlaka, as with\nother matters resulting from the aggression and territorial\npretensions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, bilateral\nnegotiations have been unsuccessful. The simple reason is\nthat the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia does not wish to\naccept Croatia's internationally recognized borders. Only\nwhen the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia accepts Prevlaka\nas a purely security-related issue instead of considering it\na territorial dispute, and refrains from abusing this issue in\ninternal Serbian-Montenegrin relations, will a solution be at\nhand. The opening of border crossings with the Republic of\nMontenegro has, by allowing for the freedom of movement\nof people and goods, significantly contributed to regional\nstability and helped the democratic transformation of\nMontenegro.\nCroatia has proposed the establishment of a bilateral\nsecurity regime as a follow-up to the present one\nadministered by the United Nations Mission of Observers\nin Prevlaka (UNMOP). Whether as a result of successful\nbilateral negotiations with the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia, of a Security Council resolution or even of\nunilateral action consistent with the rights and duties of\nCroatia under international law, the UNMOP mandate\nshould be terminated soon. Further prolongation of the\nmandate will only serve those who wish to stall\nnegotiations indefinitely, which is contrary to good-\nneighbourly relations and the interests of stability in the\nwider region.\nThe key legal issue arising from the disintegration of\nthe former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\nremains that of succession. As long as this matter is\nunresolved, the prospects for lasting normalization in the\nregion will be hampered for all the successor States.\nResponsibility for this state of affairs lies squarely with the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, which keeps rejecting the\nconclusions of the United Nations/European Union\nConference on the Former Yugoslavia, as well as the\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly. Only if rooted in this existing body of\ninternational law and authority can the question of\nsuccession be resolved. Pending a full resolution of this\nissue, the normal economic processes that might\notherwise promote stability and cooperation cannot have\na positive effect, either on the region or on bilateral\nrelations.\nOver the past year, Croatia has persevered in its\ndetermination to enlarge and enrich the content and scope\nof its special bilateral relations with Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. I am particularly pleased to be able to\ninform the Assembly that we have recently resolved one\nof the hitherto open questions in our relations with Bosnia\nand Herzegovina: an agreement has been signed settling\nthe issue of our common border.\nCroatia will continue both to support the\nimplementation of the Dayton agreements regarding\nBosnia and Herzegovina and to maintain its commitment\nto ensuring the rights of the Croats, as the least numerous\nof its three constituent peoples.\nFollowing a slow initial response, there has been a\nproliferation of both national and multinational initiatives\nthroughout the second half of the 1990s aimed at ensuring\nlong-term stability in South-Eastern Europe. The new\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe builds upon the\nsound foundation provided by the prospect of the\ninclusion of the States of the region in the Euro-Atlantic\nintegration processes. However, its success will depend\nupon an individual evaluation of the progress being made\nby the respective States, an evaluation which should be\nbased upon simple, clear and transparent criteria.\nMy country has welcomed the Pact as an important\ndevelopment involving all the relevant international actors\nand seeking a comprehensive solution. In the view of\nCroatia, the strengths of the Pact \u2014 provided that it is\nimplemented to the letter \u2014 are, first, its\ncomprehensiveness and, secondly, its vision of integrating\nthe participating States into the Euro-Atlantic structures.\nIn this way, we hope that it will marshal the hitherto\ndispersed energies of the international community. Croatia\nlends its full support to the process related to the Pact and\nreiterates its determination to continue to take an active\nrole in its implementation.\n14\n\n\nThe joint success of the United Nations and the\nCroatian Government in peacefully reintegrating the\npreviously occupied part of eastern Croatia early last year\nhas been followed by the gradual return of displaced\npersons to their homes, not only in that region, but also to\nother areas of Croatia. It is a complex process involving the\nreturn of Croats to their homes in the previously occupied\nareas, and the return of Croatian Serbs to their homes from\nother countries and from eastern Croatia to other parts of\nthe country.\nWhile the difficult economic circumstances,\nparticularly in the areas of return, are certainly not helping\nthe process, they are affecting all citizens equally. In spite\nof these objective circumstances, the national Programme\nfor the Return and Accommodation of Displaced Persons,\nRefugees and Exiled Persons is being successfully\nimplemented and has resulted in the return of 65,000\nCroatian Serbs.\nCroatia maintains intensive relations with the\nInternational war crimes Tribunal for the former\nYugoslavia. It has taken numerous steps, from providing\ndocumentation and access to alleged crime sites to assisting\nin the voluntary surrender of indicted persons to the\nTribunal. Whenever a legal dispute has arisen, Croatia has\nsought ways of resolving it through proceedings within the\nTribunal Chamber itself. However, while it has lent its full\nsupport and cooperation to the Tribunal, Croatia is not fully\nsatisfied with the results to date. Indictments issued so far\ndo not adequately reflect the true nature and scope of the\nwar crimes committed by different sides in the conflict. The\nunusual delay in bringing persons in custody before the\ncourt \u2014 in some cases more than two years, despite the\ninitial assurances of speedy trials \u2014 has not strengthened\nthe Tribunal's credibility.\nNo one has been charged for the crimes committed\nagainst Bosnian Croats \u2014 despite assurances given as long\nago as the Dayton negotiations \u2014 and no one has been\nsentenced for crimes committed during the aggression\nagainst Croatia, despite ample evidence and 14,000 deaths.\nAllow me to repeat what I have said on previous\noccasions in this forum. The Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia continues to harbour the notorious war criminal\nMile Martic and the perpetrators of the most heinous war\ncrimes committed in Vukovar \u2014 Mrksic, Sljivancanin and\nRadic. Its stance overtly defies the will of the Security\nCouncil, the international community and justice in general.\nIt also poses a big obstacle to the reconciliation process.\nWe have witnessed tremendous advances during the\ntwentieth century. However, many challenges remain,\nparticularly if we are to eradicate poverty, protect our\nenvironment, and promote and achieve sustained social\ndevelopment and economic growth.\nThe recent important deliberations and work of the\nEconomic and Social Council have confirmed that the\nCouncil is an important forum for addressing the manifold\nissues arising from globalization. Croatia believes that\nimplementation of the negotiated outcomes in the broad\nsubject areas of sustainable development is the key to\npromoting the global agenda of leaving a healthy planet\nEarth for future generations to enjoy. The system of\ninternational conferences, now undergoing their five-year\nreviews, and the United Nations system as a whole, have\na leading role to play in this regard. It is with all these\nfactors in mind that Croatia has chosen the Economic and\nSocial Council as the first principal body to which to\npresent its candidature.\nOur hopes and goals for the future notwithstanding,\nthe world is still encumbered with the legacies of the\ntwentieth century. The scourge of war and all that violent\nconflicts bring with them are still a clear and ever-present\nconcern. The United Nations must be ready to cope with\nthese challenges. This inevitably requires reform of the\nOrganization. There is, of course, a broad consensus\nabout the need for reform, but as always, the devil is in\nthe details. The United Nations needs to have mechanisms\nat its disposal to address the issues arising from the new\ninternational order in a timely and efficient manner. The\nreforms within the competency of the Secretary-General\nare moving ahead. The Member States should now grasp\nthe symbolism of the new millennium in order to\nconclude the reform process.\nThe reform of the Security Council remains stalled.\nThe primary task of the Council, the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, makes its representation\nand transparency, and hence its reform, highly important.\nQuestions related to mine clearance and to the\ndestruction of anti-personnel and other types of mines are\na matter of special concern to Croatia. In spite of the fact\nthat much work is being done to alleviate this problem,\nhundreds of thousands of mines still lie scattered over\n6,000 square kilometres of Croatia's territory. Having\nratified the Ottawa Convention last year, Croatia was\npleased to host a regional conference on anti-personnel\nmines in Zagreb in July this year and thus share its\n15\n\n\nexperience and expertise directed at ridding the world of\nthese terrible weapons.\nThe United Nations is best known for its peacekeeping\nrole around the world. Croatia, which has hosted five\nseparate peacekeeping operations on its territory, has in\nrecent weeks taken on the role of a contributor of\npeacekeepers. As we have announced in the past, through\nits participation in the United Nations mission in Sierra\nLeone Croatia will now be able to repay in kind the good\ndeeds previously bestowed on it. The Croatian Government\nis honoured by this responsibility and is confident that its\nsoldiers will be exemplary members of the United Nations\nforce. Additionally, we welcome the evolutionary\ndevelopments in the area of peacekeeping, from the use of\ncivilian police and preventive forces to the \u201cWhite\nHelmets\u201d proposal.\nThe promotion and protection of human rights requires\nconstant vigilance and effort by all responsible\nGovernments. The Croatian Government, through its\nNational Committee for Human Rights Education, in\ncooperation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and experts from the\nCouncil of Europe, is preparing a national programme on\nhuman rights education targeting schoolchildren at the\nprimary and secondary levels.\nCroatia continues to follow closely the progress being\nmade towards establishing an International Criminal Court.\nThe establishment of an efficient, permanent International\nCriminal Court will be a milestone in the march towards\nthe universal protection of human rights and the rule of\nlaw. Croatia has signed the Statute of the Court and looks\nforward to other States doing so, too, so that this great\nachievement of the international community can commence\nits operation as soon as possible.\nThe present session of the General Assembly will be\nvital in preparing for the coming Millennium Assembly. It\nis important that this Assembly be well prepared so that it\nis an event of substance rather than of ceremonial character.\nCroatia hopes that it will be a real crossroads and that it\nwill succeed in providing guidelines for a better and more\ntolerant world in the coming millennium.\nAllow me to conclude by noting that Croatia is\nlooking forward to the work of the fifty-fourth session,\nhopeful that it will bring further progress in addressing the\nchallenges and grasping the opportunities of our times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Thailand, I extend my warm\ncongratulations to you, Sir, upon your unanimous election\nto the presidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly. I am confident that with your leadership and\nexperience this session will complete its work successfully\nand set the stage for the Millennium Assembly and the\nmillennium summit next year.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to Mr. Didier Opertti, President of the Assembly at\nits fifty-third session. My delegation truly appreciates his\nleadership and his tireless dedication to the heavy\nresponsibilities entrusted to him during the past year.\nMay I on behalf of the Government and people of\nThailand congratulate the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic\nof Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on their admission as\nnew Members of the United Nations, which further\nreinforces the universal character of the Organization.\nAs we gather on the threshold of the new millennium,\nwe find the United Nations and the international community\nare still preoccupied with maintaining international peace\nand security. Yet this is only one of the many purposes of\nour Organization; to achieving international cooperation in\nsolving international problems of an economic, social,\ncultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and\nencouraging respect for human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms for all is no less an important goal in our Charter.\nInvariably, the traditional security paradigm\npredominates in the discussions and ensuing actions\nregarding international peace and security. A decade after\nthe end of the cold war, global and regional organizations\ntend to focus their efforts primarily on traditional security\nconcepts and related tools for solving security problems. In\nSouth-East Asia, the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF), which deals\nwith some aspects of security issues in this traditional\nsense.\nBut the traditional concepts of security are woefully\ninadequate to meet the new challenges faced by mankind.\nThe very narrow scope of its definition serves as an\nintellectual strait-jacket which limits our ability to\nconceptualize and respond to new threats of our time.\nThis fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is\nbeing conducted under the menacing shadows of the\nconflicts in Kosovo and East Timor. All of us are\npreoccupied with the implications and consequences of\nthe ways in which we choose to handle these conflicts.\nMore and more, we in the international community\nare being faced with conflicts within States, not between\nor among States, as in the past. Rather than State rights,\nState interests, State sovereignty, we now have to grapple\nwith the defence of the common good, the protection of\nrights beyond borders and intervention to promote and\nsafeguard humanitarian ideals and objectives.\nOur Organization is now being challenged to provide\nclear guidelines for the collective pursuit of these new\nlofty goals and this complex agenda. Unless and until we,\nas the foremost Assembly of mankind, come up with\ncriteria, objective and consensual, the international\ncommunity will not be able to address the many lurking\ninternal conflicts effectively. The period between now and\nthe millennium summit next September is an opportune\ntime for our collective deliberation on this issue. And I\ncommend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in\nlaunching the process of consultation at the beginning of\nthe session. My delegation pledges its full cooperation\nwith him and with all representatives in the Assembly for\nthe successful outcome of this historic search.\nBut let us not forget that before we can protect and\npromote those common interests, save rights beyond\nborders and think about intervention on the ground of\nhumanitarian concerns, we have to make sure that we are\nin agreement about what it is that we must, that we want\nto, protect and promote.\nI propose that we should begin to change our\ntraditional, exclusive preoccupation with the security and\nsovereignty of States to serious consideration on the\nemerging concept of human security. It is a concept\nwhich attempts to take us beyond the traditional meaning\nof security, by addressing new issues. The scope of what\nfalls within the realm of human security is still not yet\nwell defined, except to place people at the centre of our\ndefinition of security. Security is now people-related more\nthan State-related.\n10\n\n\nOne interpretation of human security in vogue includes\nupholding human dignity, protecting and promoting human\nrights and use of humanitarian law, shielding women,\nchildren and non-combatants from the effects of armed\nconflicts, and combating terrorism. We have also seen\nconcerted action to meet these objectives through joint\nefforts to eradicate anti-personnel landmines, prevent the\nproliferation of small arms and struggle against organized\ncrime. This somewhat limited interpretation of human\nsecurity emphasizes physical protection of the human\nperson, and strives to provide human beings with freedom\nfrom fear. This is a step in the right direction.\nBut it is not sufficient. We think human security\nshould be more comprehensive. Can we afford to continue\nto attach less importance to addressing the social and\neconomic dimensions of human security? Can we honestly\nenjoy genuine security amidst l.3 billion people who live on\nless than $1 a day, or another 840 million who remain\nmalnourished? Can we fully enjoy freedom from fear\nwithout having freedom from want, which emanates from\nliving in an environment free from infectious disease,\nilliteracy, poverty, natural disaster and social unrest? If we\nare to give importance to protecting children from harmful\neffects during times of war, should we not give equal\nimportance to providing children with basic benefits during\ntimes of peace? We cannot turn a blind eye to the need to\nsecure for people their freedom from want. We believe that\nhuman beings will begin to enjoy genuine security only if\nthey have a chance to make a living, to be able to stand on\ntheir own two feet, to have equal opportunities to develop\ntheir livelihoods and to make their own decisions about\ntheir own futures. This will not happen so long as people\nare threatened by socio-economic ills such as poverty,\ndisease, environmental degradation and social vices,\nincluding drugs.\nThe need to pursue human security in such a broader\nand more comprehensive definition is made even more\nurgent by the multifaceted challenges that we face from\nunbridled globalization. Granted, globalization has created\nmany important opportunities and benefits, such as the\ncreation of more competitive world markets, which has led\nto greater efficiencies in production and faster economic\ngrowth. But I ask the question: has globalization helped\neradicate poverty in the marginalized subregions of the\nworld, or eliminated social and economic inequities even in\nthe developed world? We cannot deny that uncontrolled\nmarket forces and unfettered short-term capital flows, to\ntake but a few examples of globalization, have had\ndevastating consequences on our economies, social\ncohesion, political stability and cultural identity \u2014 in\nmany cases for the worse rather than for the better.\nThe events of the recent financial crisis in Asia have\nbrought us face-to-face with the worst consequences of\nglobalization. Millions of adults were unemployed and a\nlarge number of children were forced to leave school.\nBut, if anything, the crisis has made us even more\ndetermined to meet this challenge, which, though\nprimarily financial in nature, has had immense social\nconsequences. We have learned that the multifaceted\nnature of the challenge of globalization requires a\nmultifaceted response.\nIn our case, besides the traditional economic reforms\nand adjustments undertaken, we also sought to focus our\nefforts on addressing the short-term and long-term threats\nto the viability and welfare both of individuals and of our\nsociety. We therefore give strong priority to promoting\nthe establishment of adequate social safety nets and the\ndevelopment of human resources. This strategy puts\npeople at the centre of our national efforts to bring about\nour economic revival. I can proudly say that our efforts\nhave finally borne fruit. We have emerged from the crisis\nmore competitive, more resilient and better prepared,\neconomically and socially.\nAt the global level, I firmly believe that to meet the\nchallenges of globalization and take the most advantages\nfrom its benefits, we must join hands to promote\nglobalization with a human face. This is not a new idea.\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has spoken of it. The\nUnited Nations, particularly the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, has long been a proponent of\nthis concept. Unfortunately, when it was introduced some\nyears ago, it was still considered an idea far beyond its\ntime. If we still find such a concept revolutionary, we are\nindeed behind the times.\nWe need to ensure that globalization leads us to,\namong other things, greater equity among peoples and\nnations; the easing of social tensions and the\nstrengthening of communities; the inclusion of a greater\nnumber of economies as stakeholders and co-partners in\nthe building of the global economy; declining poverty and\nthe reduction of the income gap between the very rich\nand the very poor; enhanced protection and preservation\nof our environment; greater protection and promotion of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms; and, perhaps\nmost importantly and very simply, a better life for all\npeoples.\n\n\n\nThe holding of the tenth session of the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development \u2014 UNCTAD X \u2014\nin Thailand in February 2000 will be an important, defining\nmoment in our quest to promote globalization with a human\nface. We will consider all these challenges together. We\nhope to be able to tame the tsunami of globalization and\nturn it into a benevolent force of reconstruction and\nequitable distribution of wealth and opportunities, and not\nthe menacing force of destruction and destabilization it has\nthus far been.\nI am pleased to report that our preparations for\nUNCTAD X are going well. I wish to take this opportunity\nto convey the Thai Government's assurance to all of you in\nthe Assembly that Bangkok will be fully prepared for\nUNCTAD X in February 2000. Thailand, as the host\ncountry, strongly encourages all Member States to consider\nsending to Bangkok delegations at the highest level\npossible.\nJoining hands to promote globalization with a human\nface is a distinct contribution to promoting human security.\nThe United Nations is already playing a leadership role in\nrealizing this goal at the global level. But the United\nNations cannot do it alone. It needs to forge a partnership\nwith the non-governmental sector, especially the private\nsector and civil society, and with other international\norganizations. In a sense, our endeavour to define and,\nindeed, to promote human security has philosophical and\npractical implications \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 for\nus as sovereign States and for the United Nations as the\nleading global multilateral Organization. We are embarking\non an effort to define what the key role of the United\nNations will be in the next millennium. I urge all of us to\ncontribute to this important mission together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At\nthe outset, I wish to greet the President of the General\nAssembly, His Excellency Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, whom I congratulate on his\nelection and offer all the cooperation of the delegation of\nParaguay in his work.\nIn greeting Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I\ncongratulate him on his excellent work for the\nOrganization and reaffirm the full support of the Republic\nof Paraguay for his efforts on behalf of world peace.\nAt the same time, the delegation of Paraguay wishes\nto welcome the Republics of Kiribati and Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga to membership of the United Nations.\nWe are convinced that their work will contribute to\ninternational peace and development and that their\npresence among us is further evidence of the\nuniversalization foreseen under the Charter.\nThis regular session of the General Assembly finds\nParaguay at a crucial moment in its political life and for\nits expectations for economic and social development. The\nParaguayans have very recently overcome internal\ndestabilization. However, a rapid, broad and heroic\nmobilization of the citizenry, in particular the members of\nParliament, youth, workers and peasants, formed an\nimpenetrable barrier against an attempt to foment a\nconstitutional collapse and provided support for the\nresistance to this attack on democracy.\nAs a result of the crisis of March 1999, the gravity\nand importance of which caused it to be followed by the\nmedia throughout the world, a Government of national\nunity was established in the framework of the National\nConstitution. That Government, which I have the honour\nto represent before this Assembly, is composed of all\npolitical parties through democratically elected\nparliamentarians. Today, it faces the great challenge of\n5\n\n\npulling Paraguay out of chronic economic stagnation and\ngreat social inequity.\nIn various international forums, and yet again in this\narena of brotherhood among the States of the world,\nParaguay appeals for the solidarity and cooperation of the\nmultilateral and bilateral organizations in carrying out its\neconomic reactivation programme and the implementation\nof social and anti-poverty policies. This activity will be the\nbasis and guarantee of the survival of our democracy.\nIn this context, for the first time in my country's recent\nhistory, the political parties, the authorities of the State and\nthe representatives of civil society have agreed in a patriotic\nconsensus on policies and strategies to rechannel economic\ngrowth, alleviate poverty, combat social exclusion and\nachieve well-being for our people. Democracy, as an ideal\nform of organization and coexistence, will be insured for\nhistory by sustainable development, which will guarantee\nthe material well-being of the impoverished majority.\nIn this respect, my country has subscribed to and fully\nsupports the principles, objectives and measures adopted at\nthe United Nations Conferences on social development,\npopulation and development, and women. We are\nunswervingly committed to political democracy because we\nknow that we must consolidate it with justice, social equity,\neconomic growth and sustainable development. My\nGovernment is firmly decided to participate and act jointly\nwith other countries of the world at all levels to enhance\nnatural resources and preserve the environment as an\nirreplaceable framework for human development.\nIn a significant response to the requirements of the\nCairo Conference, Paraguay has adopted a national plan and\na Council for Reproductive Health. With the establishment\nof the Women's Secretariat, we have strengthened women's\npresence in government and made available a programme\nfor women's equality in education. This measure has\nallowed us to incorporate gender equality into educational\nreform and to adopt a women's equal-opportunity plan.\nWe have attributed equal importance to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and to the\ncommitments made at the Children's Summit. In this\nrespect, the Executive Power has submitted a code for\nminor's for parliamentary approval.\nClearly, these important steps have had a positive\neffect. Paraguay today, according to the most recent report\nof the United Nations Development Programme, is in a\ncomparatively improved position that favours its human\ndevelopment indicators.\nThe dynamic of today's world is an unavoidable\nchallenge demanding not only domestic democratic\ncooperation, but also negotiations that will raise countries\nto a level of development at which they can work with\nother regional and multilateral partners.\nConvinced of this, Paraguay, freely and in full\nsovereignty, has decided to join the great Southern Cone\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) project, a regional\nexperiment that has proved to be a useful instrument for\naddressing the challenges of an ever-changing world\neconomy. Thus, we look forward to the opening of\nnegotiations to establish a free-trade zone between\nMERCOSUR and the European Union. Similarly,\nParaguay is actively participating in the ambitious Free\nTrade Area of the Americas, an undertaking that will\nhave enormous repercussions for the American continent.\nIn its decisive struggle for comprehensive progress,\nmy country is participating with renewed hope and great\nfaith in the ideals that formed the basis for the\nestablishment and existence of the United Nations. We\ntherefore reaffirm our full commitment to the principles\nof multilateralism, equal sovereignty of States and respect\nfor the legal order that support the essential principles of\nthe Organization.\nIn this respect, Paraguay is examining the process of\nchange and the strengthening of this Organization. We\nwill support all efforts to improve its efficiency and\noperational capacity to maintain peace and contribute to\nthe human development of all peoples.\nNevertheless, my country believes that the structure\nof the United Nations must be made less costly and more\nefficient. The Organization should strengthen the\nEconomic and Social Council, continue to streamline the\nSecretariat and reduce the overlap of its specialized\nagencies, through efficient rationalization of the flow of\nresources for cooperation for sustainable development.\nGiven the challenges facing the United Nations, we\nattach considerable importance to the adoption of\nmeasures to ensure the good financial functioning of its\norgans, and we therefore urge Member States, particularly\nthe most developed, to meet their financial obligations as\nan essential prerequisite for the reform of the\nOrganization.\n6\n\n\nSimilarly, the Government of my country does not\nconsider that the present composition of the Security\nCouncil reflects the presence of all the main actors of the\ninternational community, nor that its numbers are in\nproportion to the totality of Members. Only an increase in\nthe number of permanent and non-permanent Members will\nensure more equitable participation within the Security\nCouncil and, thus the necessary political balance. In that\nrespect, the progressive process of international\ndemocratization must conclude with the elimination of the\nright of veto of its permanent members.\nTherefore, Paraguay supports the aspiration of Latin\nAmerica and other continents to have greater representation\nin the Council, where the presence of Brazil as a permanent\nmember, could represent the great interests of our region.\nParaguay is convinced that maintaining international\npeace and security must continue to be one of the priorities\nof the United Nations, in particular in those areas of\nconflict where its intervention can contribute decisively to\nstabilizing the situation on the ground and achieving peace.\nAs proof of its commitment to these noble purposes,\nthe Government of Paraguay has officially offered the\nSecretary-General the participation of members of its armed\nforces in United Nations peacekeeping operations, a\ndecision which will contribute to this noble humanitarian\npurpose. To that end, a battalion of elite officers of the\nParaguay army is receiving special training to participate in\nthose operations, in accordance with the memorandum of\nunderstanding to be signed between the Republic of\nParaguay and the United Nations.\nHowever, we truly believe that the best guarantee of\npeace, together with the monitoring of human rights and\nequal opportunity for development, is to reduce armaments\nprogressively and in a sustained manner until they are\ntotally eliminated.\nParaguay strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms,\nregarding it as one of the most serious threats to our\nsocieties. In that respect, we have supported all the United\nNations initiatives to counteract this scourge, making clear\nour resolve to prevent it, combat it and eliminate it. It is\ntimely to recall that my country has itself suffered from the\neffects of this terrible scourge; in this very year we have\nsuffered the horrendous assassination of the Vice-President\nof the Republic, Luis Mar'a Arga\u00f1a. I take this opportunity\nfor the President of the Republic of Paraguay to thank the\nGeneral Assembly for the tribute which was paid to him.\nParaguay will not cease its struggle to eradicate terrorist\nbands, which are alien to our tradition and our history.\nWith regard to other scourges which afflict our\nsocieties, I must emphasize with great satisfaction the\nefforts which my country is making in the crusade against\nillicit drug-trafficking and related crimes, a struggle which\nis carried out with the greatest cooperation. The twentieth\nspecial session of the United Nations, on the question of\ndrugs, held in New York in June 1998, conveyed in its\ndecisions that spirit, which should lead us inexorably to\nthe final destruction of the merchants of death, a victory\nwhich will be achieved with the shared responsibility of\nthe nations committed to the crusade.\nThese purposes will be achieved with the faithful\nfulfilment of the commitments undertaken with regard to\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. In this respect,\nmy country has followed the recommendations of the\nUnited Nations with regard to signing, adhering to and\nratifying those commitments, whose purpose it is to\nstrengthen the framework for the promotion and\nprotection of the rights of the individual. International\nlegal instruments in this regard form part of the law in the\nRepublic of Paraguay.\nFor that reason, my Government accepts verification\nand monitoring by organizations concerned with the\nprotection of human rights, thus complying with the\nprovisions of the covenants which it has ratified, as a\ncommitment of its will to fulfil them. We must note here\nthat Paraguay has just received a visit from the Inter-\nAmerican Commission on Human Rights, which arrived\nin the country in response to an invitation by the\nGovernment.\nWith regard to the priorities of justice concerning\ncrimes of international scope, we find it very satisfactory\nto note a most promising event: the approval in 1998 of\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, to\npass judgement on individuals accused of the crimes\nwhich most offend the human conscience. Paraguay,\nbeing one of the signatories, has submitted this document\nfor parliamentary approval.\nFurthermore, Paraguay, whose population includes\n15 per cent of foreigners, the majority of whom live in\nborder areas, free of segregation or discrimination, notes\nwith satisfaction that the problem of the Balkans is\nmoving back to its natural ambit, the United Nations\nSecurity Council, which must necessarily approve any\ndecision.\n7\n\n\nOur permanent, determined support for the Conference\non Disarmament is one of the pillars of our international\npolicy. Paraguay, which supported the process of\ndecolonization and the autonomy of peoples from the time\nthe United Nations was established, has followed with great\nconcern the events in East Timor. I sincerely hope that with\nthe efforts of the United Nations, the best solution will be\nfound to the problem, with the consecration of the rights of\nthis people, legitimized in the referendum and encouraged\nby our Organization.\nMy country has firmly decided to keep to the essential\nprinciples of coexistence and civilization; this is a necessary\nresult of its belonging to the international community.\nFollowing the principle of universality, Paraguay supports\nthe right of all the peoples of the world to make their\nvoices heard at the United Nations.\nParaguay believes that the situation in the China Strait\nmust be resolved within the framework of international law,\nnon-aggression and peaceful coexistence of nations.\nI cannot fail to state here that we share the sorrow of\nthe people of the Republic of China at the catastrophe\nafflicting its territory. We must all commit ourselves to\noffering cooperation and help to achieve its full recovery.\nIn my country there is an unswerving commitment to\ndemocracy and the belief that this can be consolidated only\nthrough justice, social equity, economic growth and\nsustainable development. That is why my Government has\nresolved to participate and act together with other countries\nin all efforts aimed at preserving natural resources and the\nenvironment, an indispensable task for comprehensive\ndevelopment. For the same reasons, in this year when\nhumanity will achieve the surprising figure of six billion\ninhabitants in the world, we, the Heads of State and\nGovernment and political leaders and officials have the\nhistoric responsibility to respond to the needs and\nexpectations of this huge world population. But let us not\ndo it with hunger, thirst, wars, terrorism, discrimination,\ngenocide, tyranny and injustice \u2014 let us do it with\nresponsibility, with positive actions, and with security for\nthe human person.\nOn the threshold of the new millennium, Paraguay is\nprepared to participate in this urgent task of improving\nhuman civilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "We are coming to\nthe end of 1999, a date that many see as the end of an\nepoch, given the proximity of the new millennium. The\nimminence of its arrival invites us to reflect on the history\nof men and women.\nIt is with humility that Western nations, such as\nmine, consider the development of mankind, which well\nbefore our year one was recorded by other calendars\nduring thousands and thousands of years, as homo sapiens\nbegan to create tools of wood and metal, began to bury\ntheir dead with dignity or to build empires and cultures\never greater, and also ever more ephemeral. Today we\nmarvel at the mysterious paintings of prehistoric man,\nsuch as we find in Andorra and throughout the Pyrenees,\nor at the great architectural projects of ancient Egypt. Our\nculture, our crafts, our way of life \u2014 all these have\ncertainly changed; but our intellect, though more\ncultivated and filled with more knowledge, continues to\ngrasp at the problems of our existence in the same way,\nwith the same hesitations \u2014 caught between superstition,\ncruelty and fear on the one hand and optimism and hope\non the other.\nIn short, at the dawn of the year 2000 we remain\nessentially human and we can still discern in ourselves\nthe traces of our ancestors who were born of natural\nevolution. However, the progress of human societies has\nso intensively transformed our environment that our era\nis intrinsically new and different from those that preceded\nit. This new world, so recent and so obvious to us that it\nappears it could not be otherwise, is the world of the new\nmillennium. Globalization defines the spirit of the age.\nThis phenomenon is of such importance that the General\nAssembly should reflect upon it, each of us according to\nhis unique perspective. The universality of this\ninternational forum \u2014 where, because of the far-\nsightedness of its founders, all nations, large and small,\nhave the same voice \u2014 makes it the ideal place for a\nsober reflection on globalization and its effects.\nThe nineteenth century saw the birth of nationalism,\nwhich, in giving cohesion to human communities of all\nsizes, mythologized its unifying elements, often to an\nextreme. Andorra is a State, the fruit of a juridical\nagreement that defined it, long before the coming of\nnationalism. Our national essence is not based only on our\nlanguage, Catalan, which we share with our neighbours to\nthe south and to the north, or on other manifestations of\nmodern nationalism. Institutions are the pillars of our\ncommunity: a democratic parliamentary system that began\nin 1419, a culture of peace that has continued\nuninterrupted since 1278. Perhaps, since the Andorran\nfatherland is the result of institutional and political ideas\nworked out in a unique historical experience, born out of\n23\n\n\na pact, we can emphasize these ideas today in this speech\nso that here at the United Nations they can serve as\nunifying institutional elements, thereby promoting the idea\nthat globalization should be shared by all in common\nprogress.\nWhat is important in the new millennium is to know\nhow to orient this globalization with international criteria,\nso that a son of the Argentine pampas or a daughter of\nGabon can equally laugh and cry at the same cartoon, so\nthat their freedom and ambitions can be equal and equally\nunconstrained. For if their childhoods are no longer so\nculturally separate, the political and economic opportunities\nthey have when they pass into adulthood should be equally\nsimilar.\nGlobalization is probably the greatest opportunity for\nhumanity, but it will not develop its potential if it is not\naccompanied by both principles and political action at the\nhighest levels which allow for the establishment of new\n\u201cpost-national\u201d communities with different cultures but with\nsimilar characteristics, communities that together can work\ntowards a world of peace and economic progress. This will\nnever be realized without the United Nations, the\nindispensable Organization. There are no indispensable\nnations, just as there are not men and women who are\nbetter than others because of the accident of their places of\nbirth. What exists today are the indispensable economic and\npolitical precepts that our parents, survivors of the\nHolocaust and other terrors of the Second World War, gave\nto the United Nations and to the other international\norganizations allied to it. This Organization, which many\nlove to criticize, while it may be distorted or weakened by\nthe weakness of its Members, is at its core the expression\nof one of the greatest moments of the soul of humanity.\nThe political power of the United Nations comes from\nthe defence of the rights of man and the peaceful resolution\nof conflicts. Its power in the economic sphere is based on\nan ethical cry for development. I spoke before of the\nchildren of the pampas or of Gabon, as I might speak of\nchildren of the American Midwest or of East Asia or the\nFrench Pyrenees or the Arab peninsula. Many of these boys\nand girls will grow up with the same aspirations, instilled\nin them by a global culture, but once the age of adulthood\nis reached the possibilities for the exploitation of their\npotentials is not the same, and in this great injustice lie the\nseeds of new wars, exploitations and corruptions. For many\nof these children globalization has little meaning.\nWe cannot turn our backs on the fact that 20 per cent\nof mankind lives in conditions of extreme poverty, and that\nmany millions of others are very close to this state. What\ndoes global culture represent for all of these people?\nPerhaps simply a mirage of all that they might have had\nand taken pleasure in had they been born citizens of a\nricher country. The world has today more that 1.5 billion\npeople who lack access to potable water and basic\nsanitation facilities and who are largely illiterate. What\nkind of global community will we be creating if these\nnumbers do nothing but rise? The United Nations\nindicated what needed to take place after the Social\nSummit in Copenhagen in 1995. That conference traced\na path that we have begun to follow, but that must now\nbe followed with a firmer step. Why do we not, in the\ndecades to come, try to apply the desires expressed in\nUnited Nations policy to economic organizations, such as\nthe World Trade Organization, the International Monetary\nFund and the World Bank? We must do this. Otherwise,\nglobalization cannot be any more than it is now: a\ndictatorship of the financial world over people and their\nlegitimate representatives.\nA discussion of the responsibility of those States that\nadminister economic aid returns us to the questions of\npolitical rights, the advancement of democracy, the\ntransparency of the political and economic process and\nthe consolidation of the rule of law. Models exist, and if\nthey have been developed in specific nations of the earth,\nthese models do not carry any copyright. Human\ncommunities are either free or not; there exists no other\npossibility. True democracy, the freedom to choose the\npeople to administer the public good through regular\nelections, is the only form of democracy that can be\ndefended. Today, with the information we have at our\nfingertips, nobody should dare defend tyranny by\nresorting to cultural arguments. During the first years of\nthe new century, it will be necessary to keep alive the\nprinciples of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nso that people everywhere are educated in the social\nresponsibility of the individual and so that democracy is\naccepted as the only natural form of governance for all\nregimes.\nThe recent conflict in East Timor is a good example\nof the opportunities as well as the dangers that the United\nNations has before it. On the one hand, we find ourselves\nfacing a long but productive process, in which a popular\nvote accepted by all the parties will lead towards an\nunequivocal resolution of a long-standing problem. On the\nother hand, once this democratic process was effectively\ncarried out, violence broke out, and now we must react\nquickly in order to stop the massacre. The United Nations\ncapacity for reaction and the mobilization of the forces of\n24\n\n\nthe States that compose it is therefore essential. Here is the\nthird aspect of the United Nations that must become more\neffective than it is at present. Peacekeeping must be\nconducted using more powerful and better organized\nmechanisms of intervention that allow for rapid action and\nguarantee the effective conversion of words into deeds.\nGlobalization, a current reality, presents both\nopportunities and dangers. In order for it to be a tool of\nprogress, it must be accompanied by a system that is both\npolitical \u2014 involving democracy, the rule of law and\nrespect for human rights \u2014 and economic \u2014 involving the\ngoal of the eradication of poverty and encouragement of\ndevelopment. Support for the system depends on the United\nNations having a real capacity for intervention so that\npeacekeeping is more effective. This was the point of\ndeparture for my series of observations. I can guarantee that\nAndorra, a small State that has been a United Nations\nMember only since 1993, will make every effort so that the\ndesire to make the United Nations an instrument for\npositive globalization is not in vain. We are making\nincreasing efforts within the Organization.\nAndorra's active participation in the Rome Conference\nto establish an international criminal court, where it was the\nsecond State, after Italy, to sign the Statute, which begins\nwith words written by Andorra well illustrates the efforts of\nmy country to aid and reinforce the rule of law in the\nworld.\nI have the pleasure to announce to the Assembly today\nthat once the juridical analysis and translation from Catalan\nhas been completed, my Government will give to the\nConsell General, our Parliament, a copy of the Statute for\nratification. We hope, therefore, shortly to be one of the\nStates that will permit the International Criminal Court\n(ICC) to become a reality by being one of the first\ncountries to ratify the Statute for its entry into force.\nAnother small European State, San Marino, preceded us\ntowards this goal and we congratulate it on its speed and\nsupport for the ICC.\nThe work of Andorra in the United Nations concerning\nthe rights of man continues to occupy a special place in this\nfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. In particular,\nour delegation will follow with interest the work of the\nCommission on Human Rights during its meetings in\nGeneva. Andorra's desire to mark its opposition to the death\npenalty as punishment for a crime will again be expressed.\nWe will also insist on the need to teach human rights to\nchildren, as is emphasized in Article 29 of the Convention\non the Rights of the Child. We will also work this year on\nother United Nations Conventions concerning human\nrights to which Andorra has committed itself to adhere\npending internal proceedings.\nThe year 2001, as a result of the internal rotation of\nthe Western Group, will allow Andorra to be a member\nof the Economic and Social Council. This represents an\nimportant goal for us in our international life, and we are\npleased to inform the Assembly that Andorra has started\nits preparatory work for its presence in this organ, so\nimportant to the United Nations. The deliberations of the\nnext session of the Economic and Social Council which\nwill take place in New York in the year 2000. For the\nsession to take place in 200l in Geneva, where we will\nparticipate as full members, the recent extension of our\nPermanent Mission to the Geneva Headquarters will\nassure our being able to carefully follow the proceedings.\nTo this end, I have asked our Permanent Representative\nto establish at this session which of the members of his\nteam, and in what capacity, will be responsible for the\nEconomic and Social Council in 2001 for Andorra. This\npreparation will ensure that our contribution will measure\nup to the noble work of the Council, notably in the war\nagainst poverty.\nStill on the economic plane, Andorra's candidature\nfor the World Trade Organization represents one of the\nmost important current challenges for my country,\nalongside the relationship we are exploring with our\nneighbours in the European Union. As a small State\nwhich tries to understand its economic opportunities, we\nfind the flows of global commerce, and our participation\nin them, of particular interest.\nIn 1998 each Andorran gave around $6 to our annual\nbudget for contributions to the United Nations; this is the\nper capita figure for the Andorran contribution to the\nOrganization. I am aware that it is not an enormous\ncontribution, but it is much greater than that which each\ninhabitant of the biggest countries with a high income\npays or should pay. A good part of this figure was for\nvoluntary contributions towards disarmament. An\nexhibition on children and small arms opened recently.\nPrepared by the Department of Under-Secretary-General\nDhanapala and the United Nations Children's Fund\n(UNICEF), and sponsored by Andorra, it will move to\ndifferent sites in the world to raise consciousness\nconcerning the tragedy brought about by the presence of\nsmall arms in areas of conflict, especially for the young.\nWe have also made contributions towards programmes\ndesigned to collect small arms in some of those countries\nthat suffer from an infestation of this plague. My country\n25\n\n\nintends to continue to contribute to initiatives such as these\nin order to express our solidarity with the actions for peace\nof the United Nations. It is right that a small country such\nas mine, which has been blessed by 721 years of\nuninterrupted peace should participate in the United Nations\nin those acts which bring about a culture of peace.\nThe last time I visited the Headquarters of the United\nNations, during May of last year, I did so to present a\nprogramme of computerization for the archives of the\nGroup of Western European and Other States to the high-\nlevel working group on informatics. I am happy that the\ndiplomatic mission of a small State such as ours can bring\nabout the realization of this project, aided by the National\nComputer Science Centre of Andorra. The server computers\ninstalled at the Mission function at a good rhythm and other\nregional groups have asked for information in order to\nestablish a similar system. I therefore reiterate the offer I\nmade last year concerning the cooperation of Andorra with\nany other interested regional groups.\nThe United Nations is certainly imperfect, but it is the\nbest organization that we have to orient this unpredictable\nworld of the third millennium towards a culture of peace\nand international solidarity and also along the path of\ndevelopment.\nThere are many labours left unfinished: the reform of\nthe Security Council, the new tasks of the Trusteeship\nCouncil, the revitalization of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, the increase in possibilities for peacekeeping\noperations, among others.\nWe have a great chance to change this world so\ntransformed by globalization. Do not forget, however, that\nat the end of this century marked by the worst excesses of\nhumanity, the United Nations represents our charitable spirit\nand at its centre there is not a machine, but human beings,\nalbeit exceptional ones: the first among them, Kofi Annan,\nthe Secretary-General; Didi Opertti, the outgoing President\nof the General Assembly, whom we thank with all our\nhearts for work well done; Theo-Ben Gurirab, the new\nPresident, whom we congratulate on his election; and many\nother persons who bring their individual beliefs to this\ncommon house for humanity. It comforts us to think not\nabout systems, but rather about those people who,\nindefatigable, work for a better world. Let us therefore have\nthe optimism to believe in our species. For I believe that,\nas the Nobel Prize Winner William Falkner said:\n\u201cman will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is\nimmortal, not because he alone among creatures has\nan inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a\nspirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and\nendurance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr.\nPresident, I have the pleasure of congratulating you on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nfourth session. Confident that your experience and ability\nwill strongly influence the successful outcome of the\nproceedings of this session, I assure you of my delegation's\nreadiness to cooperate with you in fulfilling your task.\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to\nexpress my thanks to His Excellency Didier Opertti Bad\u00e1n,\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session,\nfor his contribution to the achievements and success of that\nsession. It is also my pleasure to express appreciation for\nthe efforts that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has exerted\nin order to enable the Organization to fulfil its role in\npromoting international peace and security and in furthering\ninternational cooperation. I also extend the sincere\ncongratulations of the State of Bahrain to the Kingdom of\nTonga, the Republic of Nauru and the Republic of Kiribati\nupon their admission to the United Nations.\nOn 6 March 1999, the State of Bahrain announced to\nthe people of Bahrain and to the world the sad news of the\npassing away of His Highness Shaikh \u2018Isa Bin Salman Al-\nKhalifa, may God grant him peace and mercy. He was a\ngreat and humane emir who loved people and was loved by\nthe people by virtue of the remarkable traits he exhibited,\nwhich are the embodiment of the Bahraini character:\nloyalty, tolerance and civility. He, may God bestow His\nmercy upon him, championed national independence, the\nConstitution, the consultative process and the erection of\nthe State institutions and the rule of law. He championed\ndevelopment, comprehensive renaissance and diversification\nof the national economy. He championed Gulf cooperation\nand Arab solidarity through the most difficult times and\nsituations. He championed peace and international\ncooperation and genuine friendship among all peoples.\nThese causes were the legacy of the late emir, whose\napproach will continue to be the beacon that guides\nBahrain as it moves forward along its national path and\nas it pursues Gulf cooperation, Arab solidarity, regional\ncooperation with neighbours and international cooperation\nwith one and all.\nIn view of this session\u2019s special momentousness, as\nit is being held at a juncture between the end of a century\nand the beginning of a new millennium, it behoves us to\npause and reflect on the experience of the United Nations\nover the last half century. It should again be emphasized\nthat, as we approach the third millennium, we ought to\ndirect our actions in consonance with the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations Charter, which are aimed\nat enhancing peace and economic and social development,\nin the interest of the world as a whole and on the basis of\nequality, justice and respect for law.\nThe Organization\u2019s experience of more than 50\nyears, with all its successes and setbacks in dealing with\ncrises and in addressing the challenges facing the world,\nhas demonstrated that the benefits of past experience\nshould be taken into account as we prepare for the future.\nIn this way we would be better equipped to contribute to\nthe building of a new world and a brighter future and\nwould be better committed to the United Nations. Some\nof that experience has proved that departure from the\nUnited Nations principles, Charter and resolutions has\nstrained relations among many States and caused regional\ndisputes and ethnic conflicts that have threatened security\nand stability in numerous regions of the world. Yet\nhumanity has accomplished much during the last half\ncentury, particularly through United Nations involvement\nin the maintenance of international peace and security,\nsustainable development and international cooperation.\nSuch United Nations endeavours deserve our appreciation\nand commitment so that we can alleviate the human\nsuffering of those who are beset by poverty and lack of\nsecurity, stability and the basic requirements of a life of\ndignity.\n17\n\n\nHence, our common agreement on enhancing the\nvitally important role of the United Nations during the\nforthcoming millennium as the embodiment of the\ninternational community\u2019s conscience and its hope of\nbuilding a better world in which our common human\naspirations, as enshrined in the Charter, can be realized.\nBahrain\u2019s experience on the Security Council during\nthe past two years has demonstrated that small countries are\ncapable of effectively contributing to the causes of\ninternational peace and security. That experience has also\nreaffirmed Bahrain\u2019s convictions, most notably its\nadherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter\nand international legality, which reflect the will and desire\nof the international community to live in security, tolerance\nand peace. It has also confirmed the importance of\nstrengthening the principles of equitable geographic\nrepresentation and transparency as important values and\nprinciples in international relations. Such principles would\nenhance the Security Council\u2019s role in maintaining peace\nand security and help develop its ability to function\neffectively. Therefore, it is essential that efforts be exerted\nto reform the Council so that it can adequately reflect\npolitical realities and cope with the changing international\nclimate during the next century.\nThe role of the Security Council in dealing with the\nquestions of peace and security requires that the processes\nof peacekeeping and peace-building be interrelated in order\nto prevent the renewal of conflicts; hence Bahrain\u2019s request\nfor the convening of an open meeting during its term as\nPresident of the Council last December, to consider the\nrelationship between peacekeeping and peace-building. The\nextensive participation of members of the Council and other\nMembers of the United Nations bears witness to the\nconviction of many Member States that such linkage is\nessential for the integration of political action with action\nin the field of economic and social development.\nBahrain\u2019s enthusiasm and interest in taking part in\njoint efforts to reach solutions for issues of peace and\nsecurity have been demonstrated by its active and\nconstructive participation whenever the Security Council\nhas dealt with such questions. By virtue of the expertise\nthat it has gained, Bahrain will be active, both within its\nregion and at the international level, in furthering the\nprinciples of security, peace and stability.\nSince the beginning of Bahrain\u2019s modern revival, our\ncountry has been building a modern State and a developed\ncivil society on the basis of developing, preparing and\nqualifying the individual to deal with the demands of our\ntime and to participate positively in present and future\ntransformation. As a result, Bahrain has been able to build\nan open and developed economy that has made it possible\nfor the country to realize comprehensive and sustainable\nhuman development, as reflected in its remarkable\nranking in the human development index for five\nconsecutive years. This is also reflected in the reports of\nthe United Nations Development Programme, whose\ncontributions and efforts in the field of development in\nmany States we commend.\nThe State of Bahrain has long been aware of the\nimportance of human development and has thus drawn up\nplans and policies for the development and utilization of\nthe capabilities of Bahrainis in all fields. It has also\nenacted legislation encouraging women to join the\nworkforce and to enter the labour market. Thus, the\npercentage of Bahraini women in the entire public sector\nlabour force reached 33.5 per cent in 1998, and the total\nnumber of women in the private sector labour force has\nreached 20 per cent. The State of Bahrain takes pride in\nthis achievement at the regional and international levels.\nIt makes available equal opportunities to both men and\nwomen in the fields, inter alia, of education, health care\nand social welfare, as these are basic priorities of human\nrights for which Bahrain\u2019s efforts have been applauded by\nUnited Nations human rights bodies and experts.\nIn its new era under the leadership of its emir, His\nHighness Shaikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa, Bahrain will\ncontinue on its course, which has allowed it to assume a\nprominent place economically and socially, thereby\nbecoming an example of progressive development that\ntakes into account both the global dimension and the\npreservation of its heritage and traditions.\nOver the last two decades, the Gulf region has\nwitnessed serious and painful events, the ramifications of\nwhich continue to pose a threat to the security and\nstability of this vital region, which is an important hub for\nworld trade and for mutual, beneficial exchange between\nvarious nations of the world.\nThose events have demonstrated that the\nmaintenance and preservation of regional security can be\nbased only on respect for and strict observation of\nprinciples that the State of Bahrain has always advocated,\nmost notably respect for the status quo and the\ninviolability of established boundaries. Relations among\ncountries of the region should be based on the principles\nof good neighbourliness, mutual respect and non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States.\n18\n\n\nRecognition of each State's national sovereignty is an\nessential factor for the preservation of security and stability\nin the region, as is the settlement of disputes by peaceful\nmeans acceptable to the States concerned.\nAccordingly, and reaffirming its consistent position\nwith respect to a number of regional and international\nquestions and its keen interest in the maintenance of\nsecurity and peace in the world, particularly in the Gulf\nregion, Bahrain again calls on Iraq to implement relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions, especially those relating to\nweapons of mass destruction and the release of prisoners of\nwar and detainees of Kuwaiti and other nationalities.\nAt the same time, Bahrain urges anew that efforts be\ncontinued with a view to alleviating the suffering of the\nbrotherly Iraqi people resulting from sanctions. It is also\neager to ensure the independence, unity and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq and opposes any interference in its internal\naffairs.\nIn the interest of security, stability and peace in the\nGulf region, Bahrain wishes to emphasize again its support\nfor all efforts aimed at settling by peaceful means the\ndispute between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran over the three islands, namely Abu Musa,\nGreater Tunb and Lesser Tunb, all of which belong to the\nUnited Arab Emirates. In this respect, Bahrain wishes\nsuccess to the work of the Tripartite Ministerial Committee\nformed by the Gulf Cooperation Council to solve the\ndispute in a manner that would lead to the establishment of\ngood and normal relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran\non the basis of the principles of good neighbourliness,\nmutual respect and observance of mutual interests.\nIn conjunction with the questions of security and\nstability, it is imperative that we re-emphasize the danger\nof territorial claims aimed at changing established, inherited\nand traditionally accepted boundaries. Bahrain therefore\nwelcomes the resolutions adopted by the summit of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) held in Algeria in\nJuly 1999 which confirmed the adherence of member States\nto the principles set out in the OAU Charter and OAU\nresolutions in respect of inherited and traditionally accepted\nboundaries.\nDuring the last three years, the Middle East peace\nprocess has encountered a setback which froze and almost\ncompletely destroyed the process, owing to the rigid\npositions and contradictory policies of the previous Israeli\nGovernment. Now that a new Government has taken over\nand has made promises regarding its readiness to revive the\npeace process, Bahrain, having endorsed that process from\nthe very beginning and having consistently worked\ntowards its success, expresses its hope that the new Israeli\nGovernment will translate its promises into full, complete\nand faithful implementation of all the agreements reached\nand will be responsive to international efforts to make the\npeace process a success.\nAccordingly, the State of Bahrain has welcomed the\nlatest Palestinian-Israeli agreement on the implementation\nof the Wye River accords signed at Sharm el-Sheikh as\na positive step towards a final settlement between the two\nparties and the enhancement of the peace process among\nall other parties.\nThe Arab side has repeatedly confirmed its\ncommitment to the peace terms reflected in the principles\nof the 1991 Madrid Conference and the relevant United\nNations resolutions. It believes that achievement of a just,\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the region should be\nthe strategic option that would obligate Israel to recognize\nlegitimate Arab rights, to comply with the relevant\nresolutions of international legitimacy, including Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), to respect\nthe right of the Palestinian people to have their own\nindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital, to fully\nwithdraw from all occupied Arab territories, including the\nSyrian Arab Golan Heights, to the boundaries that existed\non 4 June 1967 and to withdraw from Lebanese territory\npursuant to Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\nThe success of the peace process and the\nachievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace\nwill undoubtedly have a bearing on the future stability\nand development of all the countries and peoples of the\nregion.\nAt the same time, we wish to stress the importance\nof intensifying efforts to make the Middle East, including\nthe Gulf region, a zone free of all weapons of mass\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons.\nThe world has witnessed this year positive\ndevelopments in respect of an issue that was a source of\ndeep concern to the international Organization and the\ninternational community, namely the question of\nLockerbie. We should like here to commend the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya for complying with relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, as well as the other parties in the\ncase for the cooperation they have displayed. We also\nwelcome the suspension by the Security Council of\nsanctions against Libya and express our appreciation of\n19\n\n\nefforts exerted by the Governments of the brotherly\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and South Africa and by the\nSecretary-General, as well as the concerned regional\norganizations, which have led to agreement on the case. We\nhope that this will lead to the complete lifting of sanctions.\nThe easing of the Kosovo crisis by virtue of the return\nof refugees and displaced persons to their homes and\nvillages has imbued the international community with hope\nand satisfaction. However, the whole world has seen\nshocking images of the crimes of ethnic cleansing and the\nterrorizing of innocent people and of the human suffering\nthat has beset the people of Kosovo, including the\ndisplacement of about one million Kosovars, mass graves\nand the destruction of villages and homes. It is incumbent\nupon the international community to unfailingly guard\nagainst and to address the causes of the phenomenon of\nracism and all its manifestations.\nIn view of its keen interest in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, the State of Bahrain calls\nupon the United Nations and the international community\nquickly to intensify their efforts, in cooperation with the\ncompetent regional organizations, to settle the ongoing\nconflicts in various regions and among a number of States.\nThese include the tense situation between Ethiopia and\nEritrea and internal strife in Afghanistan, Somalia, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, East Timor and other\nparts of the world.\nOther sources of concern are the phenomena of\nterrorism, violence, organized crime and related activities\nsuch as transnational drug and weapons trafficking that\ncontinue to pose a threat to all societies. To address these\nproblems the State of Bahrain supports the call by the Arab\nRepublic of Egypt for the convening of an international\nconference, under the auspices of the United Nations, with\na view to drawing up a comprehensive strategy to combat\nand eliminate these phenomena.\nSince the end of the Second World War, the world\neconomy has experienced tremendous changes on the\ninternational trade landscape, including the emergence of\ngiant trade conglomerates and a revolution in the fields of\ntechnology, information and communications.\nAbout half a century after the establishment of the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the\ninternational community was able to establish the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) in order to undertake the\nresponsibility of establishing frameworks for world trade in\nthe forthcoming decades. Now, with the advent of the\ntwenty-first century and the rise of economic\nglobalization, the international community has to set\nambitious goals, most notable of which are the eradication\nof poverty and the pursuit of economic and social\ndevelopment.\nAlthough the positive and constructive position taken\nrecently by the Group of Eight regarding the settlement of\nthe problems of indebtedness has created an atmosphere\nof confidence and satisfaction, two important points\nshould be stressed. First, the burden of repaying the\nremaining balances and the servicing of debts should not\ninterrupt the growth and integration of the national\neconomies concerned into the world economy. Secondly,\nit is essential to create a favourable environment for the\npromotion of economic and trade cooperation between\nStates on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and\nwithin a framework of transparency of capital markets, in\naddition to facilitating the transfer of technology and\nencouraging international investment, which would\nenhance development and growth for all, as well as\nfacilitating the equitable integration of the economies of\ndeveloping countries into the world economic system.\nThis will enable the world economy to avoid any other\nshocks that are liable to have a universal impact.\nThe State of Bahrain is pleased and willing to\ncontribute to international efforts aimed at achieving\nincreased international economic cooperation, due to its\nstability and strategic location, and the trade and\ninvestment environment it enjoys \u2014 elements that have\nhelped it attract foreign capital and enhance its standing\nas an advanced financial and commercial centre.\nWith the imminent approach of a new century, the\nworld has witnessed major historical changes precipitated\nby technological and scientific advances, a\ntelecommunications revolution, a rapid flow of\ninformation, a trend towards open global markets and a\nwidening scope of interaction between nations, cultures\nand civilizations. All this serves as a harbinger signalling\nthe advent of a better world for humanity as a whole. Yet,\nwhile we appreciate the positive aspects of such advance,\nwe are duty-bound to warn against the dangers that\naccompany those positive aspects. Those dangers raise the\nfollowing questions.\nTo what extent can poor countries benefit from the\ntechnological revolution? If they cannot, then the\nrevolution will serve only to widen the gap between the\npoor and the rich. To what extent can scientific advance\n20\n\n\nand globalization solve the various environmental problems\nthat endanger the entire world, if such a solution is not\nlinked to solving the problems of development in poor\ncountries, on the one hand, and to curbing and rationalizing\nconsumer and welfare trends in rich countries, on the other?\nTo what extent can globalization of capital flows and\nmarkets facilitate the flow of investments into developing\ncountries and boost their export capacities in a manner that\nwould enhance the development of their economies and\ntheir contributions to the world economy? To what extent\ncan the potential of such advance and globalization be\nutilized to help prevent the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction, address ethnic conflicts, settle disputes\nand eliminate the threat of international terrorism? To what\nextent can this advance and globalization be utilized to\nenhance opportunities for improving the quality of\neducation, culture and worldwide intercultural knowledge,\nwith a view to upholding the ideals of peace, equality and\nbrotherhood among the entire human race?\nWith the advent of the third millennium, it behoves us\nto consider and reflect upon the accomplishments of\nhumanity, on the one hand, and the horrible human\nsuffering that has beset thousands of individuals as a\nconsequence of disputes, conflicts and poverty, on the\nother. We believe that the United Nations is the principal\nforum for such reflection and consideration so that solutions\ncan be found for these disputes and conflicts. It is Bahrain\u2019s\nconviction, in this connection, that the international\ncommunity can enhance its standing and its values during\nthe next millennium and ensure a better destiny for itself,\nthrough the achievement of peace, security, solidarity and\ncooperation within a framework of universal human\npartnership and pluralism. Bahrain regards these elements\nas essential for the survival of the planet and calls for\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations system, as it is\nthe trustworthy custodian of our accomplishments and\naspirations, so that it can carry out its task to the fullest\nextent. We are confident that mankind can reach higher\nlevels of advancement, development and growth through\ncoordination and cooperation within the United Nations and\nother regional organizations. It is our hope that the new\nmillennium will usher in a new era of abundance wherein\nthe world will be endowed with security, peace and\nstability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate you warmly,\nMr. President, on your well-deserved election and to assure\nyou of the delegation of Monaco's full cooperation in\nassisting you in the discharge of your lofty mandate. Your\nrole in your country's exemplary struggle for independence\nand for the dignity of the Namibian people are deeply\nmeaningful for us.\nI should like also to thank the members of the General\nAssembly for entrusting to my country one of the vice-\npresidencies of this fifty-fourth session, at the same time as\nMonaco is commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the\naccession of His Most Serene Highness Prince Rainier\nIII \u2014 my father. I wish to assure the Assembly that the\ndelegation of Monaco will strive to be worthy of this\nhonour and to work closely with the other members of the\nBureau \u2014 whom I congratulate on their election \u2014 and the\nmembers of the Assembly, to ensure that this session, the\nlast of the century, produces effective, concrete and\ntangible results.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to thank also\nMr. Didier Opertti, President of the fifty-third session of\nthe General Assembly, for his dedication and accessibility\nand for the competence and diplomatic skill with which\nhe guided our work.\nI should like also to congratulate and warmly\nwelcome the three new States Members of the United\nNations \u2014 the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. The Government and\npeople of Monaco are particularly pleased to greet these\nthree countries of the Pacific, with which we share a\nnumber of concerns about the protection of the oceans\nand seas. We assure them of our readiness to enter into\nand develop a solid and fruitful cooperation with them.\nFinally, I should like most sincerely to express my\nsatisfaction, as many have already done from this rostrum,\nat the resumption of the peace process in the Middle East\nand the immense hopes to which it has given rise.\nSince the general debate of the previous session,\nmany distressing events have unfolded, some of which\nhave had serious consequences that will last for years.\nThe conflict in Kosovo, with the thousands of refugees\nand the massive suffering that it caused, was one of the\nmost obvious. The whole of the United Nations system\nwas mobilized, in a way that has certainly never happened\nbefore, to assemble the resources required to come to the\naid of the populations in distress. The armed intervention\nand the decisive role played by the International Criminal\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague, brought\nto bear in defence of the principles of humanity and\nhuman rights, seem to foreshadow a strengthened\ndetermination on the part of the international community\nto enforce respect for the fundamental values of justice\nand human dignity that inspired the San Francisco\nCharter.\nWe offer our sincere encouragement to the United\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo as it\nstrives, despite the major difficulties in its way, to\nimplement the provisions of Security Council resolution\n1244 (1999). We wish courage, perseverance and success\nto the men and women responsible for carrying out that\nnoble mandate of ensuring security, extinguishing the\nflames of hate and restoring good-neighbourly relations\namong the communities.\n12\n\n\nI should also like to emphasize the crucial role played\nby the United Nations in holding the election on self-\ndetermination in East Timor and in the protection operation\nthat our Organization has recently launched to come to the\naid of the civilian population there. We are following\ndevelopments on the ground extremely carefully, and we\nhope that implementation of Security Council resolution\n1264 (1999) will proceed without hindrance or delay.\nIn this context, we should recall the very enlightening\ndebate held by the Security Council on 12 February on the\nissue of the protection of civilians in armed conflict, during\nwhich the subject of internal conflicts, which have now\nbecome more numerous than those between States, was\ndiscussed at length. It was recalled that such conflicts fall\nunder the purview of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, whose\nfiftieth anniversary we have just commemorated, especially\nthe provisions of the Fourth Convention. Article 3, which\nis common to all four instruments, imposes rules of conduct\nthat are binding on the High-Contracting Parties, whatever\nthe circumstances and nature of the conflict. That article\ncategorically prohibits any kind of attack on the life and\nphysical and moral integrity of the person, as well as the\npassing of sentences and the carrying out of executions\nwithout previous judgement or indispensable judicial\nguarantees.\nOn 16 and 17 September, a further debate took place\nin the Security Council on the same issue, the positive\nresult of which was the adoption of resolution 1265 (1999),\nwhich makes considerable demands on both States and the\ninternational community as a whole. It stresses in particular\nthat it is incumbent on States to put and end to impunity\nand to prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes\nagainst humanity and serious violations of international\nhumanitarian law. The Principality of Monaco unreservedly\nendorses these recommendations, which we consider to be\nextremely important.\nWe have very high hopes for the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court as a means of better\npreventing war crimes and crimes against humanity. The\nPrincipality of Monaco was one of the first signatories of\nthe Statute, which was adopted last year.\nIn Kosovo, in East Timor and in conflicts that are\noften forgotten or that receive no recognition, particularly\nthose in Africa, it is the weakest and the most vulnerable,\nparticularly children, who suffer most. With the tenth\nanniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights\nof the Child taking place on 20 November, it is up to us\nnow more than ever to see to it that children, in peace as\nwell as in war, are strictly protected from all forms of\nviolence and subjugation. Following on from the\npresidential statement of June 1998, Security Council\nresolution 1261 (1999), adopted on 25 August, will, we\nhope, make a decisive contribution to resolving the\ndistressing problem of the fate of children in times of\narmed conflict.\nMy country, which is committed to that end, has\nbeen host to a number of international non-governmental\norganizations dedicated to the protection of children.\nThese associations are working hand in hand with the\nUnited Nations specialized agencies. For its part, the\nPrincipality of Monaco is actively contributing on a\nregular basis to steps taken to improve the lot of the most\ndisadvantaged children.\nJust as children need to be protected, women, too,\ndeserve the keenest attention from the international\ncommunity. Many forms of discrimination and\ninjustice \u2014 indeed, cruelty \u2014 including genital\nmutilation, which is the cause of much pain and\nhumiliation, are still too often tolerated. They represent a\nnumber of obstacles to women's achieving their full\npotential. In a report recently submitted to the\nSubcommission on the Promotion and Protection of\nHuman Rights, a non-governmental organization known\nfor its competence and precision denounced the\nunacceptable treatment still being endured by women in\nmany countries, be they young girls, wives or mothers. I\nshould like in this connection to emphasize the high\nregard in which we held the high-level debate that took\nplace in the Economic and Social Council last July on the\nrole of jobs and work in the elimination of poverty,\nemphasizing in particular the advancement of women.\nWomen's access to jobs, as well as to education and\nprofessional training, has been widely encouraged. It is\none of the areas of concern of the Government of the\nPrincipality, which is taking specific measures in the\nsocial and educational fields in order to deal with the\nissue. Respect for equality between men and women in\ndaily life, as well as in the development of their\nprofessional careers, in both public and private sectors, is\nessential if we are to improve the situation of women and\ncombat the precariousness and poverty that often affect\nthem much more than men. We are particularly aware of\nthat. The substantial involvement of women in political\nand economic decision-making can also contribute to\nensuring greater social justice, while stimulating and\nbalancing the economy. The authorities of my country are\nconvinced of this and are striving to take steps to adjust\n13\n\n\nand complete the legislation of Monaco so as to ensure that\nin every respect it is in conformity with the requirements of\nthe United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women, so that Monaco\ncan soon become a party to that essential instrument.\nBecause of the complexity and irrevocably globalized\nnature of today's economy, it has become necessary, now\nmore than ever, to achieve greater balance at both the\nnational and international levels. Existing inequalities,\nwhatever their origin, must necessarily be reduced to make\nsure that the dangerous gap separating the industrialized\ncountries from the most disadvantaged countries does not\ngrow wider. The Ministers of Economics and Finance of 44\nStates and Governments members of the International\nOrganization of La Francophonie were able to devote\nthemselves to that subject during their first meeting, which\ntook place in Monaco on 14 and 15 April last.\nThose leaders, like those who met in Geneva at the\nJuly substantive session of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, recognized that globalization, if poorly controlled,\ncould have serious consequences for the future of all\nnations. Stepped up trade and investment, and the adoption\nof policies of liberalization \u2014 sure engines of growth \u2014\nhave not yet enabled everyone to enjoy significant\ndevelopment. We must guard against some being barred\nfrom progress and from the benefits of the major trends in\nthe world economy, something that could have serious\nconsequences.\nAware of that danger and of the deterioration in\ninternational relations it could cause, ministers of the\neconomy or of finance of Francophone countries, meeting\nin Monaco, recognized the need for better supervision of\nthe human and social effects of ongoing economic\nprocesses, including structural adjustment policies. They\nstressed the importance of maintaining, or indeed\nincreasing, official development assistance, while adopting\nappropriate measures to encourage private investment. They\nindicated their grave concern at the unbearable burden of\nexternal debt for many countries. The Government of\nMonaco shares that grave concern.\nThe Monaco Declaration issued at the end of their\nmeeting by ministers of the economy or of finance of\nFrancophone countries solemnly recalled the fundamental\nlink among economic development, democracy and good\ngovernance. The Declaration stressed the importance of\nupcoming multilateral trade negotiations, noted the mission\nof the World Trade Organization to encompass all members\nof the international community, and stressed the importance\nof improving the international trading system so that it\nwill make a greater contribution to sustainable\ndevelopment and to meeting the real expectations of\npeoples. It also invited the world financial community to\nmaintain its assistance to development, through both\nofficial and private contributions.\nThe Principality of Monaco, which joined the\nIntergovernmental Agency of La Francophonie in\norganizing this first meeting, is committed to contribute\nactively to implementing the Monaco Declaration and to\nencourage the establishment of a permanent Francophone\ncentre for gathering and exchanging economic\ninformation; the recent summit of heads of State or\nGovernment of Francophone countries, held at Moncton,\nCanada, from 3 to 5 September, agreed to establish such\na centre in Monaco.\nSupported by many world leaders, the Jubilee 2000\ncampaign to cancel debts that the poorest countries are\nfinding it difficult to repay enjoys wide backing. Given\ncertain modifications, it seems to us to be of great\ninterest, if only because it will enable countries\nexperiencing great difficulties to resume unhindered\nprogress towards development. Here, my country's leaders\nare duly appreciative of the decision taken at Cologne last\nJune by the heads of State or Government of the seven\nmajor industrialized countries and of Russia to reduce\nsignificantly the external debt of some 40 such countries.\nI reaffirm Monaco's unswerving determination to\nmeet its international obligations and its firm commitment\nto the values of human rights and humanitarian principles,\nand wish to affirm that the highest authorities of my\ncountry are devoting close attention to progress in the\nsphere of disarmament. The limitation and reduction of\nnuclear weapons is a constant concern of the Government\nof the Principality. In our view, universal ratification of\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) \u2014 which, to our great satisfaction, was indefinitely\nextended in 1995 \u2014 should be promoted, as should the\ncomplete application of the comprehensive safeguards\nsystem of the International Atomic Energy Agency,\nwhose remarkable International Laboratory of Marine\nRadioactivity we have been honoured to host since 1986.\nThe year-2000 conference of States parties to the\nNPT will be decisive. Here, my country praises those\ncountries, some of them close friends, that have made\nmajor sacrifices to dismantle a portion of their nuclear\narsenals while taking great care with the processing of the\nfissile materials extracted from them. We unreservedly\n14\n\n\nshare the view of Governments that favour the formulation\nand adoption of international rules to prohibit the\nproduction of fissile materials intended for the production\nof nuclear weapons and explosives.\nThe Government of the Principality considers that\ncontrols intended to prevent transfers of materials and\nequipment that could be used for the manufacture of\nnuclear weapons should be strengthened, but it strongly\nfavours improved international cooperation for the peaceful\nuses of nuclear energy \u2014 given, of course, all the\nnecessary precautions with respect to environmental\nprotection.\nThe Principality of Monaco earnestly hopes for an\nearly end to all nuclear-weapons tests; the threat that these\nweapons pose to mankind has often, and rightly, been\ndenounced. We are convinced that the accession of all\nPowers to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) \u2014 which my father, the reigning Prince, ratified on\n20 November 1998 \u2014 would be a giant step towards\nlimiting these dreadful weapons of mass destruction. As a\nparty to the CTBT, the Principality would wish to see\ngreater commitment to that important treaty. We welcome\nthe existence of nuclear-weapon-free zones established on\nthe basis of arrangements freely entered into by the States\nof various regions, and hope that strengthening confidence\nand international security will ultimately lead to the spread\nof such zones.\nLet me recall the keen interest of the Principality of\nMonaco in the implementation of the 1993 Paris\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\non Their Destruction, to which my country has been a party\nsince 1 June 1995, and of the 1972 Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling\nof Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\nTheir Destruction, our instrument of accession to which was\ndeposited on 30 April 1999.\nMy country welcomes the measures adopted at\nMaputo, Mozambique, last May, at the first Meeting of\nStates Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction, which entered into force\nin Monaco on 15 March 1999.\nEngaged from the very beginning in the fight against\nthese deadly devices, which strike hardest at civilian\npopulations, particularly the elderly, women and children,\nMonaco signed and quickly ratified this instrument. My\ncountry is fully determined to continue its efforts to\ncontribute to eliminating these weapons once and for all.\nWhen, on 12 November 1998, the Principality of\nMonaco signed the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombing, it wanted to make a\nformal commitment and to place clearly on record its\nposition in this regard. Through me, Monaco confirms\nthat decision before the Assembly, once again\ncondemning all forms of terrorism, which blindly and\nmercilessly strikes too many innocents, as we have had\noccasion once again to note recently.\nIn this spirit, it is appropriate to pay a special tribute\nto the United Nations Mission in East Timor for the role\nit is playing and for the courage its representatives are\ndisplaying, notably the members of the international staff\nthat remained in place under the gravest of threats.\nIn this connection, I should like once again to\nforcefully reaffirm our complete solidarity with United\nNations personnel, some of whom this year have lost their\nlives, been injured, or suffered violence and other grave\noffenses. Monaco, which was among the first countries to\nratify the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and\nAssociated Personnel, deplores in the strongest terms and\ncondemns without reserve the inadmissible acts of\naggression and intimidation of which they have been\nvictims. We take this opportunity to salute the first among\nUnited Nations personnel, the Secretary-General, who\nenjoys our highest esteem for his actions at the head of\nthe Organization, particularly during periods of crisis and\nin the extremely difficult circumstances with which he is\nregularly confronted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased to convey\nto the President on behalf of the delegation of Gabon, our\nwarmest congratulations on his well-deserved election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession. In addition to the tribute his election pays to\nNamibia, it is eloquent testimony to both his personal and\nprofessional qualities. We hardly need to point out that he\nwas one of the principal architects of Namibia's\nindependence. Today, the President has the honour of\npresiding over the last Assembly session of the century and\nof leading the United Nations towards the new millennium.\nAllow me through you to assure him of my delegation's\ncomplete and wholehearted cooperation.\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Uruguay, I extend my deepest gratitude\nfor the work accomplished during his term of office.\nI congratulate the Secretary-General for his initiatives\nand actions towards peace and security worldwide.\nTo the three new Member States, the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga,\nwhich have just joined the great United Nations family, I\nconvey my warmest congratulations.\nI am convinced that this session will enable us to\nshare our thoughts on the increasingly complex challenges\nthat our Organization must face if it is to create the\nnecessary conditions for the maintenance of international\npeace and security and for economic and social\ndevelopment.\nWe are entering a major period of transition marked\nby the end of one century and the beginning of another,\nso it is beyond necessary for the international community\nto see to it that the new millennium is spared the scourges\nthat sap humankind's strength.\nDuring this century that is now coming to its end,\nthe world has undergone a rapid acceleration in the pace\nof history and a thorough transformation as a result of\ncombined effects of the explosion in the numbers of new\ntechnologies, the expansion of trade and the breathtaking\nincrease in the role played by markets. The scale of this\ntransformation, which affects all aspects of people's lives,\nis today so great that no nation can escape its influence.\nUnfortunately, nations are not all in the same boat:\nsome steadily accumulate progress and prosperity while\nothers seem destined to a bottomless pit of destitution. I\nam thinking here specifically about the African countries\nwhich, unlike the rest of the world, have not yet taken\nadvantage of the profound changes in the world, and\nwhose access to the so often trumpeted shared prosperity\nis denied. I am thinking also about one and a half billion\nmen and women around the world who live on less than\na dollar a day, and the billion adults who can neither read\nnor write. I am thinking too about the 300 million\nAfricans who eke out their lives in a state of abject\npoverty on the outer margins of the global village.\nAdd to this bleak picture the heavy burden of debt,\nwhich is strangling our economies, compromising any\nattempt at development and reducing us to the level of\nmodern-day slaves at the tender mercy of our creditors.\nThe budgetary resources allocated to service external\ndebt overwhelm all efforts to meet the most basic needs\nof our people. It is therefore crucial that the recurring\nproblem of debt should be considered not only in terms\nof socio-economic indicators but also taking into account\na State's efforts to combat poverty.\nWhile welcoming the recent initiative undertaken at\nCologne by the Group of Seven and Russia with a view\nto cancelling the debt of the most heavily indebted\ncountries, the Government of Gabon is nevertheless\ndisappointed by the fact that the eligibility criteria for\nthose countries are so restrictive; for it must be recalled\nthat debt, like poverty, is a constant threat to the stability\n22\n\n\nof States. Therefore, the burning question of global\nproportions that we must all face is how to take advantage,\nboth individually and collectively, of the current prodigious\nglobal prosperity and the enormous accumulation of wealth\ncreated by globalization in order to substantially reduce the\npoverty of nations and of their people.\nAs the Minister Fischer of Germany said recently,\n\u201cAfrica must not be a loser in globalization. The\nrich countries of the North have not only a duty, but\nalso an interest, in assisting their poorest neighbours\nin the southern hemisphere to seize the opportunities\nthat globalization offers them and to allow them to\nparticipate more equitably in the global economy\u201d.\nMy country feels that the time has come for the\ninternational community to seriously tackle the unavoidable\nproblem of the eradication of poverty, at least in its most\nextreme form. We share the firm conviction that our\nOrganization must promote, in the words of the Charter,\n\u201chigher standards of living, full employment, and\nconditions of economic and social progress and\ndevelopment\u201d.\nThis would be the first step towards eliminating the\nimbalances that are among the underlying causes of many\nconflicts around the world, for a world in which some make\nprogress while others fall behind carries within it the seeds\nof its own instability. Can we therefore move towards a\nnew concept of the idea of security that no longer focuses\non the security of nations alone, but that focuses above all\non the well-being of peoples? The sine qua non condition\nfor sparing future generations from the scourge of war is to\nmove from a culture of war towards a culture of peace.\nThere are genuine reasons to be concerned about peace\nand stability in the world. Maintaining international peace\nand security, a task assigned to our Organization, has been\nseverely put to the test by the outbreak and persistence of\na number of crises. In this regard, Africa has become the\nmain theatre of these devastating crises, which result in\ncountless victims, refugees and displaced persons.\nIn spite of this regrettable situation, we have seen\nsome encouraging signs concerning the restoration of peace\nin certain African subregions. The recent signing of the\npeace Agreement by all the parties to the conflict in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, including all the rebel\nmovements, now opens up the way for a lasting settlement\nof the conflict. We urge all the parties to translate into\naction the will they expressed in signing the Lusaka\nAgreement on 10 July 1999. It is now urgent for the\ninternational community, and for the Security Council in\nparticular, to take the necessary steps for the full\nimplementation of the Agreement without delay.\nIn the neighbouring Republic of the Congo, the\nauthorities have again recently expressed their willingness\nto engage in dialogue with the opposition. In return, the\nopposition has also made clear its intention to take part in\nan inter-Congolese dialogue in order to achieve lasting\npeace.\nThe recent Lom\u00e9 Agreement on Sierra Leone is also\na positive sign of a return of lasting peace to that country.\nMy country is pleased with the resumption of the\npeace process in the Middle East and urges the complete\napplication of the Wye Plantation agreements, as well as\nfull compliance with the agreements signed in the past.\nDespite all of this progress, we cannot overlook the\nfact that important efforts still have to made in Angola as\na result of UNITA's refusal to implement the Lusaka\nagreements.\nLikewise, despite the prospects that are beginning to\nappear, the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea\nstill remains a burning issue.\nAccording to the most recent report of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Somalia is, unfortunately, still without State\ninstitutions. The time has come to reintegrate that country\ninto the concert of nations.\nGuaranteeing lasting peace and security is today a\ncollective matter. Although the primary responsibility for\nthe maintenance of peace falls to the Security Council, it\nis appropriate for the United Nations to encourage the\ndevelopment of regional peacekeeping and security\nmechanisms, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the\nCharter. Significant progress has been made in Central\nAfrica in preventing and managing conflicts within the\nframework of the United Nations Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa. The\nimplementation of the early-warning mechanism and the\ncreation of the high council for peace and security in\nCentral Africa are perfect examples of this.\nIt is also worth mentioning the joint military\nexercises to be held by the member States of the\nCommittee in Gabon during the first half of the year 2000\n23\n\n\nto simulate peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, in\npreparation for the military exercises that will be held in\nGabon within the framework of strengthening African\npeacekeeping capabilities, a military-diplomatic seminar\ntook place in Libreville in June 1999, with the participation\nof 51 countries and international organizations.\nIn the last few weeks, the Security Council has held\npublic debates on such vital topics as children and civilians\nin armed conflicts. And five days ago, I had the honour of\nparticipating in another public debate of the Security\nCouncil on small weapons. This matter is part of the United\nNations efforts to work towards complete disarmament.\nIndeed, the illegal circulation of massive quantities of light\nand small-calibre weapons in the world hampers\ndevelopment and represents a real threat to international\npeace and security. The nature of these weapons\nunfortunately helps fuel the sad and widely condemned\nphenomenon of the use of children as combatants in the\nmany conflicts that break out around the world. The same\napplies to large-scale banditry.\nIn any case, we cannot envision a world at peace if\nthe international community does not actively mobilize to\nhelp developing countries emerge from the vicious circle of\nunderdevelopment-violence-underdevelopment. If luck has\nheretofore spared us from the horrors of war, Gabon is not\nimmune to the backlash of the armed conflicts that plague\nsome of our neighbours. As Security Council resolution\n1208 (1998) clearly indicates, asylum countries pay a heavy\nprice for their solidarity with people driven out of their\nhomes as a result of combat. The consequences of refugee\nflows on the security, environment and economies of host\ncountries are sometimes incalculable, especially when the\npresence of combatants among the refugees is used as an\nexcuse for troops to carry out raids in the host country.\nEven though we live in peace and have never\nexperienced a domestic or inter-State war, Gabon\nnevertheless shoulders its share of the burdens of war. We\nare facing massive migratory flows that are leading to\nserious internal upheavals, and we recently welcomed some\n50,000 refugees.\nGiven the extent of the situation, for which my\ncountry was not prepared, the President of the Republic of\nGabon organized on 11 August last a mini-summit in\nLibreville with the participation of a number of his peers\nfrom the subregion. That summit considered the possibility\nof Africans' taking greater control of the question of\nrefugees and displaced persons, with the support of the\ninternational community.\nOn that occasion, President Bongo proposed the\ncreation of an African agency for emergency humanitarian\nintervention. I would urgently appeal to the international\ncommunity to provide greater assistance to African\nrefugees. We strongly hope that an emergency programme\ncan be set up that would relieve their suffering and\nfacilitate their return to their country of origin. The\ninternational community has the means to do so, as it has\nproved in other situations.\nI would like to take advantage of this opportunity to\npay warm tribute to Mrs. Sadako Ogata, United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, who, during the\ninternational action taken in favour of Kosovo, heightened\nthe international community's awareness of the particular\nsituation of African refugees.\nLet me now tackle the question of development from\nthe perspective of my country's experience. As in other\nAfrican countries, the socio-economic situation of Gabon\nis precarious. I shall not then resort to clich\u00e9s such as\nsaying that my country is an \u201cAfrican emirate\u201d because of\nour potential in raw materials, to the extent that today we\nare the only sub-Saharan nation to be classified by\ninternational financial and monetary institutions as an\nupper-middle-income country. As a result, we are denied\naccess to flexible conditions for our loans and for our\ndebt service.\nHowever, the Human Development Index, which\nplaces us in 124th place, clearly shows that Gabon is in\na very similar situation to that of other African countries.\nThat is why we have undertaken all of the necessary\nstructural reforms to join the global economy and to\nparticipate in subregional and regional integration. We\nhave liberalized our economy by lifting tariff and non-\ntariff barriers and restrictions as well as by instituting\ncustoms and tax reform. We have privatized our principal\nsemi-public corporations in order to make them more\neffective and competitive. We have created a new\njuridical and institutional environment that is stable and\nwill encourage investment and promote the expansion of\nthe private sector. Finally, we have set up effective\nprovisions for cooperation and regional integration in the\nframework of the Economic and Monetary Community of\nCentral Africa and of the Economic Community of\nCentral African States.\nThe stage has been set, but the actors \u2014 meaning\nthe investors \u2014 have not yet made their entrance. Foreign\ndirect investment has thus far systematically avoided our\ncontinent.\n24\n\n\nWe feel, however, that the world economy stands to\ngain by taking advantage of the immense potential of the\nAfrican market, which will soon have a billion consumers\nin a continent that is overflowing with oil, gold, diamonds\nand other raw materials required by industries of the North.\nMy country's leadership is dedicated to the promotion\nof democracy and the institutions that guarantee it\u2014 hence\nall of the political changes we have experienced and are\nexperiencing, which have made Gabon an example of a\nsmooth transition from a single-party regime to political\npluralism.\nIt is against this backdrop that recently, in the\npresence of international observers and for the second time\nsince the advent of political pluralism, free and fair\npresidential elections were held in my country. The\nPresident of the Republic, El Hadj Omar Bongo, was re-\nelected in a peaceful social and political context, a\nguarantee of democratic legitimacy.\nDemocracy which is accompanied by good\ngovernance, the rule of law and respect for human rights is\nthe most important factor in the transition towards a culture\nof peace. For lasting peace is a prerequisite for the exercise\nof all the rights and obligations of peoples, and it is the\nonly soil in which democracy and development can take\nroot.\nIt is therefore up to the United Nations system and its\nMember States to ensure that these goals and principles, so\ndear to us, become a reality for all in the new millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation is delighted to\ncongratulate the President on his election. My delegation's\nhearty congratulations are made even warmer as he has the\nprivilege and the honour to take the fifty-fourth session, as\nPresident of the General Assembly, from the twentieth into\nthe twenty-first century. A similar unique place in history\nwill not be observed for another hundred years. We are\nconfident, in view of his past heroic leadership of the South\nWest Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), and now as\nthe Foreign Minister of Namibia, he will conduct our\ndeliberations with vision and dynamism.\nMy delegation also wishes to express our grateful\nappreciation to Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay for his skilful\nand productive conduct of the proceedings of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session.\nMy delegation welcomes to the family of nations the\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\nKingdom of Tonga and offers hearty congratulations.\nAs the curtain makes its slow descent upon the\ntwentieth century, bringing it to its inevitable close, there is\na prevailing mood of reflection and anticipation. Rightly so,\nas a connection between past, present and future is being\nmade, for we cannot appreciate the present without\nknowledge of the past if we hope to ensure the future. And\nindeed, historically speaking, the past is never past, for\nwhat is past is prologue.\nIn retrospect, for some developing countries the period\nof the 1980s was considered a lost decade because of the\nheavy burden of debt servicing, falling commodity prices,\nnegative economic growth, unemployment and structural\nadjustment. In the 1990s, the catchwords seemed to be\n\u201csustainable development\u201d, \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d,\n\u201cgood governance\u201d, \u201cglobalization\u201d, and \u201cpoverty\nalleviation\u201d. These phrases seem to be the legacy of the\ncluster of United Nations summits of the 1990s: the\nConference on Environment and Development in 1992, on\nHuman Rights in 1993, on Small Island Developing States\nin 1994, on Population and Development in 1994, on Social\nDevelopment in 1995, on Women in 1995, on Human\nSettlements in 1996 and on Food Security in 1996. In all\nthese high-level meetings, the centrality of the human\nperson in sustainable social, economic, and cultural\ndevelopment was emphasized.\nGrenada believes that the concept of sustainable\ndevelopment is shared responsibility on the part of\ndeveloped and developing countries. Its global character\nmust be recognized so that there can be more sharing of\nknowledge, ideas, information and resources.\nConsequently, the region from which I come, the\nCaribbean, strongly urges our more developed partners\nurgently to make available new and additional sources of\nfunding and technological transfer to enable us to comply\nwith the obligations the international Conventions demand\nof us. In short, the concepts of the global village and\nglobalization should be premised on giving, caring and\nsharing.\nSustainable development is not possible without\nrespect for the whole range of human rights \u2014 economic,\nsocial, cultural, civil and political. Indeed, human rights\nare meaningless in an environment of poverty and\ndeprivation. The United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, has said, aptly, that\nperhaps the largest scale of human rights violations today\nis the fact that one fifth of humanity lives in absolute\npoverty. World Bank estimates reveal that over 35 per\ncent of people in the Caribbean basin live below the\npoverty line. This situation threatens the very existence of\ncivil societies there.\nMoreover, the plight of certain small Caribbean\nStates is further compounded by the World Trade\nOrganization's inhumane rulings over the European Union\nbanana regime. We are still baffled over the attitude of\nour traditional ally and certain friendly Latin American\ncountries over the modified version of the banana regime.\nWe are hopeful, though, that a satisfactory compromise\nwill be arrived at soon. If so, the economies of the small,\nbanana-producing countries would be saved from the\nshocks of a banana industry become non-existent.\nI stress that there is an urgent need to unite our\nefforts in a common framework to alleviate the problems\nassociated with critical poverty in order to restore some\nform of human dignity in our countries.\nTo the observer with no inside knowledge of the\nworking of the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies, the series of meetings to review what has\nalready been reviewed, and perhaps in some cases already\nimplemented, seem as complex as quantum physics and\nexercises in repetitive and confusing rhetoric.\nNevertheless, since the conceptual and structural\nframework of sustainable development is shared\nresponsibility, my delegation is hopeful that the recently-\n24\n\n\nended special session to review the implementation of the\n1994 Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States has given\nsome impetus to the creation of this global partnership we\nall desire. We are equally hopeful that the project proposals\nsubmitted by Grenada will be favourably considered and\nappropriate funding made available to execute them.\nThe Caribbean Sea is a unique body of water\nbordering a large number of States, with overlapping\nexclusive economic zones, vulnerable to the elements of\nnature and also to man-made disasters. The Caribbean Sea\nis indisputably the lifeblood of the countries of the\nCaribbean Community \u2014 one half of whose population\nlives on the coastline, where 20 per cent of the regional\ngross domestic product is produced \u2014 and provides\nemployment for more than 25 per cent of the labour force\nin tourism and the fishing industry. Sustainable\nmanagement and development of the Caribbean Sea and its\nresources would benefit not only the Caribbean people but\nalso the international community as a whole.\nMoreover, recognition of the Caribbean Sea as a\nspecial area within the context of sustainable development\nwould provide the jurisdictional authority necessary to\ncontrol the passage of ships carrying toxic and hazardous\nwastes and chemical and radioactive materials in Caribbean\nwaters. My delegation urges this special recognition of the\nCaribbean Sea for all of the reasons I have stated.\nWe are mindful that we do not own the Earth; we are\nsimply holding it in trust for succeeding generations. We\nare admonished not to treat the land with contempt and\nremember that from it we came and to it we shall return.\nGrenada is absolutely clear about its commitment to\nthe principles of the United Nations and therefore reveres\nthe ideals which informed those principles. Grenada thus\nplaces a premium on fairness and justice in the conduct of\ninternational affairs. It is in this context that the\nGovernment of Grenada wishes to request that a fresh look\nbe taken at United Nations General Assembly resolution\n2758 (XXVI) of 1971, as a matter of simple justice and\nfairness to the people of the Republic of China. This\nhumanitarian-minded and democratically inclined country\nhas used its hard-earned resources to help developing\ncountries to help themselves, by providing training,\nexpertise and capital for developmental projects and other\nforms of technical assistance in several critical areas. The\nnoble efforts of the Republic of China reminds one of the\ngreat Chinese philosopher, Confucius, and his thoughts on\ngiving a man a fish and teaching a man to fish, Grenada\napplauds the sacrifices of the Republic of China in this\nregard.\nIndeed, the Republic of China has wrought an\neconomic miracle, to the point where it is the fourteenth\nmost important trading country and its foreign reserves\nrank among the top in the world.\nThe international community cannot simply ignore\nthe aspirations of such a dynamic and generous people,\nand should thus ensure that the fundamental right of the\n22 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to\nparticipate in the activities of the United Nations be fully\nrespected.\nEqually, in the name of humanity and justice,\nGrenada calls for the lifting of the economic embargo\nagainst the Republic of Cuba. World opinion is definitely\nswayed towards this, and consequently overwhelming\nsupport is given year after year to the relevant resolutions\nat the United Nations on this issue. Sadly, though,\nenforcement is still outstanding. As we are about to close\nanother chapter in the history of mankind, we appeal to\nthe Government of the United States of America to once\nmore take the lead in showing its humane qualities and\nease the pain and suffering of ordinary Cubans. It should\ntherefore suspend all sanctions unconditionally.\nAs we look to the new century we must urge that\nthere be a Middle East of peaceful coexistence,\nparticularly between Israel and the Palestinians.\nWe certainly hope that past events in the Balkans \u2014\nparticularly in Yugoslavia \u2014 will not be repeated; and\nthat the principle of self-determination will be respected\nglobally, the situation in East Timor being a case in point;\nthat the various pockets of conflict around the world will\nbe resolved amicably; and that any changes contemplated\nwithin the United Nations system will take into account\nthe concerns and aspirations of smaller nations.\nGrenada believes that, with the collective efforts of\nall States and the purposeful involvement of the United\nNations, democracy, social justice, good governance,\nsolidarity and the economic prosperity of all our Members\ncould be achieved.\n25\n\n\nFinally, my country extends its concern and sympathy\nto the victims of the earthquake in Turkey and, more\nrecently, to our friends in the Republic of China on Taiwan,\na country so helpful to us in the promotion of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nWe are also mindful of the situation in East Timor and\nhope that as soon as order and security are restored,\nindependence, for which the majority voted, will take root."

        "file_text": "In taking the floor\non behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Benin, I\nwould like first of all to express my heartiest\ncongratulations to the entire Bureau of the fifty-fourth\nsession of the General Assembly. I would also like to\nexpress my satisfaction at seeing the Foreign Minister of\nNamibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, presiding over the\nAssembly at this session, the last of the century and of the\nclosing millennium.\nAt a time when the United Nations more than ever is\ncalled upon to act in the interest of the peace and well-\nbeing of humankind, Benin takes pride in seeing a\nrepresentative of Africa holding that important post. I\nwould assure him of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation and\nsupport, for it will be under his enlightened presidency that\nthe Organization will stride forward into the twenty-first\ncentury. We see this felicitous and remarkable coincidence\nas a definite assurance of the success of the important\ndebates we will be holding and a sign of hope that the\ndecisions to be taken will so direct our actions as to ensure\nthat the coming century is one of peace, progress and\ndevelopment, for the African continent in particular.\nAllow me at this stage to pay tribute to Mr. Didier\nOpertti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, for the\noutstanding work he did in the service of the Organization\nthroughout the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\nI wish also to pay a highly deserved tribute to our brother,\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, for the unstinting devotion that he has\ndemonstrated since his election and for the undeniable\nsuccesses that he has achieved for the United Nations in\nparticularly difficult circumstances.\nI should like here to reaffirm the full support and\nconfidence of the Government of Benin as we pursue the\nlofty and legitimate goal of giving the United Nations the\nmeans of tackling the challenges that await us on the\nthreshold of the first century of the new millennium.\nI should like also to congratulate and warmly\nwelcome the three new States Members of the United\nNations \u2014 the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\nThis session of the General Assembly is beginning\nat a particularly important moment in the history of\nhumankind, for, after a century of deeds and events\nfraught with all kinds of consequences, the entire\ninternational community is preparing to move forward\ninto the first century of a new millennium. We who have\nbeen privileged to witness this twofold historical\ntransition should not ignore the great responsibility that\nwe have borne throughout the century that is now closing\nand the equal responsibility that we will have to shoulder\nthroughout the one that is about to begin.\nThe challenges that face us are many and range\nacross all human areas of activity. It is our conviction that\nif we so desire, we can make the next century an era of\npeace, security, development, understanding and concord\namong peoples. In order to do this, we will have to\npromote and strengthen worldwide cooperation, in\nparticular in tackling the serious problems that the century\nthat is now ending will have bequeathed to the one that\nis now beginning.\nCombating poverty should, it seems to me, be one of\nour priorities, because poverty is a factor of\ndestabilization and a source of conflict and war,\nparticularly in Africa.\nThe holding of the millennium summit in September\n2000 will be a historic opportunity for us to strive to\nstrengthen peace, security and stability, for which all\npeoples of the world yearn.\nWe could hardly overemphasize the close\nrelationship among development, peace, security,\ndemocracy and human rights, and we all share the\nresponsibility of day by day translating these words into\nreality. We can overcome poverty.\n30\n\n\nThe international community is in a position to put an\nend to the atrocities and the savagery that have been on the\nrise recently in all continents. To this end, it is essential for\nthe process of revitalization, restructuring and\ndemocratization in the world Organization, begun under the\nauthority of the Secretary-General, to be continued so as to\nenhance its effectiveness in carrying out the urgent tasks\nthat it will face at the beginning of the third millennium.\nBenin is at peace within its borders, with its\nneighbours and with the whole of the international\ncommunity. But we are seriously disturbed by the appalling\nconflicts that continue to devastate and destabilize our\ncontinent.\nWe are ready to continue to support the efforts of\nAfrica itself and those of the great Powers in the context of\nthe prevention, settlement and sustainable management of\nconflicts.\nHere I wish to pay tribute to the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and certain subregional organizations\nsuch as the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) and the Southern African Development\nCommunity for their bold initiatives aimed at bringing\npeace and security to Africa.\nI have no wish to forget or to minimize the\ncontribution of other countries, but I wish in particular to\npay tribute here to the tremendous sacrifices made by the\npeoples of West Africa and in particular by the people of\nNigeria in the context of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG) to help the West African subregion to put an\nend to war and insecurity, which hamper development and\neconomic progress.\nI wish also to welcome the bold resolutions adopted\nby the Heads of States at the OAU Summit in Algiers, as\nwell as the initiatives of the subregional organizations in\nWest Africa and in the Great Lakes region, which attest to\nstrengthened political resolve to reverse the course of\nevents in a positive and constructive direction. These\nendeavours deserve to be sustained and strengthened by\ninternational solidarity.\nThe example of Kosovo is there to remind us of the\nkey importance of prompt and determined action on the\npart of the international community in order to restore and\nmaintain peace. The distressing events in East Timor are\nanother eloquent example of this.\nAllow me in all honesty to state here that human\nrights are universal and indivisible. If we wish to build a\nunited and peaceful international community, let us not\nintroduce into the defence, protection and promotion of\nhuman rights any conditionalities or preferences, be they\ngeographical, cultural, geostrategic or others.\nIn this age of rapid globalization, we must realize\nthat the risk of marginalizing the weakest economies and\nthe most vulnerable peoples is very real; it is a mortal\ndanger. Fortunately, there is still time to avert it. If we\nare to succeed, our vision for the twenty-first century and\nour prospects for the future must be clarified and\nstrengthened by the effective implementation of the\nvarious plans and programmes of action adopted since the\nbeginning of this decade within the framework of the\nUnited Nations system.\nIn this context, the situation of the developing\ncountries, the least developed countries in particular,\ndeserves more attention from the international community,\nwhich should endeavour to create favourable conditions\nfor those countries to develop. In this respect, we cannot\nevade the anguished question of the future of Africa on\nthe threshold of the third millennium, particularly given\nthe debt burden and the deterioration in the terms of\ntrade. These are sad realities which are killing at least as\nmany people as are dying from AIDS.\nFortunately indeed, Africa can cease to be the\ncontinent of bad news. Today, it has the ability and the\nwill to make it so. Throughout the decade that is now\ndrawing to a close, the international community has\nrepeatedly stated that Africa must be a priority. Mindful\nof the need for that continent to achieve economic\nprogress, the United Nations has worked out appropriate\nstrategies and embarked on specific development\nprogrammes. But none of those initiatives will have any\nimpact on the development of the continent if African\ncountries themselves, supported by their development\npartners, do not redouble their efforts to carry out the\nnecessary reforms and mobilize the necessary resources.\nWhile we clearly reaffirm our own responsibility, we\nmust also say that for Africa better economic performance\nnecessarily involves a rapid and lasting solution to the\nproblems caused by external debt; inputs of the new and\nadditional financial resources required to meet the\ngrowing need for funding; transfers of new and\nappropriate technology; promotion of a genuine, open and\nfair system of international trade; and appropriate\nincentives for our efforts to diversify and modernize our\n31\n\n\neconomies. What we need in this age of globalization is a\ngenuine solidarity pact.\nThis new partnership with Africa should set out to\nenable all African countries to enjoy the benefits of\nglobalization. This implies mobilizing and pooling the\nefforts of the whole international community, inspired by\nthe same vision of a common destiny and a new philosophy\nof sharing. That vision of development prompted the\nGovernment of Benin to host, in February 1999 in Cotonou,\na conference of United Nations Development Programme\nResident Representatives working in Africa to consider the\nproblems of development in Africa in the coming\nmillennium. The conference identified the major problems\nthat African countries face at the close of the twentieth\ncentury: social and political upheaval; poverty; problems of\naccess in meeting essential social needs; population\npressure; the debt burden; and economic marginalization,\namong others. The conference also highlighted the assets\nand potential of the continent: significant natural and human\nresources; cultural wealth; a spirit of sharing; and a sense\nof solidarity.\nAccordingly, the conference recommended another\napproach for Africa's development, based on the promotion\nof peace and security within and between States; real\nintegration of Africa into the world economy; and the\ncreation of an African regional observatory for\nglobalization. It would be regrettable if these highly lucid\nand relevant analyses and findings came to nothing because\nthe United Nations Development Programme itself is stifled\nby a lack of resources.\nIn keeping with those recommendations, Benin,\ntogether with several other African countries, has\nundertaken far-reaching political and economic reforms to\nimprove the living and working conditions of its people,\nparticularly those in rural areas. The measures include\naction to stabilize public finances, liberalize the economy,\ndevelop the private sector, stimulate economic growth,\ncombat corruption and preserve social peace and political\nstability through the establishment of a State based on the\nrule of law that respects democratic principles and\nfundamental rights and freedoms.\nAgainst that background we are striving, tirelessly and\nresolutely, to ensure that the democratic process takes firm\nroot in Benin. Our young democracy has just successfully\ncompleted an electoral process culminating in the renewal\nof Parliament before the deadline set by the Constitution. In\na few months' time we will be holding local elections to\nelect mayors and councillors to help entrench democracy\nat the grass-roots level.\nHowever, despite these significant efforts and\nsacrifices, we know that our political and economic\nstructures will continue to be fragile and vulnerable so\nlong as poverty and disease continue to lay waste to our\ntowns and countryside, so long as HIV/AIDS is not\nconquered or, at least, contained at the same levels as in\nEurope and America, and so long as insecurity and\nappalling internal and regional conflicts continue to undo\nthe work of the African peoples and enrich a few arms\nmanufacturers and traffickers.\nI should like to extend the recognition and gratitude\nof the people and Government of Benin to all its\ndevelopment partners, to the Powers which have realized\nthat today poverty more than ever is a matter for all of\nus, wherever it may be found, and that violations of\nhuman rights involve us all wherever they may take\nplace. I wish once again to express our thanks to all those\nwho are assisting us in our activities aimed at making\nBenin, indeed Africa in general, a haven of peace,\npolitical stability and successful, integrated development.\nDuring its fifty-first session, the General Assembly\naccepted Benin's offer to hold the Fourth International\nConference of New or Restored Democracies and\nencouraged it to do so, no doubt because of our efforts,\nwhich I have just outlined, to maintain peace, democracy\nand the constitutional rule of law. I am convinced that the\nfourth International Conference of New or Restored\nDemocracies \u2014 the first that Africa will have the honour\nand privilege of hosting, following the conferences held\nin the Philippines, Nicaragua and Romania \u2014 will be an\nopportunity for all the friends of Africa \u2014 indeed, all the\nfriends of democracy \u2014 to pool their experience and to\nwork together to consolidate a political system that,\n32\n\n\nunfortunately, is not yet the most widespread of\nphenomena. The Cotonou conference, scheduled for early\nDecember 2000, can have significance and impact only if\nall democrats agree to make a sincere contribution; this\nwould enable democracy all over the world to take a crucial\nqualitative leap forward.\nFor this reason, I fervently appeal to all those of\ngoodwill, and to all development partners eager that\ndemocracy, the rule of law and good governance should be\nsolidly established in every one of our States and on all\ncontinents, to lend their material and financial support and\ntheir experience to the preparation, organization and\nconvening of the Cotonou conference. We earnestly hope\nthat the Cotonou conference will enable us to build on\nexisting achievements in the maintenance of international\npeace and security.\nPeace, security and sustainable human development\nare the themes that my delegation would like to see as the\nbanner of this session of the General Assembly, the last\nbefore the year 2000: peace above all, so that the founding\ncry of this Organization, \u201cnever again\u201d, may in the new\nmillennium become a reality for all peoples and for all\nindividuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "As the curtain falls on\nthe twentieth century, this time-honoured institution, the\nUnited Nations, rejoices in the presence of two\ndistinguished Africans at the helm. The outstanding\nfreedom fighter of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab\noccupies our presidential perch, while our principled,\npurposeful and persuasive Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\nlike the proverbial Ol\u2019 Man River, keeps rolling along,\nrelentlessly serene in his pursuit of world peace and\nhuman development. If Africa is the last impression of\nthe twentieth century, poetic justice demands that it must\nbe our first preoccupation in the twenty-first century. This\ninternational forum must readjust the balance over\ncenturies. We must pay for our dereliction of duty over\nRwanda and the Congo. We must remove the remaining\nvestige of apartheid, and we must make a quantum leap\nin eliminating poverty and disease by addressing the\ncauses of poverty.\nThe Caribbean has always leapt over the restrictions\nof size and resources to embrace the global vision of a\nliberated world, and the liberation of Africa plays a\n24\n\n\nseminal role in this process. Caribbean thinkers such as\nPadmore, C.L.R. James, Professor Arthur Lewis, Dr. Eric\nWilliams and Dr. Walter Rodney have all sought to\nsensitize the world to the catalytic role which Africa must\nplay in global development.\nWe recognize, however, that an essential condition for\nfulfilling this role must be the overcoming of the\nunderdevelopment that plagues that continent. But if we are\nto progress in that direction, we must first boldly admit that\ndisunity among the countries of Africa has much to do with\nthis condition. In an era when other geographic regions and\ncontinents have been uniting for economic advancement,\nthe African continent remains divided. The time has come,\ntherefore, for the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to\ngo further than just making declarations of unity. Pan-\nAfricanism must not continue to remain stunted, as it was\nat the threshold of the sixties. African leaders and statesmen\nmust show the resolve and the unwavering character of\nNelson Mandela, and give African children, born and\nunborn, hope in the future of Africa.\nIn this regard, the results of the recent Algiers summit\nof the OAU are therefore most welcome, for the summit\nhas demonstrated a new sense of urgency and commitment\non the part of the new leaders of Africa. The United\nNations must not fail to support this progressive\ndevelopment. For our part, Saint Lucia, mindful of the\nAfrican heritage of our people, will exhort our Caribbean\ncolleagues to consider applying for associate status with the\nOAU and to consolidate further our solidarity in the\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) forum.\nOur call for unity is not being sent only to our\nbrothers in Africa. It goes out also to all developing\ncountries, be they in the Caribbean, Latin America, Asia or\nelsewhere. If we in the developing world are to have a\nbetter future in the new millennium, if we are to obtain any\nbenefits from the new international systems that are\nevolving around us, we cannot depend only on the goodwill\nof the countries of the developed world. There must be\nunity of action and purpose among us; there must be an end\nto the in-fighting, the skirmishes, and the wars between us.\nThe South-South Summit in Havana next year will provide\nan excellent opportunity for cementing solidarity on issues\nof common concern and deciding on a forward-looking\nagenda for the development of our people.\nIn the Commonwealth Caribbean, we the members of\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) can be proud of\nthe 25-year integration movement in which we have been\nengaged. We are in the process of completing arrangements\nfor the creation of a single market and economy and for\nthe establishment of a Caribbean court of justice that will\nbe the final appellate court for CARICOM member\ncountries. But, certainly, we must recognize that while we\nhave made progress, we have not gone far enough. In\nOctober, the heads of Government of the Caribbean\nCommunity will meet in a special session in Trinidad and\nTobago to consider the future governance of the\nCaribbean Community. We urge the leaders of\nCARICOM, in what will be their final meeting of the\ncentury, to take decisions on the future of CARICOM that\nwill erase from the memories of West Indian people all\nthe hurt, all the pain, all the disappointments of our failed\nattempts at closer political union during this century. Let\nthe occasion for their October meeting be the springboard\nthat catapults West Indians into what will truly be a new\nera. Let our people enter the new millennium with a\nCARICOM that will be fully integrated, economically and\npolitically.\nWe can extend this tableau to embrace the Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories of our region. My Government was\npleased to have hosted, in May of this year, the annual\nUnited Nations seminar of the Special Committee on\nDecolonization to review the economic, political and\nconstitutional developments in the remaining small island\nNon-Self-Governing Territories. This highly successful\nseminar brought together representatives from\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations and\nexperts from the Caribbean and Pacific regions. This\nimportant activity resulted in the adoption by the Special\nCommittee of targeted recommendations in the\nfurtherance of the decolonization of these Territories. To\nthis end, we strongly support a second decade on\ndecolonization to focus on the socio-economic, political\nand constitutional development of the remaining small\nisland Territories, which are integral components of both\nthe Caribbean and the Pacific regions.\nBut the realization of these regional goals turns on\nthe full emergence of Cuba as a vital and creative force\nin the integration and development of the Caribbean. This\nemergence is frustrated by the inability of the United\nNations to harness the political will to remove the\ninhumane sanctions imposed by the United States on the\nCuban people, despite the successive overwhelming votes\nreligiously taken every year in the Assembly. At the fifty-\nthird session of the General Assembly, 157 countries\nvoted in favour of resolution 53/4 to end the economic\nembargo against Cuba. The totally callous disregard for\nthe cumulative will of the Assembly is the touchstone\nwhich characterizes the relationship between the super-\n25\n\n\nPower leviathan and the 187 Lilliputian nations that talk\nand vote in this forum. Where is the democracy of which\nwe speak? Where is the mutual respect for sovereign\nnations? Where is the humanity?\nThe events in Rwanda, Kosovo and East Timor have\ndrawn serious lessons for the international community. The\nspectre of an effete United Nations looking on helplessly\nwhile Member nations intervene unilaterally is a nightmare\non the eve of the new millennium. It is for this reason that\nSaint Lucia strongly supports the call by Secretary-General\nKofi Annan for the United Nations to be empowered to\ntake action, whether militarily or otherwise, to stop crimes\nagainst humanity.\nSaint Lucia remains concerned at the systematic\nweakening and marginalization of the United Nations. In\nthis regard, attention is drawn to its operational activities\nand its development programmes, particularly the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP). We call on\ndonor countries to reconsider the effects of the budget cuts\non regional and country programmes.\nWe need a United Nations that not only carries out its\npeacekeeping and humanitarian capacities, but one that also\nplays a central role in the governance of globalization and\ntrade liberalization to ensure that globalization is about\ndevelopment.\nOur common humanity must demonstrate itself in our\nprompt response to natural disasters in each other's\ncountries. The people of Taiwan have been the most recent\nvictims of devastating earthquakes, which claimed the lives\nof thousands of innocent people. We commiserate with\nthem. It is at such critical moments that the spirit of\nbrotherhood must emerge. There was a surge of hope at the\nnews that the People's Republic of China had pledged\nassistance to the Taiwanese across the Taiwan Strait. Let us\nhope that the Creator is working in a mysterious way to\nbring about the peaceful and mutually agreeable\nreunification of the Chinese people on this occasion of the\nfiftieth anniversary of China.\nOur own island State of Montserrat continues to\nstruggle to recover from the destruction caused by volcanic\neruptions. Yet the international community continues to\nexclude this small island from concessional assistance on\nthe basis of its high gross national product per capita,\ncalculated from its small population and inflows of\nassistance, mainly from the United Kingdom. The United\nNations, in particular the Committee for Development\nPolicy, must take the lead role in the revision of the criteria\nfor concessional assistance to include vulnerabilities and\nqualitative data including openness of the economy and\neconomic shocks. The sustainable development of small\ndeveloping countries will remain a dream unless these\nfundamental structural and systemic biases are addressed.\nSaint Lucia is particularly concerned about the\nexclusion of transnational corporations from the rules of\nengagement the World Trade Organization (WTO) sets\nfor trade, since a large percentage of the financing for our\ndevelopment comes from trade in one commodity. Saint\nLucia will continue to call for an integrated approach to\nthe consideration of trade and finance in the context of\nthe upcoming conference on financing for development\nand for the participation of all actors, including the\nBretton Woods institutions and the WTO, under the\nleadership of the United Nations.\nThe dispute over the arrangements for the marketing\nof bananas has been particularly distasteful. People in\nmember countries of the European Union are being\npunished through sanctions by the United States for the\nsupport of their Governments for the banana marketing\nregime. That country continues to promote the interests of\nits multinational companies involved in the banana trade\nat the expense of smaller economies. There are at the\nmoment proposals on the table designed to put in place a\nnew WTO-compatible system for the marketing of\nbananas in Europe. All parties, particularly producing\ncountries, are of the view that a tariff rate quota system\nis the most viable regime for all concerned. A\ncontinuation of the tariff rate quota is essential for\nensuring that the market continues to generate adequate\nprices.\nYet the United States transnationals engaged in the\nindustry are instead promoting a simple or linear tariff\nmechanism that will have disastrous effects for Caribbean\nproducers. Saint Lucia and other ACP countries have\nexpressed dissatisfaction with this recommendation. We\nagain implore all European Union member States to\nrevisit this choice and to consider its implications for\nSaint Lucia and other ACP countries. We are inherently\nunequal trading partners, and the WTO should not subject\nsmall economies to liberalization and unbridled\ncompetition on an equal footing with economies and\ncorporations far more advanced than they are and expect\nthem to survive. Saint Lucia again calls on the\ninternational community, including the WTO, to\ndifferentiate between trading partners and promote fair\ntrade through special and differential treatment, not on a\nvoluntary basis, but as a contractual obligation.\n26\n\n\nSaint Lucia has been in the forefront of the fight for\nthe survival of small island States. To quote the words of\nthe President of the United States in his recent address to\nthe Assembly,\n\u201cWe must refuse to accept a future in which one part\nof humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new\neconomy, while the other lives at the knife edge of\nsurvival\u201d (A/54/PV.6).\nGlobalization has left us on the knife edge of survival.\nWe are thankful to Europe for empathizing with our\nvulnerabilities, and we regret that they have attracted the\nwrath of sanctions for their pains. Between the rhetoric and\nthe reality lies the gaping wound of disillusion and despair.\nPresident Clinton rightly posed the question:\n\u201cWill globalism bring shared prosperity, or will it\nmake the desperate of the world even more\ndesperate?\u201d (supra).\nSaint Lucia can confidently attest to the truth that the\nsmall States and the developing world are desperate, and\nthat their desperation is compounded by the fact that the\nglobal preoccupation with money and markets is fast\ndestroying the values and sacred norms in our respective\ncountries.\n\u201cIll fares the land, to hastening ills a prey\nWhere wealth accumulates, and men decay\u201d.\n(Oliver Goldsmith, The Deserted Village)\nThe decadence and moral turpitude that has taken over\nour paradise of an island is unbelievable. The conspiracy\nthat threatens to decimate our bananas has left us with\ntourism as a strategy for diversification. The twin monsters\nof drugs and crime promise to overrun us, and the filth that\nspews from cable television pours into our homes. Some of\nthese homes are nothing more than vile little hovels whose\ninhabitants are sustained at night by religion and\nunemployed by day. The decay is all-pervasive, and women\nfrom nearby territories are imported to ply their sordid trade\nin strip-tease joints.\nWe have lost our innocence; this is the surest legacy\nthat globalization has visited upon us. We cannot be\nswayed by the rhetoric of partnership when the relentless\nlogic of globalization is geared to decimate, to marginalize\nand to eliminate. The developing world must focus closely\non the Seattle Round and ensure that the wide sweep of\nliberalization and open markets does not wash us away. If\nthe dogmatism and inflexibility of powerful States threaten\nour survival, then we must band together in a \u201cTrade\nUnion of the Poor\u201d to seek justice and humanity. No\npoison is a necessary drink, and we cannot be expected to\nswallow globalization's cup of hemlock for the greater\nglory of the shapers of the new millennium. We want a\nnew millennium shaped by all Member States, addressing\nthe needs and interests of all, and beneficial to all.\nWe share our apprehension with this body. We will\nwork in the embrace of its wise Charter, but we would\ndescribe globalization in the words of the Irish poet\nWilliam Butler Yeats:\n\u201cAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\u201d\n(The Second Coming)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The President of the\nGeneral Assembly has assumed the mantle of leadership at\na critical time, as we are about to enter the new\nmillennium. We are about to leave a century which has\nrevealed positive and negative aspects of the human\nexperience. On the negative side, the century has been\ncharacterized by colonialism, armed conflict, racism and\nracial discrimination, apartheid, dictatorship, the Holocaust,\ngenocide, ethnic cleansing, religious intolerance and other\nforms of evil. In their wake many people, particularly\nwomen and children, have lost their lives and have been\nmaimed, traumatized, dehumanized, displaced and forced to\nseek refuge. Poverty and underdevelopment have wreaked\nhavoc.\nOn the other hand, humankind has demonstrated a\nsense of magnanimity in overcoming suffering and despair.\nWe have made very strong efforts to wipe out slavery,\ncolonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid. We have\nstriven, through multilateral institutions such as the United\nNations, to promote the togetherness of humankind and\nimprove the well-being of all. We realize, however, that\nthere is a lot more that can and must be done.\nAs this century comes to a close, Mr. Gurirab\u2019s\nleadership as President of the General Assembly, and his\ncountry, Namibia, represent a beacon of hope for the\nfuture. His qualities as an outstanding diplomat, freedom\nfighter and consensus-builder are all well known to us.\nMy delegation wishes him well as he discharges his\nheavy responsibilities and leads this esteemed\nOrganization into the new millennium.\nIn today\u2019s globalized world, the challenges are many\nand the opportunities are manifold. With the same spirit\nthat has enabled us to surmount hurdles in the past,\ntogether we can make the twenty-first century a century\nfor the prosperity of all. The groundwork, the foundation\nfor all this, exists. To give credit where it is due, despite\nmany weaknesses, humankind has never been wanting in\nideas. The standard-setting strides and intellectual\ninnovations of this century, particularly since the\nformation of the United Nations, could have been more\nappreciated if only an extra effort had been exerted\ntowards implementation. Indeed, the twenty-first century\nshould focus on the implementation and concretization of\nthe ideas that have made this century worthwhile.\nThe consolidation of human rights, good governance\nand human development seems to my delegation a useful\npoint of departure. The country that I represent was for a\nlong time under a dictatorship. The people of Malawi\nsuffered and know what it means to be deprived of\nfreedom. They are well aware of the impact that denial of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms has on\ngovernance and development. To us the promotion and\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are\nnot optional, but essential prerequisites for the well-being\nof humankind.\nHuman rights are universal and indivisible. They are\ninalienable. When the people of Malawi went to the polls\nin June this year, in the second democratic elections, we\nconfirmed our desire to strengthen further the\ndemocratization processes that we started in 1994. The\nentrenchment of democracy in Malawi has given our\npeople an opportunity to foster unity and common\nunderstanding. We now have an environment conducive\nto exploiting our full potential and maximizing our\ncontributions to the developmental efforts that the\nGovernment is pursuing. We wish for all people of the\nworld, regardless of their origin, the same opportunity to\nenjoy the rights and freedoms that Malawians are proud\nto enjoy today.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the situation globally does not give\ncause for optimism, and there is no room for complacency.\nInasmuch as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights set\nforth the yardstick of common achievement and has given\nrise to numerous subject-specific binding instruments, every\neffort should be made to assure their effective\nimplementation. The rights of women, children and the\ndisadvantaged, especially, must be given their fullest\npractical meaning.\nAs we commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\nof Discrimination against Women, we should reaffirm our\ncommitment to take all practical measures to eliminate\ndiscrimination against women and review all practices that\nimpede the mainstreaming of gender in all our\ndevelopmental endeavours. Malawi welcomes and looks\nforward to the review conference of the Beijing Platform\nfor Action next year. It is our belief that gender equality,\ndevelopment and peace in the twenty-first century are\nachievable.\nAlmost 10 years ago, world leaders assembled in this\nvery Hall for the World Summit for Children. They made\ngroundbreaking commitments to reach certain goals by the\nyear 2000. The State of the World\u2019s Children 1999 report,\nhowever, indicates that the benchmarks set are far from\nbeing realized. Meeting the commitments of the 1990\nSummit remains one of the challenges that we all face at\nthe beginning of the twenty-first century.\nThe continued recruitment and use of children as\nsoldiers in most of today\u2019s conflicts is a major source of\nworry. The use of children as child labourers and in\nprostitution is also cause for serious concern. We remain\nconvinced that investing in children means a secure future\nfor us all.\nMany other conferences have also taken place \u2014\nparticularly during this last decade \u2014 including those in\nParis, Vienna, Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul, Cairo and\nCopenhagen. In all these conferences, the protection of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms has been a\nrecurrent and cross-cutting theme. Malawi fully supports the\noutcome of these conferences.\nThe time has come to make good the pledges that we\nmade: personal liberties for all, particularly women and\nchildren; social development, especially for the least\ndeveloped countries; protection of the environment;\nprovision of food and shelter; jobs and income; education\nfor all; and secure health, including reproductive rights,\nremain the core of human security. Indeed, these\nconferences have brought to the fore the interlinkages\nbetween the protection of human rights and the questions\nof good governance and development. Quite often, they\nseem to give rise to conflicting interests; we aspire to a\nrights-based approach to development, yet the facts are\nstark: how can our countries, particularly those with\nfragile economies such as our own, ensure strong public\npolicies aimed at promoting food security, for example,\nwhen the very interventions intended to provide incentives\nfor local production and distribution are put into question\nby our efforts to spur economic growth? How do we give\npriority to public expenditures for basic social services\nsuch as education, health and water when these are the\nfirst to be cut in an effort to meet structural adjustment\nconditionalities and the demands of debt servicing?\nThe challenge for us all is to minimize conflict and\naim to strike an appropriate balance to ensure proper\nservices that are human-rights compliant. Malawi supports\nthe statement in the United Nations Development\nProgramme Human Development Report 1999, to the\neffect that national and global governance must be\nreinvented with human development and equity at their\ncore. With our concerted efforts, this is achievable. My\ndelegation particularly welcomes the positive\ndevelopments that are taking place in our beloved\ncontinent, Africa. As democracy blossoms, we are\nincreasingly witnessing efforts to harness progress in\nhuman development: Africa\u2019s renaissance is no longer a\nslogan, but a realistic achievement for the twenty-first\ncentury.\nIn Malawi, we remain committed to strengthening\ngood governance based on the principles of accountability\nand transparency. Attention is also given to addressing\ncorruption and strengthening public sector administration,\nin particular enhancing local participation in decision-\nmaking processes. We will continue to carry out the\nnecessary economic and fiscal reforms.\nDespite unpalatable structural adjustment\nconditionalities and the impact of debt servicing, the\nGovernment continues to give top priority to the provision\nof basic social services, particularly in education, health,\nwater supply, community development and road\ninfrastructure. The Poverty Alleviation Programme and\nthe Malawi Social Action Fund seek to empower the\npopulace so that they can contribute more positively to\ndevelopment. Free primary education for all was\nintroduced by the Government to ensure that Malawian\nchildren, who hold the future of the country in their\n12\n\n\nhands, are given equal opportunities to grow into productive\nand responsible adults.\nIn the health and water sectors, true to the slogan\n\u201chealthy people make a healthy nation\u201d, the Government is\nestablishing more health centres in many parts of rural\nMalawi: the Bakili Muluzi health initiative, which aims to\nbring medical services right to the people, was introduced\nrecently. We are also making remarkable progress in\nbringing clean and safe water to all rural areas.\nIn order to respond fully to the HIV/AIDS pandemic\nin the country, the Government, in close cooperation with\ncivil society, has embarked on highly publicized awareness\ncampaigns which we hope will contribute to changing\nbehavioural patterns. We appeal for more resources:\nadditional funding for research is indeed imperative.\nMeanwhile, for those already afflicted, it is important for\nthe drugs that are available now to be made more\naffordable for the majority of our poor.\nIn agriculture, the mainstay of Malawi, the priority is\nto achieve food self-sufficiency. In this connection, we have\nembarked on irrigation programmes to supplement rain-fed\nagricultural production.\nThe Malawian examples are typical of the important\nsteps that Africa is taking, which are positive signs of\nrenewal. Africa, however, needs the world in the same way\nthat the world needs Africa. Africa needs a partnership, one\nthat is shared and mutually beneficial \u2014 a genuine\npartnership. We realize that the primary responsibility for\nAfrican development rests with African countries\nthemselves. It is nevertheless important for African\ncountries to be given meaningful assistance to enable them\nto embark on sound economic development. The Cairo\nAgenda for Action adopted by the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) in 1995 is an important blueprint for African\neconomic development: it sets out the broad priority areas\nrequiring specific attention. Numerous other initiatives have\nhighlighted the need to help the development of Africa. The\nchallenge as we approach the twenty-first century should\nand must be to harmonize these initiatives with a view to\nadopting action-oriented measures for urgent\nimplementation.\nWhatever interventions are made, it has become\nincreasingly clear that a meaningful transformation of\nAfrican economies, even after introducing all the necessary\ndomestic, economic and market reforms, cannot be\nsustained without complementary improvements in trade\nflows, improvements in financial resource flows \u2014 whether\nthrough increased official development assistance, debt\nrelief or forgiveness, or foreign direct investment \u2014 and\nsupport for regional cooperation. All this must be done in\na conducive, secure and predictable environment. Indeed,\nin the globalized economy of today what happens in one\npart of the globe has ripple effects and impacts\ndevelopments elsewhere: the Asian financial crisis and the\nrecent sale of gold are clear examples of this\nphenomenon.\nWe must act now if we are to avert a human\ncatastrophe in the near future. In particular, my delegation\nwishes to single out the imperative need for the\ninternational community to address the problem of debt.\nAlthough encouraged by the positive responses in recent\nmonths, we renew the appeal for debt forgiveness which\nwe made in this Hall several years ago. The current ratio\nof external debt to gross national product, 89 per cent for\nmy country, is causing enormous economic stress and\nhardship, particularly for women and children. The\nsituation does not augur well for the future, and is having\nadverse effects on the Government\u2019s poverty eradication\npolicy; also, the gains we have made politically through\ndemocratization and good governance will become\nmeaningless without economic development.\nMalawi is not alone in this predicament. Many other\ncountries find themselves in similar conditions, where\npoverty is rampant and the disparities between the haves\nand the have-nots are widening.\nOne of the major issues on which people look up to\nthe United Nations is because of its concern for national\nidentity. It is in this spirit that Malawi reiterates its\nconviction that the question of participation by the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in the activities of the\nUnited Nations deserves consideration on the basis of\nrespect for the principle of universality and the sovereign\nequality of States. The Republic of China, a democratic\ncountry of over 21 million people, is a reality and cannot\nbe ignored. It cannot be wished away. Malawi believes\nthat readmission of the Republic of China to the United\nNations and to all its specialized agencies would be an\nimportant factor for peace, stability and international\ncooperation.\nNo progress towards improved human development\ncan be sustained without peace and stability. As we\ncommemorate the centennial of the first Peace Conference\nat The Hague, my delegation wishes to reiterate the\nimportance that it attaches to the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes and respect for international law, including\n13\n\n\ninternational humanitarian law. In this connection, Malawi\nalso welcomes the adoption of the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court last year. We have already\nsigned the Statute, and steps are under way to assure\nratification without delay. We are confident that as the next\ncentury nears, the early entry into force of the Rome Statute\nwill fortify our resolve to bring an end to impunity.\nMuch as the Rome Statute will go a long way in\nbringing to book those perpetrators of heinous crimes, it is\nincumbent upon us all to rid the earth of all weapons of\nmass destruction. The Review Conference of the States\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) next year affords us an opportunity to\nmake greater strides in the area of nuclear disarmament. It\nis worth recalling the words of Albert Einstein: \u201cPeace\ncannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by\nunderstanding.\u201d Indeed, peace cannot be sustained by a\nthreat of use of force. So long as the spectre of a nuclear\nwar exists, the world will never be at peace with itself. We\nurge all countries to sign and ratify the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and those countries that have\nnuclear weapons to destroy them in order to finally realize\ngeneral and complete disarmament and a nuclear-weapon-\nfree world.\nWe also appeal to those countries that have not yet\ndone so to become party to the Chemical Weapons\nConvention and the anti-personnel landmines Convention.\nWe equally enjoin current efforts to address the\nproliferation of small arms. In our region, this problem has\nassumed frightening proportions, as robberies and thefts\nhave become more and more violent. Urgent action needs\nto be taken to tackle this problem resolutely. In particular,\nMalawi supports a moratorium on the import, export and\nmanufacture of small arms and light weapons. We must\nalso look for ways of stopping their flow. This Organization\nshould prevail upon the manufacturers of these weapons to\nstop the illegal export of their deadly merchandise to\nAfrica. Let them stop manufacturing and exporting these\nweapons to Africa. That is the bottom line. There is no\npoint in inviting us to conferences when, under cover of\ndarkness, the manufacturers of those small arms continue\nexporting them to Africa.\nThe biggest threat to international peace and security\nremains humankind. As events in Kosovo, Sierra Leone,\nAngola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nAfghanistan, Somalia, Rwanda, Guinea-Bissau, the Middle\nEast, the Korean peninsula and many other parts of the\nglobe, including, most recently, East Timor, have shown,\nhuman beings continue to be the main centre of activity\nwhere armed conflict, tensions and the quest for power\nexist.\nAs the Constitution of the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO) reminds us, \u201cwars begin in the minds of\nmen\u201d. Only human beings can control their own destiny.\nJust as those who sat at The Hague Conference 100 years\nago were, we are capable of renouncing violence and of\nresolving all disputes through peaceful means. In this\nregard, we would like to welcome the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Summit declaration that the year\n2000 will be a year of peace, security and solidarity in\nAfrica. We remain optimistic that the Israelis and the\nPalestinians; the people of Western Sahara and East\nTimor; our brothers and sisters in Angola, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Somalia; and\nmany others whose rights and liberties remain unprotected\nwill finally find peace. We can together provide a\nconducive atmosphere for the provision of all other basic\nneeds that have an impact on peace and security.\nIn the view of my delegation, the United Nations\nremains a singular Organization that is capable of\nconsolidating peace and promoting sustainable human\ndevelopment. The relevance of the United Nations in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security has\nbecome even more pronounced in recent years. My\ndelegation wishes to pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan for providing leadership and a renewed sense of\nmission to the Organization. Reform of the Organization\nsystemwide and of its funds, programmes and specialized\nagencies has rekindled hopes for a secure world. Effective\ncollaboration by all United Nations bodies, each focusing\non areas of expertise, is a sure way of reaching our goals\nand realizing our aspirations.\nThe task that remains is to make the United Nations\nmore responsive to the responsibilities ahead \u2014 the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. For six years now\nwe have been talking about reform of the Security\nCouncil, but without any breakthrough. It is imperative\nthat the Security Council be made more democratic,\ntransparent and accountable. Representation of developing\ncountries in the permanent category is necessary in order\nto ensure the continued legitimacy of, and respect for, the\nCouncil\u2019s decisions. The United Nations must be properly\nresourced in order for it to carry out adequately its noble\nactivities.\nSimilarly, the United Nations cannot remain aloof to\nthe requirements of civil society. Increased cooperation\n14\n\n\nbetween the Organization and civil society, including the\nprivate sector, can only make the Organization stronger.\nThe important role played in particular by non-\ngovernmental organizations in the adoption of the Rome\nStatute and the anti-personnel landmines Convention must\nbe acknowledged and ways explored to enhance it. We\nbelieve that increased contacts between the Organization\nand civil society will ensure the continued relevance of the\nOrganization in the twenty-first century.\nAs the Organization prepares for the Millennium\nAssembly next year under your leadership, the role of civil\nsociety in the consolidation of human rights, good\ngovernance and human development might be a subject that\nshould be given in-depth consideration within the context\nof the overall theme of the United Nations in the twenty-\nfirst century.\nFinally, Malawi would like to congratulate the three\nnew Members of the United Nations: the Republic of\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\nWe welcome them to the United Nations family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am greatly pleased to extend\nmy warmest congratulations to our newly elected President\nof the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Also,\nI join previous speakers in expressing our debt of gratitude\nto the outgoing President, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his able\nstewardship of the proceedings of the Assembly during the\npast session.\nI welcome the newcomers to the United Nations\nfamily, Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga.\nIt has not been an easy year for our Secretary-General.\nWe all appreciate his wisdom and sense of balance in\nsteering the reform process of the United Nations itself with\na firm hand at a time of profound change on the\ninternational scene.\nWhether we like it or not, globalization is upon us. A\nsatisfactory definition of the term may not be yet available,\nbut we all feel the effects of it: pervasive; subtle or less so;\ndisturbing; sometimes perverse; and, above all, challenging.\nThe end of a millennium and the advent of a new one\nis a good time for reflection. It is not just coping with the\nmillennium bug, which may cause our computers to go\nawry; it is \u2014 to use the Secretary General's well polished\nphrase \u2014 a \u201csymbolically compelling moment\u201d. It is not\nfor me to answer the question of where we are and where\nwe are heading: the collective wisdom of the United\nNations Member States, assisted by academia and, we\nhope, by civil society too, will take charge of that at the\nmillennium summit next year. I think we must take that\nevent seriously: although we may have a lot to celebrate,\nwe still have a lot more to do, earnestly, pragmatically\nand effectively.\nLike all good things, globalization produces\nbeneficial effects; then again, as happens with most good\nthings, those benefits are not evenly distributed: those\nwho are better equipped to face the challenge of going\nglobal will reap its fruits sooner, while those who are not\nwill have to try harder. What I mean is that as we talk\nabout globalization we do not have to indulge ourselves\nin slogans or idolatry: globalization involves great\nbenefits, but also great risks. We should not forget that\nour century first experienced the dark side of\nglobalization: world war. Luckily, it is also\nglobalization \u2014 this time in its good sense \u2014 that can\nmake it impossible for conflicts to become chronic,\nbecause the whole world instantly learns about any local\ndispute and mobilizes all available energies to identify\nand implement solutions.\nThe moral underpinning of globalization is called\nsolidarity. One could say that in its very structures and\ngoals the United Nations anticipated contemporary\nglobalization: the United Nations is all about\ninstitutionalized solidarity, and to belong to this\nOrganization means making solidarity the norm of best\nconduct. Social, political and economic solidarity;\ncultural, inter-ethnic and regional solidarity; solidarity\nborn out of respect for values, and fostered by goodwill\nand good faith \u2014 these are the ethics that we wish for the\nforthcoming millennium.\nIt should be clear that the individual must\nnecessarily be the beneficiary of any form of solidarity:\ninternational organizations, States and governments do not\nacquire legitimacy and cannot be judged otherwise than\nthrough their impact on individual destiny. The real man\nor woman, rather than generic mankind, and the values\nembodied by the human species, rather than self-serving\nprojects, are the true subjects of politics.\nThis way of thinking has lately brought up the issue\nof humanitarian intervention, human rights and reform of\nthe system of international law. This is a sensitive issue\nand one full of pitfalls. There are those who say that we\nshould not tolerate legal injustice under the pretext of\n39\n\n\nhumanitarian intervention. That is true. Similarly, some say\nthat we should tolerate either social injustice nor crime\nunder the pretext of non-interference in domestic affairs.\nUndoubtedly respect for human rights is primarily the\nresponsibility of national Governments and State\ninstitutions. However, if they do not fulfil this task, there\nshould be an instrument capable of enforcing respect for\ninternational standards and there is no better instrument for\ndoing so than the United Nations.\nPreventing conflicts is a complex undertaking.\nUnfortunately, we do not always have time to act subtly\nand imaginatively. We are not doing enough in the field of\neducation in the sense of cultivating values of respect for\nthe integrity of the individual and for his or her right to be\ndifferent. We do not always understand in time that the\nmost efficient way to fight war and violence is to fight\npoverty. We do not always know how to distinguish\nbetween political manoeuvring and public interest, between\nnational pride and universally valid principles. We must\nreflect on these things not only when crises are unleashed\nbut instantly calmly and clear-mindedly. There is no simple\nway of coping with complexity. It requires vision,\nenlightened foresight, careful planning and hard work.\nThe revolutionary changes of ten years ago in Central\nand Eastern Europe and the ensuing process of transition\nwere essentially focused on values \u2014 political pluralism,\nparliamentary democracy, separation of powers, individual\nfreedom, market economy and human rights, including the\nrights of people belonging to ethnic, religious or other\nminorities. Those values prevailed because they were right,\nbecause they survived in our hearts and minds through\ndecades of totalitarian communist oppression, and because\nthey were embraced by the vast majority of people in our\ncountries.\nBut shared values themselves are not enough to build\na truly prosperous democratic society: they have to be\nunderpinned by an equally coherent set of institutions\ndesigned to serve and actually implement those values. The\ntwo \u2014 values and institutions \u2014 are inextricably linked in\na functioning democracy, and it is precisely from this\nlinkage that the indispensable ingredient for further progress\narises: leadership. That, in a nutshell, is the substance of\ngood governance. We are reminded here of the idea that:\n\u201cThe important thing for government is not to do\nthings which individuals are doing already, and to do\nthem a little bit better or a little bit worse, but to do\nthose things which at present are not done at all.\u201d\n[John Maynard Keynes, \u201cThe End of Laissez-Faire\u201d]\nWe in Romania, much like those in many other Central\nand East European countries, have been and still are\nlearning that simple truth the hard way in a difficult and\nsometimes painful process of transition.\nIt is in that spirit and in recognition of the\ninternational dimension of good governance at a time of\nglobal change that the Romanian delegation has submitted\na draft code of democratic conduct (A/54/178, annex) for\nexamination by the Assembly this session. The text before\nthe Assembly is the result of extensive consultations and\nincludes meaningful contributions from many quarters\nbased upon the original framework from the Conferences\nof New or Restored Democracies. The important \u2014 and\nI would say, novel \u2014 thing about this document is that,\nin addition to listing principles and stating general aims,\nit also spells out practical modalities for carrying them\nout in the political, legal, administrative, economic and\nsocial spheres. Last but not least, it emphasizes the crucial\nrole of non-institutional players \u2014 business communities,\nunions, non-governmental organizations, civil society, the\nmedia \u2014 in shaping policies and in building consensus\nfor implementation.\nIn a changing world, the world Organization itself is\nalso changing. The scope and pace of its reform and\nadaptation to the new realities and requirements may have\nbeen uneven, patchy in some respects and even\ndisappointing, but the process has gained momentum and\nthere are hopeful signs for steady progress in the future.\nThe United Nations is uniquely equipped by its structure\nand acquired expertise to seek specific rather than\nstandard solutions to specific problems. Every crisis we\nhave had to face in recent years and months had a\nphysiognomy of its own. To be effective, the response\nmust match the challenge in terms of innovative\ncomplexity.\nIn relation to the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil membership and its improved performance, we\nbelieve that proper consideration should be given to the\ninterests of all regional groups, including the Group of\nEastern European States, which has seen the most\nspectacular rise in numbers over the past three decades.\nRomania welcomed the initiative to create the United\nNations Stand-by Forces High-Readiness Brigade and\ntakes part in it. Recent events across the world have\ndemonstrated the urgent need to make it operational as\nsoon as possible. We have been reminded of this in a\nmost dramatic fashion by the recent events in East Timor.\nRomanian contingents took part in several United\n40\n\n\nNations-led and other peacekeeping, peace support and\npolicing operations and are further prepared to improve and\ndiversify their contribution to such activities.\nOur cooperation with the United Nations agencies has\nbecome better focused and more effective. I should like to\nmention the importance we attach to the support of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme in designing and\nmanaging specific, high-priority projects for Romania,\nnotably in public administration, in the preparation of a\nnational strategy for sustainable development and of a local\nAgenda 21 programme. Further useful work is expected to\nbe done jointly with the World Bank for the formulation of\na comprehensive development framework at both the\nnational and the regional level.\nThe Balkan tragedy has been in the headlines for the\nwhole of this past year. We all had an object lesson on the\nharm that ethnic and religious intolerance compounded by\nrabid nationalism can do to an entire region. As so many\ntimes in history, it was the innocents that had to suffer\nmost, individuals and nations alike. But we have also\nlearned that determination and prompt action by the\ninternational community can make a difference. It is\ngratifying to note that trans-Atlantic solidarity again passed\na crucial test in these past few months. In fact, if we are\nable to look into the future of the region with a reasonable\ndegree of optimism, it is because we have seen concerted\naction at work.\nThe Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe is such\nproof of a new, bold approach \u2014 a comprehensive, forward\nlooking programme which proposes to deal with the entire\nregion with specific action envisaged on three tiers:\ninternational security, economic development and\ndemocracy and institution-building. Romania has welcomed\nthe plan from the very beginning, is part of it and seriously\nmeans to do its utmost to bring it to fruition. It is still\nearly, but three preliminary observations may be in order.\nFirst, the actual participation of the countries in the\nregion and of its immediate neighbours, such as Romania,\nis crucial for its success.\nSecondly, in focusing on the eventual integration of\nthe region as a whole into the European and Atlantic\nstructures, the sequence and content of the steps to be taken\nshould realistically differentiate among the actual\nrequirements and capabilities of each participating country.\nThirdly, besides action at the governmental level, it is\nvital to secure the active involvement of business interests\nand the various organizational expressions of civil society\nin order to give substance and continuity to the whole\nprocess.\nAlmost as an afterthought, I think I should also\nmention the need for a watchful eye on transparency,\napplying equally to political decision-making and to\nprocurement procedures, including those practised by the\nagencies of the United Nations family. This is a\nlegitimately sensitive subject for the countries of the\nregion, particularly for the companies registered there, and\nought to be duly considered as such.\nRomania's commitment to its strategic goals of\nEuropean and Atlantic integration is steady and\nunwavering. It has passed the acid test of the Kosovo\ncrisis. We are looking forward with confidence and hope\nto the major decisions which are due to be taken before\nthe year's end and thereafter.\nThe United Nations may not be perfect, but is\nperfectible and, after all, is the only world forum\navailable. It is up to us to make it live and deliver. We,\nthe Member States, have to deliver in order to live in a\npeaceful world. For this I hope and pray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all, Sir,\nto extend my most sincere congratulations on your\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly and to wish you every success in\ndischarging this extremely responsible mission. This\nelection is a well-deserved tribute to the personal qualities\nof the dean of African Foreign Ministers, as well as\nevidence of the indisputable authority your country enjoys\namong the members of the international community. The\nactive and responsible position of Namibia as a member\nof the Security Council serves as another confirmation\nthat the right choice was made by this General Assembly.\nI would also like to express our gratitude to your\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his effective\norganization of the work of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly. In addition, I have the pleasure to\ngreet three new United Nations Members \u2014 Kiribati, the\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Ukraine\nsincerely welcomes them into our family.\nThe twentieth century will remain, in the history of\nmankind, as one of unprecedented ideological clashes,\nwith subsequent divisions of the world. The last 10 years,\nhowever, have been marked by an entente universelle to\nbuild this world on the basis of respect for cultural\n21\n\n\ndiversity and universally recognized values. This\ntumultuous period of transition from bloc rivalry to\nrapprochement and cooperation obviously lacks stability and\nclear vision. That is why the role of the United Nations, a\nfirm anchor in these troubled waters, takes on increasing\nand immense importance for all of its Member States.\nI would like to place special emphasis on one\nfundamental factor that determines the significance of the\nUnited Nations and makes it universally meaningful. On the\neve of the twenty-first century, we have to admit that\nhumankind is still far from achieving the purposes\nproclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations. But at the\nsame time, we must recognize that this document, which\nhas withstood the test of time, has remained the most\nambitious yet most realistic code of world order for more\nthan half a century. There exists no alternative to the order\ndefined by the rules and principles of the United Nations,\nas no alternative exists to the Organization itself, which is\ndestined to be the centre for the coordinated actions of\nnations in achieving and maintaining such an order.\nThis vision of the Organization's significance to\ninternational life is what has prompted Ukraine to take an\nactive position in carrying out concerted efforts aimed at\nstrengthening the United Nations. Two years ago, we all\nwelcomed the programme of institutional reforms put\nforward by the Secretary-General, which were designed to\nadapt and update the Organization and to ensure its ability\nto promptly respond to the challenges of our time. That\npowerful start, however, dwindled to a slow pace, while our\ninitial optimism and our readiness to go ahead with the\nprogramme of reforms of the United Nations remained\nlargely unrealized.\nThis sort of criticism is all the more pertinent when it\ncomes to the reform of the principal United Nations organ\nentrusted with primary responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. For years, all of us seemed\nto be in agreement on the need to modernize the Security\nCouncil and replenish it with new energy and fresh ideas.\nI am confident that a new impetus should be given to the\nwork of the Working Group on Security Council reform to\nget the matter off the ground in the course of the current\nsession.\nWhat could our response be to the challenges that\nhave haunted humankind for the last 55 years? First, the\nmost important conclusion that we can draw from all of the\nUnited Nations deficiencies is this: for the Organization to\nmanage to unite nations around basic universal values, it\nmust have adequate tools to protect these values. Universal\nvalues must enjoy full support by means of legal,\npolitical, economic and military enforcement.\nSecondly, the age of confrontation is giving way to\nan age of cooperation. We should create a world order in\nwhich it would be in no one's self-interest to wage wars,\noppress national minorities or exert economic pressure on\nother nations. A broad and ramified system of regional\nand subregional cooperation would serve this purpose by\nupholding a universal code of conduct.\nIn this context, I wish to refer to the recent summit\nheld in the Ukrainian city of Yalta, called \u201cBaltic-Black\nSea Cooperation: to the Integrated Europe of the 21st\nCentury Without Dividing Lines\u201d. It would be no\nexaggeration to say that there is here an unavoidable\nparallel with Yalta 1945. That post-war summit was an\nexample of how three people decided the fate of the\nworld and divided Europe. Yalta 1999, on the contrary,\nwas evidence of how 22 neighbouring countries found\nsufficient motivation to resolve their problems together\nand be unanimous in determining their future in a United\nEurope.\nWe are particularly encouraged by the increased\nattention paid by the Security Council and the United\nNations in general to humanitarian issues. A major lesson\nlearned from the eruption of numerous local and regional\nconflicts is that there is an obvious and urgent need to\nrespond to the challenges posed by humanitarian crises\nand flagrant mass violations of human rights.\nThe primary role of the Security Council in\nmaintaining and restoring international peace must be\nreiterated. This role is expressed in the clear and proud\nlanguage of the Charter. The past and continuing\nexperience of the Council underscores the importance of\nthe adoption of a holistic approach that brings into\nprominence both security and humanitarian issues. As\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan imaginatively put it\nyesterday, a global era requires global engagement, and\nthe collective interest is the national interest.\nHow can this ambitious goal be achieved? An\nimportant step forward towards the goal of protecting\nhuman life and dignity is, of course, the ongoing process\nof establishing the International Criminal Court. Today, a\nyear after the remarkable conclusion of the Rome\nDiplomatic Conference, we are pleased to observe that the\nsignificance of the adoption of the Court\u2019s Statute is\nwidely and rightly recognized as it relates not only to the\ncodification and progressive development of international\n22\n\n\nlaw but also to the system of international security in the\nnext century.\nIt is this perception of the nature and purposes of the\nfuture judicial institution that determines the position of the\nGovernment of Ukraine with regard to the signing of the\nRome Statute. I would like to take this opportunity to\ninform representatives that Ukraine intends to sign the\nStatute in the course of the current session of the General\nAssembly.\nGuided by its belief that the United Nations and\nregional organizations should play a key role in conflict\nprevention, Ukraine was one of the first to come forward\nwith peace proposals during the initial stage of the Kosovo\ncrisis. The peace plan of President Kuchma of Ukraine\nproved to be realistic, since most of its provisions were\nconsonant with the provisions of Security Council\nresolution 1244 (1999).\nFor years, Ukraine has been active in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. Last July, the President and the\nParliament of Ukraine decided to send an 800-strong\ncontingent from Ukraine to participate in KFOR. The\nUkrainian military have gained a very positive profile,\nmerited by their earlier service in the United Nations\nProtection Force, the Implementation Force and the\nStabilization Force in Bosnia. Their expertise and\ncontributions outweighed by far the financial costs entailed.\nWe fully recognize our share of responsibility in the\ncommon cause of restoring and strengthening peace in the\nBalkans.\nAt the same time, recent events in Kosovo and East\nTimor provide evidence that we should continue to increase\nthe level of security for peacekeepers. As a co-author of the\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated\nPersonnel, Ukraine appeals for the elaboration of further\npractical measures to implement its provisions.\nThe lesson of Kosovo proves that as long as human\nrights or the rights of national minorities and international\nlaw are ignored, the world will continue to be threatened by\nhumanitarian disasters. It is therefore necessary to pay\nspecial attention to regions with so-called frozen conflicts:\nareas with the potential for new outbursts of violence,\nrefugee flows and economic recession. As a guarantor of\npeaceful settlement in Transdniestria, Moldova, and an\nactive supporter of the peace process in Abkhazia, Georgia,\nand in Nagorny Karabakh, Azerbaijan, Ukraine is doing its\nutmost to translate the relevant agreements into real peace\nsettlements.\nJoint efforts are also necessary in post-conflict\nrehabilitation. Ukraine therefore welcomes both the idea\nand the adoption of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern\nEurope and is actively proposing specific projects in\ncooperation with its neighbours. The purpose of the Pact\nis not only to help reconstruct the Balkans but, most\nimportantly, to give those countries a clear perspective on\nEuropean integration.\nIntegration into European and Euro-Atlantic\nstructures remains the key priority of Ukraine\u2019s foreign\npolicy. Membership in the family of European nations\nand sharing common values means economic growth,\nstable democratic development and the consolidation of\nthe European identity of Ukrainians. At the regional level,\nUkraine is an active participant in the Organization for\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation, the Council of the\nBaltic Sea States, the Central European Initiative and the\nGUUAM forum, to which Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan,\nAzerbaijan and Moldova belong.\nI have already mentioned the Yalta Conference and\nthe summit of the leaders of Baltic and Black Sea States.\nIn addition, last May Ukraine hosted a summit meeting of\neight Central European States. We are developing\nconfidence-building measures on a bilateral basis with our\nneighbours and in a multilateral framework to reduce\nnaval military activity in the Black Sea region. Pursuing\nthe line that intensive cooperation is the best remedy for\nconflicts, Ukraine is engaged in various trilateral\ncooperative agreements promoting free economic areas\nand transborder projects.\nAs one of the founders of the United Nations,\nUkraine continues to make its contribution to United\nNations efforts in strengthening international peace and\nsecurity, the non-proliferation regime, disarmament and\narms control, crisis management, the promotion of\neconomic and social development, human rights and\nfreedoms and compliance with the fundamental principles\nof international law. By fostering internal harmony in\nsociety, creating an environment of stability and shaping\na vast network of regional cooperation, Ukraine is striving\nto make the fullest possible use of its rich experience and\nconstructive potential for the benefit of the whole\ninternational community.\nOver three years ago, Ukraine voluntarily renounced\nits nuclear stockpile \u2014 the third largest in the world \u2014\nand it is strictly abiding by its commitments as a\nnon-nuclear State. We should multiply our efforts to\nenhance the efficiency and universality of the Treaty on\n23\n\n\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In this\ncontext, it is of the utmost importance to break the\nstalemate in the preparatory process for the 2000 NPT\nReview Conference.\nUkraine has signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty (CTBT) and is now successfully completing\nlegislative procedures to fulfil its international obligations\nunder this Treaty. Last February, our country became a\nparty to the Ottawa Convention banning the use of anti-\npersonnel landmines, while in March Ukraine\u2019s Government\ndecided to prolong the moratorium on exports of all types\nof anti-personnel landmines.\nMy country is ready to participate in the development\nof collective measures to fight the proliferation of and\nillegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons. We\nsupport the initiative of Canada and the Netherlands to\nestablish an international regime for the control of light\nweapons and to start negotiations on working out a\nconvention on the prevention and combating of the illegal\ntransportation of firearms and light weapons.\nAware of the danger of the uncontrolled circulation\nand accumulation of conventional weapons, Ukraine strictly\nabides by Security Council and General Assembly\nresolutions imposing restrictions on international arms\ntrafficking. All of these factors explain Ukraine\u2019s ambition\nto be elected as a non-permanent member of the Security\nCouncil. Our ambition is particularly strong since it is our\nfirst bid for this seat as an independent State.\nIf elected, Ukraine would base its position in the\nSecurity Council on the following fundamental principles:\npaying adequate attention to conflicts and tense situations\nin different parts of the world, judging them by the real\nrequirements of each particular case; using all political and\ndiplomatic means available to the Security Council to\nprevent or manage conflicts; increasing the importance of\nthe humanitarian dimension among the Council\u2019s priorities;\nand enhancing the ability of non-members of the Security\nCouncil to influence the decision-making process in that\nbody. In addition, there is a need to analyse the present\nmechanism of sanctions to ensure that their imposition is\nbalanced and well-grounded, in particular taking into\naccount eventual negative consequences for third countries.\nUkraine remains deeply concerned at the problems of\nAfrica. Our concerns are nurtured by the strong traditional\nties of friendship that unite Ukraine with African nations.\nOne could hardly disagree that Africa is a continent with\nunlimited potential for economic and social development.\nAt the same time, it is absolutely imperative that the\ninternational community take very concrete and effective\nsteps to assist African States in developing that potential\nand in responding to the challenges facing their continent.\nNowadays it is difficult to blame the United Nations\nfor the lack of attention to Africa. For example, at this\nvery moment, the members of the Security Council are\nresponding to a briefing on recent developments in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, given by the President\nof the Republic of Zambia, His Excellency Mr. Frederick\nChiluba. In just a few days, the Security Council will\nhold another meeting to reaffirm its commitment to the\ncause of peace and prosperity in Africa. I intend to\npresent my delegation's contribution to the deliberations\nof the Council, and will make more specific remarks on\nthis matter in the course of that meeting. At the same\ntime, Ukraine hopes that commitment to Africa on the\npart of the Security Council and the United Nations as a\nwhole will be reflected in concrete deeds that benefit\nAfrica.\nThe situation in the Middle East requires closer\nattention by the Security Council. We believe that the\nSecurity Council should send strong encouragement to all\nthe parties to the Middle East peace process. It is time to\ncome back to the negotiating table to find a final\ncompromise solution to the pending problems on the basis\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions. In that\ncontext, Ukraine welcomes the recent signing of the\nSharm el-Sheikh Memorandum on 4 September, brought\nabout thanks to the constructive approach of the new\nIsraeli Government and to the position taken by the\nPalestinian leadership.\nEast Timor continues to be a hot spot. Ukraine\nwelcomed the success of the 30 August 1999 popular\nconsultation of the East Timorese people, which was\npossible thanks to the constructive position taken by the\nGovernment of Indonesia and the active intermediary\nmission of the Secretary-General. Ukraine supported the\nSecurity Council's adoption of its resolution 1264 (1999),\nwhich authorized the establishment of a multinational\nforce pursuant to the request of the Government of\nIndonesia.\nThe past year has been marked by an unprecedented\noutbreak of terrorist acts in various parts of the world.\nWe are convinced that intensified international efforts to\ncombat terrorism need a more concentrated focus on the\nunderlying causes of this extremely acute international\nphenomenon, on its deep social roots and on relevant\n24\n\n\nhistorical conditions, as well as on situations that may give\nrise to international terrorism and endanger international\npeace and security. At the same time, whatever actions are\nundertaken at the international, regional or national levels,\nthey must all be in full conformity with the basic principles\nof international law and must not run counter to the\nfundamental provisions of the United Nations Charter.\nUnderdevelopment and impoverishment, the threat of\nmarginalization, the burden of external debt, a lack of\nresources, and ecological disasters pose a real threat to\ninternational peace and sustainable development.\nCircumstances such as the global financial crisis and the\nwar in Kosovo have considerably impeded economic\nprogress in many parts of the world. Ukraine has managed\nto curb its losses and maintain macroeconomic stabilization\nsince August 1998. On the other hand, the curtailment of\nnavigation on the Danube has paralysed economic the\nactivities of Ukrainian shipping companies, ports and\nenterprises. The total accumulated losses of Ukraine amount\ntoday to more than $300 million. Together with Romania,\nBulgaria and other interested parties, we are ready to clear\nthe waterway for the soonest possible resumption of\nnavigation as the best way to cope with the humanitarian\nhardships of Balkan peoples.\nSpeaking about global issues requiring joint efforts of\nthe international community, I must again emphasize the\nproblem of Chernobyl, which is so painful for Ukraine and\nfor its neighbours, Belarus and Russia. Our country is\nmeeting its commitments to decommission the Chernobyl\nnuclear power plant as envisaged in the memorandum of\nunderstanding between the Government of Ukraine and\nGovernments of the Group of Seven and the European\nUnion. It therefore has every ground to expect the\nfulfilment by its partners of their obligations. We welcomed\nthe statement issued by the Group of Seven in Cologne last\nJune regarding the convening of a second pledging\nconference for the mobilization of financial resources to\nimplement the working plan on the transformation of the\nShelter facility into an ecologically safe system. We\nconsider this to be a confirmation by our partners of their\ncommitment to the memorandum of understanding.\nFrom this rostrum I call upon all potential donors to\ntake part in that conference and to make pledges to the\nChernobyl Shelter fund, to enable it to reach the required\namount of just $770 million. According to the Human\nDevelopment Report published by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, expenditures for cigarettes in\nEurope amounted to $50 billion in 1998 alone. Compared\nto this, the amount needed for Chernobyl looks like quite\na small price to save the environment of that vast region.\nThe present century gave the world so notable a\ndocument as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nStill, we have witnessed the most brutal and massive\nviolations of those rights. Famine, genocide, ethnic\ncleansing, torture and various forms of discrimination\ncontinue to haunt mankind. That is why the strengthening\nof international mechanisms to monitor human rights\nviolations is especially urgent today. The Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\nshould play a leading role. Cases of the most massive\nviolations of human rights should be considered by the\nSecurity Council with a view to taking preventive or\ncoercive measures.\nHence, it is imperative to strengthen the role of\ninternational law in international relations in order to\nensure strict observance of the main norms and principles,\nfirst and foremost respect for sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Ukraine\ncontinues to support the International Court of Justice as\nthe Organization's principal legal institution.\nThe establishment of a world system that would\nguarantee peace and security, prosperity and sustainable\neconomic development, and the preservation of the\nenvironment for future generations requires decisive joint\naction by the international community. That process\nshould be led by a reformed and renewed United Nations,\nan organization with great experience and opportunities to\nsolve problems of global dimensions. For that purpose,\nthe General Assembly has approved a comprehensive\nprogramme for United Nations reform \u2014 by the way,\nunder the presidency of my predecessor Hennadiy Y.\nUdovenko, who is present in this Hall today. But while\ndebating it, we did not notice that two years had passed\nand that we were approaching the brink of the\nmillennium. The prominent Ukrainian philosopher of the\neighteenth century, Grigory Skovoroda, said that a waste\nof time is the heaviest of all losses. Let us bring to life\nwhat we have conceived for the benefit of the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The unanimous election of Mr. Gurirab to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at this fifty-fourth session is a warm\ntribute to Namibia and its heroic people, who are well-\nknown for their victorious struggle against foreign\ndomination and for their tireless defence of the principles\nof the Charter of the United Nations. As I am familiar with\nhis skill and broad experience of international relations, I\nbelieve that under his wise leadership the work of the\nGeneral Assembly at this session will be crowned with\nsuccess.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express\nmy sincere congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary-General of our Organization, for his work to\nreform and revitalize the United Nations, as well as for his\nsteadfast commitment in the service of peace and\ndevelopment throughout the world.\nAs this century of rapid change fades away, we are\nconfronted with challenges, but also presented with many\nopportunities. Globalization has become a problem\nthroughout the world. While technological progress and the\nglobalization of production and finance have brought\nprosperity and modernity to many countries, particularly in\nthe developed world, the great majority of people are still\nliving in conditions of persistent poverty. The protection of\nthe environment, the eradication of poverty and the struggle\nagainst drugs and all forms of terrorism have also become\nurgent problems requiring concerted action at global level.\nIn the face of this situation it is more urgent than ever\nfor the international community to adopt concrete collective\nmeasures to enable the United Nations to devote more of its\nresources to social and economic development in order to\nbuild a better life for all the world\u2019s peoples, in particular\nfor the poorest among them. If it is to take up these\nchallenges, the United Nations, as the only universal\ninternational organization, needs the capacity to act and to\nadapt to a new and changing world situation.\nWith the end of the bipolar world, many countries,\nespecially developing countries, had hoped that the\nnuclear era would end as well. Here, the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic, along with the other countries\nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN), signed the Treaty on the Southeast Asia\nNuclear Weapon-Free Zone, which entered into force in\n1997. It also endorsed the joint declaration of 9 June\n1998, subscribed to by the Foreign Ministers of Brazil,\nEgypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South\nAfrica and Sweden, the objective of which was to\nrevitalize nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament\nefforts. Such positive steps will help us together gradually\nto build a world free of nuclear weapons, thus creating\nmeaningful guarantees for the survival of mankind.\nTo guarantee peace, to promote the development of\nall countries, and to adapt to a new world situation, the\nOrganization must be reformed so that it can fulfil its\nmandate and achieve its purposes. Here in the United\nNations, all countries have equal standing, in conformity\nwith the principle of the sovereign equality of States. And\nhere in the United Nations, we extol the principles of the\nnon-use or threat of use of force against the independence\nor sovereignty of States, of the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes, and of non-interference in the internal affairs of\nother States.\nIn speaking of United Nations reform we cannot\npass in silence by the delicate work under way in the\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the\nSecurity Council, where a number of interesting initiatives\nhave been put forward. Our position on this matter is well\nknown, and was set out at the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly: we favour an increase in both the\npermanent and the non-permanent membership, in line\nwith the principle of equitable geographical distribution\nand taking into account the prominence of the country in\nquestion. As part of the effort to attain that goal, some\ncountries \u2014 such as, in particular, Japan, Germany and\nIndia \u2014 could become permanent members of a\nrestructured Security Council. As we all know, the\nquestion of Council reform is not a simple one. We need\nto be patient, to continue the debate and to take advantage\nof the momentum we have created, so as to attain the\n3\n\n\ngoal of giving that organ greater transparency, legitimacy\nand, above all, credibility.\nTrue to its consistent policy of peace, friendship and\ncooperation, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\nconsiders that the use of force against a sovereign\nindependent State without Security Council authorization,\nno matter what the pretext, runs counter to international law\nand the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that all\nconflicts, no matter how complex, should be resolved only\nthrough negotiations.\nConvinced of the importance of peace in the Middle\nEast, my country is pleased that Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization have resumed serious negotiations,\nwhich led to the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh\nMemorandum on 4 September 1999. It is essential for the\nparties directly concerned to continue those negotiations in\norder to settle their problems on the basis of existing\nresolutions and agreements. This would open the path to\npeace, cooperation and peaceful coexistence among the\npeoples of the region.\nAmong the glaring injustices in the world, we cannot\nforget the economic, trade and financial blockade that has\nbeen waged for more than 40 years against the Republic of\nCuba. We consider that the United States ought to put an\nend to that operation, which runs counter to the present\nworld trend towards international economic cooperation for\ndevelopment.\nPeace on the Korean peninsula remains fragile. We\nappeal to all the countries concerned to show maximal\nrestraint and to continue their dialogue with a view to\nrestoring mutual understanding, and together to seek\nsolutions that would meet the aspirations of the Korean\npeople for the peaceful reunification of the two parts of\nKorea, and that would contribute to the consolidation of\npeace, stability and cooperation in the region.\nSince 9 July 1999 we have seen renewed tension in\nthe Taiwan Strait. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\nreaffirms its consistent position that Taiwan is an integral\nand inalienable part of China, and that the Government of\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China is the sole legal and\nlegitimate representative of the entire Chinese people.\nOver the past two years, the financial crisis affecting\nthe whole of South-East Asia has quickly made itself felt,\nto varying degrees, in other regions \u2014 indeed, throughout\nthe world. In some countries there are today signs of an\neconomic upturn, but nothing indicates that the world\neconomy is yet on the road to solid recovery. In the light\nof that crisis and of the fact that countries large and\nsmall, industrialized and developing, are becoming\nincreasingly interdependent, the international community\nmust work together to find an effective solution to the\ncrisis, to promote worldwide growth, and to bring about\nsustained social and economic development.\nSince the 1995 Copenhagen World Summit for\nSocial Development, the struggle against impoverishment\nhas been bolstered. But it is clear that developing\ncountries, especially the least developed among them,\ncannot accomplish this huge task on their own and\nwithout the necessary support and assistance of the\ninternational community. In that context, we consider that\nthe special follow-up meeting that will take place in 2000\nwill give the international community an opportunity to\nreview the situation and to take the measures necessary to\nattain the noble goals set at the Summit.\nFor years, the special problems of landlocked\ndeveloping countries have been discussed at various\ninternational conferences and meetings. Although many\nmeasures have been taken both at the national and at the\ninternational levels, those problems are still far from\nbeing resolved.\nThe President took the Chair.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, which has\nthe honour of chairing the Group of Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries, is cooperating actively with the\nother member countries to establish and maintain an\neffective and self-sustaining system of transport and\ntransit. This huge task requires support and assistance\nfrom the entire international community in order for our\ncountries to meet our particular needs. It is more than\nurgent that the recommendations adopted last August in\nNew York at the fourth meeting of governmental experts\nfrom landlocked and transit developing countries and\nrepresentatives of donor countries, and financial and\ndevelopment institutions, be wholly translated into reality\nas soon as possible.\nIn the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic over the\npast year, the multi-ethnic Lao people has strongly unified\nitself and is actively working for national development,\nparticularly in the area of agricultural production. This\nhas made it possible for us not only to achieve self-\nsufficiency in rice production, but also to have something\nof a surplus in reserve. This achievement has helped\nsoften the effects of the economic and financial crisis in\n4\n\n\nthe region. Throughout the country, political stability and\nsocial harmony, important conditions allowing us to\npromote sustained national socio-economic development in\nkeeping with the policy of renewal, continue to be ensured.\nAt the international level, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic is continuing its efforts to strengthen and extend\nits external relations and cooperation, particularly with\nneighbouring countries, and it is cooperating with other\nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in\nthe implementation of the Hanoi Plan of Action and of the\nVision 2020 for the progress and the prosperity of the\nregion.\nThe question of drugs continues to be a major concern\nin the daily life of South-East Asia. In this respect, my\nGovernment has made great efforts to reduce the annual\nproduction of opium and is carrying out a vigorous battle\nagainst drugs, the results of which have been greatly\nappreciated by the international community. At this time, in\ncooperation with the United Nations International Drug\nControl Programme (UNDCP), we are working out a\nstrategy for a substantial eradication of opium production\nover the next six years. In this connection, I appeal to the\ninternational community to contribute to the Fund UNDCP\nin order to achieve those objectives.\nSaving future generations from the scourges of war,\npoverty, hunger and sickness remains an essential objective\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. Aware of this\nhighest goal, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic will\nspare no effort to make its modest yet positive contribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I bring to you, Mr. President,\nto Secretary-General Kofi Annan and to all representatives\nthe greetings and best wishes of His Majesty King Birendra\nand of the Government and people of Nepal. Your election\nis testimony to the wide recognition of your great country's\ncontribution to the cause of freedom of the peoples and to\nthe work of the United Nations. Please accept our\ncongratulations and pledge of support. Our appreciation\ngoes also to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the\nwise manner in which he conducted the business of the\nfifty-third session of the General Assembly.\nThe massive loss of life and property and the untold\nsuffering caused by the recent earthquakes to the peoples\nof Turkey, Greece and Taiwan have touched the hearts of\nthe Nepalese people. Indeed, our hearts go out to the\nhundreds of thousands of peoples across the globe who\nhave suffered from both natural and man-made disasters.\nNepal wholeheartedly welcomes Kiribati, Nauru and\nTonga as new Members of the United Nations. Their\nadmission has enriched the world Organization and\nenhanced its universality.\nFollowing the restoration of the multi-party political\nsystem in Nepal, I had the unique privilege of steering the\ncountry at a turning point of history as its Prime Minister,\nentrusted with the twin responsibilities of overseeing the\nformulation of a new democratic constitution of the\nKingdom and the holding of free, fair and peaceful\ngeneral elections at the beginning of the last decade of\nthis century. With the people's trust and guidance, the\ncooperation of all political parties and the support of His\nMajesty the King, and above all with God's will, those\nresponsibilities were fully discharged.\nThe Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal not only\nguarantees the fundamental human rights of the people\nbut also the independence of the judiciary. It defines and\nprotects the basic tenets of parliamentary democracy in\nNepal, and it identifies the purposes and principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations as the fundamental plank of\nthe foreign policy of the country. Standing today before\nthis Assembly of nations, I wish to reaffirm Nepal's\ncommitment to the principles and objectives of the United\nNations and to share, in brief, our hopes, aspirations and\nviews.\nLast year we observed the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, a milestone in\nhuman history. The fiftieth anniversary of another\nhistorical milestone \u2014 the Geneva Conventions of\n1949 \u2014 this year provides the international community\nwith another opportunity to reiterate its deepening\ncommitment to democracy, human rights and improved\nliving conditions for peoples. At the national level, we\nregard the protection and promotion of human rights as a\nsine qua non for the all-round development of the people.\nDemocracy and development, I believe, are two sides of\nthe same coin, hard to guarantee and secure except in a\n13\n\n\nstate of peace and stability under a system of participatory\ngood governance.\nNepal is a nation with a young democratic setup and\nan ever-deepening commitment to human rights and the all-\nround development of the people, who are beset with the\nnumerous unique and onerous challenges characteristic of\na small land-locked and least developed country with\ndifficult Himalayan and mountainous terrains and the\ngreatest of contemporary problems \u2014 poverty. At no point\nin history have we witnessed poverty eating up so\nsystematically the spiritual richness of peoples in many\ncountries, including Nepal \u2014 the land of the Buddha.\nNepal's development efforts are driven by an\noverriding objective of poverty eradication through\nemployment and income generation, social mobilization and\nthe strengthening of social capital within a democratic\nvalues-based system. The country has almost unlimited\npotential for hydropower development and tourism, and we\nhave created legislative conditions for the participation of\nforeign investors in these sectors as well as in other trade\nand services-generating sectors in Nepal. Our commitment\nto sustainable development has been translated into several\nmeasures aimed at the preservation of the environment and\necological balance, including the earmarking of a large part\nof our land area for the development of wildlife parks and\nnature reserves. I want at this stage to reiterate our\ncommitment to the development of Lumbini \u2014 the\nbirthplace of the Buddha \u2014 as an enduring peace\nmonument, a holy shrine for pilgrimage and one of the\nworld's greatest cultural heritages.\nI am disheartened that despite several world summits,\nconferences and international commitments, absolute\npoverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and hopelessness should\nstill remain the lot of the bulk of the world's population.\nOne billion adults, the majority of them women, cannot\nread or write. Almost a billion people are underfed and\nmalnourished, and a similar number have no access to clean\nwater, shelter or health care. Many millions die before they\nreach the age of 40.\nEqually threatening is the ever-widening gap between\nthe haves and the have-nots. The conclusion of this year's\nHuman Development Report is the unbelievable polarization\nbetween peoples and countries, which the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) characterized as\ngrotesque and dangerous. The one fifth of the world's\npopulation in the highest-income countries commands 86\nper cent of world gross domestic product and 82 per cent\nof world export markets, while the bottom fifth, in the\npoorest countries has just 1 per cent of both categories.\nHow long can the world go on like this, with a small part\nof its people living in freedom and prosperity while the\nlarger segment is living in fetters under abject conditions,\nbefore calamity engulfs us all?\nA few years ago, at the request of the heads of State\nor Government of the South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation, I undertook the task of chairing the\nIndependent South Asian Commission on Poverty\nAlleviation as part of a regional endeavour to work out\nregional strategies and programmes of action for the\neradication of poverty from South Asia. My own\nexperience as Chairman of that Commission leads me to\nthe inescapable conclusion that the goal of poverty\neradication requires, among other things, sustained\npolitical will and commitment of the highest order, an\nintegrated and coordinated approach and decisive national\nactions, with the participation of all, including grass-roots\norganizations and civil society, backed by enhanced\ninternational development cooperation.\nBut the fast-dwindling official development\nassistance flows and ever-increasing resource constraints\nof United Nations development agencies, such as the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, make our task\nof poverty eradication and development harder and harder\nwith each passing year. This is particularly true in the\ncase of least developed and landlocked countries such as\nNepal. While we deeply appreciate the help of our\ndevelopment partners, we urge developed countries, which\nare undoubtedly in a position to do so, to generously\nincrease the volume of their official development\nassistance so as to attain the target set by this Assembly.\nReallocation of official development assistance in favour\nof the less developed countries is another area which\ndeserves attention.\nAs we are a democratic nation, women \u2014 who\nmake up half of every country's population \u2014 are the\nbackbone of Nepalese society. We can hardly remain\noblivious to the urgent need for their empowerment and\nadvancement. We have made legislative arrangements to\nguarantee their participation in the national polity by\nreserving exclusively for them as many as 40,000 seats in\nthe local elected bodies. In the three general elections\nsince 1991, the number of women parliamentarians has\nsteadily gone up. But we are aiming for more. Their\nliteracy rate is also improving. The Committee on the\nElimination of Discrimination against Women, to which\nNepal recently presented its country report, has\nacknowledged the progress made in raising the status of\n14\n\n\nwomen in general and in increasing understanding of\ngender issues and the human rights of women among the\nNepalese population. We know we have to do a lot more,\nand I am personally committed to this.\nWe are equally committed to the protection and\npromotion of the rights of the child as well as the rights\nand interests of other vulnerable and disadvantaged sections\nof society. In short, we have before us a large agenda for\nnation-building, for the consolidation of gains in democracy\nand human rights and for living up to our international\ncommitment to peace, cooperation and development in the\nworld. We are dealing with the agenda with a sense of\npurpose and commitment, although there are several\nobvious difficulties, including the economic, social,\nenvironmental and political problems created by 100,000\nrefugees from Bhutan. We seek the continued support and\nunderstanding of the international community in the\ncreation of an environment conducive to the resolution of\nthis problem through bilateral negotiations. We also seek its\nsupport for their sustenance until they are repatriated.\nI wish to place on record our appreciation of and\ngratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the world's\nforemost public servant, for his efforts and successes in\ndefusing tensions around the world and solving many\nseemingly intractable problems, such as those of Libya and\nthe popular consultation in East Timor. I am impressed with\nhis impassioned call for the transition from a culture of\nreaction to a culture of prevention in the United Nations.\nHe has drawn our attention to the benefits and risks\nprovided by globalization and to the need for strengthened\ninternational cooperation to offset the vulnerability of many\ncountries, particularly the least developed and landlocked\nones, and the marginalization of Africa.\nWe have noted his emphasis on the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security as the primary\nresponsibility of the Security Council. We thank him also\nfor his dedication to comprehensive United Nations reform\nand for his package of reform proposals. Reform is a\ncontinuing process. It will be neither meaningful nor\ncomplete unless we arrive at a ratifiable global consensus\non the functioning and composition of a reformed Security\nCouncil. The statement of the Foreign Ministers of the five\npermanent members that any attempt to restrict or curtail\ntheir veto rights would not be conducive to the reform\nprocess is a matter of deep disappointment. Nepal supports\nthe common position evolved at the Durban Summit of the\nNon-Aligned Movement on the question of Security\nCouncil reform. We are also firm in our view that no\nreform measure should curtail the authority of the General\nAssembly, which is the nearest thing to a world\nparliament.\nThe United Nations cannot continue to function\neffectively without a fair and sound financial base.\nAssessed dues must be paid in full and on time.\nPeacekeeping is a unique and most useful instrument for\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of international\npeace and security. Nepal has participated in United\nNations peacekeeping for over 40 years in all parts of the\nworld. Some 35,000 of our troops and 800 of our police\nhave served with many peacekeeping operations, 39\nhaving been martyred and several more wounded in the\nline of duty. It is the firm policy of Nepal not only to\nmaintain but also to increase our contribution to United\nNations peacekeeping.\nIt is disappointing that for three years in a row the\nprincipal United Nations forum for disarmament\nnegotiations, the Conference on Disarmament, has not\nbeen able to agree on an agenda of work. Some important\narms control and disarmament measures have been\nadopted without reference to the Conference on\nDisarmament. As host to the United Nations Regional\nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the\nPacific, Nepal's commitment to general and complete\ndisarmament, including total nuclear disarmament,\nremains undiluted.\nIn the summer months of this year, South Asia\nwitnessed a flare-up between two of our close neighbours.\nDisquieting because it broke a peace that had lasted for\nnearly three decades, it also exposed the myth fostered in\na bygone era that countries possessing nuclear weapons\nwould not go to conventional war against each other. The\nrisk of an accidental nuclear war engulfing other countries\nwas magnified by the close proximity of the two\ncountries. Leaving aside the causes of that flare-up, I\nwould like to commend the Prime Ministers and the\nGovernments of the two countries for their restraint, good\nsense and wisdom in containing the conflict and\ndisplaying a high degree of responsibility to their peoples,\nto the rest of South Asia and to the peoples of the entire\nworld. May I take this opportunity once again to appeal\nto the Prime Ministers of those two countries to resume\ntheir dialogue, begun in Lahore last February.\nNepal welcomes the Sharm el-Sheikh accord\nbetween Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat as an\nirreversible step forward in the Middle East peace\nprocess. It opens the way to a just, lasting and\ncomprehensive peace. We hope, for the sake of peace,\n15\n\n\nthat negotiations between Syria and Israel and Lebanon will\nsoon resume in accordance with relevant United Nations\nresolutions.\nLet me conclude with a brief mention of the South\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),\nwhich consists of the seven countries of the region,\nrepresenting one fifth of humanity. We are united in a\ncommon effort to enhance the quality of life of all our\npeoples. I am looking forward to hosting the next summit\nmeeting of heads of State or Government of the South\nAsian region in two months' time at Kathmandu. Our\nimportant agenda will deal with such issues as free trade\nand a SAARC social charter. We will also be signing a\nregional convention on combatting the crime of trafficking\nin women and children. This will be another landmark in\nthe work of SAARC, a regional association dedicated to\npeace and cooperation in South Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On the occasion of the fifty-\nfourth session of the General Assembly, marking our last\nmeeting in this century, I am humbled to address this body\non behalf of President Charles Ghankay Taylor, the\nGovernment and the people of Liberia.\nIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate the President\nmost cordially on his election to preside over this fifty-\nfourth session and to assure him of my delegation\u2019s support\nand cooperation during the session. When we give\nconsideration to the scope of his diplomatic experience, the\nexpanse of his wisdom and the integrity of his heart, we\ncan only conclude that this is his hour, when his\nqualifications bespeak eloquently his ability to preside over\nthe Assembly.\nI recall my country\u2019s involvement in the struggle for\nNamibia\u2019s independence, and I am proud that, just about a\ndecade after achieving independence through the sustained\ndiplomacy of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\nthe United Nations, Namibia is serving in such a high\ncapacity. Significantly, it presides over the agenda of the\nlast session of the General Assembly of the twentieth\ncentury, where constructive discourse on new paradigms for\npeace, development and social progress will shape the new\nmillennium.\nI pay tribute to Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay. We\nhave witnessed his many attributes, especially his wise\nstewardship of the fifty-third session, which has laid the\nbasis for this one. I therefore offer to Mr. Opertti best\nwishes in his future callings.\nFor many reasons, I would like to express special\nappreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan. My focus is on his innovative leadership at\nthe helm of this world body. In particular, I note that only\ntwo years since his introduction of system-wide reforms\nthe Organization has been geared in the direction of\nrendering improved and better services and better\nhandling of world situations. We recollect the happy\nmoments of his visit in July to Liberia, which gave\nfurther testimony to the Secretary-General\u2019s commitment\nto solving the problems of Africa. The Government and\npeople of Liberia are deeply proud that the United\nNations leadership has focused on the search for sustained\npeace in our region, especially in the work of the United\nNations Peace-building Support Office in Liberia, which\nhas been instrumental in the consolidation of peace in\nLiberia.\nWe heartily welcome the admission of three new\nmembers: the Kingdom of Tonga, the Republic of Nauru\nand the Republic of Kiribati. We look forward to their\ncontribution to the ideals of the United Nations.\nIt is encouraging to note that the inflexible attitudes\ngenerated by the cold war have been superseded by\ndialogue. For the promise of a better future, innovative\nand alternative efforts are required in all areas of human\nendeavour. Accordingly, the world is experiencing a\ntransformation in international relations. At the dawn of\na new millennium, we are moving from confrontation to\ncooperation. Nation States continue their search within\nsubregional organizations for the stabilization of civil\norder, the elimination of human suffering and the\nmaintenance of peace. Liberia reaffirms its commitment\nto the concept of world peace that is sustainable in\ncontext and global in approach. Hence, we believe that\nequal treatment should be accorded to all conflicts,\nwherever they might occur.\nLiberia takes a dim view of the disparity in the\nresources committed by the Security Council to the\nconflicts in Kosovo and East Timor, on the one hand, and\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the other.\nRegarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia\ncommends President Chiluba of Zambia for his mediatory\nrole, which led to the signing of the Lusaka Agreement\nby all the concerned parties. We endorse his recent\nrequest to the Security Council that it authorize and\nsupport the deployment of a peacekeeping force in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, with an appropriate\nmandate.\n32\n\n\nFollowing the relaxation of tension in international\nrelations, there should be a renewed determination on the\npart of us all to search for creative avenues to resolve civil\nconflicts and promote regional, political and economic\ncooperation for the prosperity of all peoples.\nAt the onset of his assumption of national leadership,\nfollowing free and fair elections, President Charles Taylor\nembarked upon sound programmes aimed at achieving\nnational reconciliation, the resettlement of all refugees and\ninternally displaced persons, the rehabilitation and the\nreintegration of ex-combatants and reconstruction. Not only\nis our Government making every effort to achieve these\nspecific goals; we are also committed to improving the\nquality of life of our people.\nIn this regard, President Taylor\u2019s Administration\nremains committed to three cardinal principles: ensuring\nnational unity through national reconciliation, resettlement\nand reconstruction; good governance through accountability,\nefficiency and transparency; and the guaranteed protection\nof human rights.\nRegarding good governance, I should like to state that\nmechanisms for revenue collection have improved and\nexpenditure has been strictly controlled to ensure prudent\nfiscal and monetary management and public accountability.\nOur human rights record has improved tremendously and\nremains the focal point in our continued efforts to meet the\nchallenges of national reconciliation. In furtherance of this\nobjective, President Taylor holds regular consultations with\nleaders of the opposition, civil society, religious groups and\nthe media on matters of national interest.\nI should also mention that in response to President\nTaylor\u2019s policy of inclusion, opposition political leaders in\nMay this year toured the United States and certain\nEuropean capitals to further sensitize the international\ncommunity and donor Governments to post-conflict\nproblems confronting Liberia and to seek assistance.\nThe Secretary-General, in his statement to the fourth\nMinisterial Meeting of the ad hoc Special Conference on\nLiberia, held on 3 October 1997, highlighted the\nGovernment\u2019s commitment to national reconstruction. He\nurged the international community to render necessary\nassistance to achieve this goal. Accordingly, a donors\u2019\nconference on Liberia was held in Paris, France, in April\n1998. The amount of $230 million was pledged for\nLiberia\u2019s national reconstruction programme. However, it is\ndisheartening to note that donors have not yet honoured\ntheir commitments. We earnestly appeal to them to give\nhumane consideration to the difficult circumstances of\npost-conflict reconstruction. We are eager to rejuvenate\nthe economy, revitalize productive activities, restore the\nsocial infrastructure and improve the standard of living\nfor all Liberians. Unfortunately, these efforts cannot be\nlaunched without support and assistance from the\ninternational community.\nThe evolving trends of globalization pose enormous\nthreats to weak and vulnerable nations, which are\ncontinuously marginalized in a global economic system.\nFor most developing countries, particularly the least\ndeveloped countries, which include Liberia, the debt\noverhang and the unequal levels of trade are perennial\nproblems for their socio-economic development and\nreintegration into the world economy.\nThe huge debt burden inherited by Liberia remains\na major obstacle in our post-war reconstruction efforts.\nOur debt stock is $3 billion. This means that each\nLiberian man, woman and child carries a debt burden of\n$1,200. In a country where the per capita income is\nbarely $275 it may never be possible to fully repay this\ncolossal financial obligation. Additionally, the cost of\nrehabilitation and resettlement makes it imperative that\nconsideration be given to our request for debt relief. We\nare continuously undertaking economic reforms to deal\nwith the massive demands of our people and the\ninternational community. In view of all that, we call on\nour creditors to consider relieving Liberia of this\nenormous financial burden.\nDebt relief should be considered on a humanitarian\nbasis against the background that such a move would\nconsolidate existing peace, enhance rehabilitation and\nfoster social and political stability. We believe that it\nwould be supportive of Liberia\u2019s desire for inclusion in\nthe evolving global economy.\nThe resolution of the Liberian civil crisis would not\nhave been possible without the close cooperation that\nexisted between the international community and the\nLiberian people. We believe that the high level of\ncollaboration between Liberia and the international\ncommunity should continue to guide our future\nendeavours in post-conflict Liberia so that the gains made\nby all stakeholders will not be lost.\nOf major concern in our reconstruction, rehabilitation\nand healing programme is the condition of women and\nchildren, for no amount of planning for reconstruction can\never succeed if the plight of women and children is\n33\n\n\nignored. Thus, we are implementing programmes that\nrefocus their emphasis towards pursuing educational\nopportunities and safeguarding the rights of women and\nchildren.\nOver the past two years Liberia has repeatedly sought\nthe lifting of the 1992 arms embargo imposed on it by the\nSecurity Council. Our request is based on a principled legal\nstance that the Liberian civil war, which had necessitated\nthe imposition of the embargo, effectively ended on 2\nAugust 1997 with the installation of a duly elected civilian\nGovernment. Thus, the intent of the arms embargo, which\nwas to contain the war and the proliferation of arms in\nLiberia, is no longer necessary.\nIn our submission to the Council requesting that the\nembargo be lifted, we referred to the 1996-1997 final\ncommuniqu\u00e9 of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), by which that regional organization\nlifted all sanctions and embargoes on Liberia and called\nupon the international community to do the same. It is\nimportant to note that it was ECOWAS that saw the need\nto impose an arms embargo on Liberia and to request the\ninternational community, including the Security Council, to\nsupport the embargo.\nThe Government of Liberia continues to stress that the\narms embargo presently imposed against Liberia by the\nSecurity Council is unjust. There are no defined criteria or\ntime limit for its lifting. It has been expanded in perpetuity\nwithout any explanation. The Government of Liberia\nreiterates that the continued refusal by the Security Council\nto lift the arms embargo is a clear infringement of Liberia's\nsovereignty, which the United Nations Charter defends.\nLike all Member States, Liberia has the unqualified right to\ndefend itself and all those within its borders. The attitude\nof the Council on this matter imputes partial sovereignty\nand has hindered the freedom of a Charter Member of this\nOrganization.\nThe arms embargo has created an imbalance, with the\npotential for adverse consequences for peace and security.\nThe substantial advance of the destruction of arms in\nLiberia was followed by cross-border aggression. The arms\nembargo on Liberia does not contribute to peace in the\nsubregion; rather, it contributes to a fragile situation of\ninsecurity and suspicion, which could lead to instability.\nSuch an untenable condition need not exist in a region with\na high population of refugees and former combatants,\npoverty and deteriorating socio-economic conditions.\nIn our continued efforts to prevent the proliferation\nof arms left over from the civil war, and to ensure\nregional peace and stability, on 25 July 1999 the\nGovernment of Liberia decided to destroy arms and\nammunition collected from the then warring parties during\nthe disarmament process. This destruction exercise is\nbeing carried out with the assistance of the United\nNations, ECOWAS and the United States Government.\nMost of the ammunition and arms have been destroyed.\nThe arms and ammunition destroyed as of 10 September\n1999 are as follows: 3,156,156 total rounds of\nammunition of all sizes and 19,297 total weapons of all\nsizes. Following are the categories of weapons that were\ndestroyed: 18,420 small arms; 626 heavy machine guns;\n150 anti-tank launchers; 63 mortars; 26 recoilless rifles;\n9 guns and howitzers; and 3 rocket launchers. The total\nis 19,297.\nThe destruction of these arms and ammunition does\nnot negate the necessity of lifting the arms embargo. The\nformer represents a clear departure from war mode to the\ninstitution of a culture of peace. The latter restores\nLiberia's sovereign right to equip and maintain a national\narmoury under the aegis of a restructured national army\nto ensure proper accountability and fulfil the elected\nGovernment's constitutional responsibility for national\nsecurity.\nLiberia's international efforts are geared towards\npeace and security, primarily in our subregion and\ngenerally in the world. Our stability is inextricably linked\nto security in the West African subregion. It is within this\ncontext that President Taylor took bold initiatives which\nsignificantly contributed to peace in Sierra Leone. Liberia\nalways felt that the conflict in Sierra Leone was primarily\ninternal. Our persistence to bring about a negotiated\nsettlement, rather than the use of force and violence,\nemanated from our national experience with the futility\nand destructiveness of armed confrontation.\nIn this connection, my Government participated in\nvarious talks, which led to the signing of the historic\nLom\u00e9 Peace Agreement. Presently, Liberia is hosting two\nleaders of the Sierra Leonean conflict in Monrovia in\norder to resolve internal differences and facilitate their\nearly return to Freetown for the smooth implementation\nof the Agreement. My Government is genuinely\ncommitted to the Sierra Leonean peace process and will\ndo everything to ensure that peace and normalcy return to\nthat sister Republic.\n34\n\n\nWe concur with the Secretary-General's\nrecommendation to the Security Council on the\nestablishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force for\nSierra Leone; this, we believe, will sustain and strengthen\nthe efforts of ECOWAS.\nLiberia has been concerned about its borders with\nneighbouring countries, especially Guinea. We have\nwitnessed two incidents of armed aggression along our\nnorthern border, which resulted in the loss of life, property\nand the displacement of people. In this regard, we appeal to\nthe international community to provide us with all the\nnecessary assistance to enable our Government to cope with\nthe problems of refugees and internally displaced persons,\nas well as to address the humanitarian crises created as a\nresult of the attack by dissidents. We are indeed gratified\nthat the Secretary-General has added his voice to the appeal\nfor assistance.\nLiberia is committed to finding a diplomatic solution\nto the problem along the Guinea-Liberia border and\nreaffirms its adherence to the practice of good-\nneighbourliness. We call on the international community to\nduly consider the vulnerability of the subregion due to the\nlarge volume of refugees and the attendant humanitarian\ncrisis. My Government is of the strong conviction that\ndialogue and cooperation between and among neighbours\nwill enhance security, peace and stability in the subregion.\nAccordingly, at a mini-summit of the heads of State and\nGovernment of the Economic Community of West African\nStates, (ECOWAS) held in Abuja, Nigeria on 16 September\n1999, Liberia reached an understanding with Guinea\nrelative to security and cooperation. We therefore call on\nthe international community to lend its support to the\nefforts aimed at reactivating the Mano River Union.\nSince 1992, Africa has experienced numerous\nimpediments to its economic development. There has been\na continuous decline in its exports, imports and the flow of\ndirect foreign investment and overseas development\nassistance. This situation is compounded by the increasing\ndebt burden, estimated at $300 billion. These negative\ntrends hamper Africa's integration into the global economy,\nthus leading to its marginalization. We therefore call for the\ncreation of a more favourable economic environment that\ntaken into account the unique problems of Africa.\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General on the\nmeasures he has taken in helping create a favourable\neconomic environment for Africa, as outlined in his\n\u201cProgress report on the implementation of the\nrecommendations contained in the report on the causes of\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\nsustainable development in Africa\u201d (S/1999/1008).\nFurthermore, we reaffirm our commitment to the\nprovisions of the Algiers Declaration of the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) with respect to the establishment\nof a genuine international partnership.\nWe welcome the offer of the United States President\nBill Clinton to forgive the debts of the world's poorest\ncountries, including Liberia.\nAs a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child, my Government has taken measures to improve\nthe environment for nurturing and developing the child.\nWe hereby reiterate our commitment to the rehabilitation\nand reintegration of children into civil society, in\naccordance with the Maputo Declaration adopted by the\nOAU. We therefore call upon the international community\nto provide support for efforts in this regard.\nLiberia firmly believes that the unification of China\nshould be peacefully pursued and that although it is a\nmatter for the Chinese people themselves to determine,\nthere is nonetheless a need for the United Nations to\nexamine the exceptional international situation pertaining\nto the Republic of China on Taiwan. In so doing it will\nensure that the fundamental rights of 22 million people to\nparticipate in the work and activities of the United\nNations, and it will do honour to this great world body.\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan has contributed\nsubstantially to the international community in the area of\ntechnical and development assistance and has shown a\nstrong commitment to human rights, democracy, market\neconomy and multilateralism. The unparalleled economic\nand political development of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan has brought a strong desire of its people to\nparticipate in international activities.\nResolution 2758 (XXVI), however, denies over 22\nmillion people their right to participate in United Nations\nactivities and contravenes the United Nations Charter's\nprinciple of universality. Taking into account the changing\ninternational climate, characterized by global economic\ninterdependence, it is essential for the United Nations to\nreview this unfair resolution as it steps into a new\ncentury. Liberia believes that the Republic of China on\nTaiwan can play a more important and beneficial role in\nthe United Nations community and that it is willing to\nplay that role. Liberia strongly urges the United Nations\nto find a speedy and satisfactory resolution to the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan's participation in the United\nNations.\n35\n\n\nIn conclusion, since its establishment, the United\nNations has represented mankind's legitimate aspirations.\nDespite its shortcomings, we continue to see it that way.\nLiberia cannot overemphasize its support for the ongoing\nreforms of the United Nations. Twenty-five years ago,\nLiberia called for a review of the United Nations Charter to\nensure its effectiveness to cope with some of the\nfundamental problems that continue to beset the world\ncommunity.\nAlthough we have not been favoured with the usual\nlevel of international support to help speed up the pace of\nprogress in rebuilding our country, Liberia is most grateful\nfor the vital support it has received, especially in the areas\nof rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants and\nresettlement of refugees and displaced persons. It may not\nbe intentional, but it is regrettable that the issue of African\nrefugees has received little attention from the international\ncommunity, as has the issue of the developmental needs of\nthe continent. The United Nations must ensure that on its\nagenda the treatment of refugees around the globe is not\nskewed unequally against a particular region.\nIf this world body will underline the promotion of\nsustainable development, the pursuit of global peace and the\nneed to safeguard human progress, and if we realize that in\norder to succeed we ought to rededicate ourselves to high\nand inspiring objectives, then we can truly ensure the future\nof all mankind, irrespective of our places of origin.\nIn Liberia, we have evolved four strategies for the new\nmillennium: first, to eradicate ignorance, disease \u2014\nparticularly the HIV/AIDS pandemic \u2014 and poverty, and\nto promote human rights; secondly, to strengthen the full\ncapacity of the United Nations to effectively preserve the\ninternational system; thirdly, to promote universal harmony\nand globalization; and fourthly, to protect humankind\nagainst the scourge of nuclear, chemical and biological\nwarfare, and to preserve our ecosystem.\nAs we enter a new century, we need to re-evaluate our\nundertakings and take measures to improve conditions in\nour world with an unflinching respect for the dignity of\nhumankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "We are pleased to note that the annual sessions of\nthe General Assembly are increasingly each year not only\na special forum for discussing international affairs, but also\nand in particular an opportunity for the democratic\nexpression of our shared experience, a time for each\nMember State of the Organization to freely state his or her\nviews.\nIn this context, Cameroon is particularly pleased that\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\nsession has been assumed by a fraternal country, Namibia.\nWe regard it as highly symbolic that this role, at this\ndelicate time of a bridge between two centuries and two\nmillenniums, has been entrusted to you, Mr. Theo-Ben\nGurirab, worthy representative of Namibia, the last State in\nAfrica to recover its sovereignty. My country fully\nassociates itself with the praise addressed to you and we\nassure you of our full support as you exercise your difficult\nand lofty duties. I hardly need recall that your country's\nattainment of independence, just like the end of apartheid\nin South Africa, demonstrates what the United Nations and\nthe international community are capable of.\nCameroon wishes also to reiterate its full appreciation\nto your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the skill,\ndevotion, effectiveness and open-mindedness he\ndemonstrated throughout the fifty-third session.\nFinally, we wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his continuing work to\nconsolidate peace and combat poverty, and for his special\nattention to the problems of the African continent and the\npoorest regions or those in crisis. His outstanding report on\nthe work of the Organization illustrates again this year the\nintelligence and determination that are his constant guides\nas he performs his duties. The work of the Secretary-\nGeneral, carried out with an acute sense of the common\ninterest of all Member States, deserves our support.\nCameroon welcomes the new Members of the\nOrganization: Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga. Their admission\nreinforces the universality of our Organization.\nDespite great progress in many areas, this last decade\nof the twentieth century has been marked, and continues to\nbe marked, by less positive events in the world. More than\never before, therefore, we need to react, act and even act\npreventively, constantly and vigorously, in order to rectify\nan inappropriate course of events. There are still too\nmany conflicts. Too much human blood has been shed.\nToo many men and women have their fundamental rights\nand freedoms flouted. There is too much poverty, even\ndestitution, which is in stark contrast to an unparalleled\nopulence: Too many inequalities and too much\ninterference and domination persist in inter-State relations.\nThis succession of dangers is accentuated by the\nproblems of epidemics and illiteracy, and recalls the vital\nneed for greater solidarity between prosperous countries\nand developing countries, given the growing globalization\nof economies and the universal need for peace,\ndemocracy, prosperity, justice, the guarantee of\nfundamental human rights and the effective sovereignty of\nStates.\nCameroon therefore welcomes recent positive steps\non the path to peace. I refer to the Middle East, with the\nsigning of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in Egypt. The\nresolution of the Kosovo crisis, and particularly the\nestablishment of an administration guaranteed by our\nOrganization, also deserves recognition. Cameroon\nencourages all actors in the Balkans and the Middle East\nto continue to advance resolutely towards lasting\nnormalization.\nWe are also very mindful of developments in East\nTimor, and we hope very much that wisdom will\nprevail \u2014 that is, that everyone will respect the process\ninitiated under United Nations auspices.\nWe welcome the holding in Maputo, Mozambique,\nof the First Meeting of the States Parties to the Ottawa\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction. That meeting made it possible to\ncontinue the campaign to heighten the international\ncommunity\u2019s awareness of the need to ban these ghastly\nweapons for ever. These weapons continue, particularly in\nAfrica, to indiscriminately mutilate children, women, the\nelderly, civilians and military personnel every day.\nCameroon, in confirmation of its commitment to this\ngreat struggle, recently ratified the Convention.\nWe welcome the results achieved in Sierra Leone,\nGuinea-Bissau and Northern Ireland. These and other\nadvances cannot, however, make us forget either the\ndeadly conflicts that continue to destroy lives or the\nthreats of holocaust that persist because of the lack of\nsignificant progress in the field of nuclear disarmament.\n19\n\n\nIn this overall context, which remains full of elements, the\nproliferation of hotbeds of tension and conflict in Africa,\nparticularly in Central Africa, is a major source of concern\nfor Cameroon. That particular situation deserves more\nattention from the international community than ever\nbefore. Unfortunately, as the Secretary-General notes in his\nreport, these African crises, no matter how grave, have\nbasically been ignored.\nIs it conceivable that Somalia, fragmented and\ndisorganized, with its helpless, starving, sick people, and\nnow bereft of any viable state structure, could be purely\nand simply forgotten, abandoned and allowed to perish?\nCould the situation in Somalia today not be the fate of\nother countries on our continent and elsewhere? Should the\ninternational community abdicate its duty of solidarity with\nand assistance to Western Sahara, to the Sudan or in the\nconflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea?\nWe deplore the continuing bloody destructive crisis in\nAngola. That disastrous civil war directly or indirectly\ndestroys thousands of lives and systematically obliterates\ninfrastructure every day; this, too, seems to have been\nforgotten by everyone. Since the withdrawal of the United\nNations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), the States\nmembers of the United Nations Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, which\nfor a year now has been chaired by Cameroon, is trying to\ndo the impossible in order to prevent Angola from\npermanently locking itself up behind fratricidal closed doors\nin the face of this kind of widespread indifference.\nTogether with some other regional and international\ndiplomatic actors, the Standing Advisory Committee has\nalso made many efforts to try to restore peace in Burundi,\nthe Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and Rwanda, particularly through the resolute\ndissemination of a culture of peace.\nIn this respect, Cameroon and all States Members of\nthe Committee welcome the peace accords on the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo signed in July in\nLusaka, Zambia. This came as a result of the doggedness\nand tenacity of African mediators, and it proves, if any\nproof is needed, that Africa, with the support of the\ninternational community, is able to overcome its difficulties.\nWe wish to reiterate the solemn appeal of the Standing\nAdvisory Committee to all signatories of these accords to\nsee to it that the peace process is carried through.\nCameroon is convinced that their determination to\nconsolidate peace will be supported by the international\ncommunity, in particular through the speedy and effective\nestablishment of the peacekeeping force that the United\nNations is planning to deploy in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo.\nNo matter what the cost, we must eradicate wars and\nconflicts in Africa, particularly in Central Africa. We\nmust halt the spiral of bloody confrontation and fighting\nin that subregion, which pits ethnic group blindly against\nethnic group, political group against political group. It is\nnot true that love of and devotion to one\u2019s own people or\nfaith in one\u2019s own ideals must be proved by one\u2019s hatred\ntowards others. These grim tragedies, as we know, are not\ninevitable. Fundamentally, they are the result of practices\nto which Africa must put an end; otherwise, the continent\nwill be for ever left out of humankind\u2019s majestic march\ntowards modernity.\nThe diagnosis of the causes of this situation is\nalready apparent: poverty, destitution, ignorance, the\nabsence of good governance, the fragility of the nations\nand States concerned, and acts of interference of all kinds\nare at the heart of the problem. Together we can combat\nthem and overcome them.\nThis is why one of the priorities of Cameroon\u2019s\ndiplomacy, promoted by President Paul Biya, with the full\nendorsement of his peers, is to help guarantee peace,\nsecurity, stability, democracy and prosperity for the 100\nmillion women and men of Central Africa. This\ndetermination has guided our action as we head the\nUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security\nQuestions in Central Africa.\nAs we prepare to hand over the chairmanship to\nanother fraternal country, we would like to recall the\nprogress that member States have made together over the\nlast 11 months in our quest to strengthen peace, security\nand stability in Central Africa. The most significant\ninitiative undoubtedly was the threefold decision taken at\nthe meetings in Yaound\u00e9, on 25 February 1999, and in\nMalabo, on 24 June 1999, by 9 of the 11 heads of State\nof Central Africa, to establish the Council for Peace and\nSecurity in Central Africa (COPAX); to adopt the\nYaound\u00e9 declaration on peace, security and stability in\ncentral Africa; and to integrate COPAX into the structures\nof the Economic Community of Central African States\n(ECCAS). Through this threefold decision, those heads of\nState have given our subregion a politico-diplomatic\norgan and ethical framework, as well as a code of\nconduct to meet the challenges of prevention,\nmanagement and the lasting settlement of crises and\n20\n\n\nconflicts. The practical modalities for the functioning of\nCOPAX are now being worked out in the secretariat of\nECCAS.\nSince crisis and conflict prevention remain absolute\npriorities, the States of Central Africa have continued their\nefforts to establish an early warning mechanism. This\nstructure has just acquired premises that serve as its\nheadquarters in Libreville, Gabon.\nA number of other initiatives mark important progress\nfor the establishment of peace and stability in Central\nAfrica.\nI refer first to the decision taken in June at the Malabo\nsummit by the heads of State of Central Africa to lend their\nprestige to the establishment of a subregional centre for the\npromotion of human rights and democracy. With the\nsupport of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, this centre will be both an observatory of\nrealities and trends and a kind of think tank to produce\nrecommendations on human rights and democracy. I wish,\non behalf of the peoples of Central Africa, to welcome the\nencouragement shown by Mrs. Mary Robinson for this\nproject, as well as the steps she has taken to follow up on\nthe resolution adopted on this subject by the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session.\nI also wish to refer to the establishment of a network\nof parliamentarians of Central Africa \u2014 an initiative that\nshould lead to the establishment of a subregional parliament\nwhich will be both a democratic forum and a subregional\nplatform for cooperation and harmonization of laws dealing\nwith questions of peace, security and integration.\nI would also mention the establishment of the Central\nAfrican Court of Justice, the seat of which will be in\nN\u2019Djamena.\nI would like to refer to the high-level seminar held in\nYaound\u00e9 from 19 to 21 July this year on the report of the\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and the\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\nAfrica, proceeding from the desire and determination of the\nleaders of Central Africa to build peace and progress in the\nsubregion. This high-profile meeting \u2014 which brought\ntogether parliamentarians, seasoned experts, civilians and\nmilitary, men and women with experience representing civil\nsociety and non-governmental organizations and whose\nreport was published by the United Nations \u2014 made it\npossible to identify ways and means for the specific\nimplementation in Central Africa of the recommendations\nof the Secretary-General.\nThe main actions recommended by the seminar to\nfollow up the very frank diagnosis of the situation seek to\npromote effectively human rights, participative\ndemocracy, methods for the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes, good governance, transparency, international\nhumanitarian law and accelerated national and regional\nintegration.\nThe proliferation and illicit circulation of small arms\nand light weapons in the region is another major concern\nfor the member countries of the Committee because they\nthreaten their stability. A subregional conference will be\nheld on this subject at the end of October in N\u2019Djamena\nunder the aegis of the Committee and with United\nNations support. It will make it possible for member\nStates to assess the scale, causes, mechanisms and\nconsequences of this phenomenon and to envisage\nspecific steps to be taken.\nAll of these actions \u2014 in particular the\nestablishment of COPAX, the early warning mechanism,\nthe subregional human rights centre, the parliament and\nthe Central African Court of Justice \u2014 are challenges, not\nmerely for Central Africa itself, but clearly for the entire\ninternational community. They will be priority areas for\nfruitful bilateral and multilateral cooperation at the\nthreshold of the new millennium. That is certainly the\nwish of the peoples of Central Africa.\nThe design of a subregional policy for peace,\nstability, democracy and development in Central Africa is\npartly related to the domestic policy of Cameroon. The\nhead of State has always believed that there is no crisis\nthat cannot be resolved peacefully through dialogue,\npooling of efforts and especially through respect for the\nlaw. It is this conviction that prompted Cameroon to\nstress the search for a settlement through legal means of\nthe dispute with the Federal Republic of Nigeria regarding\nthe land and maritime border.\nIn this year which marks the closing of the United\nNations Decade of International Law, we must forcefully\nreaffirm our total support for the rule of law in inter-State\nrelations and the peaceful settlement of disputes, including\nthrough jurisdictional means when other mechanisms have\nproved to be ineffectual. That is why we urge the\ninternational community to continue to help our two\ncountries, Cameroon and Nigeria, to adopt effective\nmeasures to strengthen peace and the climate of\n21\n\n\nconfidence which has emerged following the contacts at the\nhighest level which have taken place this year.\nPending the verdict of the International Court of\nJustice in The Hague, three of these measures could be\ntaken right now: a solemn declaration of commitment to\nabide by the Court\u2019s decision, withdrawal of armed forces\nfrom the battlefield to positions which they held before the\noutbreak of fighting, and the lifting by Nigeria of its recent\nreservations about the optional clause regarding binding\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice,\nreservations which negate an international society based on\nlaw. The positive winds of change now blowing across\nNigeria, following the coming to power of the\ndemocratically elected civilian regime, give us enormous\nhope.\nThrough the work it did last year, Cameroon, like\nother States in Central Africa, is resolutely committed to\nsaving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. But\nwe did more than that. We also determined for the sake of\nfuture generations to protect the environment and to\nsafeguard the natural resources. An example of this was the\nsummit on conservation and sustainable forest development\norganized last March in Yaound\u00e9 in the presence of heads\nof State and Government of the subregion and a\ndistinguished host, His Royal Highness Prince Philip, the\nDuke of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom of Great Britain\nand Northern Ireland, who is past President of the World\nWide Fund for Nature.\nFour resolutions were adopted by the heads of State\nand Government of Central Africa to preserve and extend\nthe millions of hectares of forest in our subregion. They\nundertook to conserve and manage the forests of Central\nAfrica in a sustainable manner to safeguard our rich\nbiodiversity. They then undertook, in particular, to protect\nnew transnational forest zones in the Congo basin. Then the\nmajor partners and donors agreed to provide financial and\ntechnical assistance to implement the resolutions and\ncommitments adopted at the Yaound\u00e9 summit. Finally, the\nsummit participants agreed that good forest management is\nan important part of work for sustainable development in\nCentral Africa.\nHowever, in the areas of the protection, conservation\nand sustainable management of forests and biodiversity, a\nprofound dilemma has arisen. Central Africa is, after the\nAmazon region of South America, the second largest\nforested area of the world whose natural characteristics are\ndecisive for the balance of the biosphere and the\necosystems of the entire planet. The accelerated and\nmindless destruction of this forest would in fact be a\ndirect way to prepare for the disappearance of all life on\nearth. In a word, the forests of Central Africa are the\nlungs of the world.\nFollowing the Yaound\u00e9 summit, the senior officials\nof Central Africa and the peoples concerned became\nclearly aware of their duty to all humankind, a duty that\nshould be reflected in the sound conservation and\nmanagement of forests and the diverse resources they\ncontain. But at the same time, the experts rightly noted\nthat this would involve extremely heavy and increasingly\nhigher costs. The costs of protecting species, reforestation\nand reintroducing animals, as well as the administrative\ncosts involved in the functioning of the institutions\nneeded to do those jobs, will be an additional burden on\nthe already meagre resources of the countries of our\nsubregion.\nThis is why we believe that it would only be right\nfor the whole of humankind \u2014 for which we are making\nthis vital sacrifice of forest and biodiversity\nconservation \u2014 to find the ways and means to support us\nin this work for the common good. This could be done by\nproviding matching funds or, better yet, by bringing about\ngenuine global action under the guidance of the United\nNations and financed by a fund for the preservation and\nsustainable management of forests and biodiversity in\nCentral Africa. That fund would support all the important\npreliminary work to be done in this essential area of\nglobalization.\nWe will be submitting a draft resolution on this\nsubject for the kind consideration of the General\nAssembly.\nWhen Cameroon campaigns with other States for the\nprotection of the environment and for the safeguarding of\nnatural resources, we do so very mindful of the long term,\nwhich has meaning only in relation to the future of\nmankind, and of younger generations in particular. We are\nall the more conscious of the importance of the legacy we\nwill leave for the adults of tomorrow because more than\n46 per cent of the population of Cameroon will reach\nadulthood at the beginning of the twenty-first century.\nThe proportion of our children who are today under 15\nyears of age, like all men and women of the world in the\nnext century, have a legitimate right to demand of us, as\nthe most important part of our legacy, peace, security and\nstability in freedom and development and in a healthy\nenvironment. That is why, in conclusion, I wish to\n22\n\n\naddress our partners in the prosperous countries, particularly\nthe Group of Eight.\nI wish first of all to say how much we appreciate the\nsteps that have been taken this year to reduce the debt\nburden of the poorest countries, particularly those in our\ncontinent. According to the Secretary-General, the African\ndebt burden represents more than 300 per cent of the value\nof goods and services exported from the region. Therefore,\nthe spirit of solidarity in the Group of Eight, which is a\ngood sign, must be pursued and consolidated while taking\ninto account the situation of the so-called medium-income\ncountries. That spirit of solidarity must be resolutely\ncontinued and take root in all other developed countries.\nThe Secretary-General's in-depth coverage of many\nsubjects in his report calls for us to reflect on them. I will\ntake up just one of these subjects: AIDS.\nLike other pandemics, AIDS not only jeopardizes the\nfuture of millions of African men and women, it is also a\nmortal danger for all humankind. To show a lack of\nconcern for its ravages in Africa, no matter what part of the\nworld one comes from, would be suicidal indifference. The\nfuture of the world is more indivisible than ever before.\nThe choice can no longer be postponed \u2014 the choice\nbetween the universal common good and the chaos caused\nby poverty, destitution, ignorance, injustice, the absence of\ngood governance, interference, wars, et cetera.\nThe end of this century shows every sign of serving as\na loud and clear call to the whole of mankind, but first and\nforemost to the leaders of nations. The end of the century\nhas made hope possible and has brought about the global\nadvancement of the values of peace, democracy, solidarity\nand the struggle for human rights. These principles must\nnot merely guide each nation; we believe that they should\nalso inspire the relations between nations. The staunch\nresolve of all countries to promote these principles together\nis the only guarantee of a better future for humanity. In\norder to bring this about, mankind as a whole \u2014\nincreasingly more united and in solidarity under the banner\nof the United Nations \u2014 has a duty to provide speedy\nassistance wherever the life and dignity of the human being\nhave been seriously undermined or threatened.\nAccordingly, it is clear that the international\ncommunity, assembled within the United Nations, has an\ninalienable, inviolate and sacred right to act. This universal\nright to act, whose letter, spirit, legality and legitimacy\ncome from the Charter itself, is the reflection and the\ninevitable consequence of the changes occurring in the\nworld today. Clearly, it excludes any form of interference.\nA new world has thus been born; we must\nacknowledge this from now on. The Millennium\nAssembly and the Millennium Summit, to be held in the\nyear 2000, should embody the spirit of that new world\nand set it in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

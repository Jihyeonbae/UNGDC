        "file_text": "The Government and\npeople of Botswana salute your elevation to the Presidency\nof the forty-ninth session of the Assembly. Your election by\nacclamation is a fitting tribute not only to your personal\ndistinction but also to the African continent, on whose soil\nyou were bred and nurtured. It goes without saying,\ntherefore, that the confidence we repose in you as you\nguide our deliberations is beyond measure.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s legendary tenacity of purpose\nat the helm of our Organization has continued to serve us\nvery well indeed. He remains undaunted by the\ncomplexities of the problems he faces as the world\u2019s chief\ndiplomat and peacemaker in an era marred by the\ncontinuing absence of peace. We salute him and his staff of\ndedicated international civil servants.\nLet me also pay a deserved tribute to our dear brother,\nlast year\u2019s President, Ambassador Samuel Insanally, whose\ntenure of office was most effective, productive and creative.\nWe wish him a happy, hard-earned retirement from the\nservice of our General Assembly.\nThe new world order remains a misnomer. Misery and\nwretchedness are the order of the day in many parts of the\nworld. The post-cold war era was to be the era of\ndemocratization, peace and development, so we hoped. Yes,\ndemocratization has taken root in many parts of the world,\nincluding our own continent, Africa. That is to be\ncelebrated, and should be celebrated. Unfortunately, the\nenergies and resources that the international community\ncould be deploying to help buttress and nurture emerging\ndemocracies have to be expended on the search for\nsolutions to a multiplicity of intractable civil wars.\nTragically, some of these civil wars show no sign of\namenability to solutions. They have become perennial; so\nis the United Nations mission to mitigate them. This places\nthe United Nations in a terrible dilemma, both moral and\nmaterial. Unfortunately, there is very little choice for our\nOrganization. It would be absolutely unconscionable to\nabandon a Bosnia or a Somalia to its own wretched\ndevices.\nNevertheless, there is no doubt that the United\nNations peacekeeping commitments are threatening to\noverwhelm the Organization\u2019s capacities. Financial\nresources to sustain these commitments may soon dry up,\nif indeed they are available, in tandem with the drying up\nof support for peace-keeping generally, particularly\namong the big contributors.\nThe past year has been a year of mixed blessings for\nAfrica. The continent won a major victory with the\nliberation of South Africa from the shackles of apartheid\nand racism. Three-and-a-half centuries of white minority\ndomination have ended, and the construction of a new\nnon-racial society has begun in earnest in South Africa.\nWe heartily congratulate all the people of South Africa,\nin their racial and cultural diversity, on the wisdom and\ncourage they have shown in coming to terms with their\ncommon destiny. We welcome the new South Africa into\nour midst with open arms.\nSouthern Africa, the erstwhile cockpit of conflict,\nhas suddenly found salvation and begun the process of\nreconstruction and regional cooperation and integration.\nSince peace and stability are universal prerequisites for\norderly economic and social development, both of which\nwe have begun to savour in southern Africa, there is\nevery reason why we should be excited about the future\nof our region.\nWith the holding of multiparty elections in the sister\nRepublic of Mozambique, the process of democratization\nin the region will have come closer than ever before to\nculmination. Increasingly, the region is being guided in\nthe ordering of its political affairs by a set of common\ndemocratic values. Through the Southern African\nDevelopment Community\u2019s economic fraternity,\nmechanisms are being developed to promote regional\napproaches to the protection of human rights and the\nsafeguarding of the democratic milieu that the region has\nlaboured so hard and shed so much blood to bring about.\nAs an example, I would mention the case of\nLesotho, about which members will have heard.\nRecently, when democracy was placed in danger there,\nthe region, through the good offices of three Presidents of\nsouthern African countries - Zimbabwe, South Africa and\nBotswana - sprang into action to engage the Basotho\nleaders in a dialogue, which happily culminated in the\ncherished Lesotho democracy being saved without a shot\n30\n\n\nbeing fired. It was regional conflict-resolution and\ndiplomacy at their very best.\nYet we remain troubled and pained by the fact that not\nall is well in other parts of the African continent by any\nstretch of the imagination. Our south western sister\nRepublic of Angola has never had a moment of tranquillity,\npeace or stability ever since it attained its independence 19\nyears ago. Blood has continued to flow in that tortured\ncountry in ever-increasing profusion, even as we are told\nthe Lusaka talks are on the verge of a successful\nconclusion. This is the precious blood of innocent Angolans\nshed needlessly because the multiparty democracy\ndemanded by UNITA and its supporters was won three\nyears ago, only to be subjected to another round of brutal\ncivil war. We remain hopeful, however, that the marathon\ntalks in Lusaka, capital of the Republic of Zambia, will\nproduce an agreement for the parties to implement without\nreservation.\nThe Somali tragedy remains intractable. The presence\nin the fractured country of 18,000 United Nations peace-\nkeeping troops, including Botswanans, has not made much\nof a difference in the restoration of peace and tranquillity\nto the Somali people.\nNow we are faced with a threat to abandon the\ncountry to its fate. The international community has every\nreason to be frustrated and exasperated by what looks like\na total absence of any intention on the part of the warring\nSomali factions to reconcile and give their nation a chance\nto drag itself out of the quagmire of civil war. We\nunderstand this frustration and exasperation, and yet we\nwould find it absolutely unconscionable for the United\nNations simply to uproot itself from Somalia when it is\nabundantly clear that such a course of action would have\ncatastrophic consequences. The decision to withdraw the\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) must\nbe carefully weighed against the obvious consequences of\nthe vacuum it will create.\nThere is also Liberia, whose agony clearly knows no\nlimit. The madness that is being displayed by the warring\nfactions there is surely beyond comprehension. Is the\nnewly intensified fighting which has caused another exodus\nof refugees to neighbouring countries and wasted more\ninnocent lives the way to thank the monitoring Group of the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOMOG)\nand the international community for the cost in lives and\nmaterial they have suffered and incurred in an attempt to\nsave Liberia from self-destruction? The first world is\nalready showing signs of extreme weariness about the cost\nof peace-keeping. Soon even ECOMOG may run out of\nthe means and the will to persist in its seemingly\nimpossible mission to save Liberia from itself. And as\nlong as Liberia is in the state in which it is there is the\ncertainty that peace in the region at large will be and\nremain imperilled.\nAlthough the carnage has ended in Rwanda, the\ntragedy that has befallen its people has not. The\nRwandese nation cannot reconcile so long as chunks of it\nare languishing and dying in refugee camps in foreign\nlands. Rwanda cannot endure any more cycles of civil\nwar and genocidal massacres. The tens or hundreds of\nthousands of refugees encamped at present in the\nneighbouring countries must be helped to return to their\nhomeland lest out of the frustrations of exile in their\nsqualid refugee camps they ignite another cycle of\ngenocide.\nOn the perennial question of Western Sahara,\nBotswana shares the view that it is taking far too long to\nhold a referendum in the Territory to allow the Sahraoui\npeople to decide their future. The Territory cannot and\nmust not be allowed to mark time forever in a limbo of\nuncertainty as if the fulfillment of the aspirations of its\npeople can be delayed until their final submission.\nBeyond the African continent, the agony of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina has continued to outrage the conscience\nof mankind. The senseless bloodletting in that tormented\nregion of Europe remains stubbornly impervious to\nsolution. Peace plan after peace plan has failed to\nimpress one side or the other, and the result is that the\npatience of the international community, which has to\ndeploy enormous resources to maintain a massive\npeace-keeping presence in the area, is being tested beyond\nendurance. The question we ask is: How can the\nperpetrators of that cruel conflict ever make sense out of\nit? We appeal to them to stop the carnage. Meanwhile,\nwe urge the International Tribunal set up to bring to\njustice the authors and perpetrators of that barbarous war\nto spare no effort in doing so.\nWe hope that in the Caribbean, the people of Haiti\nwill take advantage of the massive assistance they are\nreceiving from the international community to normalize\nthe situation in their country. They have a golden\nopportunity to do so and to resume the journey they\nstarted three years ago towards a democratic future.\nThere may be no second - or third - chance.\n31\n\n\nBotswana believes that the time has come for Cuba\nand the United States to negotiate an amicable end to their\nprotracted estrangement. Intractable problems all over the\nworld, are being resolved through negotiations, and we do\nnot believe that the cold war between Cuba and the United\nStates is beyond resolution by negotiation. Botswana\nvalues the friendship of both countries and cherishes the\nhope that soon there will be peace and reconciliation\nbetween the two neighbours.\nThe Middle East has broken out of the straitjacket of\nno war- no peace. We hail the agreement clinched last year\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO) and the rapprochement between Israel and Jordan\nsymbolized by the signing of the Washington Declaration\nto bring to an end the state of war between the two\ncountries, and we urge that no stone be left unturned in the\nquest for a comprehensive solution to the problems of that\nvery important area of the world.\nUnfortunately, the sound of the drums of war in the\nGulf area are piercing our ears once again. We hope that\nthis time the parties involved in the war dance are merely\ntrying to exorcise the demons of the politics of\nbrinkmanship, without any intention whatsoever of bringing\nworld peace to the brink and beyond.\nThe arbitrary division of the island of Cyprus remains\nunrepaired. We urge the parties to reintensify their search\nfor a mutually acceptable dispensation that will make\npossible the reunification of the island and its people.\nThe same applies to the two Koreas. The people of\nthe North and South are Koreans in every sense and soon\nthey must realize that, like the people of South Africa, who\nhave just triumphed over racial division, they too can\ntriumph if they try harder, over ideological division.\nWe live in the age of dialogue and negotiation, the age\nof reconciliation and forgiveness. No one will be excused\nfor refusing to negotiate an end to a disagreement.\nOver the past two decades my country has experienced\nan unprecedented period of economic growth. Between\n1970 and 1992 Botswana achieved an annual real growth\nrate of 12 per cent per year in gross domestic product.\nAfter being viewed as one of the world\u2019s poorest countries,\nwith a per capita income estimated at $70, Botswana\nsuddenly became Africa\u2019s success story, a success born out\nof a stable, democratic political system and a free-market\neconomy. Our democratic system is now so entrenched\nthat it has become our nation\u2019s second nature. The happy\nresult is that Botswana is free from any ethnic or tribal\nconflict.\nRegrettably, we have not been spared the wrath of\nthe world recession and have thus experienced dramatic\ndeclines in growth rates. Our economic growth, heavily\ninfluenced by the development of minerals, particularly\ndiamonds, has experienced adverse effects arising from\nthe fall in the price of diamonds. Our country has\nentered the most challenging period since independence.\nAfrica as a whole is engaged, in one form or\nanother, in economic and political reforms that need the\nsupport and cooperation of the donor community and the\nmultilateral financial institutions. Poverty is an\nunderlying factor of underdevelopment that many African\ncountries have to contend with today. Regrettably,\nimplementation of the structural adjustment programme,\nwelcome as it is in the restructuring of African\neconomies, has in many instances worsened the social\nconditions of the poor in the short term. This is why\nBotswana looks forward to the forthcoming World\nSummit on Social Development, where we will have the\nopportunity to address these anomalies in a very serious\nmanner.\nBotswana is encouraged by the ongoing process of\nreform and revitalization of the United Nations in the\neconomic, social and related fields. The adoption of\nGeneral Assembly resolution 48/162 has brought about\nunprecedented changes in the working of the United\nNations system, at the level both of the Economic and\nSocial Council and of the Second Committee of the\nGeneral Assembly; we welcome all of this. It is our hope\nthat these changes will bring about efficiency and\neffectiveness in addressing the needs and concerns of\ndeveloping countries at the policy-making and operational\nlevels.\nWith regard to reform of the Security Council, I can\ndo no better than quote the African Common Position\nPaper on United Nations Reforms:\n\\\"The expansion and equitable representation in the\nSecurity Council has become imperative because of\nthe need to democratize and make the Council more\n32\n\n\nefficient and transparent. In this era, the democracy\nthat is being preached at national level should pervade\nthe international system. It is thus necessary to review\nboth the composition and the decision-making process\nof the Council, in line with the above principles, and\ntaking into account the relationship between the\nCouncil and the General Assembly. In implementing\nthese ideals, it is necessary to bear in mind the need\nfor equitable geographical representation, which\nemphasizes increased permanent membership for\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa.\\\"\nWe are due to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of this Organization. The United Nations has\namply vindicated its existence. It survived the distractions\nand ravages of the cold war with its sense of purpose\nrelatively intact. Botswana\u2019s fidelity to the purposes and\nprinciples of the Organization\u2019s Charter remains unstinting.\nIt is therefore our cherished hope that the next century will\nusher in an environment in which the Organization will\nthrive in the pursuit of these purposes and principles.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to\noffer congratulations and special greetings to Ambassador\nEssy on his unanimous election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that under his able\nleadership this session of the General Assembly is well\nplaced to address successfully the important issues on its\nagenda.\nAllow me to express appreciation to His Excellency\nMr. Samuel Insanally for his wise and effective guidance\nduring the session just concluded. He has indeed made an\noutstanding contribution, of which our region is very proud.\nWe express our thanks to the Secretary-General for his\nstewardship of the Organization during these trying times,\nand we renew our pledge to give him our fullest support.\nTrinidad and Tobago, like the rest of the world, is in\nthe process of making fundamental changes in the way we\nmanage our affairs. We have already advanced\nsignificantly along the path of deregulation and\nliberalization brought upon us by the inexorable move\ntowards globalization and borderlessness, and most\nimportantly by the absolute necessity to achieve greater\nefficiency and higher sustainable levels of productivity.\nGreater emphasis is being placed on the market paradigm\nas the means to unleash the inner energies of our society\nand to create the wealth needed for the improvement of the\nlives of all our citizens.\nBut let me hasten to add that we are acutely aware of\nthe imbalances that could arise as a result of the purest play\nof market forces, and we as a society consider it our\nresponsibility to ensure that distributive justice exists in our\nsystem, sufficiently to guarantee the well-being of all of our\ncitizens, including those who are unable to compete and\nwho for one reason or another may have been pushed out\nof the mainstream of national activity. In other words,\nwhilst many things may be changing, there is one constant\nin Trinidad and Tobago, and that is our preservation of a\nhumane and just society where all have the opportunity for\nfulfilment.\nSide by side with the globalization process, or maybe\nas a byproduct of it, is a resurgence of regionalism\nthroughout the world. In our own hemisphere this is very\npronounced, and the dream of a free trade area from Alaska\nto Tierra del Fuego seems more realizable than ever before.\nWe are pleased to see various subregional groupings\nemerge and then develop relationships with one another.\nNever before in the history of our hemisphere has the\nintegration process been so advanced. We have the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Southern\nCone Common Market (MERCOSUR), the Andean Pact,\nthe Central American Integration Movement, the Latin\nAmerican Economic System (SELA), the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) and the Rio Group, in addition\nof course to the Organization of American States. It is\nsignificant that the cooperation which is flowering is not\nonly economic but also political; this augurs very well for\nthe development as well as for the security of the\nhemisphere.\nIn addition to this multilateral coalescence, there is\na general strengthening of bilateral relationships. We in\nCARICOM have been making strides towards overcoming\nhistorical barriers and have been deepening our ties with\nLatin America. My own country, having this year\nestablished diplomatic relations with six countries of Latin\nAmerica, now has diplomatic relations with all the\ncountries of the western hemisphere. Also, we joined 38\nothers, including both independent countries and\nnon-independent Territories, in establishing the\nAssociation of Caribbean States, comprising countries of\nthe Caribbean littoral and bringing into being a market of\nover 200 million people with a combined gross domestic\nproduct of $500 billion.\nWe do all this for the benefit of our people, realizing\nthat when we join forces we are stronger, we lay the\nbedrock for a stable environment within the hemisphere,\nand we create, among other things, megamarkets for our\nproducts and generate the wealth through which we\nimprove the standard of living in our countries.\nI have spoken about the possibilities for political\nco-operation as a result of the integration processes taking\nplace in our region. May I mention an outstanding\ncurrent example. I refer of course to Haiti. At present in\nHaiti, sanctioned by Security Council resolution 940\n(1994), is a multinational force comprised mainly of\ntroops from the region, with military contributions from\nelsewhere. My Government welcomes the cooperation\nextended by countries outside the region whose\nfarsightedness persuaded them to contribute to the\nrestoration process now taking place in Haiti.\nIn the changed circumstances of today\u2019s world, there\nis more than ever a need to cooperate for security\npurposes and for the preservation of democracy, and this\n19\n\n\nof course requires the political will which has been\ndemonstrated by our region in the Haitian situation.\nSoldiers from Trinidad and Tobago are part of the\nmultinational force at present in Haiti. We are pleased to\nparticipate in the collective efforts to ensure stability and\nthe return of democracy and the democratically elected\nPresident to that country. We believe that the Caribbean\nhas a special responsibility in relation to Haiti. We have\ntherefore been in the forefront of attempts to solve the\ncrisis, and we vow to remain with the problem until it is no\nmore with us.\nTrinidad and Tobago joins the jubilation of the\nmillions of proud Haitians at home and in the diaspora at\nthe welcome news of the resignation of General Raoul\nCedras and his Chief of Staff. Like others, we hope this\nsends an unequivocal message to those elements in Haiti\nthat seek to continue to wage war and terror against a\npeople still yearning for a society of freedom, democracy\nand justice - a society in which the collective talents and\nresourcefulness of Haitians can be appropriately channelled\ntowards rebuilding their nation and fighting the enemies of\npoverty and degradation.\nAnother area of Caribbean concern has to do with\nCuba. We welcome the commencement of dialogue\nbetween Cuba and the United States of America on specific\nissues. These talks should assist in laying a foundation for\nthe resolution of remaining difficulties and in achieving the\nlong-term objective of fully reintegrating Cuba into the\nWestern Hemisphere. We in the Caribbean are doing our\npart towards the goal of Cuba\u2019s reintegration. We have\nestablished the Cuba-Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\nMixed Commission, and recently Cuba joined us as a\nfounding member of the Association of Caribbean States.\nTrinidad and Tobago also welcomes the consolidation\nof democracy in the Latin American and Caribbean region.\nPeaceful elections continue to be conducted in these\ncountries, deepening the democratic process in the region.\nWe are pleased with the many positive developments\nin our part of the world. There have also been positive\ndevelopments in former areas of conflict which seized the\nattention of this body for many years, further illustrating\nwhat can be achieved through partnership and political will.\nThe peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa a few\nmonths ago stands out as a beacon of hope and signals that\nno problem is insurmountable if there is concerted national\nand international action. Trinidad and Tobago joins with\nthe international community in assuring South Africa of its\ncontinued support in this crucial post-apartheid period. The\nGovernment of South Africa has announced its decision\nto include among its priorities the continuation of\ntraditional friendships and the promotion of new\npartnerships. We look forward to the development of\nstrong bilateral relations between South Africa and\nourselves, a process that is already under way.\nTrinidad and Tobago is also heartened by the\nprogress achieved so far in the Middle East peace\nprocess. We welcome the initiation of self-governing\narrangements in the Gaza Strip and Jericho - important\ndevelopments in this transition period - and look forward\nto the extension of Palestinian self-governing\narrangements to encompass other occupied territories in\nthe implementation of the Declaration of Principles. The\ninternational community\u2019s support for development efforts\nin the economic and social fields and the rebuilding of\ninfrastructure destroyed during the long years of\noccupation is critical to the Palestinian people at this time.\nWe are encouraged by the Washington Declaration\nof 25 July 1994, issued by the Governments of Jordan\nand Israel, which ended the state of war and paves the\nway for normalization of relations and a formal peace\ntreaty. We also appreciate the efforts made by the Syrian\nand Lebanese Governments in their commitment to\nadvancing the peace process in the Middle East.\nWhilst there is cause for satisfaction globally, we\ncontinue to be traumatized by other events which have\nalready shattered the lives of millions of people, evoking\nimages more horrendous than those we have witnessed\nbefore. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a genocidal war\nrages on, having already brought the evil of \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d into our modern vocabulary and consciousness.\nWe were first appalled and are now numbed by the horror\nin Rwanda, where hundreds of thousands of lives have\nbeen lost, creating hellish human suffering in that country.\nDestruction, oppression and suffering continue in various\nparts of the world, affecting hundreds of thousands of\nlives in Somalia and elsewhere.\nNuclear proliferation makes us all very uneasy,\ncreating pictures of an abyss of unspeakable chaos into\nwhich we can very easily slip. The ideological divide\nmay be behind us, but the threat of Armageddon still\nhangs over humanity.\nIt has become a clich\u00e9 of international helplessness\nto say that the world community must act decisively and\nexpeditiously to do this or that to deal with many of the\nproblems that I have mentioned. The fact is that there is\n20\n\n\na very long road ahead. To effect lasting solutions to the\ncrises that are upon us we must go back always to the\nfundamentals and remember, for example, that development\nand peace are inextricably linked. If we are to get\nanywhere near to solving some of our problems we must\ndeal with key issues such as good governance, the\npromotion of peace, the promotion of justice as a pillar of\nsociety, sustainable environmental management and social\ndevelopment.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the world\ncommunity is already beginning to grapple with\nfundamentals. We are in the process of elaborating the\nAgenda for Development as a necessary complement to the\n\u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d. International conferences of world\nleaders, some held and others to come, all point the way to\na new partnership for development based on global\nconsensus and action.\nIn this regard, the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment will be convened in March 1995 in Denmark\nto address some of the serious ills afflicting many societies\nby focusing on the key problems of poverty, unemployment\nand social marginalization. The programme of action to be\nadopted at the social Summit must therefore include\nspecific provisions, including adequate financial resources\nfor implementation and follow-up by the international\ncommunity and, more specifically, by the United Nations\nand its agencies and institutions.\nThere can be no doubt that the quality of life in many\ncountries today as it relates to the individual is undergoing\na grave transformation. The growing intolerance and\nincreasing senseless violence within the home and in\ncommunities at large have led many to question the very\nmores of the society in which we live. The situation is\nfurther aggravated by the growth of organized transnational\ncrime, which in many countries exacerbates problems of\nrampant vicious criminal activity, terrorism, drug abuse,\nillegal drug trafficking and money laundering.\nIn this era of increasing globalization, no Government,\nparticularly Governments in the developing world, can\nhope, on its own, to address effectively these varied\nproblems. We therefore welcome the approval by the\nInternational Law Commission earlier this year of a draft\nstatute for an international criminal court and we support\nthe convening of a diplomatic conference to conclude a\nconvention on the establishment of a permanent court.\nAnother important area being tackled by the\ninternational community is the full participation of women\nin the process of development. The fact is, effective\ninternational cooperation for development will remain\nelusive, in the absence of specific measures for an\nadequate means of empowering all members of society to\nparticipate fully in the political, economic and social life\nof their respective societies. It is widely acknowledged\nthat investment in women can have an enormous impact\non the advancement of society as a whole. However,\nwomen from all parts of the globe continue to face\nsystematic discrimination in all fields of endeavour, while\nalso bearing a disproportionate burden of the\nconsequences of economic recession, poverty, structural\nadjustment policies and political strife.\nIn acknowledging this, Trinidad and Tobago has put\nin place constitutional guarantees to ensure equal\ntreatment for all under the law, irrespective of gender,\ncreed or race. My Government holds steadfastly to the\nposition that women must be allowed equal opportunity\nto participate fully in all spheres of life and at all levels\nof society, particularly in decision-making positions.\nTrinidad and Tobago is encouraged by efforts made\nduring the ongoing preparatory process for the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women to address these and other\ncrucial issues. Much work remains to be done in the\nensuing months. My Government will continue to work\nclosely with others in an effort to elaborate concrete\nrecommendations, including specific attainable goals,\naimed at overcoming the numerous impediments to the\nadvancement of women.\nThe population question also continues to be on the\ninternational agenda. It is recognized that population-\nrelated goals and policies must be integral parts of\ncultural, economic and social development aimed at\nimproving the quality of life. Consequently, the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\nwhich was convened in Cairo last September, quite\nappropriately reviewed the impact of demographic factors\non development and emphasized the importance of the\nentire spectrum of population policies to the development\nprocess. We must now take concrete steps to uphold the\nprinciples and implement the Programme of Action\nadopted by the Conference.\nThe crucial area of the environment is also being\ndiscussed. Member States have taken initial steps at the\nnational and international levels, towards the elaboration\nof a new development paradigm based on the integration\nof environmental concerns in development activities. The\ncontinuation of this process would lead to the\n21\n\n\nimplementation of the policies and decisions adopted at Rio\nde Janeiro, thereby making possible the attainment of the\ntargets identified for our common good.\nAs a follow-up to the Rio de Janeiro Conference, the\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States, which was held in\nBarbados earlier this year, allowed island States and the rest\nof the international community to explore a comprehensive\napproach to sustainable development within the framework\nof Agenda 21. For many island developing States which\nhave remained on the periphery of international\nprogrammes for development, the implementation of the\nagreements adopted in Barbados will create the opportunity\nto participate as contributors and beneficiaries in a truly\nglobal effort. As Chairman of the Alliance of Small Island\nStates, Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its commitment to\nplaying a lead role in the active pursuit of the\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.\nThe preservation and sustainable management of the\nresources in all global commons must be an important goal\nof the Agenda for Development. But this goal must be\nfacilitated by the development of legal regimes to ensure\nthat we successfully carry out our duties as trustees of those\nresources.\nIn this context, Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the\nimminent entry into force of the 1982 United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, having participated very\nactively with other Member States in forging a new, more\nuniversally accepted public order for the oceans. The spirit\nof accommodation and consensus manifested in the work\nachieved by the Preparatory Commission for the\nInternational Seabed Authority and for the International\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea constitutes a solid and\nvaluable foundation for the launching of the International\nSeabed Authority in Kingston, Jamaica, on\n16 November 1994. Trinidad and Tobago will continue to\nparticipate constructively and in close cooperation with\nother Member States in the decision-making process of the\nAuthority as well as in other institutions related to the 1982\nConvention.\nThe coming into force of the Convention on the Law\nof the Sea should provide an impetus to the United Nations\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\nFish Stocks, which is developing principles for the effective\nmanagement of one of the most important renewable food\nresources. This objective can be attained only if there is a\nconfluence of political will to act decisively.\nPolitical will is also absolutely necessary if we are\nto address adequately the various international economic\nimpediments to effective national efforts to promote social\nprogress and better standards of life. The major obstacles\ninclude trade barriers, insufficient flows of international\nfinancing, onerous external debt and the inadequate\ntransfer of technology to developing countries. They\nserve to frustrate the ardent efforts made by Governments\nto revitalize their economies.\nTrinidad and Tobago welcomes the important step\ntaken earlier this year towards free and open trade, with\nthe successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade\nnegotiations. We emphasize, however, that as we seek to\nimplement the trade liberalization measures under the\nagreements arrived at, urgent attention must be given to\nthe persistent trend of economic growth accompanied by\nincreased poverty, unemployment and marginalization of\nlarge sections of populations the world over.\nIt is clear from what I have said that it is only\nthrough a multilateral approach that we will solve the\nproblems of the world. Clearly, the most appropriate\nvehicle to accommodate this approach is the United\nNations. People are turning increasingly to the United\nNations not only for the realization of their aspirations for\npeace and security, but also in their quest for\ndevelopment with equity and social justice. Following the\ndissipation of the distrust and hostility of the cold-war\nera, the United Nations ought to be in a better position to\nrespond to these needs.\nOn becoming a Member of the United Nations 32\nyears ago, Trinidad and Tobago undertook along with\nother Member States to maintain international peace and\nsecurity and to promote the economic and social\nadvancement of all peoples. To this end we intend to\nparticipate actively in current efforts to restructure the\nUnited Nations to enable it to become more responsive to\nthe needs of Member States in this dynamic international\nenvironment.\nAs the United Nations is on the threshold of\ncelebrating its fiftieth anniversary, Trinidad and Tobago\nis pleased to recommit itself to the purposes and\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter. As Members, we\nneed to redouble our efforts towards forging universal\npeace and a new era of development, in which both\nnations and individuals find security and fulfilment. I am\nconfident that inherent in the human condition is the\ndesire and the will to achieve these goals.\n\n"

We are\nconfident that his abilities and skills will enable him to\ndischarge his responsibilities in the best possible manner.\nI should like also to congratulate the members of the\nGeneral Committee on their election to that body.\nOn this occasion I cannot fail to express the\nappreciation of the delegation of the State of Qatar, as well\nas my personal appreciation, to Mr. Essy\u2019s predecessor as\nPresident of the General Assembly, Ambassador Samuel\nInsanally, who represents the friendly Republic of Guyana,\nfor his excellent leadership and the work carried out during\nhis tenure.\nIt is also my pleasure to extend our congratulations to\nthose States that have recently joined our international\nOrganization. We look forward to their constructive and\neffective participation in the activities of the United Nations\nand to their defence of its principles.\nIn that context, I salute the delegation of the Republic\nof South Africa and that country\u2019s great leader, Nelson\nMandela, the first African President of the State, which, in\nthis new chapter of its history, will undoubtedly be a new\nMember representing the African continent and the\ninternational community. We are convinced that it will\nplay an outstanding role, for which it is eminently qualified\nby its stature, as well as by its expertise in all fields.\nI should like also to reaffirm the State of Qatar\u2019s full\nconfidence in and special appreciation of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ncommitment and devotion in the service of this international\nOrganization and for his efforts to uphold the noble\nprinciples of the United Nations and to promote its\ninternational peace-keeping and peacemaking role in dealing\nwith international problems and crises. This is a role that\nwill undoubtedly increase in importance.\nThe General Assembly\u2019s forty-ninth session is being\nheld in the shadow of dynamic and rapid changes in\ninternational relations. These rapid dynamic changes have\nnot yet reached their culmination. We are in a period of\ntransition wherein new patterns of international relations are\nconstantly emerging. It is a period in which the so-called\nnew international order is being formed.\nThe most important underpinnings on which this\nnew order must rest are, in our view, respect for the\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations and its\nCharter, in particular, the principle of sovereign co-\nequality, the willingness of States to honour their\ncommitments in good faith, non-intervention in the\ninternal affairs of other States, the control by States of\ntheir natural resources, the non-use and the absence of the\nthreat of the use of force against the territorial integrity or\npolitical independence of other States, and the resolution\nof international disputes by peaceful means in accordance\nwith the principles of international law through mediation,\ndialogue or through the International Court of Justice.\nWith the ending of the cold war, a new era has\ndawned in the United Nations. This international\nOrganization is now being resorted to increasingly and\nmore urgently. The United Nations mechanism is now\nsquarely in the forefront of international efforts to face up\nto problems that in the past were intractable. Such\nproblems are now being examined and debated in a\nserious manner in the United Nations and its specialized\norgans and agencies with the aim of finding suitable\nsolutions thereto.\nIn this regard, the State of Qatar believes that the\nUnited Nations and its specialized organs and agencies\nare the most appropriate framework for deliberation on\nissues relating to peace-keeping and peacemaking, the\npeaceful settlement of international disputes, questions of\ndevelopment and the forging of just and balanced\neconomic and social relations.\nGiven today\u2019s challenges, there is no doubt that the\nsolving of such problems should be the collective\nresponsibility of all States regardless of size, if the\nsolutions devised are to be compatible with the interests\nof the entire international community. Therefore, the\nState of Qatar supports efforts to restructure this\ninternational Organization and its bodies in order to make\nthem more democratic and dynamic so that they may\nbecome more suited to the task of satisfying new\ninternational requirements and dealing with the challenges\nof peace, development, the issues of international peace\nand security, as well as economic and social issues.\nThese issues are dictated by the radical\ntransformations in the patterns of international relations.\nFirst of all, there must be a balanced relationship between\nthe General Assembly as the principal political body, the\nSecurity Council as the body responsible for questions of\nsecurity, and the Economic and Social Council as the\n34\n\n\nbody responsible for issues of economic and social\ndevelopment.\nIn addition, the General Assembly and its resolutions\nmust be given a more effective role as a framework for\ndeliberations and negotiations and for the adoption of\nresolutions on issues of international importance. This is\nfully in line with the commitment by all States to the\nprinciple of sovereign co-equality and the right of effective\nparticipation in the upholding of the common interests of\nthe international community.\nNo one State or group of States, regardless of stature\nor power, should monopolize the fashioning of the new\ninternational order in the absence of the United Nations,\nwhich is the true representative of the international\ncommunity. Such a new order must be fashioned by all\nStates collectively through the United Nations, whose\nstature and efficacy must be enhanced and supported as the\nonly forum for international deliberations, the body\nresponsible for international peace and security and the\nbody that has the overall responsibility for economic and\nsocial development, the protection of the environment and\nof human rights as well as for combating drugs and\nterrorism.\nIn this context, I should like to express my support for\nthe statement in the Secretary-General\u2019s report \\\"An Agenda\nfor Peace\\\" that democracy within the family of nations\nrequires the fullest consultation, participation and\nengagement of all States, large and small, in the work of\nthe Organization.\nI should like to refer also to the statement in the same\nreport that the employment of preventive diplomacy\nrequires prior knowledge of potential disputes, participation\nin peacemaking and peace-keeping, support for the\nagreements concluded and the taking of measures that aim\nat resolving the economic, social and political problems that\nled to the dispute in the first place.\nWe welcome the positive developments in the role of\nthe Security Council and its ability to perform the role\nmandated to it by the Charter, thanks to the new spirit of\ncooperation that emerged between its members and enabled\nit to take collective measures in respect of some very\ndifficult and sensitive issues and to assume new\nresponsibilities such as the expansion of its authority in\nrespect of some peace-keeping issues through the\nadministration of some areas during periods of transition\nand through the supervision of elections and the protection\nof human rights. None the less, we have some fears that\nthe Council may become an institution that is used to\nimpose the will of the strong on the weak.\nTherefore, we believe that the exercise by certain\nmembers of particular rights and privileges must not lead\nto hegemony by a limited number of strong States over\nthe course of events in the world. Thus we believe that\nthe question of membership of the Security Council must\nbe dealt with in a manner that takes into account the large\nincrease in the membership of the United Nations while\nputting some checks on the use of the right of veto.\nIn addition, the international community must respect\nthe resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil. Political will must be mobilized to implement\nthose resolutions, to impose peace if conditions so\nrequire, or to negotiate peace if there is good faith and if\nthe parties cooperate. We believe that this is the\nguaranteed means of protecting the new international\norder and of ensuring its acceptability, credibility and\nstability.\nWe hope that the celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations will mark the rebirth of\na new, stronger and more democratic body. In this\nregard, we are encouraged by discussions, within and\noutside the United Nations, regarding the restructuring of\nthe Organization and its various organs. These are very\nconstructive, serious and objective discussions, and all the\nStates of the world are participating in them.\nThe State of Qatar, proceeding from the wise\ninstructions of the Emir, His Royal Highness Sheikh\nKhalifa Bin Hamad Al-Thani, and his loyal heir, His\nRoyal Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, has\nalways participated by all means in the solution of issues\nrelated to the Arab Gulf, as well as the Arab and Islamic\nnation. We have supported the Gulf Cooperation Council\nbecause it serves the interests of the Gulf States and their\npeoples. We, as part of the region, believe that our\nsecurity is closely linked to the region\u2019s. We have\nsupported stability in the region and rejected every\nattempt to bring about regional changes by force. We\nbelieve that the security of the region requires cooperation\namongst all its States on the basis of good-\nneighbourliness, mutual respect, non-intervention in\ninternal affairs and respect for international law. We hold\nthat all unresolved problems should be resolved by\npeaceful means, through dialogue, mediation or the\nInternational Court of Justice.\n35\n\n\nProceeding from this principle, the State of Qatar\nsupports the resolution by such means of the current dispute\nbetween the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic\nof Iran over the three islands of Abu Moussa and the two\nTumbs.\nOn the Arab level, the State of Qatar has continually\ncalled for the airing of issues in the Arab world and for\nreconciliation, in order to promote Arab solidarity so that\nthe Arab Umma may resume its role in history and in the\nmarch of civilization.\nWe have followed with the greatest concern the\nregrettable events in the Republic of Yemen. Since the\ndispute began, the State of Qatar has participated in\ndiplomatic efforts to contain it. Despite the bloody and\nregrettable struggle, friendly Yemen has maintained its\nunity. As you know, from the beginning we have stood on\nthe side of legality and unity in Yemen, and we have been\neager to abide by these two principles in dealing with the\nissue, proceeding from our faith in the need to maintain the\nunity of the Yemenite territory and people.\nAs for the situation in Iraq, our position is that the\nunity of Iraq and its territorial integrity must be maintained.\nIraq must commit itself to the implementation of all\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. It must recognize the\nsovereignty of the state of Kuwait and its territorial\nintegrity, as well as its internationally recognized border\naccording to United Nations Security Council resolutions.\nWe also sympathize with the Iraqi people and call for the\nalleviation of their hardship, taking into account the acute\nshortage of medicines and foodstuffs.\nConcerning peace in the Middle East, we support the\nprocess and hope that negotiations will achieve concrete\nprogress on all tracks, particularly concerning Lebanon and\nSyria. Last year, we welcomed the Palestinian-Israeli\nagreement as a landmark on the road to a just solution to\nthe Palestinian question. We now welcome the subsequent\nsteps taken, namely the early transfer of authority and the\nexpansion of self-rule, both of which are important steps\ntowards the achievement of a just and comprehensive\nsolution to the question of Palestine. We also welcome the\nJordanian-Israeli declaration as to the ending of the state of\nwar between the two countries and the initiation of serious\nnegotiations to resolve all problems, specifically those\nconcerning water and borders. This declaration is also a\nlandmark on the road towards a just and comprehensive\nsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, on the basis of the\nMadrid formula; Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\nand 338 (1973); the land-for-peace principle; the full\nwithdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied territories\n(the Golan Heights, the southern part of Lebanon,\nJerusalem); the restoration of all inalienable rights of the\nPalestinian people, including the right to self-\ndetermination; and the creation of a State whose capital\nwill be Jerusalem, as it is a symbol of peace and is part\nand parcel of the territories occupied since 1967. During\nthe transitional period, the situation in this territory,\nparticularly its demographic aspects, should not be\nchanged. I wish here to reiterate the need to put a stop\nto the process of Israeli settlement, which is illegal and\nconstitutes a major hurdle in the way of peace.\nProceeding from this, the General Assembly should\nreaffirm, at its current session, all previous resolutions\nregarding the question of Palestine and the Middle East\nproblem, and declare them unalienable.\nIn order to push ahead the peace process in the\nMiddle East, we participated in the multilateral\nnegotiations. We indicated that those negotiations did not\nreplace bilateral negotiations but complemented them, and\nthat they would lead to nothing unless a just and\ncomprehensive peace was achieved in the region. In this\nregard, the State of Qatar hosted, from 2 to 5 May 1994,\nthe fifth meeting of the Working Group on Disarmament\nand Regional Security in the Middle East, which\ndeveloped from the multilateral negotiations.\nThe position of Qatar was stated as follows. First,\nsupport for all international efforts aimed at achieving\nagreement on disarmament on the regional and\ninternational levels, and support for the efforts of the\nDisarmament Conference in this respect. Second, the\narrangements of arms control after the achievement of\npeace should be based on legally binding and co-equal\ncommitments by all parties under international law and in\nconformity with the United Nations Charter. Third, arms\ncontrol efforts on the international level have achieved\nremarkable success, particularly between the Russian\nFederation and the United States as indicated by the\nsigning of START and all subsequent steps. Yet those\nefforts have not achieved any tangible progress in the\nMiddle East, since one State continues to retain its\nnuclear capabilities. Fourth, all States are called upon to\naccede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and to agree\nto abide by its safeguards and subject their nuclear\nfacilities to international inspections. The region must be\nfreed from all weapons of mass destruction and their\ndelivery systems. In this regard, we wonder how the\nGeneral Conference of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency could decide to resume its technical assistance to\n36\n\n\nIsrael, while Israel continues to reject the NPT and refuses\nto submit to its safeguards regime.\nWe follow with great concern the situation in brotherly\nSomalia. We hope that national reconciliation will\nsafeguard the unity, independence and stability of Somalia.\nOn this occasion, we wish to support the decision by the\nArab Foreign Ministers to set up an Arab ministerial\ncommittee that would monitor the situation in Somalia and\nwork towards the desired reconciliation alongside the\nSecretary-General of the League of Arab States.\nAs for Afghanistan, we express our concern over the\ncontinuing violence and call upon all factions to halt\nhostilities and work for a permanent and peaceful\nsettlement that would give precedence to the interests of the\nAfghani people.\nSince the Second World War, Europe has not\nwitnessed a tragedy such as that which is unfolding in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The suffering imposed on the\nMuslim people through the atrocities of ethnic cleansing,\ngenocide and mass killings at the hands of Serb aggressors\nconstitute crimes which far exceed all those committed in\nEurope in the course of the Second World War. Despite\nthe fact that the Serbs reject the international peace plan\ndrawn up by the five States and accepted by Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, no disciplinary action has been taken against\nthe Serb aggressors, while the embargoes are still in place\nagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the very least, the\ninternational community should enable the Muslims to\nexercise the right of self-defence, a legitimate right\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. Once again,\ntogether with other members of the Islamic world we ask,\nwhy is it that there is all this procrastination in dealing with\nthe Serbs, and why are they allowed to hold on to the land\nthey have acquired by force and on which they continue to\npractice the atrocities of ethnic cleansing? The international\ncommunity is called upon to deal with this matter firmly\nwith no double standards and in a manner that would\nguarantee the independence and territorial integrity of\nBosnia and Herzegovina and guarantee for it an economic\nsituation that may enable it to survive. This would\ncertainly contribute to the maintenance of international\npeace and security in that sensitive region of the world.\n\nThe State of Qatar reiterates its condemnation of this\naggression and reaffirms the independence of the Republic\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, its territorial integrity, its\nsovereignty and its unity with and its one indivisible\ncapital, Sarajevo.\nWhile we welcomed the resolution adopted by the\nUnited States Congress and agreed to by the\nAdministration to lift the embargo against the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, we have been surprised by the\nlatest resolution by the Security Council, which included\na relaxation of the sanctions imposed on Serbia and\nMontenegro, the State that stands beside the Serbian\nmilitias in their continuing aggression against the Muslims\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe that the said\nresolution will have grave consequences as it rewards the\naggressor and the forces that support that aggression and\nconstitutes a retreat in the face of aggression, massacres\nand continuing ethnic crimes.\nIn this regard, we call on the Security Council not to\nreward aggression. We call upon it to discharge its\nresponsibilities towards the protection of the Muslims in\nBosnia and Herzegovina by declaring the entire Republic\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe haven. The Council\nmust ensure that no military assistance is allowed to reach\nthe Serbs. The Muslims must be enabled to exercise their\nlegitimate right to self-defence by the lifting of the\nembargo on their country. Once again, we emphasize that\nthe war criminals in the former Yugoslavia must be\nbrought to justice and support the demand by the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) contact\ngroup on Bosnia and Herzegovina to be allowed to\nparticipate in all activities of the contact group of five.\nThe world economy is slowly emerging from the\nstate of stagnation which has lasted for far too long. A\nnew period of varying degrees of growth has started,\nparticularly in the third world. Numerous elements had\ncontributed to that situation. Foremost among those\nelements was the burden of foreign debt which is being\naggravated by the deterioration in prices of basic export\ncommodities side by side with the paucity of foreign\ninvestments in the areas of production and the very high\nexpenditures on armaments. The time has come for the\ninternational community, in particular the developed\nindustrial States, to adopt effective measures that would\nmake it possible to devise a definitive solution to the\nproblems of indebtedness in the third world as a whole,\nand in Africa in particular.\nThe debt burden in Africa has had many grave\nconsequences which have affected the ability of the\ncontinent to grow and develop. Despite the many debt\nrescheduling agreements concluded over the past few\n37\n\n\nyears, the servicing of debt continues to consume over\n22 per cent of all export earnings and continues to obstruct\ninvestment and human development.\nIn this context, the dialogue between the North and the\nSouth should be reactivated in a more effective manner in\norder to find new means to achieve development in the\nthird world and to rid the third world of poverty and\nunderdevelopment. We believe that ridding the world of\npoverty and underdevelopment is an essential prerequisite\nof lasting peace and the welfare of mankind.\nUndoubtedly, success in the dialogue between North\nand South and productive cooperation between them will\npromote efforts to reach a new more realistic and more\nbalanced international economic order. The development\nof the South is not merely in the interests of its States and\npeoples alone, it is also in the interests of the North and its\npeople.\nThe developing world pins its hopes on international\ntrade as a means of achieving prosperity for all. We\ntherefore welcomed the recent success achieved with regard\nto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\nand hope that this success will result in the freeing of trade\nand of unrestricted competition in the world.\nThe threats facing mankind today, and which will\ncontinue to face it in future, are not all political or military.\nThere are questions of the deterioration of the environment,\npoverty, underdevelopment, drugs, the spread of life-\nthreatening diseases, terrorism and violations of human\nrights which become more grave with each passing day.\nThese non-political issues require urgent solutions before\nthey become intractable and threaten all mankind.\nAmong the indications of the international\ncommunity\u2019s concern with economic and social issues is\nthe large number of international conferences devoted to\nsuch issues. Over the past two years, the world witnessed\nthe holding of several such conferences, including the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development in\nRio de Janeiro, and next year the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment will be held in Copenhagen. Each one of the\nconferences that have been convened has achieved results\nwith regard to the issues it has dealt with by means of\nresolutions and recommendations and the international\nconsensus surrounding those resolutions and\nrecommendations.\nAll we wish for here is that those issues should not\nbe used as a pretext to intervene in the internal affairs of\nStates, to deal with States in a discriminatory manner, or\nto impose conditions on providing economic or\ndevelopmental aid.\nI refer in this connection to the idea of a carbon tax,\nwhether individual or collective, under the pretext of\nprotecting the environment. This is purely an economic\nissue which will harm the economies of oil-producing\nStates, particularly those in the Gulf.\nThe State of Qatar reaffirms its support for the\nUnited Nations efforts to deal with the issues I have\nmentioned. The United Nations is the ideal institution to\nface up to international and world issues with all their\npolitical, humanitarian, economic and social dimensions.\nInspired by the Charter, it can achieve success by\nbuilding a world based on relations of cooperation and\nmutual confidence, a world of justice and stability.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first congratulate you, Mr.\nPresident, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly for its forty-ninth session. The American people\nlook forward to working with you to celebrate the United\nNations fiftieth anniversary.\nWe meet today at a time of great hope and change.\nThe end of the cold war, the explosion of technology and\ntrade and enterprise have given people the world over new\nopportunities to live up to their dreams and their God-given\npotential. This is an age of hope -yet in this new world,\nwe face a contest as old as history.\nIt is a struggle between freedom and tyranny; between\ntolerance and bigotry; between knowledge and ignorance;\nbetween openness and isolation. It is a fight between those\nwho would build free societies governed by laws and\nthose who would impose their will by force.\nOur struggle today - in a world more high-tech,\nmore fast-moving, more chaotically diverse than ever - is\nthe age-old fight between hope and fear.\nThree times in this century - from the trenches of the\nSomme to the island of Iwo Jima to the shattered Wall in\nBerlin - the forces of hope were victorious. But the\nvictors of the First World War squandered their triumph\nwhen they turned inward, bringing on a global depression,\nand allowing fascism to rise and reignite global war.\nAfter the Second World War, the Allies learned the\nlesson of the past. In the face of a new totalitarian threat\nand the nuclear menace, great nations did not walk away\nfrom the challenge of the moment. Instead they chose to\nreach out, to rebuild and to lead. They chose to create the\nUnited Nations and they left us a world stronger, safer\nand freer.\nOur generation has a difficult task: the cold war is\nover. We must secure the peace. It falls to us to avoid\nthe complacency that followed the First World War -\nwithout the spur of the imminent threat to our security\nthat followed the Second World War.\nWe must ensure that those who fought and found the\ncourage to end the cold war - those from both East and\nWest who loved freedom - did not labour in vain. Our\nsacred mission is to build a new world for our children -\nmore democratic, more prosperous, more free of ancient\nhatreds and modern means of destruction.\nThat is no easy challenge; but we accept it with\nconfidence. After all, the walls that once divided nations\nin this very Hall have come down. More nations have\nchosen democracy than ever before. More have chosen\nfree markets and economic justice. More have embraced\nthe values of tolerance and liberty and civil society that\nallow us all to make the most of our lives.\nBut while the ideals of democracy and free markets\nare ascendant, they are surely not the whole story.\nTerrible examples of chaos, repression and tyranny also\nmark our times. The twentieth century has proved that\nthe forces of freedom and democracy can endure against\ngreat odds; our job is to see that in the twenty-first\ncentury these forces triumph.\n6\n\n\nThe dangers we face are less stark and more diffuse\nthan those of the cold war, but they are still formidable:\nthe ethnic conflicts that drive millions from their homes;\nthe despots ready to repress their own people or conquer\ntheir neighbours; the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction; the terrorists wielding their deadly arms; the\ncriminal syndicates selling those arms, or drugs, infiltrating\nthe very institutions of fragile democracies; a global\neconomy that offers great promise but also deep insecurity,\nand in many places declining opportunity; diseases like\nAIDS that threaten to decimate nations; the combined\ndangers of population explosion and economic decline,\nwhich prompted the world community to reach the\nremarkable consensus at the Cairo Conference; global and\nlocal environmental threats that demand that sustainable\ndevelopment become a part of the lives of people all\naround the world; and, finally, within many of our nations,\nhigh rates of drug abuse and crime and family breakdown,\nwith all their terrible consequences. These are the dangers\nwe face today.\nWe must address these threats to our future.\nThankfully, the end of the cold war gives us a chance to\naddress them together. In our efforts, different nations may\nbe active in different situations in different ways, but their\npurposes must be consistent with freedom and their\npractices consistent with international law. Each nation will\nbring to our common task its own particular strengths -\neconomic, political or military.\nOf course, the first duty of every Member of the\nUnited Nations is to its own citizens, to their security, their\nwelfare and their interests. As President of the United\nStates, my first duty is to the citizens of my country.\nWhen our national security interests are threatened, we will\nact with others when we can, but alone if we must. We\nwill use diplomacy when we can, but force if we must.\nThe United States recognizes that we also have a\nspecial responsibility in these common endeavours that we\nare undertaking, the responsibility that goes along with\ngreat power and also with our long history of democracy\nand freedom. But we seek to fulfil that responsibility in\ncooperation with other nations. Working together increases\nthe impact and the legitimacy of each of our actions, and\nsharing the burdens lessens everyone\u2019s load. We have no\ndesire to be the world\u2019s policeman, but we will do what we\ncan to help civil societies emerge from the ashes of\nrepression, to sustain fragile democracies, to add more free\nmarkets to the world, and of course to restrain the\ndestructive forces that threaten us all.\nIn every corner of the globe, from South Africa to\nAsia, to Central and Eastern Europe, to the Middle East\nand Latin America, and now to a small island in the\nCaribbean, ordinary citizens are striving to build their\nown future. Promoting their cause is our generation\u2019s\ngreat opportunity, and we must do it together. A\ncoalition for democracy is good for America.\nDemocracies, after all, are more likely to be stable, less\nlikely to wage war; they strengthen civil society and can\nprovide people with the economic and political\nopportunities to build their futures in their own homes -\nnot to flee their borders.\nOur efforts to help build more democracies will\nmake us all more secure, more prosperous and more\nsuccessful as we try to make this era of terrific change\nour friend, and not our enemy. In my nation, as in all of\nyour nations, there are many people who are\nunderstandably reluctant to undertake these efforts\nbecause often the distances are great or the cultures are\ndifferent. There are good reasons for the caution that\npeople feel. Often, the chances of success or its costs are\nunclear. And, of course, in every common endeavour\nthere is always the potential for failure and often the risk\nof loss of life.\nAnd yet our people - as we have seen in the\nremarkable global response to the terrible crisis in\nRwanda - genuinely want to help their neighbours around\nthe world and to make some effort in our common cause.\nWe have seen that progress can be made as well. The\nproblem is deciding when we must respond and how we\nshall overcome our reluctance. This will never be easy.\nThere are no simple formulas. All of us will make these\ndecisions in part based on the distance of the problem\nfrom our shores, the interests of our nation, the difference\nwe think we can make, the costs required, or the threat to\nour own citizens in the endeavour.\nHard questions will remain, and cannot be erased by\nsome simple formula. But we should have the confidence\nthat these efforts can succeed, whether they are efforts to\nkeep people alive in the face of terrible tragedy, as in\nRwanda, or our efforts to avert a tragedy, as in the Horn\nof Africa, or our efforts to support processes that are\nliterally changing the future of millions. History is on\nour side. We should have confidence about this. Look\nat the march of freedom we have seen in the last year\nalone. Who, a decade ago, would have dared predict the\nstartling changes in South Africa, in the Middle East and\nin Ireland; the stunning triumph of democracy and\nmajority rule and the redemption of the purpose of Nelson\n7\n\n\nMandela\u2019s life; the brave efforts of Israel and its Arab\nneighbours to build bridges of peace between their peoples;\nthe earnest search by the people of Northern Ireland and\nGreat Britain and Ireland to end centuries of division and\ndecades of terror? In each case, credit belongs to those\nnations\u2019 leaders and their courageous people. But in each\ninstance the United States and other nations were privileged\nto help in these causes.\nThe growth of cooperation between the United States\nand the Russian Federation also should give us all great\ncause for confidence. This is a partnership that is rooted in\ndemocracy, a partnership that is working, a partnership of,\nnot complete agreement, but genuine mutual respect. After\nso many years of nuclear terror, our two nations are taking\ndramatic steps to ease tensions around the world. For the\nfirst time since the Second World War, foreign troops do\nnot occupy the nations of Central and Eastern Europe. The\nBaltic nations are free. Russian and American missiles no\nlonger target each other\u2019s people. Three of the four nuclear\nmembers of the former Soviet Union have agreed to\nremove all nuclear weapons from their soil. And we are\nworking on agreements to halt production of fissile\nmaterials for nuclear explosives; to make dismantling of\nnuclear warheads transparent and irreversible; and further\nto reduce our nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles.\nThe United States and Russia also recognize that we\nmust cooperate to control the emerging danger of terrorists\nwho traffic in nuclear materials. To secure nuclear\nmaterials at their sources, we have agreed with Russia to\nstop plutonium production by the year 2000; to construct a\nstorage facility for fissile materials and buy up stocks of\nweapons-grade fuel; and to combat the criminals who are\ntrying to smuggle materials for nuclear explosives. Our\ntwo nations and Germany have increased cooperation and\nengaged in joint anti-terrorist training. Soon, under the\nleadership of our Federal Bureau of Investigation, we will\nopen a law enforcement training academy in Europe, where\npolice will learn how to combat more effectively trafficking\nof nuclear weapons components, as well as the drug trade,\norganized crime and money laundering.\nThe United States will also advance a wide-ranging\nnon-proliferation agenda: a global convention to halt\nproduction of fissile materials; efforts to curb North\nKorea\u2019s nuclear ambitions; transparent procedures for\ndismantling nuclear warheads; and our work to ban testing\nand to extend the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons. And today I am proposing a first step\ntoward the eventual elimination of a less visible but still\ndeadly threat: the world\u2019s 85 million anti-personnel land-\nmines - one for every 50 persons on the face of the earth.\nI ask all nations concerned to join with us and conclude\nan agreement to reduce the number and availability of\nthose mines. Ridding the world of those often hidden\nweapons will help to save the lives of tens of thousands\nof men, women and innocent children in the years to\ncome.\nOur progress in the last year also provides\nconfidence that in the post-cold-war years we can adapt\nand construct global institutions that will help to provide\nsecurity and increase economic growth throughout the\nworld. Since I spoke here last year, 22 nations have\njoined the Partnership for Peace of the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO). The first joint exercises\nhave been conducted, helping to give Europe the chance\nto become a more unified continent in which democratic\nnations live within secure borders. In Asia, security talks\nand economic cooperation will lead to further stability.\nBy reducing nations\u2019 fears about their borders and\nallowing them to spend less on military defences, our\ncoalition for democracy can give nations in transition a\nbetter chance to offer new freedoms and opportunities to\ntheir own people. It is time that we think anew about the\nstructures of this global economy as well, tearing down\nwalls that separate nations instead of hiding behind them.\nAt the Group of Seven meeting at Naples this year\nwe committed ourselves to this task of renewal, to re-\nexamining the economic institutions that have served us\nso well in the past. In the interests of shared prosperity,\nthe United States actively promotes open markets.\nThough still in its infancy, the North American Free\nTrade Agreement has dramatically increased trade\nbetween the United States and Mexico and has produced\nin the United States alone an estimated 200,000 new jobs.\nIt offers a model to nations throughout the Americas\nwhich we hope to build on. And this week I will send\nlegislation to the Congress to implement the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the largest\ntrade agreement in all of history. GATT - and its\nsuccessor, the World Trade Organization - holds the\npromise for all of us of increased exports, higher wages\nand improved living standards. In the months and years\nto come we will work no less to extend the reach of open\nmarkets, starting with the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council and the Summit of the Americas\nlater this year.\nHere at the United Nations we must develop a\nconcrete plan to meet the challenges of the next 50 years\neven as we celebrate the last 50 years. I believe we\n8\n\n\nshould declare next year\u2019s fiftieth anniversary not just a\nyear of celebration but a year of renewal. We call on the\nSecretary-General to name a working group so that by the\ntime we meet next year we will have a concrete action plan\nto revitalize the obligations of the United Nations to address\nthe security, economic and political challenges ahead -\nobligations we must all be willing to assume.\nOur objectives should include ready, efficient and\ncapable United Nations peace-keeping forces, and I am\nhappy to report that, as I pledged last year and thanks to\nsupport in the United States Congress, $1.2 billion is now\navailable from the United States for this critical account.\nWe must also pledge to keep United Nations reform\nmoving forward so that we do more with less, and we must\nimprove our ability to respond to urgent needs. Let me\nsuggest that it is time for the members of the Assembly to\nconsider seriously President Menem\u2019s suggestion for the\ncreation of a civilian rapid-response capability for\nhumanitarian crises.\nAnd let us not lose sight of the special role that\ndevelopment and democracy can play in preventing\nconflicts once peace has been established. Never before\nhas the United Nations been in a better position to achieve\nthe democratic goals of our founders. The end of the cold\nwar has freed us from decades of paralysing divisions. And\nwe all know that multilateral cooperation is not only\nnecessary to address the new threats we face but possible\nto succeed.\nThe efforts we have undertaken together in Haiti are\na prime example. Under the sponsorship of the United\nNations, American troops, now being joined by the\npersonnel of an ever-growing international coalition of over\ntwo dozen nations, are giving the people of Haiti their\nchance at freedom. Creative diplomacy, the influence of\neconomic power and the credible threat of military force -\nall have contributed to this moment of opportunity.\nEssential civil order will be restored. Human rights\nviolations will be curbed. The first refugees will be\nreturning within hours, on this day. The military leaders\nwill step down. The democratic Government will be\nrestored. President Aristide will return. The multinational\nmission will turn its responsibilities over to the United\nNations mission, which will remain in Haiti throughout\n1995, until a new president is elected. During this time a\nmultinational development effort will make available more\nthan $1 billion to begin helping the Haitians rebuild their\ncountry. In the spirit of reconciliation and reconstruction,\nPresident Aristide yesterday called for the immediate easing\nof sanctions so that the work of rebuilding can begin\nimmediately. Accordingly, I intend to act expeditiously,\nwithin Security Council resolutions 917 (1994) and 940\n(1994) to enable us to restore health care, water and\nelectrical services, construction materials for humanitarian\nefforts, and communications, agricultural and educational\nmaterials.\nToday I am also announcing that the United States\nwill suspend all unilateral sanctions against Haiti except\nthose that affect the military leaders and their immediate\nsupporters. This will include regularly scheduled air\nflights when the airport becomes available, financial\ntransactions and travel restrictions. I urge all other\nnations to do the same.\nIn Haiti, the United States has demonstrated that it\nwould lead a multinational force when our interests are\nplain, when the cause is right, when the mission is\nachievable and the nations of the world stand with us.\nBut Haiti\u2019s people will have to muster the strength and\nthe patience to travel the road of freedom. They have to\ndo this for themselves. Every new democratic nation is\nfragile. But we will see the day when the people of Haiti\nfulfil their aspirations to liberty and when they are once\nagain making genuine economic progress.\nUnited Nations actions in Bosnia, like those in Haiti,\ndemonstrate that progress can be made when a coalition\nbacks up diplomacy with military power. For the first\ntime ever, NATO has taken, since we met last year,\nmilitary actions beyond the territory of its members. The\nthreat of NATO air power helped to establish the\nexclusion zone around Sarajevo and to end the Bosnian\nSerbs\u2019 spring offensive against Gorazde. NATO\u2019s\nFebruary ultimatum boosted our mediation efforts, which\nhelped to end the war between the Bosnian Government\nand the Bosnian Croats and forged a federation between\nthose two communities. To that extent the situation in\nBosnia has improved, but in recent weeks the situation\naround Sarajevo has deteriorated substantially, and\nSarajevo once again faces the prospect of strangulation.\nA new resolve by the United Nations to enforce its\nresolutions is now necessary to save Sarajevo, and NATO\nstands ready to act.\nThe situation in Bosnia is yet another reminder of\nthe greatest irony of this century we are leaving. This\ncentury, so full of hope and opportunity and achievement,\nhas also been an age of deep destruction and despair. We\ncannot help but remember the millions who gave their\nlives during two world wars and the half century of\n9\n\n\nstruggle by men and women in the East and West who\nultimately prevailed in the name of freedom.\nBut we must also think of our children and the world\nwe will leave them in the twenty-first century. History has\ngiven us a very rare opportunity - the chance to build on\nthe greatest legacy of this century without reliving its\ndarkest moments. And we have shown that we can carry\nforward humanity\u2019s ancient quest for freedom to build a\nworld where democracy knows no borders but where\nnations know their borders will always be secure, a world\nthat gives all people the chance to realize their potential and\nto live out their dreams.\n"

        "file_text": "It surely must be one of the\ngreat ironies of our age that this Assembly is being\naddressed, for the first time in its 49 years\u2019 history, by a\nSouth African Head of State drawn from among the\nAfrican majority of what is an African country.\nFuture generations will find it strange in the extreme\nthat it was only so late in the twentieth century that it was\npossible for our delegation to take its seat in the\nAssembly, recognized both by our people and by the\nnations of the world as the legitimate representative of the\npeople of our country.\nIt is indeed most welcome that the Organization will\nmark its fiftieth anniversary next year with the apartheid\nsystem vanquished and consigned to the past. That\nhistoric change has come about not least because of the\ngreat efforts in which the United Nations engaged to\nensure the suppression of the apartheid crime against\nhumanity. Even as it was still in the process of\nestablishing its institutions, the United Nations was\nconfronted by the challenge of the accession to power of\nthe party of apartheid domination in our country.\nEverything that that system stood for represented the very\nopposite of all the noble purposes for which the\nOrganization was established. Because apartheid reduced\nand undermined the credibility of the United Nations as\nan effective international instrument to end racism and\nsecure the fundamental human rights of all peoples, the\nestablishment and consolidation of apartheid constituted\na brazen challenge to the very existence of the\nOrganization.\n6\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\nThe United Nations was born out of the titanic\nstruggle against nazism and fascism, with their pernicious\ndoctrines and practices of racial superiority and genocide.\nIt therefore could not stand by while, in South Africa, a\nsimilar system was being established by a Government\nwhich also had the temerity to claim representation within\nthe United Nations.\nWe believe that it was indeed of great importance to\nthe universal efficacy of, and respect for, the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the United Nations\nCharter that the United Nations should have spurned the\npleas of the apartheid regime that the gross violation of\nhuman rights in South Africa was a domestic matter of no\nlegal or legitimate concern to the world body.\nWe stand here today to salute the United Nations and\nits Member States, both singly and collectively, for joining\nforces with the masses of our people in a common struggle\nthat has brought about our emancipation and pushed back\nthe frontiers of racism.\nThe millions of our people say \\\"Thank you\\\" and\n\\\"Thank you again, because the respect for your own dignity\nas human beings inspired you to act to ensure the\nrestoration of our dignity as well\\\".\nWe have together traversed a course which we are\nconvinced has strengthened human solidarity in general and\nreinforced the bonds of friendship between our peoples and\nthe nations of the world. This dates back to the early days\nwhen India put the question of racism in South Africa on\nthe Assembly\u2019s agenda, to the moment when the world\ncommunity, as represented here, could adopt consensus\nresolutions against apartheid with none dissenting.\nIt was therefore with great joy that at our inauguration\nas President of our Republic we received, among others,\nsuch high and distinguished officials of the Organization as\nthe Secretary-General, the President of the General\nAssembly and the Chairman of the Special Committee\nagainst Apartheid. Their presence reaffirmed the\nincontrovertible truth that the victory over apartheid, the\nsuccess of the cause of democracy, non-racialism and non-\nsexism in our country belongs as much to our people as it\ndoes the United Nations.\nAnd so we have embarked on the road to the remaking\nof our country, basing ourselves both on the democratic\nConstitution, which came into force on 27 April this year,\nand on the Reconstruction and Development Programme,\nwhich has become the property of all our people.\nClearly, these documents would have no life unless\nthe people gave them life. The words printed in them\nmust inspire common ownership by all our people and\ntheir common allegiance to the process and the results\nwhich these documents intend. For this to happen, as we\npropagate the vision these documents contain we must at\nthe same time engage in a historic effort of redefinition\nof ourselves as a new nation.\nOur watchwords must be justice, peace,\nreconciliation and nation-building in the pursuit of a\ndemocratic, non-racial and non-sexist country. In all that\nwe do we have to ensure the healing of the wounds\ninflicted on all our people across the great dividing line\nimposed on our society by centuries of colonialism and\napartheid.\nWe must ensure that colour, race and gender become\nonly a God-given gift to each one of us, and not an\nindelible mark or attribute that accords a special status to\nany.\nWe must work for the day when we as South\nAfricans see one another and interact with one another as\nequal human beings and as part of one nation united,\nrather than torn asunder, by its diversity.\nThe road we shall have to travel to reach this\ndestination will by no means be easy. All of us know\nhow stubbornly racism can cling to the mind and how\ndeeply it can infect the human soul. Where it is sustained\nby the racial ordering of the material world, as is the case\nin our country, that stubbornness can multiply a\nhundredfold.\nAnd yet, however hard this battle may be, we will\nnot surrender. Whatever the time it may take, we will not\ntire. The very fact that racism degrades both the\nperpetrator and the victim commands that, if we are true\nto our commitment to protect human dignity, we fight on\nuntil victory is achieved.\nWe firmly believe that we who have particular\nexperience of the destructive and anti-human force of\nracism owe it to ourselves to centre our transformation on\nthe creation of a truly non-racial society. Because we\nknow racism so intimately, we must stand a good chance\nof developing and nurturing its opposite.\nIt will perhaps come to be that we who have\nharboured in our country the worst example of racism\nsince the defeat of nazism will make a contribution to\n7\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\nhuman civilization by ordering our affairs in such a manner\nthat we strike an effective and lasting blow against racism\neverywhere.\nSome of the steps that we have already taken -\nincluding the establishment of a Government of National\nUnity, the orderly transformation of the institutions of State\nand the cultivation of a national consensus on the major\nissues of the day - have started us off on a correct footing\nwith regard to continuing the processes leading to the\ncreation of the just society we have been speaking of.\nOur political emancipation has also brought into sharp\nfocus the urgent need to engage in the struggle to secure\nour people\u2019s freedom from want, from hunger and from\nignorance. We have written this on our banners: that the\nsociety we seek to create must be a people-centred society;\nall its institutions and its resources must be dedicated to the\npursuit of a better life for all our citizens. That better life\nmust mean an end to poverty, joblessness, homelessness\nand the despair that comes of deprivation. This is an end\nin itself because the happiness of the human being must, in\nany society, be an end in itself.\nAt the same time, we are intensely conscious of the\nfact that the stability of the democratic settlement itself and\nthe possibility actually to create a non-racial and non-sexist\nsociety depend on our ability to change the material\nconditions of life of our people so that they not only have\nthe vote but have bread and work as well.\nWe therefore return to the United Nations to make the\ncommitment that, as we undertook never to rest until the\nsystem of apartheid was defeated, so do we now undertake\nthat we cannot rest while millions of our people suffer the\npain and indignity of poverty in all its forms.\nAt the same time, we turn once more to this world\nbody to say \\\"We are going to need your continued support\nto achieve the goal of the betterment of the conditions of\nlife of our people.\\\" We are pleased and inspired that both\nthe Secretary-General and the specialized agencies of the\nUnited Nations have taken up the development challenge in\nSouth Africa with the enthusiasm that they have shown.\nWe believe that it is in the common interest that we\nsustain the common victory that we have scored in South\nAfrica, and take it further by achieving success not only in\npolitics but also in the socio-economic sphere.\nIt is perhaps common cause among us that everywhere\non our globe there is an unmistakable process leading to the\nentrenchment of democratic systems of government. The\nempowerment of the ordinary people of our world freely\nto determine their destiny, unhindered by tyrants and\ndictators, is at the very heart of the reason for the\nexistence of this Organization.\nBut it is equally true that hundreds of millions of\nthese politically empowered masses are caught in the\ndeathly trap of poverty, unable to live life in its fullness.\nOut of all this are born social conflicts which\nproduce insecurity and instability, civil and other wars\nthat claim many lives, millions of desperate refugees and\nthe destruction of the little wealth that poor countries are\nable to accumulate. Out of this cauldron are also born\ntyrants, dictators and demagogues who not only take away\nor restrict the rights of the people but also make it\nimpossible to do the things that must be done to bring\nlasting prosperity to the people.\nAt the same time, the reality can no longer be\nignored that we live in an interdependent world which is\nbound together to a common destiny. The very response\nof the international community to the challenge of\napartheid confirmed this very point that we all\nunderstood - that so long as apartheid existed in South\nAfrica, so long would the whole of humanity feel\ndemeaned and degraded.\nThe United Nations understood very well that racism\nin our country could not but feed racism in other parts of\nthe world as well. The universal struggle against\napartheid was therefore not an act of charity arising out\nof pity for our people, but an affirmation of our common\nhumanity. We believe that that act of affirmation requires\nthat this Organization should once more turn its focused\nand sustained attention to the basics of everything that\nmakes for a better world for all humanity.\nThe elaboration of a new world order must, of\nnecessity, centre on this world body. In it we should find\nthe appropriate forum in which we can all participate to\nhelp determine the shape of the new world.\nThe four elements that will need to be knit together\nin fashioning that new universal reality are the issues of\ndemocracy, peace, prosperity and interdependence.\nThe great challenge of our age to the United Nations\nis to answer the question \\\"Given the interdependence of\nthe nations of the world, what is it that we can and must\n8\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\ndo to ensure that democracy, peace and prosperity prevail\neverywhere?\\\"\nWe are aware of the fact that the United Nations is\naddressing these questions in many ways; yet there can be\nno gainsaying the fact that such progress as we have made\nhas been made more by stealth than in the bold and\ndetermined fashion that the world crisis demands today.\nPerhaps a new and forceful initiative is required. Such\nan initiative should inspire all of humanity because of the\nseriousness of its intent. It should also have a chance to\nsucceed because it will have been underwritten by the\ncommitment of the masses of the people in each member\ncountry to join hands with other nations, to address together\nthe related issues of democracy, peace and prosperity in an\ninterdependent world.\nWe are aware of the fact that the dictates of realpolitik\nmilitate against the speedy realization of such an initiative.\nBut we do believe that the reality of life and the realism of\npolicy will, at some point, bring to the fore the fact that the\ndelay we impose on ourselves today will serve only to\nincrease the pressure on all of us to incorporate, within\nwhat we consider possible, a sustainable vision of a\ncommon world that will rise or fall together.\nUndoubtedly, to inspire greater confidence in itself\namong all the member nations and to reflect better the\nimpulse towards the democratization of international\nrelations, the United Nations will have to continue looking\nat itself to determine what restructuring of itself it should\neffect. This process must naturally affect, among others,\nthe structure and functioning of the Security Council and\nthe peacemaking and peace-keeping issues raised by the\nSecretary-General in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\".\nDemocratic South Africa rejoins the world community\nof nations determined to play its role in helping to\nstrengthen the United Nations and to contribute what it can\nto the furtherance of its purposes. Among other things, we\nhave this morning acceded to the covenants and\nconventions adopted by this Organization, which address\nvarious matters such as economic, social and cultural rights,\ncivil and political rights, and the elimination of all forms of\nracial discrimination, to say nothing of our irrevocable\ncommitment to the realization of the objectives contained\nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nWe are determined to play our full part in all\nprocesses that address the important question of the\nnon-proliferation and elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Our Government has also decided to become\na signatory to the Convention on prohibition and\nrestrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons.\nIn a similar vein, we shall not be found wanting in\nthe quest for sustainable development that is in keeping\nwith the Rio de Janeiro Declaration on Environment and\nDevelopment as well as with Agenda 21.\nEqually, our own national interest dictates that we\njoin forces with the United Nations and all its Member\nStates in the common struggle to contain and end the\ntraffic in narcotics.\nEven in constitutional terms, we are committed to\nthe advancement of the objective of the emancipation of\nwomen through the creation of a non-sexist society.\nApart from anything else, we are therefore actively\nengaged in the preparations for what we are convinced\nwill be a successful Beijing Conference.\nWe are part of the region of southern Africa and the\ncontinent of Africa. As members of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community and the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), and an equal partner with other Member\nStates, we will play our role in the struggles of these\norganizations to build a continent and a region that will\nhelp to create for themselves and all humanity a common\nworld of peace and prosperity.\nOurs must become a continent free of such tragedies\nas those that have afflicted our own country as well as\nRwanda, Somalia, Angola, Mozambique, the Sudan and\nLiberia. Happily, the OAU is actively addressing the\nissues of peace and stability on our continent.\nWe are greatly encouraged that the countries of our\nregion, faced with a crisis in Lesotho, acted together\nspeedily and, with the cooperation of the Government and\nthe people of that country, succeeded in demonstrating\nthat together we have the will to defend democracy, peace\nand national reconciliation.\nFurthermore, as members of the Non-Aligned\nMovement and the Group of 77, we are committed\nespecially to the promotion of South-South cooperation\nand to the strengthening of the voice of the poor and\ndisadvantaged in the ordering of world affairs.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to express\nour appreciation to the members of the General Assembly\nfor the speed and readiness with which they accepted the\n9\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\ncredentials of democratic South Africa, enabling us to\nparticipate in the work of the last General Assembly. We\nare pleased to note that this same spirit characterized the\napproach of other international organizations towards our\nnew democracy, including the Commonwealth and the\nEuropean Union.\nWe would like to close by congratulating you, Mr.\nPresident, on your election to your high post, and we\nexpress our confidence that you will guide the work of the\nAssembly with the wisdom and sense of purpose for which\nwe admire you.\nThe millions across our globe who stand expectant at\nthe gates of hope look to this Organization to bring them\npeace, to bring them life, to bring them a life worth living.\nWe pray that the new South Africa, which the General\nAssembly helped bring into being and so warmly welcomed\namong the community of nations, will, in its own and in the\nwider interest, make its own contribution, however small,\nto the realization of those hopes.\nOur common humanity and the urgency of the knock\non the door of this great edifice demand that we must\nattempt even the impossible.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth regular session and to offer\nyou the fullest cooperation of the Guatemalan delegation\nin the important tasks before you. I also wish to express\ndeserved appreciation to Ambassador Samuel Insanally\nfor the manner in which he discharged his duties as\nPresident during the last session. The Latin American\nand Caribbean region is justifiably proud of his\nperformance.\nI wish also to convey our appreciation to Secretary-\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his skilful\nhelmsmanship of the activities of the Organization. We\nagain offer him our support in his endeavours.\nIn the light of the great changes that have taken\nplace in recent years, we come to this Assembly full of\nhope and expectation. In some regions of the world\nevents make it possible for us to look ahead with\noptimism to a future of peaceful coexistence between\nnations. At the same time, in other regions we look with\nconcern on the inflammation of new hotbeds of tension\nthat lead to a weakening of the power of the State as the\ncatalyst among various social sectors. This situation\nseriously threatens the social fabric and the very norms\nthat make it possible for human beings to live together in\npeace.\nAs far as Guatemala is concerned, international\nrelations must be grounded in profound respect for the\nprinciples and norms of international law. Peaceful\ncoexistence can be achieved only by means of absolute\nrespect for the sovereignty, independence and legal\nequality of States.\n19\n\n\nMultilateralism has been given new impetus in the\nnew international context and constitutes a more intense,\nmore comprehensive contribution to the search for solutions\nto problems old and new. To the extent that we place our\nfaith in multilateral action and are able to define it properly\nand efficiently, we will be able to move forward in\ndeveloping a stable international order that enables us to\nfoster peace and well-being for mankind. Within this\ninternational landscape, which has also transformed the\nconcept of global security, we face the challenge of\nunderstanding and coping with the new risks looming over\nmankind.\nGuatemala is at a moment of special importance in its\nhistory. Still fresh are the historic and unprecedented\nevents in which the people of Guatemala organized and\nmobilized and demonstrated its profound democratic\nconvictions, making it possible to restore constitutional\norder, which had broken down, and carrying the former\nhuman rights prosecutor to the presidency.\n\nThe background of our President Leon Carpio is well\nknown and constitutes the best guarantee of the\ncommitment and determination of the Government of\nGuatemala to struggle for the full enjoyment of human\nrights and the search for peace through dialogue and\nnegotiation. The Government has amply demonstrated its\npolitical will through concrete actions aimed at resolving a\nvery broad and complex range of problems. It has done so\nby pursuing an economic, social and cultural policy that\ntakes into account the multicultural nature of our country,\nincluding proposals from civilian society, which naturally\ninclude those emanating from the indigenous population of\nGuatemala.\nOur commitment to human rights has also been\nunquestionably strengthened by the important progress\nmade in the peace negotiations with the Unidad\nRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) with a\nview to ending one of the lengthiest armed conflicts in\nLatin America. Among the elements of progress made in\nthe negotiations, the Comprehensive Agreement on Human\nRights, with international validity and verification, is of\nparticular importance.\nIn the process of negotiations, the following\nagreements have been signed this year: the Framework\nAgreement for the Resumption of the Negotiating Process,\nsigned in Mexico on 10 January 1994, which provides for\nall agreements to include national and international\nverification mechanisms and that the United Nations be\nresponsible for the international ones; the Agreement on\na Timetable for the Negotiation of a Firm and Lasting\nPeace; the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights\nsigned in Mexico on 29 March 1994; the Agreement\nconcerning the resettlement of displaced persons, signed\nin Oslo on 17 July 1994; the Agreement on the\nCommission of Inquiry, signed in Oslo on 23 June 1994.\nAll Guatemalans and the international community\nare fully aware of the firm resolve of the Government to\nnegotiate responsibly and with determination to achieve\npeace agreements within the agreed timetable. The\npatience and flexibility of the Government of Guatemala\nare well known and have made it possible to reach\nagreement despite many difficulties. The representatives\nof the countries in the Group of Friends - Mexico,\nColombia, Spain, Norway, the United States and\nVenezuela - can testify to this.\nThe Framework Agreement and the Timetable\nestablish the parametres for negotiations, limiting both\nparties to a certain format and time-frame. The\nmoderator convenes meetings in accordance with the\nTimetable and the parties attend and negotiate in\nconformity with the established procedures. These are the\nagreed rules and no party can capriciously change them,\nmuch less try to usurp the function of verifying\ncompliance with the Comprehensive Agreement on\nHuman Rights. Full compliance with that Agreement is\nto be verified by a machinery requested of the United\nNations by both parties. On this basis, the mandate of the\nmission known as the United Nations Human Rights\nVerification Mission in Guatemala was established by\nGeneral Assembly resolution. My country would like to\nthank the international community, the Group of Friends\nand the United Nations for their assistance in the quest\nfor peace.\nIt is clear that fundamental rights and freedoms,\npolitical democracy and the right to development are\nindivisible and interdependent. Those countries like ours\nthat have experienced the tragedy of armed conflict know\nfrom experience that there are other, broader connotations\nto the right to development and that it is not possible to\nhave development and social evolution without peace. At\nthe same time, the full enjoyment of human rights is not\npossible without development or peace. The international\ncommunity has been firm and decisive in its political\nsupport for democratic processes. We have to believe\nthat it will pursue this course in seeking to strengthen and\n20\n\n\nrefine them. Regrettably, however, the processes involved\nin national reconciliation have not been understood, and\nsupport for the processes of development has been\ninsignificant; worse yet, development has been blocked,\nthus impeding access to sources of finance and to\ninternational markets.\nIf the development model and reconciliation are\nallowed to fail, democracy will fail too and we shall never\nachieve secure and lasting peace, because if the population\nloses faith in the democratic system we shall inevitably\nreturn to authoritarianism. The international community has\nthe responsibility to support economic and social\ndevelopment and to foster the processes of reconciliation if\nit would have all the nations of the world living under\ndemocracy. International condemnation and pressure might\nbe effective in fostering democracy, but they are not\nsufficient in and of themselves to establish it on a solid and\nlasting footing.\nThe Government of Guatemala reiterates its policy of\nwide-ranging cooperation with the United Nations system\nin the field of human rights. It has also demonstrated to\nthe international community its readiness to negotiate peace\nagreements within the scheduled timetable. It hopes that,\nin the face of a refusal by the URNG to return to the\nnegotiating table or to disarm and demobilize itself after its\nnon-binding signature, that party\u2019s sources of finance will\nbe closed off to prevent armed action that would be totally\nunwarranted. The people of Guatemala has shown itself to\nbe a champion of democracy and dedicated to its\nimprovement. We urge the other party to recognize that its\nintegration into legitimacy by means of negotiation is the\nonly feasible course that would allow it to participate in the\nbuilding of a new Guatemala.\nGuatemalans believe that the authority of the State\nshould be based on the mandate of its people, that any\nGovernment must act with the consent of the majority of\nthe governed, and that the voice of the people must be\nheard in the formulation and implementation of government\npolicy. As far as we are concerned, these are vital and\nfundamental components of democracy. We understand\nthat there may be differences of opinion as to the form of\nthe people\u2019s expression of this mandate and its participation\nin the various political forums of the State. We also\nbelieve that no State has the right to impose its political\nsystem on any other.\nFor us, the fundamental characteristics of the system\nshould be the legitimacy of the people\u2019s mandate, the\nauthenticity of its consent to be governed and the\neffectiveness of its participation. Similarly, democracy\nbetween States requires strict and meticulous respect for\nthe United Nations Charter.\nGuatemala participates with the Central American\ncountries in a process of regional integration that has\nundergone institutional renewal. We consider integration\nto be a process deeply rooted in our common history and\nculture and an instrument of momentous importance for\nthe development of our peoples.\nFor this reason, together with the other countries of\nthe region, we are pursuing important initiatives such as\nthe Alliance for Sustainable Development, whose\nprinciples are based on improving the quality of life of\nour peoples, respect for and development of the diverse\npotential and vitality of the Earth in a sustainable manner,\nthe promotion of peace and democracy as basic forms of\nhuman coexistence and respect for human rights and the\nmulticultural and multi-ethnic nature of our region.\nFurthermore, Guatemala is active in other regional\ninitiatives, such as the forthcoming ecological Summit in\nNicaragua and the International Conference on Peace and\nDevelopment, which will take place in Honduras. Both\nof these events are part of the region\u2019s endeavours to\npromote economic and social development in Central\nAmerica.\nIn connection with the territorial dispute over Belize,\nthe Government of Guatemala will now be assisted by a\ncouncil made up of distinguished citizens, whose advice\nwill make it possible to define and give impetus to the\nprocedure for solving this dispute in the framework of the\nposition, well-known to the international community, that\nis set forth in document A/49/94 of 14 March this year.\nThe Government of Guatemala reiterates its\nreadiness to continue direct discussions with the\nGovernments of Belize and the United Kingdom, in\nconformity with the norms established for the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes, in order to arrive at a definitive\nsolution to the territorial dispute that exists between our\nStates, a position that Guatemala has unswervingly and\nconstantly upheld.\nGuatemala wishes to reiterate its support for and\nsolidarity with the people of Haiti, reaffirming its\ncommitment to democracy and consequently to the\nlegitimately elected Government. In addition, it urges the\ninternational community to seek a lasting solution to the\nHaitian crisis that would set out not merely to restore\n21\n\n\ndemocracy but also to meet the basic needs of the\npopulation.\nMy country feels bound to express its wish to see in\nCuba a peaceful transition to a democratic and pluralistic\nregime. At the same time, we wish to express our\ngratification at the new possibilities for dialogue that have\nbeen developed in connection with the situation in that\ncountry.\nWe also wish to mention our satisfaction with the\nagreements reached between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and between Israel and Jordan.\nThese represent a momentous step forward in the quest for\na solution to one of the most complex regional conflicts.\nSuch agreements are unquestionably proof that peaceful\ncoexistence and understanding among States and nations is\npossible, even in certain parts of the world where walls of\nhostility and mistrust have been built up over the years.\nWe hail all the peoples of that region and call on them to\ncontinue in their efforts to build peace.\nAlongside these positive actions, we feel duty-bound\nto voice our profound concern at the events that have taken\nplace in Rwanda. International cooperation must be\ngenerously channelled to that country. It should be\nregarded as part of an integrated effort to assist its\nGovernment in the difficult process of rebuilding the State\nwith a view to ensuring that it is effective in tackling the\nserious problems still persisting in the country.\nWe also share the concerns about the situation in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The international community\nmust continue in its efforts to convince the parties to the\nconflict of the imperative need to find an appropriate\nsolution that will put an end to this irrational conflict. This\nconflict cannot be allowed to become a permanent situation.\nGuatemala is a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural country,\nand it views with great satisfaction the international\ninstruments that are being developed with a view to\nintegrating indigenous peoples into development.\nConsistent with the precepts of our Magna Carta, the\nGovernment is pursuing policies designed to recognize,\nrespect and encourage their lifestyles, customs, traditions,\nsocial organization, languages and dialects, while also\nproviding protection to indigenous agricultural lands and\ncooperatives.\nWith respect to the question of women, I should\nunderscore that the policy of the Government has been to\ncooperate with other sectors of Guatemalan society in order\nto pursue measures designed to expand the scope for\nparticipation by women in the productive process and in\ndecision-making. Within the structure of the State itself,\nthere is an ever-growing number of women holding high\npositions, at the same time bearing a share in major\nresponsibilities relating to the building of a prosperous\nfuture for our society. At the same time, Government\naction is designed to strengthen mechanisms designed to\nprotect women, mechanisms which are in conformity with\nthe resolutions adopted by this Organization designed to\nadvance the rights of women.\nTurning now to attention given to children, the\nGovernment is fostering joint activities with non-\ngovernmental organizations in the private sector with a\nview to combating drug addiction, illiteracy, malnutrition,\nabandonment and other problems of children.\nThe World Summit for Social Development offers us\nan opportunity to tackle development as a priority of the\ninternational community and to redress the inequities that\nare increasingly widening between developed and\ndeveloping countries. The progress that has been\nachieved in the course of the work of the Preparatory\nCommittee must be further pursued, achieving the\nconsensus needed for the adoption of the draft declaration\nand the programme of action.\nThe common interests of the developing world must\nfind reflection in the agendas of international forums and\nagencies. To this end, mutual cooperation is the proper\nvehicle, and the coordination endeavours of the\ndeveloping countries among themselves should be stepped\nup.\nGuatemala has acceded to the international\ninstruments designed to eradicate drug trafficking. The\npresent Government attaches priority to combating this\nscourge. It goes without saying that we need solidarity\nand international cooperation in order to eradicate it.\nThe economies of the developing world have had to\nmake great efforts to adapt and open up to world markets,\nefforts which, in most cases, have had a high social cost.\nGuatemala takes the view that trading relations among\nStates need to be based on the free exchange of goods\nand services. We all need trade, and this makes it vital\nto break down the barriers placed in its way, in\naccordance with the spirit and principles of the World\nTrade Organization.\n22\n\n\nAs a consequence of the changes taking place in the\ninternational arena, the United Nations has undertaken a\nprocess of restructuring in an attempt to respond to the new\nrequirements of international relations. Guatemala believes\nthere is a need to reform the world Organization, and in\nthis respect we support the revitalization of the Economic\nand Social Council, which would enable it to function in\nkeeping with present requirements. We are also in favour\nof establishing a better balance between the General\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Secretariat that\nwould allow the Assembly to play a more decisive role as\na forum for deliberation, negotiation and decision-making\non all global problems.\nIn this connection, Guatemala believes that the\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in the\nmembership of the Security Council holds pride of place in\nthe process of reforming this Organization. During this\nprocess structures that emanated from and operated within\na world of confrontation should be reformed. The Security\nCouncil should be restructured with a view to achieving\nrepresentation that is proper and equitable and reflects the\ncurrent international situation.\nGuatemala notes with satisfaction the measures taken\nby the Secretary-General to adapt the Organization to the\nnew international environment and to equip it with the\nmeans to fulfil the objectives of the Charter. In this\nrespect, Guatemala has offered to participate in the\nformation of the stand-by forces.\nPeace-keeping operations are multiplying daily.\nNo one can deny that the role played by these forces in\ndealing with a very large number of conflicts has prevented\nthem from worsening and has allowed latitude for dialogue\nand negotiation. For this reason, they need to be given the\nappropriate means for carrying out their activities, which\nshould always be based on the consent of the parties\nconcerned so as to safeguard the sovereignty of States and\nrespect for their domestic jurisdiction. They should act on\nthe basis of clearly defined mandates and well-delineated\nfields of action.\nThe promotion of world peace should be one of the\ncentral issues addressed by this Organization. In this\ncontext, the limitation of arms production continues to be\nnecessary. All the resources used in weapons research and\ndevelopment should be released and used to promote the\nwell-being of our peoples. Nuclear disarmament should\nalso be one of the major objectives on the agenda of the\ninternational community in the coming years.\nFor this reason, and because of our peace-loving\ntradition, we shall continue to strive to ensure that at the\nmeeting of States parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons to be held in 1995 the\nTreaty\u2019s validity should be extended indefinitely.\nThe ultimate aim of the contribution of each and\nevery one of our nations to this Organization is the\noverall development of the human being. All nations\nwish to see all their citizens enjoying the benefits of\ncomprehensive development. To achieve this there must\nbe cooperation between all the nations of the Earth.\nMy Government therefore is very pleased to\nassociate itself with the cordial welcome extended by the\nOrganization to South Africa on the occasion of its\nreintegration into the United Nations, as well as to the\nnew Observers, especially the Sovereign Military Order\nof Malta, whose humanitarian impact on the world has\nbeen of great importance.\nThis gives full validity to the principle of\nuniversality, which should prevail in the United Nations.\nAnd this belief prompts us to touch on the question of a\ncountry which is capable of making a significant\ncontribution to the search for solutions to the problems\nthat the nations of the world must face. The entry of the\nRepublic of China, Taiwan, into the United Nations\nwould strengthen the Organization, permitting and\nencouraging it to deal properly with topics with global\nimplications.\nGuatemala reaffirms its firm and resolute\ndetermination to meet the commitments and\nresponsibilities it has undertaken in relation to its own\npeople and the international community, in order to assist\nin building a fairer, more peaceful and developed\nworld.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, I wish to express my sincere congratulations to you on your unanimous election as President of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. We are delighted to see a son of Africa, a distinguished diplomat from Cote d'Ivoire, a country with which Mozambique entertains friendly relations, presiding over our deliberations. I should like to pledge my delegation's cooperation in the discharge of your duties. I am confident that under your able leadership our deliberations will be successful.\nI should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to convey through you, Mr. President, my utmost appreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally, for the brilliant manner in which he conducted the work of the previous General Assembly session.\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, deserves our warmest felicitations for the competent manner in which he has been discharging his duties. The people and the Government of the Republic of Mozambique remain grateful to his untiring efforts and dedication to the cause of peace in my country.\nOur participation in this forty-ninth session of the General Assembly takes place at a crucial moment for my country. In about three weeks' time the people of Mozambique will cast their ballots in the first multiparty elections scheduled for 27 and 28 October.\nThe electoral campaign was inaugurated on 22 September last. To this end, 14 political parties, including two coalitions, are running for parliament and 12 candidates are contesting the presidential elections.\nThe electoral census shows that more than 6.3 million people of an estimated 7.5 million eligible voters have been registered. Given the existing difficulties deriving from 16 years of armed conflict, we believe the number of registered voters is quite significant and encouraging.\nA code of conduct aimed at ensuring that the electoral process is carried out harmoniously was signed by presidential candidates before the beginning of the campaign. A similar document was also signed by the 14 contesting political parties. Both codes establish specific rules and guidelines which must be observed during the campaign. In these documents, all parties have, inter alia, pledged to commit themselves to abide by and respect fully the results of the general elections, once they are certified to have been free and fair by the United Nations.\nThe forthcoming multiparty general elections represent the culmination of a long and delicate process of implementation of the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique, signed in Rome in October 1992. The cantonment and demobilization of forces, including the dissolution of the High Command of the former Mozambican Armed Forces, has been concluded. In addition, the Government has transferred all its military assets and infrastructure to the new army. The formation of the agreed 30,000-strong Mozambican Defense Force (FADM) is also under way. However, owing to logistical and material difficulties facing the execution of this commitment, we will have a single army of only about 10,000 men by the time of the elections.\nMy Government appreciates the fact that a mission of the Security Council has recently visited Mozambique to verify on the ground the status of the implementation of the General Peace Agreement and the performance of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ). We took note with satisfaction of the conclusion arrived at by the mission, according to which conditions exists in Mozambique for the holding of free and fair elections, and that the United Nations will immediately endorse the results of these elections, as soon as they are declared free and fair. My Government attaches great importance to the need for ONUMOZ to certify that the signatories of the Rome Agreement have fully respected their commitments regarding the complete demobilization of their forces, so as to ensure a climate free of fear and intimidation during and after the elections.\nAs we move closer to the final stage of the implementation of the General Peace Agreement, the people of Mozambique look forward to a lasting peace and stability under which national unity will be preserved and national reconstruction will be carried on as a matter of priority for the progress and prosperity of our country. That is why my Government and my party, FRELIMO, believe that the winner of the forthcoming elections should be able to form a government which, taking into account the best interests of the nation, will select men and women - irrespective of their political affiliations - with proven qualities of leadership and with a recognized capacity in the management of government affairs who are dedicated to serving the people and preserving peace and stability in the country.\nAs President Chissano stated about 10 days ago, on the opening day of the electoral campaign, the government that will emerge from the forthcoming elections should be one that brings together all Mozambican citizens - a government that should truly serve the nation. He reiterated that, should he win the election, he would be guided by the ideals of reconciliation, dialogue and tolerance among all Mozambicans. That means that his government would seek permanent dialogue with the opposition in order to achieve consensus on the major issues and policies facing our country.\nWe believe that the winner must commit himself to strengthening institutional mechanisms that can ensure an effective participation by the opposition in the decision-making process, particularly within the framework of the Assembly of the Republic. Every guarantee will be extended to the opposition so as to enable it to play a meaningful and active role in the political life of the country.\nThat is our vision of the post-electoral future in Mozambique, a vision that will give high priority to the issue of unity and reconciliation, peace and stability, and rehabilitation and development in our country.\nIn the meantime, it is our strong belief that the international community should encourage and put pressure on the parties to faithfully implement the Rome Agreement and to pre-empt any move aimed at renegotiating the Agreement or undermining its implementation. Pacta sunt servanda. With the elections less than a month away, it is imperative that the signatories to the General Peace Agreement and the international community as a whole do not lose perspective and depart from the legal and political framework of that important peace-making instrument. If we are to witness a successful outcome of the peace process in Mozambique, it is essential that the signatories of the Rome Agreement respect fully their obligations and refrain from raising issues, conditions or preconditions in the implementation of the Agreement. The international community must therefore exert the necessary positive influence over the parties to abide by their commitments under the Rome Agreement.\nMy Government is determined to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement. In the course of 19 years of independence, FRELIMO and the Government of Mozambique have always respected their commitments, both at home and at the international level.\nWe have successfully established multiparty democracy in Mozambique; we have successfully embarked on economic reforms; and we have successfully concluded the General Peace Agreement. Today, at this critical juncture, we are once again ready to honour our obligations and responsibilities.\nMozambique is emerging from 16 years of a devastating conflict that has deeply rent its economic and social fabric. Therefore, apart from the relentless efforts that the Government has been deploying in honouring its obligations within the framework of the General Peace Agreement, our endeavour is also directed towards the monumental task of national reconstruction. This noble task constitutes a basic component of the whole process towards a lasting peace in Mozambique. Our success in national reconstruction will greatly contribute to the political, economic and social stability of the country.\nThe advent of peace in 1992 paved the way for the Government to fully embark upon the implementation of the economic recovery programme that was launched in early 1987. It is due to this undertaking that in 1993 our gross domestic product increased by 5.6 per cent as a result of a significant growth by basic economic sectors: agriculture, 8 per cent; transport and communications, 10 per cent; trade, 17 per cent; and construction, 3 per cent.\nLikewise, the rate of inflation dropped to 30 per cent in 1993, as compared to 165 per cent in 1987. Economic forecasts show that the conditions are present to reduce even further the inflation rate in the years to come. This is an encouraging trend in the performance of our economy that provides confidence in its continued growth.\nWith regard to investment opportunities, the combination of two years of peace and wide-ranging economic reforms heralds a new era for Mozambican private-sector development. The role of foreign direct investment and other fields of cooperation with the international business community is recognized as being crucial to the success of national reconstruction in Mozambique.\nMoreover, my Government is engaged in rehabilitating the economic and social infrastructures destroyed by war. The reintegration of demobilized soldiers into civilian life, the resettlement of refugees and displaced persons, and the rehabilitation of socio-economic infrastructures such as roads, bridges, health centres, commercial networks, schools and water supplies are real challenges that will require the special attention of the government that will emerge from the forthcoming elections.\nIn this context, we attach great importance to the ongoing demining process, as it will contribute to the normalization of life throughout the country, particularly to the resumption of agricultural production in the rural areas. This task is both delicate and enormous, bearing in mind the nature of the conflict that ravaged Mozambique and given the size of the territory. We therefore wish to reiterate our appeal to the international community to continue, in the light of General Assembly resolution 48/7 of 19 October 1993, to render its generous assistance in the form of financial, material, technical support and needed expertise for the mine-clearance programme in Mozambique.\nMy delegation welcomes the call for a moratorium on export of land-mines and endorses the appeal contained in the 1994 report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization for the international community to take appropriate measures to limit the production, use and sale of anti-personnel land-mines with a view to achieving their complete ban.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, the southern African region has witnessed an unprecedented historical event. My delegation wishes to join the previous speakers in welcoming a free and democratic South Africa back into the family of nations. With the presence of President Mandela in this Assembly Hall this morning, we honour the people of South Africa, all the men and women in southern Africa, and people all over the world who have contributed to the struggle for the elimination of the abominable system of apartheid.\nThe accession to power of a democratically elected Government in South Africa represents the dawning of a new era not only in that sister country but also in the African continent in general. It is our firm expectation to see all the people of South Africa, regardless of their colour or social background, learn how to live together in harmony.\nThe new South Africa represents the end of the policy of destabilization in southern Africa and the setting up of a peaceful environment at the regional level, which will certainly lead to a fruitful cooperation among the States of the region in their quest for progress and economic development.\nThe eradication of the apartheid system in South Africa and the consolidation of multi-party democracy in the countries of the region have paved the way for the establishment of a climate of peace and stability in southern Africa. The countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), in building their community, are pursuing their joint efforts towards common regional security by addressing issues of conflict prevention and conflict resolution. The prospects of lasting peace and stability in southern Africa will allow us the opportunity to redouble our efforts within the SADC region in our search for progress. Furthermore, peace and stability in southern Africa will ensure our participation as equal partners in development cooperation with other regional economic groupings.\nThe present session of the General Assembly provides us with an excellent opportunity for a joint assessment of current international political and socio-economic developments. We note with concern that the end of the cold war has not meant the end of armed conflicts around the world. Indeed, armed conflicts continue to proliferate, especially at the regional level, where they constitute a real threat to international peace and security.\nIn this context, my delegation is particularly concerned by the tragedy and untold suffering which are taking place in the African country of Rwanda. Thousands of innocent people have fallen victim to violence, and as a result thousands more have been forced to leave the country, thus sparking another humanitarian crisis in our conflict-torn continent. We in Mozambique, having experienced a long- lasting conflict, wish to appeal to all parties concerned in Rwanda to settle their differences through dialogue. Only dialogue can bring peace and an end to the tragic situation and human suffering in that martyred country.\nPeace in Angola cannot be delayed any longer. While we appreciate the role played by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and his recent initiatives to bring about a successful outcome at the Lusaka Talks, we still believe that the United Nations should redouble its efforts aimed at putting pressure on UNITA to respect the Bicesse Accords fully and abide by their letter and spirit. My delegation appeals to UNITA to lay down its weapons and seek to achieve its political objectives through dialogue and national reconciliation as a legalized political party.\nIn the light of Security Council resolutions 864 (1993) of 15 September 1993 and 932 (1994) of 30 June 1994, the United Nations has a moral obligation to exhort UNITA to negotiate with the necessary seriousness, and in good faith, and to cooperate with the Government of Angola on an expeditious conclusion of negotiations under way in Lusaka. We further welcome Security Council resolution 945 (1994) of 29 September 1994 which, inter alia, calls upon both parties to honour the commitments already made by them at the Lusaka Peace Talks and urges them to complete their negotiations as soon as possible and to make every necessary effort to have the Lusaka Agreement formally signed before 31 October 1994.\nIn the Middle East, we note with satisfaction the implementation of the peace accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which have resulted in autonomy for Gaza and Jericho and the return of the PLO leader to his motherland. In the same manner, we believe that the recent Declaration signed by Jordan and Israel is a significant step forward in the relaxation of tensions in the region. The international community should continue to support these developments for the restoration of peace and mutual confidence in the Middle East. We encourage Israel and Syria to continue negotiations in order to conclude an early agreement on issues which for so long have been a source of conflict between the two countries.\nThe question of East Timor continues to be of grave concern to the international community. My Government wishes to express its support for all initiatives for a genuine dialogue conducive to the achievement of self- determination by the people of East Timor.\nWe have been following with keen interest the ongoing debate on the restructuring of the United Nations, in particular the flowing ideas within the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council. We believe that the expansion of the Council must reflect the growing need for justice and a balance of interests among nations and continents, with emphasis on increased permanent membership for developing countries in general and Africa in particular. To this end, we should sofar as possible work during the current session of the General Assembly to achieve consensus on this issue.\nIn our opinion, the adequate representation of developing countries on the Security Council will rectify imbalances deriving from the current composition of this body and ensure its efficiency and legitimacy. Above all, it will confer a democratic nature on the decisions taken by that organ. In this context, my delegation fully subscribes to the African common position on this issue adopted by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on 29 September.\nSince last year's debate on this issue, some countries have been singled out as qualifying for additional permanent membership on the Security Council. This year a number of countries have described Brazil as meeting the requirements for permanent membership in the framework of these reforms. My delegation fully shares that view.\nThe presence of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique offers an opportunity to address the issue of peace-keeping operations. As we have stated on several occasions, peace-keeping forces will succeed only if they strictly adhere to the fundamental principles which guide them and scrupulously respect the terms of reference of the mission for which they have been established.\nIt is our considered position that there is no universal formula for the success of each and every peace-keeping mission. In this connection, we feel that, though we may recognize the basic rules that govern peace-keeping activities, it is important to bear in mind specific situations and concrete agreements that have to be fully observed in each case. In other words, we cannot prescribe the same medicine for every kind of disease. This could be a prescription for death rather than for recovery, a recipe for disaster rather than for success. We believe that it is extremely important for the United Nations always to take into account the need to safeguard the sovereignty of the State concerned. Where there is a Government, even with weak institutions, peace-keeping missions should work in close cooperation and consultation with the local authorities and respect and strengthen those institutions, rather than try to weaken or undermine them.\nThe International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo last month was a landmark in the efforts to control world-wide population growth in favour of sustainable development. The Programme of Action adopted by the Conference responds to the challenges that lie ahead of us. Similarly, the World Summit for Social Development, scheduled to take place in Copenhagen in March 1995, will offer an opportunity to the nations of the world to arrive at common ground on today's pressing issues, such as the social integration of disadvantaged and marginalized segments of the population and the eradication of poverty, especially in the developing countries. The Summit should also emphasize the need to improve the quality of life as an integrated approach to sustainable development, by incorporating health concerns in developmental strategies.\nSimilarly, we look forward to the holding of the World Conference on Women, in Beijing in September next year. It is our expectation that the Beijing Conference will culminate in the adoption of comprehensive strategies and policies in order to address pressing issues affecting women world wide.\nIt is regrettable to note that, four years after the holding of the World Summit for Children, the situation of children world-wide continues to be deplorable and a matter of concern. Amongst them, children in conflict situations deserve our special attention. My country is faced with an adverse environment for children, a legacy of 16 years of devastating war, which, among other things, broke up entire families and left many children orphans or deeply traumatized and without any kind of comfort or family warmth.\nWe therefore welcome resolution 48/157 of 20 December 1993 which, inter alia, requested the Secretary-General to appoint an expert to undertake a comprehensive study of the question of the protection of children affected by armed conflicts. We in Mozambique feel honoured by the Secretary-General's recent nomination of Mrs. Graga Machel to coordinate a working group on such a study.\nThirty years have now elapsed since Mozambique embarked on the search for independence and peace. It has been a long and difficult journey. Today we are at a crucial stage in the implementation of the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique and of the holding of multiparty general elections. On behalf of my Government, I would like to seize this occasion to reiterate our deepest appreciation to the international community for the solidarity and support it has extended to our people. It is our firm belief that we will continue to enjoy this support for the consolidation of peace, progress and prosperity in our country.\n"

I express our happiness and that\nof the sons of Africa on his assumption of that important\npost. It is our hope that during his term of office Africa\nand the whole of the international community will achieve\nthe development and the consolidation of peace and security\nto which our peoples aspire.\nI wish also to convey our compliments to Mr. Samuel\nInsanally of Guyana on his exemplary and able leadership\nduring his presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-\neighth session.\n\nI should also like to salute the Secretary-General for\nhis tireless effort as leader of the Organization; we wish\nhim all success.\nOn this occasion it is my pleasure to welcome the\nreturn of the sister Republic of South Africa to the\ninternational community as a democratic country, that is\nnow free from apartheid and that is governed by its own\nnational will, to participate effectively in the development\nof Africa and of the world at large. In welcoming South\nAfrica, I reiterate our continued support for its people, just\nas we were devoted to their cause during the struggle for\nthe eradication of apartheid.\nIndeed, it is the destiny of people committed to the\ndefence of their freedom to have their will tested. That is\nexactly the fate of the people of Sudan which, since the\nNational Salvation Revolution came to power has decided\nto have an independent voice in all regional and\ninternational forums on all issues and in all fields, inspired\nby its principles based on its cultural heritage and its\nregional and international affiliations.\nI have the honour of briefing the Assembly on a\nnumber of the accomplishments my Government has\nachieved despite the obstacles it has faced owing to its\nadherence to the cultural choice of the Sudanese people.\nThe Government of the National Salvation Revolution\ninherited armed discord in the South, with all its\nconsequences. From the start, it accorded the highest\npriority to the achievement of a peaceful, negotiated, just\nand lasting settlement. It is the conviction of my\nGovernment that only a permanent solution will be\nacceptable to the people. During its five years in power,\nthe Government has engaged in a number of peace talks\nwith the rebel movement. These have taken place\nsuccessively in Addis Ababa, Nairobi and twice in Abuja;\nrecently there have been four rounds of talks in Nairobi.\nThe talks have taken place with the help of neighbours\nand brethren who share our belief that it is the sons of\nAfrica who can find suitable solutions to Africa\u2019s\nproblems. The Government, with earnest determination\nto ensure the success of the peace talks, proposed a new\nmechanism to expedite the peace process. This calls for\nthe dispatch of personal envoys of the Presidents of the\nmediating countries to engage in shuttle diplomacy\nbetween the Government and the rebel movement.\nMy Government, which is anxious to reach a just\nand lasting solution, not only entered into negotiations,\nbut has also adopted the federal system of government\nthat had long been called for by the southern Sudanese.\nIt implemented the formula of power sharing and the\nsharing of wealth in the framework of Federalism. As\nregards the relationship between religion and State, the\nGovernment proposed a formula that would enable the\nmajority to choose whatever suits its cultural heritage,\nwithout infringement on the rights of the rest of the\npopulation, ultimately bearing in mind the need to respect\nevery citizen\u2019s equal rights and the cultural diversity that\ncharacterizes the Sudan and of which we are so proud.\nThat is why the southern Sudan, where the majority is\nnon-Muslim, has been exempted from the application of\nIslamic law.\nGiven its conviction that those who joined the ranks\nof the rebellion and those who happen to live in the\nrebel-held areas are Sudanese citizens who deserve, and\nare entitled to enjoy fully all their rights, the Government\nsigned the Operation Life-Line Sudan III Agreement to\nensure the delivery of food and medicines to whoever was\nin need. Officials of the United Nations were candid and\nsincere when they described Operation Life-Line Sudan\nas unprecedented world wide. The allegation that the root\n32\n\n\ncauses of the war in southern Sudan are religious or ethnic\nis refuted by the fact that the majority of displaced persons\nmoved northwards and to the national capital, while only a\nfew migrated out of the country.\nCitizens of the south who had suffered the ravages of\nthe lengthy war in the south took the initiative of convening\nthe Juba Conference in May 1994. That Conference was\nalso attended by a number of foreign Ambassadors\naccredited to the Sudan. Those who represented the south\nat that Conference reiterated the unity of the country and\ncategorically rejected the isolated agenda of the rebels\nwhich aims at fragmenting the country.\nNations manifest wisdom when, in quest of national\nidentity and in search for an effective system of\nGovernment that best suits their special conditions and\nhistorical background, they draw inspiration from their own\nheritage. Our people have found this in the application of\nthe shura, or consultation, as a system of Government to\nensure the universality of opinions free from the tribal and\nsectorial fanaticism that causes disunity amongst the sons\nof the nation. This principle is exercised without a\ntyrannical authority that deprives them of their will. The\nshura is the overall vessel for political, developmental and\nsocial endeavour. To put the shura into practice, the\nPermanent Electoral Commission was founded in\nconformity with the electoral law enacted by the\nTransitional National Assembly, which is composed of\nneutral personalities of professional integrity. Voter\nregistration was introduced to ensure an atmosphere\nconducive to fair and genuine elections that are scheduled\nto take place early next year, after the full participation of\nall the people is secured.\nTo enable all strata of the population to participate\neffectively in administering and organizing themselves,\ndeveloping their resources and enjoying all their rights, the\ncentral power made way for 26 State Governments within\nthe framework of the federal system. This minimization of\nthe administrative authority was aimed at achieving the\nadvancement and welfare of the country through the\ndevelopment of its States.\nOur belief that almighty Allah elevated the human race\nabove all other species is our guiding principle in the area\nof human rights. My Government has translated that belief\ninto action in all areas. In order to ensure the effective\nenjoyment by all citizens of their human rights, the\nGovernment established the Supreme Council for Human\nRights and bestowed upon it full constitutional liberty. It\nsecured the freedom of the judiciary and protected it against\ninterference by the political authority. The justice system\nwas reformed to guarantee freedom of litigation, equity\nand rule of law.\nThe Government of the National Salvation\nRevolution strengthened the role of women in the Sudan\nand upheld all their rights. It enabled women to occupy\nhigh constitutional, judicial, political and economic posts,\nwhile also upholding their social rights. Today, women\nrepresent 50 per cent of the labour force in Government\noffices, where they perform very ably. Statistics of the\nMinistry of Education revealed that 60 per cent of the\nstudents enrolled in universities and institutions of higher\neducation are female.\nThe best example of the confidence of the\nGovernment in its performance in the area of human\nrights is the fact that it opened its doors wide for\nrepresentatives of European Parliaments, including the\nBritish House of Commons and House of Lords, the\nItalian Parliament, and the United States Congress. In\naddition, human rights organizations, religious\nassociations and other dignitaries have visited the country,\nespecially those areas where abuses of human rights were\nalleged to have taken place.\nAs a manifestation of our tolerance, our country is\ncurrently hosting the Inter-Religion Dialogue Conference,\nin which Muslim and Christian scholars from different\nparts of the world are participating. This Conference is\naimed at the enhancement of tolerance and peaceful\ncoexistence between religions in any one geographical\narea. The purpose is also to prove that religion is not, as\nalleged by others, mere fanaticism. The Conference is\nbased on the mutual conviction that ethics and morals are\nthe best guides for individuals and peoples. In this\nregard, I would like to point out that the present\nConference is the sequel of a previous one that was\nconvened in Sudan two years ago, after which inter-\nreligion dialogue continued inside and outside the Sudan.\nAfter this brief account, the Assembly may agree\nwith me that reports of violations of human rights in the\nSudan are nothing but malicious applications of political\npressure to deter the Sudan from exercising its freedom\nto make its own decision and holding on to its cultural\noptions. I need not state that those who continue to level\nbaseless accusations against Sudan have not produced any\nevidence whatsoever to support their allegations. This, as\nI said earlier, seems to be the lot of all nations that\nchoose their own way.\n33\n\n\nThose who make unfounded allegations that Sudan\nharbours terrorism have not produced a single shred of\nevidence to prove it. They never expected that Sudan\nwould prove its innocence by capturing the most dangerous\nand most wanted terrorist in history: Carlos, the Jackal.\nGuided by standards of conduct that condemn violence and\nbloodshed, and in accordance with its adherence to\ninternational conventions and ethical ideals, Sudan arrested\nthat terrorist. By virtue of our doctrine of transparency and\nopenness, the doors of our country will remain wide open\nfor whoever wishes to see for himself that no terrorism is\nharboured in the Sudan.\nThe rebel movement, which was hatched outside\nSudan, has kept changing its skin, with different\nprogrammes and ideologies, in order to gain support.\nUnfortunately, up to now the rebellion has received moral,\nmaterial and military support from those who do not want\nthe Sudan to enjoy its freedom of decision. The rebellion\nthus became a pliant tool in the futile attempts to subjugate\nthe Sudan. The rebel leaders made themselves warlords,\nindifferent to the plight of their own people and the blood\nthey continue to shed. Before the eyes of international\ncommunity, the rebels commit the worst and atrocious\nkinds of violation of human rights: attacking and\ncommandeering relief barges and trains, killing relief\nworkers, looting villages and abducting men and children.\nLeaders of the rebellion are now launching a repugnant\nliquidation of their opponents in the ranks of the rebel\nmovement. As proof of its defeat, very large numbers of\nreturnees from the rebel movement came back home,\nconvinced that it lacked a proper objective and that it had\nfallen prey to the influence of foreign powers.\nThe crime of our time was that which was committed\nin the Kakuma Refugee Camp in Northern Kenya, which\naccommodates children who are Sudanese refugees. The\nGarang faction kidnapped 5,000 children at gunpoint to join\ntheir ranks, undeterred by conscience or respect for the\ninternational covenants that govern the status of refugees\nand provide for their protection. To our surprise, this crime\nwas met with indifference from the international\ncommunity, which did nothing to ensure the return of those\nchildren to their families. From this rostrum we call upon\nall international agencies, the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Committee\nof the Red Cross to condemn this crime in the strongest\npossible terms and to work effectively and decisively to put\nan end to the plight of those children and to work to reunite\nthem with their families in the Sudan as soon as is\npracticable.\nThe relationship of the Sudan with the United\nNations has continued to exist on a basis of constructive\ncooperation. Within the scope of such cooperation,\nproductive developmental schemes and child-care projects\nhave been set up, in addition to the humanitarian\noperations under the auspices of the Department of\nHumanitarian Affairs and the appointment of a special\nenvoy who played an effective role in coordinating\nhumanitarian efforts. The United Nations also\nsuccessfully raised from the donor community resources\nequivalent to 60 per cent of the required finances of\nOperation Life Line for 1994.\nWhile we recall such positive achievements, we must\nalso refer to certain negative aspects that accompanied\nthat cooperation. In the field of relief distribution under\nOperation Life Line, statistics have confirmed that the\ngreater portion of relief is directed to the rebel-held areas,\nwhich represent less than 10 per cent of the area of\nSouthern Sudan, a situation which must be rectified.\nAlso, while we appreciate the valuable role of\nnon-governmental organizations working in the\nhumanitarian field, it is relevant to underline the negative\nactivities of some of them, which go so far as to violate\nthe national sovereignty of Sudan, and provide support to\nthe rebels, thus prolonging the war and adding to the\nsuffering and distress of our people.\nAs we look forward to the forthcoming celebrations\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we must\nrecall that its inception was a product of a human\nawakening, following two destructive world wars that\ncaused devastation to mankind and the environment, and\ncrippled the progress of humanity. At a time when the\nuse of military power was the sole means to expand\npolitical and economic influence, the establishment of the\nOrganization represented a hope for humanity to\novercome its destructive tendencies, which were spurred\nby the possession of nuclear weapons and weapons of\nmass destruction, and to strive for the horizons of peace\nand development.\nIt was saddening that the human awakening which\nculminated in the inception of the Organization was\nfollowed by a Cold War that continued until the 1990s.\nAs a result, huge resources were drained away instead of\nbeing invested in the areas of peace and development. It\nis also saddening that the mentality of the Cold War still\nprevails in what is conceived as a clash of civilizations.\n34\n\n\nIt has been wrongly believed that the disappearance of one\nenemy must be followed by the creation of a new one in an\nattempt to keep the cycle of war and conflict going. While\nthe world witnesses the emergence of new States and the\ndecline of apartheid, some are still trapped in that erroneous\nconception, which has given rise to various regional\ntensions, such as those in Bosnia and Herzegovina and\nRwanda. Racial discrimination and xenophobia have\nincreased in a number of western countries; the exodus of\nrefugees and the flow of displaced persons continues.\nIn the economic arena, and despite the world\u2019s drive\ntowards a free-market economy we have nevertheless\nwitnessed a deterioration in economic and social\ninfrastructures, especially in the developing countries. This\ndeterioration is a direct result of the unfair practices and\ncriteria that still plague international economic relations.\nContributions by wealthier States and international financial\ninstitutions to assist developing countries have severely\ndecreased; selective non-economic conditions are often\nimposed in dealing with the developing countries.\nMoreover, economic performance is no longer the criterion\nthat is taken into account. Political considerations have\nbecome the sole basis of cooperation with the lending\nStates and institutions.\nThe problems of indebtedness and debt servicing\ncontinue to represent a huge burden on debtor States and in\nparticular, the least developed countries. The debt problem\nremains unresolved because the creditors insist on imposing\nconditions that related more to the political stances of the\ndebtor States and therefore, selectivity was resorted to in\nresolving the debt problem. We call upon this august body\nto adopt the resolutions and recommendations of the Non-\nAligned Movement Ministerial Meeting held last August in\nJakarta, Indonesia, on resolving the debt problems of\ndeveloping countries. The partial remission of debts is the\nappropriate starting point to resolve the debt problem,\ninstead of the re-scheduling process, which has already\ncontributed to multiplying the amount of debt service in\nexcess of the principal.\nThe objective of establishing regional economic\ngroupings is to contribute to the creation of a free flow of\ntrade, investments and technology across national borders\nand the integrated trading groups. The scale of\ndevelopment in all countries, especially the developing\ncountries, must be stepped up and the politics of\nprotectionism practised by the major Powers vis-\u00e0-vis\ndeveloping countries for political reasons must end.\nWhen we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, we hope that the Organization will attain\ntangible achievements in eliminating the political,\neconomic, social and humanitarian distortions that\ninfluence the international arena. Such achievements can\nbe attained only by translating the principles and\nobjectives of the Charter into real terms that reflect the\nvalues of justice, equality, and full participation by all\nMember States in creating a better future.\nIn order to achieve such goals, the democratization\nof the United Nations and all its organs must be\naccomplished. According to the Charter, the General\nAssembly has a role to play on an equal footing with the\nSecurity Council in the maintenance of international peace\nand security, as well as in supervising the performance of\nother organs of the Organization.\nJust as we fully support the call for increasing the\nmembership of the Security Council to ensure the\nequitable representation of all geographic and political\ngroups in the Council, we also call for a reconsideration\nof geographical representation by allowing Africa, Asia\nand Latin America more opportunities to have permanent\nseats on the Council. We also call for the complete\nabolition of the veto power, as it contradicts all the\nprinciples of democracy and maintains the hegemony of\nthe minority.\nFurthermore, we note a lack of transparency in the\nfunctioning of the Security Council, and believe that most\nMember States are often unable to follow its work.\nWhile we appreciate the efforts made to improve the\nperformance of the Council, its persistent practice of\nholding intensive informal consultations marginalizes the\nrole of the majority of Member States in the maintenance\nof international peace and security. Accordingly, rules of\nprocedure regulating the Council\u2019s procedures must be\nestablished to provide for a fair and objective guarantee\nof the existence of the required transparency.\nAs regards the Council\u2019s resolutions, it is regrettable\nthat the practice of double standards and selectivity, as\nreflected in its resolutions and their implementation, has\ngreatly affected its credibility, a problem which we hope\nwill be resolved.\nThe Economic and Social Council, as a guardian of\neconomic and social rights should take more interest in\nmaintaining the right balance between political and\neconomic rights in its resolutions and decisions, which\nhave become more inclined towards political rights in\n35\n\n\nspite of the Vienna Declaration, which considered the right\nto development a basic human right.\nThe peace process has already started in the Middle\nEast. In order for that process to reach the desired goals,\nthe peace that is hoped for in the regional should be based\non the pillars of justice and equality and the attainment by\nthe Palestinian people of all their rights and the withdrawal\nfrom the territories occupied in 1967. The withdrawal from\nthe Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon should be\ncarried out in full implementation of Security Council\nResolution 425 (1978). The withdrawal from Jerusalem\nand all the other occupied Arab territories will remain\ncritical in determining the real Israeli intention to establish\na just and lasting peace.\nThe recent conflict in the sisterly state of Yemen\nended with the victory of constitutional legality, which\npreserved the unity of Yemen; this incident should lead us\nto stress the need to refrain from intervention in the internal\naffairs of other States that might find themselves in similar\ncircumstances.\nWith regard to Somalia, which faces enormous hurdles\nand internecine killings, we call upon all parties to heed the\nvoice of reason and to work together for the attainment of\na national reconciliation that would enable Somalia to\nresume the role destined for it at the regional and\ninternational levels.\nWe must also pause here to consider the suffering of\nthe Iraqi people, which is worsening as a result of the\nembargo imposed on it even though it has been admitted\nthat Iraq has shown full cooperation in implementing the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We call for the\nlifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq as soon as possible\nand we urge the members of the Security Council to renew\ntheir consideration of this issue.\nAs regards the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, we are\nsurprised by the continuation of sanctions in spite of all the\npractical proposals made by the Jamahiriya, through the\nLeague of Arab states, in order to finalize its dispute with\nsome Western countries over the Lockerbie incident in a\nreasonable manner. The aforementioned treatment of Libya\nlacks any legal and humanitarian justification.\nThe Bosnian peoples\u2019 tragedy continues to be a\nshameful blot the face of humanity. Factors of religious\nbias have greatly contributed to the creation and escalation\nof the Bosnian tragedy.\nAs for the Security Council, it has pursued a clear\npolicy of double standards in the case of Bosnia and\nHerzegovena. Not only did the Security Council reward\nthe aggressors by granting them territories they do not\nown, but it has deprived the Bosnians of their legitimate\nright to self-defence as enshrined in the United Nations\nCharter, through an arms-embargo resolution. Bosnia and\nHerzegovena did not declare an intention to acquire the\nlands of others, but only wanted to defend itself and its\npeople against aggression.\nAs I conclude my statement, I should like to pose\nquestions which, I believe, that are relevant to our\npreparations for celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations and the International Decade of Tolerance.\nAre we prepared to abandon the unilateral approach to the\ntackling of problems of international relations? Are we\nready to recognize now that this world accommodates us\nas distinct and diverse peoples and civilizations coexisting\nwith one another?\nIt is our opinion that fostering regional and\ninternational peace and security does not mean the\nomission of the underlying causes of tension. Equally,\ncomprehensive development does not mean the\nentrenchment of the unfair economic and technological\npractices existing in today\u2019s world. Furthermore,\ndemocracy in our opinion does not mean the imposition\nof the western model of democracy alone and omission of\nother peoples\u2019 practices and civilizations in the field of\ngovernance and systems of government. Moreover,\nuniversality of sovereignty does not mean disregard for\nthe national and geographic sovereignty of States. Also,\nthe universality of human rights, which enjoys our respect\nand commitment, does not necessarily mean cancellation\nof the religious beliefs of peoples and their moral values.\nIn brief, the principles and values adopted by any one\nsociety are not necessarily or definitely fit for application\nby all other societies. By applying such a unilateral\nperspective, we will deprive civilization of the benefits of\ndiversity and from its productive legacy and we will as\nsuch deprive peoples of their right to opt for the political\nmodels and social conduct that are more compatible with\ntheir aspirations. Otherwise, we would only compound a\nnew phase of undesired cultural conflicts and tensions.\nLet us turn a new leaf in international relations that\nwould be founded on the rejection of conflict and\nconfrontation, based on the principles of mutual respect\nand non-interference in the affairs of others, without\nextremism, bias or radicalism.\n36\n\n\nIn conclusion, let our deeds speak louder than our\nwords in building up the tolerance with which we prepare\nto commence the international decade, and let us extend\nthis it to embrace all aspects of politics, thought,\neconomics, culture, and religion.\n"

        "file_text": "I\nam pleased to extend to you, Sir, my sincere\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly and to express\nto you my great delight at seeing you, a distinguished\nfriend from a sisterly country, conducting the work of this\nsession.\nYour competence and great diplomatic experience are\nassets which ensure the success of our deliberations. We\nare convinced that, through you, Africa will bring to this\nsession its well-known capabilities and talents in order to\nsecure the best results for our work. Allow me to assure\nyou of the full cooperation of the delegation of the\nKingdom of Morocco.\nI should also like to pay tribute to His Excellency\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, the Permanent\nRepresentative of the Republic of Guyana and President of\nthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, for the\nlaudable work he accomplished.\nI should like also to express to our Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, my sincere regards and\nappreciation for his untiring efforts in upholding the\nprinciples of the Charter and for the wisdom and the\nperspicacity with which he faces the increasing\nresponsibilities assigned to the United Nations in recent\nyears.\nThe end of the cold war gave the peoples of the world\ncause for hope that they were about to see the dawn of a\nnew era in international relations, an era of democracy,\njustice and an effective international solidarity which would\ntake into account the interests of all.\nYears after that historic opportunity, we have come to\nrealize that our optimism was unjustified. We are to see\nyet any sincere international effort towards the creation of\na new world order and of the hoped-for peace dividends we\nhave seen nothing concrete yet. On the contrary, what we\nsee now makes us fear that that historic opportunity is on\nthe verge of being dissipated in the fog of an ambiguous\ninternational political atmosphere.\nA close examination of the characteristics of the\npresent world order reveals that its thrust focuses almost\ntotally on the issues of economic openness, freedom of\ninternational trade, democracy and human rights.\nThere is no doubt that these two last questions\ndeserve every attention, since they are among the\nunderpinnings of any system of honest government and of\nsocial justice and have always been among the goals of\nenlightened civilizations in their search for a fair society\nin which justice and social peace may prevail.\nMaybe it would be going too far to insist, as some\ndo, on the adoption of one model of democracy, out of all\nthe other models, by all the countries and societies of the\nworld without taking into account the numerous factors\nwhich have to do with the civilizations of the peoples of\nthose countries, their customs, traditions, cultures, the\ndegree of their development, their general conception of\nthe universe we live in, or their views concerning life and\nsociety.\nAs regards our Organization, the principles of\ndemocracy require us to examine its methods of operation\nin order to secure a unified implementation of its\nresolutions and ensure efficiency in the discharge of its\nduties.\nIn view of the ever-increasing importance of the role\nthe Security Council now plays in international affairs, we\nmust debate the extent of its adaptation to the great\nchanges that have taken place in the world recently and\nwhich have affected the balance of power, side by side\nwith the new political and economic trends, so that we\nmay find consensus solutions in reviewing the Security\nCouncil\u2019s methods of work and in trying to enhance its\nefficacy.\nThe changes I have spoken of require us to review\nalso some of the provisions of the Charter with a view to\nenabling our Organization to face up to the new\ninternational challenges with the participation of all in the\ninterests of all.\nAs for the question of human rights, the Kingdom of\nMorocco attaches great importance to those rights, which\nare enshrined in our constitution. However, I wish to\npoint out - as I did in past years - that human rights have\ndifferent aspects which must be respected fully. We\nshould not focus solely on the political aspect whose\nimportance has been established. The rights of the human\nbeing to the essential, basic human needs such as food,\nclothing, medicine and shelter are inalienable and\nfundamental, just exactly as the right to life. That is why\nthe World Conference on Human Rights, which was\nconvened in Vienna last year, determined that economic\n17\n\n\ndevelopment which makes it possible to satisfy those needs\nwas a fundamental human right.\nConsequently, the affluent nations have an obligation\nto pay more attention to the economic interests of the\ndeveloping world in order to help it reach the levels of\ndevelopment that will allow it to accord to those rights the\npriority they deserve.\nIn this context, we expect the World Summit for\nSocial Development, which will take place in Copenhagen\nnext year, to define the essential needs of man the\nsatisfaction of which would guarantee a decent life and\nexpect the Summit to set up a plan of action to stimulate\nsocial development and economic progress in the countries\nof the third world.\nThe world has entered upon a new era marked by\nfundamental changes in the traditional international relations\nwhich emphasized the primacy of political beliefs. In\naddition, the great Powers have engaged in a new race for\neconomic interests in place of the arms race. The race that\nnow concerns them is characterized by the strengthening of\nrelations within great economic groupings with a view to\nthe creation of new economic blocs. These developments\nwill undoubtedly alter the economic and political map of\nthe world and will, thereby, widen the gap between the\ndeveloped and the developing countries.\nIn a much more interdependent world, thanks to the\nnew means of communication and technology, such as live\ntelevision broadcasts, it has become ever more difficult to\npersuade the peoples of the developing countries to be\ncontent with their lot while the disparities between the\naffluence of the developed countries and the misery of the\ndeveloping countries are constantly worsening. Therefore,\nit would be illogical to expect that lasting peace and\nsecurity could prevail in a world wherein the overwhelming\nmajority of people live in despair, deprivation and social\nmisery.\nThe rich countries should find satisfactory solutions to\nthe economic problems of developing countries - in\nparticular, to those related to the deterioration in terms of\ntrade, the decline in commodity prices, external\nindebtedness and technological weaknesses.\nIn April 1994, the city of Marrakech hosted the\nsigning of various agreements under the General Agreement\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Through these agreements,\nthe international community established the primacy of the\nrule of law in international economic and trade relations\nand put an end to the law of the primacy of strength that\nprevailed in the past.\nThe agreements, which were signed by 109 States,\nincluded a number of extremely positive elements. One\nof the most significant results of the Marrakech\nagreements was the creation of the World Trade\nOrganization, which will come into being next year and\nwill have competence in the areas of control and\nimplementation. We hope that this new organization,\nthanks to its competences, the policies laid for it, and the\nprogramme of work designed to pursue those policies will\nbe able to lay real foundations for international trade that\nwould free trade from the protectionism that plagues it\nunder many guises such as the so-called social\nconsiderations that relate to workers\u2019 rights and\nenvironmental considerations.\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War and the\nsetting up of the United Nations, international relations\nhave been characterized essentially by the movement\ntowards the liberation of peoples from the colonial yoke,\nespecially in Africa and Asia. Nowadays, only some\nenclaves remain from the colonial era. For particular\nreasons, those enclaves required more time for their\nliberation, and they are now involved in settlement\nprocesses with the agreement of the interested parties.\nThe British colony of Hong Kong will revert to\nChinese sovereignty in 1997, as will the Portuguese\ncolony of Macau in the near future. Similarly, the status\nof Gibraltar is the subject of continuous discussions\nbetween Spain and the United Kingdom with a view to\nthe return of that Territory to Spanish sovereignty. These\nare settlement processes that we in Morocco strongly\nsupport.\nAs we know, some enclaves in the northern part of\nMorocco are still under Spanish control. These are the\ncities of Sebta and Melilia and the neighbouring islands.\nSince its accession to independence, my country has\ntirelessly asked Spain to return those enclaves so that we\nmay restore our territorial integrity and put an end to this\nlong-standing dispute.\nThere is no doubt the ideal solution in this respect\nwould be to follow the same procedure that was adopted\nin the case of each of the territories I have just\nmentioned, namely, dialogue, natural understanding and\nharking to the voice of wisdom by heeding the logic of\nour time and taking into account the interests of both\nparties.\n18\n\n\nWe believe that the Moroccan-Spanish group proposed\nby His Majesty King Hassan II to reflect and consult on\nthat question is the best framework within which it would\nbe possible to reach a settlement that may safeguard the\nsovereign rights of Morocco and, at the same time, allows\nSpain to protect its economic interests.\nWe are convinced that the historic ties of civilization\nbetween Morocco and Spain as well as our relations of\ngood-neighbourliness and our fruitful cooperation in several\nareas will make it possible to overcome the difficulties that\nlie in the way of the settlement of this dispute.\nThe freeing of relations between Morocco and Spain\nfrom the remnants of the past is a matter of significant\nimportance in view of the fact that both countries belong to\nthe Mediterranean region, that sensitive part of the world\nwhich should be a region of cooperation, stability and\nsolidarity.\nIn this context, we are convinced that the prosperity\nand security of Europe and particularly of its Mediterranean\ncountries could not be fully achieved without genuine\nefforts to contribute to the development of the southern\nMediterranean countries. We are also convinced that this\nwill be achieved only through the eradication of the existing\ngap between the countries of the two sides of the\nMediterranean and the establishment of a multifaceted\ncooperation that would be inspired by a comprehensive\nvision of the concept of cooperation and anchored in the\nwill of both sides to enter into a partnership that may\nprovide a solid foundation for the prosperity and stability of\nthe region.\nProceeding from this conviction, the Kingdom of\nMorocco proposed to the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe at its fourth session held in\nDecember 1993 in Rome, the convening of a ministerial\nmeeting to address the issues of security and cooperation in\nthe Mediterranean region in which all the Mediterranean\ncountries as well as all other countries interested in the\nfuture of that sensitive region would participate in order to\nconsult over the various issues and problems that face the\nregion. We do hope that the proposal will gain the support\nof the countries concerned.\nAlong with our brethren from the countries of the\nArab Maghreb, Morocco has made sustained efforts aimed\nat securing the unity of the region and ensuring the coming\nto being of the institutions of such unity.\nHowever, it is no secret to anyone that the\nachievement of the desired unity still faces certain\ndifficulties regardless of all that has been accomplished so\nfar at the institutional, structural and regulatory levels.\nNevertheless, it is the conviction of all concerned that the\nsetting up of that edifice will benefit all the people of the\nregion and will open up great vistas in the areas of\ndevelopment and progress.\nIt is obvious that the pace of progress towards the\nachievement of the desired objectives is rather slow at the\ntime. However, my country remains prompted by a\nsincere determination and by a firm will to overcome\nthose difficulties, in the conviction that its future and that\nof the countries of the region depend to a great extent on\nthe achievement of such unity and solidarity amongst\nthem. In all this, there is the awareness that the ties of\ncommon heritage, of common history, of culture, of\nlanguage and of religion bind all our peoples together.\nWith regard to the so-called question of Western\nSahara, the United Nations settlement plan has entered the\nfinal stage of implementation. The Kingdom of Morocco\nhas cooperated sincerely with the Secretary-General, as\nattested to in the Secretary-General\u2019s reports, with a view\nto facilitating his mission and speeding up the ongoing\nprocess. Therefore, we look forward with optimism to\nthe holding of the referendum within the next few\nmonths.\nThe past decade was one of the most disastrous for\nthe African continent in economic and in social terms.\nThe limited international effort provided to assist the\ncontinent has not yielded any improvement so far. As a\nmatter of fact, standards of living in many sub-Saharan\ncountries continue to worsen as the per capita income\ncontinues to decline while the growth rate of the gross\nnational product dropped to less than 1.5 per cent at a\ntime when the population grows at a much greater rate.\nThus the overall economic situation in Africa has\nfallen to a level below the one recorded in the seventies.\nBecause of such constant deterioration and the\nmarginalization from which Africa suffers, partial and\ntemporary solutions cannot satisfy us. Exceptional\ninternational efforts should be undertaken and drastic\nsolutions designed to remedy to the situation.\nOn the occasion of the holding of the historic\nmeeting of Marrakech, in the context of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Agreements,\nHis Majesty the King has called upon the leaders of the\n19\n\n\nworld to integrate the economy of Africa in the global\neconomy and urged the elaboration of a Marshall Plan with\na view to reducing poverty and alleviating the suffering of\nmillions of human beings in our continent.\nAs an African country, the Kingdom of Morocco\ncontinues to do its utmost in assisting sisterly countries in\nthe sub-Saharan region by all the means at its disposal. In\nfact, my country channels 90 per cent of the funds it\nallocates to international cooperation to the assistance of\nsisterly African countries.\nDuring the month of April 1994, the African scene\nwitnessed an important event, namely, the victory of\ndemocratic forces, the forces of peace and freedom, against\nthe forces of racial discrimination. Thus, South Africa\u2019s\nfirst free elections in which all segments of its people\nparticipated have resulted in the election of Mr. Nelson\nMandela to the presidency of the Republic.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco had earlier expressed its\nsatisfaction at those decisive developments, which ended a\nhalf-century-long conflict and allowed South Africa, a sister\ncountry, to usher in a new era of national harmony and\ndemocracy and give it reason to look forward to a\nprosperous future for all its people. My country made its\ncontribution by giving an impetus to the reconciliation\nprocess through meeting with and offering encouragement\nto Presidents Mandela and De Klerk, both known for their\nwisdom and clearsightedness.\nWe were one of the first countries to establish\ndiplomatic relations with the new South Africa - more than\ntwo years ago now - and we will make every effort to\nstrengthen the basis of our cooperation with that country,\nwhich, to our great satisfaction, has taken back its rightful\nplace within the United Nations. We have no doubt that\nSouth Africa will greatly and positively contribute to the\nenrichment and effectiveness of the work of our\nOrganization and to the well-being of the entire African\ncontinent.\nOne year after the signing in Washington of the\nDeclaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government\nArrangements in Gaza and Jericho, between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and Israel, we note today that the\npeace process in the Middle East is moving along at a\nsteady pace, thus giving rise to some optimism for the first\ntime in the last 50 years.\nIn spite of the hindrances and obstacles it faces from\ntime to time, this agreement is being effectively and\npractically implemented. We hope that this encouraging\nstart will continue and will include all the occupied\nPalestinian territory, and that it will result in the transfer\nof all powers to the Palestinian National Authority to\npave the way for a comprehensive solution that would\ngrant the totality of its legitimate rights to the Palestinian\npeople, including the creation of an independent State\nwith Al-Quds as its capital, in accordance with the United\nNations resolutions.\nIt was only natural that the Palestinian self-\ngovernment experience should face initial difficulties and\nexperience sensitive beginnings. We hope that the States\nmembers of the international community that have\nfollowed this issue for decades and that supported the\nstruggle of the Palestinian people throughout its different\nstages will not fail to grant all the necessary material aid\nand assistance to the Palestinian National Authority\nduring this delicate period, in order to help it build its\nnational institutions and its economic structures, and to\nensure the success of this experience.\nSimilarly, Jordan and Israel have signed an\nagreement recently in Washington. However, the advent\nof peace and security in that region will always depend\non the achievement of a comprehensive solution, which\nwould guarantee the recovery of Syrian and Lebanese\nterritories, in conformity with international legality and in\nparticular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973) and 425 (1978).\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, convinced of the virtues\nof dialogue and concerted action among the parties to the\nArab Israeli conflict, was one of the first to recommend\nand promote this approach as the ideal means for the\nsettlement of disputes. My country strongly believes that\nthe logic of war and violence does not lead to permanent\nsolutions. That is why we feel a great deal of satisfaction\ntoday as we see the parties in the Middle East engaging\nin a constructive dialogue to achieve an agreement that\nwould put paid to conflicts and tragedies and usher in a\nnew era of peace, cooperation and well-being in the\nregion\u2019s history.\nIn order to encourage peace efforts and to make the\nArab world benefit from their dividends, Morocco will\nhost next month, in Casablanca, an Economic Conference\nfor the Middle East and North Africa. Highly placed\ngovernment officials, and businessmen as well as\nfinancial and economic experts will participate in the\nConference. This gathering will aim at setting the rules\nfor boosting the economy and development in the two\n20\n\n\nregions, and at creating economic programmes based on\npartnership for the benefit of the countries of the two\nregions and their peoples.\nRegarding the dispute between Iran and the United\nArab Emirates, we hope that the two countries, which are\nmembers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\nwill resort to dialogue to resolve their dispute over the\nfuture of the islands of Abu Moussa and the Greater and\nthe Lesser Tumbs. The historic and friendly relations\nbetween the two peoples, which allowed them to coexist\nunder United Arab Emirates sovereignty on Abu Moussa\nisland, should enable them to return to normal relations.\nContemporary history has known few tragedies\ncomparable to the one being experienced by the people of\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who have been,\nand still are, subjected to all kinds of collective\npunishments, massacres, \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", displacement,\nconfiscation of property, destruction of places of worship\nand demolition of cultural monuments. The inability of the\ninternational community and of the United Nations in\nparticular to put an end to these outrageous criminal acts\nand their inability to uphold the principles of international\nlaw, which is violated daily by Serbian practices, is\nintolerable and unacceptable.\nOur Organization will celebrate next year its fiftieth\nanniversary. The period that has elapsed since its inception\nhas known many activities and accomplishments but also\nsome failures and setbacks. As regards its\naccomplishments, one should underline its sustained action\nto liberate peoples from the colonial yoke and to assist\nthem in obtaining their political independence, as well as\nits activities aiming at the settlement of many conflicts by\npeaceful means and the maintenance of international\npeace and security through, inter alia, peace-keeping\noperations. Its specialized institutions and agencies have\nalso made considerable contributions through their great\nefforts in social, health and cultural matters.\nHowever, our Organization has been unable to\naccomplish some tasks entrusted to it by the Charter. I\nrefer in particular to economic and development issues.\nNo large-scale action has been taken to help developing\ncountries in particular achieve economic development,\ndespite the efforts and the many meetings devoted to this\nquestion.\nThis fiftieth anniversary will take place in an\ninternational environment that is totally different from the\none that followed the Second World War. Our\nOrganization must adapt to this change by exploring the\nprospects of the twenty-first century, of which we are on\nthe threshold.\nTo this end, several ideas have been put forward\nwith the aim of strengthening our Organization, reforming\nits structures and affording it the means whereby it could\nmeet the new and increasing demands made upon it in\nmany areas. In short, the aim is to enable the\nOrganization to satisfy the current needs of the\ninternational community. The Secretary-General\u2019s report\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" appeared at the right moment to\nshow us the appropriate means by which the organs of the\nUnited Nations might serve international peace and\nsecurity. The report also introduced new ideas\nconcerning preventive diplomacy with the aim of\npreventing the eruption of new conflicts and dealt with\nthe issues of building and maintaining peace, as well as\nmany other issues, and put forth proposals which we are\nsure will improve the functioning of our Organization.\nThere is no doubt that the fiftieth anniversary\ncelebrations will be an opportunity for many world\nleaders and other high officials that are rich in experience\nto rethink the future of our Organization in order to\nenable it to meet the highest aspirations of mankind in the\ntwenty-first century: to live in peace and security, in\nsocial justice and human dignity.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the\noutset to congratulate the President of the General\nAssembly on his unanimous election. It is indeed a great\n21\n\n\nhonour for his country. I can assure him of my\ndelegation\u2019s willingness to assist him in his duties.\nLet me also congratulate His Excellency Ambassador\nSamuel Insanally of Guyana on the exemplary manner in\nwhich he carried out his duties. His innovative use of\nexpert hearings on the question of development were\nfollowed closely by the Marshall Islands delegation.\nMy compliments are also extended to our\ndistinguished Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, whom we thank for his tireless\nefforts on behalf of this Organization.\nOn a more sombre note, I wish to extend the\ncondolences of my Government, delegation and people to\nour neighbours in the Pacific, Papua New Guinea and\nJapan, which have both recently experienced devastating\nvolcanic eruptions. Our prayers go out to the peoples of\nboth countries in the hope that they will be able to make a\nspeedy recovery.\nFurther grim descriptions and graphic pictures of the\nterrible loss of life on the high seas in the sinking of the\n\\\"Estonia\\\" have been occupying the air waves and television\nscreen. We should like to express our deepest sympathy\nand condolences to the affected families and Governments\nover this tragic accident.\nWe now wish to join other delegations in welcoming\nSouth Africa to this Organization. The struggle of its\npeople with racial inequality resulting from apartheid was\nlong and difficult, often resulting in the loss of precious\nlives. We share their excitement in finally joining the\nconcert of nations.\nWe also wish to congratulate our neighbour the\nRepublic of Palau on attaining its independence on 1\nOctober this year.\nThe aftermath of the cold war has made it necessary\nfor the United Nations to take on many challenges. The\nOrganization itself has become involved in several\nambitious undertakings in innovative international relations\nand multilateral actions. We hope that these new\nendeavours of partnership will produce lasting solutions to\nmany of our global problems.\nThat very partnership is evident by the work being\nundertaken on the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change, which is viewed with great interest in\nthe Marshall Islands. Currently, we are working together\nwith the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), of\nwhich we are a founding member, in introducing a new\nprotocol to the Convention. We commend the Chairman\nof the Alliance of Small Island States for her coordinating\nwork in the International Negotiating Committee. In\naddition, we welcome the urgent call made by the\nGerman Foreign Minister for more immediate reductions\nin carbon dioxide emissions. The German Government\u2019s\nsupport for the AOSIS protocol is most gratifying. We\nhope that the Conference of the Parties will adopt the\nproposed protocol to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change on Greenhouse Gas\nEmission Reduction next year in Berlin.\nAs an island nation, the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands regarded the adoption by the General Assembly at\nits forty-eighth session, earlier this year, of the Agreement\nrelating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea as historic and\nof great importance. We view this Agreement as a\npositive step in bringing order to the exploitation of\nmarine resources. In this vein I am happy to announce\nthat we will sign that Agreement at this session. We are\nalso happy to note the imminent entry into force of the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, in\nNovember this year.\nIn the months leading up to the Barbados\nConference last April, we were very confident that at last\nthe international community would try to do something\npositive for the small island developing States, a group of\ncountries that we feel has been neglected. We are\npleased that we now have a Programme of Action, and\nwe will do our utmost to seek its successful\nimplementation to enhance our island economic\ndevelopment.\nAs a country with one of the highest population\ngrowth rates in the world, the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands has followed with great interest the International\nConference on Population and Development. It was a\nshame that this process was nearly derailed by semantic\ndisagreements. Fortunately, the Conference, in Cairo,\nafter arduous and intensive negotiations, saw fit to adopt\nan expanded international population strategy, as a result\nof which we now have a well-thought-out Plan of Action.\nIt is of concern to us that so much of the cost involved in\nthe implementation of the Plan of Action will be borne by\nindividual countries. We will, however, make every\neffort to maximize our participation in this Plan of\nAction.\n22\n\n\nThe United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks recently\ncompleted its third round of discussions here in New York.\nWe all owe a great deal to its distinguished Chairman for\nhis masterful stewardship. For the Marshall Islands, this\nConference is particularly important as we seek to build our\ncapacity to utilize our marine resources responsibly. Unlike\ndistant-water fishing nations, our geographical location\ncompels us to ensure the sustainable exploitation of our\nfisheries resources for future generations, whether within or\noutside our exclusive economic zone. This is a matter of\nsurvival, one that transcends economics.\nI submit, however, that large-scale commercial\nfisheries are a new concept for our people. That being so,\nwe are interested in modern methodologies for the\ncommercial exploitation of fisheries resources. We must\nfamiliarize ourselves with them. In this regard, the active\nassistance of the developed countries is needed to train our\npeople in the modern techniques of commercial fishing. In\nthis context, it is essential that we gain preferential access\nto international markets. We have brought this matter up\nmany times, and we urge the Assembly to promote trade as\nwell as training. While we are not asking for much, we do\nhope that assistance for self-help will continue to be\nforthcoming.\nThe development of human resources is probably the\nmost important factor in improving the economic situation\nin the Marshall Islands. We are grateful to New Zealand\nand to the current Chairman of the South Pacific Forum -\nAustralia - for their efforts in this field. We encourage\nothers to follow their example. Thus, together with other\nForum countries, we will aspire to develop a strategy that\nwill prepare the way for the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment.\nWe recognize that further improvement of our\nrelationships with the various United Nations agencies in\nour region is essential. Furthermore, because of their\nincreased responsibilities and workloads, we would\nencourage an increase in the number of representatives of\nthe United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme in the region, and we would also\nsupport an increase in their funding.\nI also wish to associate myself with my colleagues\nfrom the region regarding the application by the South\nPacific Forum for observer status at the United Nations. I\nurge the General Assembly to seriously consider this\nrequest, as it would be of great value to our region\ninasmuch as it would strengthen our ties to the United\nNations.\nOf equal importance is the World Conference on\nWomen in Beijing next year. As a matrilineal society, we\nhave long recognized the wisdom of including women in\nour decision-making process, and we look forward to\nparticipating in the Beijing Conference.\nDuring the World Hearings on Development earlier\nthis year, many of the expert witnesses spoke of the high\nproportion of United Nations expenditures earmarked for\npeace-keeping, much to the detriment of overall\ndevelopment efforts. This is a matter of ongoing concern\nto the Marshall Islands as well as to several other small\ncountries. We feel that the sheer number and cost of\nthese operations are getting out of hand. The preservation\nof global peace is of the utmost importance, but in\nrelative terms the costs that fall on smaller developing\nStates is very large. The Marshall Islands will actively\nparticipate in this matter in the Fifth Committee, and we\nhope to work together with others for a more equitable\napportionment of expenses and assessed contributions.\nWe are fully supportive of the views put forward by the\nPresident of Latvia regarding the concept of the \\\"capacity\nto pay\\\".\nThe people of the Marshall Islands regard with\nabhorrence the numerous human rights abuses that are\noccurring around the world. We shall be very vigilant in\nthe discussions following on the Vienna Declaration on\nthis matter. We believe there is no statute of limitations\nto human rights abuses, as clearly they are crimes against\nhumanity. The prevalent lack of common decency, which\nthe President of Bosnia and Herzegovina so painfully\ndescribed in his recent address, must be eradicated.\nWe note that His Excellency President Boris Yeltsin\nof the Russian Federation stated that the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations should also\ncommemorate the victims of the Second World War. My\ndelegation fully supports this concept, particularly since\nthe fate of many Pacific Island people during the Second\nWorld War remains an unwritten chapter in the history\nbooks. For example, the atrocities carried out against the\npeople of Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands have not been\nfully addressed. We trust that moral restitution will be\nmade to the memory of these victims.\nThe consequences of recent geo-political events have\namply demonstrated the need for the expansion of the\nSecurity Council. With 184 Members, the United Nations\nmust ensure that the Security Council reflects the realities\nof the changed situation. My delegation supports the\nproposal for increased membership. Moreover, there is an\nacute need for increased transparency in the work of the\nCouncil. In this context, it is appalling to note that the\nSecurity Council, whose decisions affect all Members, does\nnot involve more States in its decision-making process. As\na positive remedial solution, the suggestion by the Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs of New Zealand in this regard is of\ngreat significance and should be considered.\nI should like to remind the members of the General\nAssembly of the continued presence in the Marshall Islands\nof dangerous residual radioactive contaminants from United\nStates nuclear- weapons-testing programmes. Members will\nno doubt recall that it was during the relatively brief period\nof the United Nations-approved trusteeship that 67 atomic\nbombs were detonated on islands that had been inhabited\npeacefully and productively by the people of the Marshall\nIslands for centuries. This must be regarded as a matter of\nmore than historical interest, in view of the resulting legacy\nof horrific environmental degradation and tragic human\nsuffering - a legacy that threatens to haunt the Marshallese\npeople for centuries to come.\nDocuments recently declassified and released confirm\nthat the full extent of the radioactive contamination\nresulting from these tests was not disclosed to the Marshall\nIslands by the United States during the negotiation of the\nCompact of Free Association. Accordingly, neither the\ncompensation provided nor the remedial measures\nundertaken or contemplated for the clean-up of some of the\ncontaminated islands and the treatment of the affected\nhuman population can now be regarded as adequate.\nMy Government lacks the huge sums required to\nensure the proper clean-up and disposal of the radioactive\ncontaminants and the treatment of the radiation-induced\nillnesses and birth defects caused by the nuclear-weapons\ntests. Notably, the containment facility that was established\nfor the radioactive materials gathered from some\ncontaminated areas is wholly unsatisfactory by any\nreasonable environmental standard.\nWhat, then, is my Government to do? We may hope\nfor the unreserved cooperation of the former administering\nPower in fully cleaning up and disposing of its nuclear\nwaste and in adequately aiding our afflicted people.\nHowever, as a country that every day continues to suffer\nthe consequences of the failure by that Power to meet its\nobligations, we must look to such alternatives as we may\nfind. In short, we must do more than simply hope.\nIt is with this unhappy dilemma in mind that we ask\nthe General Assembly to consider sympathetically our\nefforts to attend to the restoration of our lands and the\ntreatment of our people. The clean-up and disposal of\nnuclear contamination in the Marshall Islands will require\nvery large sums of money indeed. The effective disposal\nof those contaminants will require their permanent\nisolation from the human biosphere. An international\nfacility on a remote, uninhabited atoll of the Marshall\nIslands for the safe, permanent disposal of nuclear\nmaterials would, if technically feasible and politically\nacceptable, meet these requirements. My Government\nwishes it to be understood that such a facility would also\nserve the global interest in securing the safe and\npermanent disposal of a portion of the world\u2019s dangerous\nnuclear materials, an interest that, at present, is by no\nmeans accommodated anywhere in the world.\nConsequently, my Government has resolved to conduct a\npreliminary feasibility study for such a facility and to\nconsult closely with interested members of the\ninternational community as we proceed.\nIn this regard, I wish to commend the remarks made\nby the Foreign Minister of Norway in calling on the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to convene an\ninternational conference on the management of nuclear\nwastes. We look forward with interest to such a\nconference, and we pledge our support.\nMy Government recognizes that the establishment of\na nuclear materials disposal facility in the Marshall\nIslands may upon detailed analysis be found to be\nunfeasible or otherwise unacceptable. In that event, my\nGovernment will look to the Members of this\nOrganization for their support in the effort to secure the\ncomplete removal from the Marshall Islands of all\nresidual radioactive contaminants and of the existing\nstorage facility. We expect that the party responsible for\nthe radioactive contamination of the Marshall Islands will\nprovide the funds and the technical means required to\neffect this removal promptly and completely, as well as\nto ensure the restoration of all the affected islands to their\nfull economic viability. We expect that this Organization,\nwhich placed our islands under trusteeship in the first\nplace, will ensure that justice prevails.\nAt this time, my Government requests the\nsympathetic support of the General Assembly as we\n24\n\n\ncontinue with the effort to secure a commitment to\nadequate treatment and full compensation of all the victims\nof the nuclear-weapons-testing programme. My\nGovernment attaches the utmost importance and immediate\nurgency to this matter.\nThe issues I have mentioned are of high priority. It is\nmy sincere hope that when we gather together next year,\nour efforts will indeed have yielded concrete results, visible\nand meaningful to our peoples. To accept anything less\nwould be a disappointment.\n"

        "file_text": "Canada is very pleased, Sir, that you have been elected to\nthe presidency of the Assembly, and it is certain that you\nwill, with tact and efficiency, assume the responsibility of\nguiding our work. You can count on our full cooperation.\nThe United Nations has always had a special place in\nCanada\u2019s foreign policy. As I address the Assembly for the\nfirst time as Minister of Foreign Affairs, I am reminded of\nsomething one of my illustrious predecessors, Lester B.\nPearson, said about the United Nations:\n\\\"We must cultivate international ideals, develop\ninternational policies, strengthen international\ninstitutions, above all the United Nations, so that\npeace and progress can be made secure.\\\"\nThe Government that I represent shares his broad and\nnoble vision of the role and place of the United Nations.\nIn order to face the challenges that await it at the dawn of\nthe twenty-first century, the international community needs,\nmore than ever, a strong, credible multilateral institution\nequipped with the tools needed to fulfil our expectations.\nThese challenges are the maintenance of peace and\ninternational security, as well as development, justice,\ndemocracy, human rights and the fight against inequalities.\nAt a time when we are preparing to celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, there is no more\nurgent task than the intensification of our efforts for\nreform in order to give our Organization the second wind\nit needs. Let us draw inspiration from the vision and\nenthusiasm of the people who drafted the Charter of the\nUnited Nations 50 years ago.\nThe extensive upheavals that have shaken our planet\nsince the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold\nwar can be symbolized in a few images. I am thinking of\nthe moving image of President Nelson Mandela taking the\noath of office as democratically elected President of South\nAfrica and the historic handshake between Prime Minister\nYitzhak Rabin and the Palestine Liberation Organization\nleader, Yasser Arafat. For their people and those in\nCambodia, El Salvador - and soon, perhaps, Mozambique\nand Angola - who have discovered the road to peace, with\nthe help of the United Nations, the future is filled with\nhope.\nThere is also hope in Haiti, where a courageous\npeople has been subjected for too long to oppression and\nabject poverty. We shall share their joy when they can\nfinally welcome to his native land President Aristide, a\nliving symbol of nascent democracy.\nBut there are also unbearable images of the victims\nin the market in Sarajevo and the flood of humanity\nfleeing the killings in Rwanda.\nThe international community cannot remain\nindifferent to conflicts that threaten the lives of millions\nof innocent people and expose them to the worst\nviolations of their most fundamental rights. Recent\nexperience has shown us that only a concerted and\ndetermined effort on the part of the international\ncommunity can solve these problems.\nIt is no easy task. Faced with the problems in\nBosnia, Somalia, Rwanda or even Haiti, some people will\nbe tempted to give up and wonder if the United Nations\nis wrong in trying to resolve essentially internal conflicts\nthat have numerous complex causes.\nCanada does not share this opinion. We think that,\ndespite these problems, the Security Council is on the\nright track, even though the steps it has taken have not\nalways proved capable of solving all the problems.\nConsistent with that belief, we have always made a\ntangible contribution to United Nations operations, as far\nas our circumstances permit.\n9\n\n\nThe Canadian contribution to peace-keeping operations\nin the territories of the former Yugoslavia totals more than\n2,000 soldiers and civilian police. The Canadian\nGovernment decided a few days ago to renew once more\nthe mandate of its troops for a six-month period. Canada\nhas always been convinced that there can be no military\nsolution to the Yugoslavian conflict. It is because we wish\nto give peace another chance that we have chosen to\nmaintain our contribution to the United Nations Protection\nForce.\nWe have also responded to the Secretary-General\u2019s\nappeal for help in the tragedy of Rwanda. For two months\nours was the only country providing an air bridge to Kigali.\nThere are 600 Canadian soldiers serving under the United\nNations flag, and many Canadian non-governmental\norganizations have mobilized to provide help to those in\ndistress.\nWe will also be in Haiti, with 600 soldiers and 100\npolice officers when the time comes to deploy the United\nNations peace-keeping force. Our participation is a logical\nsequel to our numerous efforts of the past three years to\nrestore the democratic process in this country, to which we\nare attached by language, geographical proximity and the\nmany personal ties between our peoples. The Haitian\npeople can count on Canada\u2019s lasting help as they rebuild\ntheir economy.\nWe are also contributing to the Middle East peace\nprocess. As the leader of the multilateral Working Group\non Refugees, we are tackling with determination that task\nentrusted to us by the international community. Our\nobjective is to contribute to the construction of a renewed\nregion where, 10 years hence, no one will consider himself\nor herself a refugee. We are also providing substantial\nfinancial assistance to the Palestinian people\u2019s\nreconstruction projects. We would favourably consider\nsending peace-keepers if the need should arise, thus\ncarrying on a lengthy tradition of Canadian participation in\npeace-keeping operations in the region.\n(spoke in English)\nThe economic and social problems facing the\ninternational community often receive less headline\nattention than the armed conflicts. However, they are every\nbit as urgent. Hundreds of millions of people around the\nworld continue to be condemned to a life of poverty. For\nwhole sectors of humanity, such basic needs as a proper\ndiet, drinking water, education and medical care are more\nof a dream than a reality.\nCertain parts of the developing world are currently\nexperiencing remarkable progress, while others,\nunfortunately - the African continent in particular - are\ncontinuing to struggle.\nIt is estimated that there are an unprecedented 19\nmillion refugees and displaced persons in the world. We\nare witnessing a massive movement of people that none\nof our societies is able to manage without the cooperation\nof the entire international community.\nThe recent Cairo Conference revealed the urgent\nneed for effective measures to cope with the problems of\npopulation and development, problems that cannot be\nresolved without giving full recognition to the essential\nroles of women.\nOur ability to translate into reality the concept of\nsustainable development will have a very direct impact on\nthe daily lives of our fellow citizens. The fishermen of\nNewfoundland and the Maritime Provinces of Canada are\nall too familiar with this problem. Their livelihood has\ndisappeared, through the plundering of fish stocks in\ninternational waters off our shores. This is why we\nbelieve an agreement must be reached without delay on\nfishing on the high seas.\nWe could easily add to the list of pressing problems\nthat I have just mentioned. And no one can challenge the\nfact that all of these problems - from peace-keeping to\ndevelopment, including the fight against AIDS, drug-\ntrafficking and the protection of human rights and the\nenvironment - require a determined, coordinated effort on\nthe part of the international community.\nA great deal has been done over the past few years\nto help our multilateral institutions to effectively face\nthese numerous challenges. However, much more needs\nto be done. Too often, the intervention of the United\nNations comes too late, is too slow and is carried out\nunder inadequate conditions.\nThe lack of political will on the part of Member\nStates cannot be blamed on the Secretary-General. On\nthe contrary, I would like to pay special tribute to the\nSecretary-General and his staff. They have done more\nand better than anyone should expect from an institution\ndeprived of the most elementary resources, lacking even\na solid financial foundation.\nWe must fully assume our responsibilities and give\nthe United Nations the tools required to fulfil its unique\n10\n\n\nmandate successfully. However, it seems that we are\nunable to take a second look at the habits of the past.\nWe invest too much energy in activities of marginal\nuse and in unimportant quarrels when there is an\nemergency right under our noses.\nWe waste valuable resources by allowing the\nnumerous institutions and agencies we have created over\nthe years to jealously protect their independence and resist\nchange when circumstances require a pooling of energies.\nAs a result of our extreme reticence to implement\nadministrative reforms, we are handicapping the only\ninstitution on which we can depend, when modern and\nflexible management methods would enable us to respond\nmuch more effectively to the needs of the moment.\nCanada believes that the reforms of the United Nations\nsystem must be deepened and accelerated. We must do\nmore and better with the resources at our disposal.\nEfforts should be concentrated on the following five\nmajor priorities, which I would like to bring to your\nattention.\nFirstly, we must strengthen the United Nations\nsystem\u2019s capacity for preventive action. The United\nNations already has a number of tools for detecting\npotential conflicts, and can use a variety of mechanisms to\ntry to eliminate problems before crises break out. Lack of\ninformation is not the problem; what we need is the ability\nto better analyse this information, to develop appropriate\nstrategies and above all to mobilize energy from all\ncomponents of the system.\nIn order to act rapidly, the United Nations must be\nable to count on qualified human resources, available on\nshort notice, to complement its own personnel. This is why\nCanada has prepared for the Secretary-General an inventory\nof resource persons suited to missions of good offices or\nspecializing in elections, human rights, the administration\nof justice and other such fields.\nAt its first summit in January 1992, the Security\nCouncil recognized that non-military sources of instability\nin the economic, social, humanitarian and ecological fields\nhave become threats to international peace and security.\nLet us recognize once and for all the need to expand the\ntraditional concept of security, and to mobilize all\ncomponents of the United Nations system to attack conflict\nat its very roots.\nWe also feel that the preventive capacity of the\nUnited Nations system will be strengthened if we make\nbetter use of the expertise of those who have direct\nknowledge of the field. The United Nations Economic\nand Social Council should periodically hold public\nhearings, similar to those held last June on the Agenda\nfor Development, with a view to assisting the United\nNations to better anticipate problems and to develop\nstrategies for attacking the economic and social causes of\nconflicts. The findings of its hearings could and should\nbe provided to the Security Council and the Secretary-\nGeneral so that they can develop appropriate preventive\nmeasures.\nAny strategy for preventing armed conflicts also\ninvolves pursuing tangible disarmament objectives.\nCanada has established two priority objectives for the\nnext few years: nuclear non-proliferation and the control\nof conventional arms.\nNuclear arms control and disarmament are under\nway: we are continuing negotiations on a comprehensive\ntest-ban treaty to ban nuclear testing for all time. Canada\nis working in the Conference on Disarmament to secure\na mandate for negotiations on a convention to prohibit the\nproduction of fissile material for weapons purposes.\nTogether, these treaties will have the effect of\nconstraining and preventing a future nuclear arms race.\nIn 1995 we will have to decide the fate of the\nworld\u2019s nuclear non-proliferation regime; the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is very\nimportant for Canada, and we believe that there is only\none option: that the NPT must be indefinitely extended.\nI urge all Governments to support this option, which will\nallow for the continuation of a crucial instrument in\npreventing the spread of nuclear-weapon technology and\nprovide new impetus to reduce existing stocks.\nWe must also recognize that, although the threat of\nnuclear weapons is of prime concern, the ongoing use of\nconventional weapons is an equally dangerous and very\nreal threat to peace and security.\nThe task of controlling conventional weapons is the\nresponsibility of every Government. Huge sums are\nbeing spent each year purchasing such weapons, often to\nthe detriment of services essential to the public, such as\neducation and health care. Those who are more\nconcerned about the size of their military arsenal than\nabout the welfare of their people should no longer expect\nto receive unconditional international aid.\n11\n\n\nThe recently established United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms is a start, and I urge Member States to\nmake information available to the Register as Canada has\ndone.\nMore can be done, however. For example, next year\nwe will be reviewing the Convention on certain\nconventional weapons that deals with land-mines. The\nabuse of land-mines is responsible for continued suffering\nand death of civilians long after the fighting has stopped.\nI welcome the proposal made by President Clinton on\nMonday to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of anti-\npersonnel land mines. He can count on the support and\nassistance of the Government of Canada on this useful idea.\nWe must strengthen the Convention by extending its scope\nto cover internal as well as international conflicts and by\ninsisting on effective verification measures to ensure\ncompliance. We will create a task force in Canada to\nconsider other initiatives that might be taken in the coming\nmonths, and I look forward to sharing ideas on this subject\nwith other ministers.\nSecondly, we must conduct an in-depth review of the\nUnited Nations economic and social activities. I think I\nspeak for most members of the Assembly when I express\nserious concerns regarding what can best be described as\nthe drift of the United Nations in the economic and social\nsectors. While the debate on the United Nations mandate\nin the areas of peace and security is lively and productive,\nit is unfortunately too often vague and directionless when\nwe tackle economic and social problems.\nWe are not saying that everything must be changed -\nfar from it. But certain reforms have already been\nintroduced; to mention but one, we welcome the decision\nto make the United Nations Development Programme\nAdministrator responsible for system-wide coordination.\nBut at a time when large sectors of international economic\nactivities are beyond the control of States, and when the\nresources devoted to development and international\ncooperation are subject to all manner of constraint in all of\nour countries, we must rethink the role and mandate of all\nour multilateral institutions, including those of Bretton\nWoods. These questions will be taken up at next year\u2019s\nGroup of Seven summit, to be held in Halifax, and should\nbe debated as widely as possible within other relevant\ninstitutions.\nCanada is ready to proceed with a comprehensive re-\nevaluation of its multilateral system as it applies to\neconomic and social issues. If necessary, the relevance of\ncertain institutions must be rethought, and a real solution\nmust be found to the problem of duplication.\nWe expect great things of the next chapter of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s Agenda for Development. We share\nto a great extent his visions of development, which\nencompass all facets of human activity, and particularly\nits social dimensions. Although the full importance of\nthese dimensions has finally been grasped, they are still\npoorly integrated in our development strategies. The time\nhas come to translate this vision into new operational\npriorities and to adapt our institutions and structures to it.\nThe Secretary-General should not hesitate to recommend\nradical reform if necessary. Together we can restore the\nrelevance and leadership of the United Nations system.\nWe must adapt it to the new realities of an ever-changing\nworld.\nThirdly, we must strengthen the rapid-intervention\ncapability of the United Nations. The implementation of\na number of the proposals advanced by the Secretary-\nGeneral in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" has enabled the United\nNations to make great strides in the area of peace-\nkeeping. Last April the Government of Canada took the\ninitiative of inviting the major troop-contributing countries\nto a meeting in Ottawa to discuss problems associated\nwith political direction, command and control and the\ntraining of peace-keeping- operations personnel.\nIn this regard, I am pleased to announce that Canada\nwill soon open a centre for peace-keeping research and\ntraining. The centre, to be located on the site of the\nformer military base in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, will be\nnamed after Lester B. Pearson, Canadian recipient of the\nNobel Peace Prize. I invite Member States to come and\njoin us so they can share our experience and help fine-\ntune our future approach.\nThe experience of the last few years leads us to\nbelieve that we need to explore even more innovative\noptions than those considered to date. Recent peace-\nkeeping missions have demonstrated the limitations of the\ntraditional approach. As we now fully realize, rapid\ndeployment of intervention forces is essential.\nIn the light of the prevailing situation, the\nGovernment of Canada has decided to conduct an in-\ndepth review of the short-, medium- and long-term\noptions available to us to strengthen the rapid-response\ncapability of the United Nations in times of crisis. From\namong these options, we feel that the time has come to\nstudy the possibility, over the long term, of creating a\n12\n\n\npermanent United Nations military force. We will ask the\nworld\u2019s leading experts for their input and will inform all\nMember States of the results of the study.\n(spoke in French)\nFourthly, we must improve the functioning of United\nNations decision-making bodies.\nThe Security Council currently bears enormous\nresponsibilities. Its decisions are binding on all Member\nStates and have a determining influence on millions of\npeople. It is essential that the Council be able to reflect as\naccurately as possible the wishes of the entire international\ncommunity. For this reason, it is imperative that the\ncomposition of the Council be reviewed. By making the\nCouncil more representative of today\u2019s world, we can\nenhance the legitimacy of its actions and facilitate their\nimplementation. Canada will continue to play an active\nrole in the negotiations launched during the last session of\nthe General Assembly, with a view to concluding an\nagreement as soon as possible.\nHowever, an expanded Council must not be seen as a\npanacea. As we have said on a number of occasions, the\nCouncil must make its working methods more transparent\nand become more receptive to the viewpoints of non-\nmember States with special concerns. More specifically,\nCanada has advocated closer dialogue between the Council\nand troop-contributing countries. The informal practices\ndeveloped in recent years are a good start, but in our view\nwe must look for practical ways to institutionalize them.\nWe ask the members of the Council to keep an open mind\nin this regard.\nFinally, we must put the United Nations on a sound\nfinancial footing.\nIt goes without saying that the United Nations can\nfulfil the mandates we give it only to the extent that\nMember States meet their financial obligations and\ncontribute generously to its voluntary funds. The sums in\nquestion are no doubt modest when compared with those\ninvested elsewhere, but they represent none the less a\nburden that is already significant and growing larger at a\ntime when many of our countries, Canada most definitely\nincluded, are going through a difficult period of budgetary\nadjustment.\nOur taxpayers do not question the need to contribute\nto the United Nations, but they are entitled to expect that\ntheir contributions will be spent judiciously. That is why\nwe attach such great importance to the need for sound\nmanagement of the system\u2019s resources. The recent\ncreation of the new position of inspector general should\nhelp tighten controls and improve administrative practices.\nThere is also a need to review budgetary procedures in\norder to make them more transparent and to simplify\nthose that govern peace-keeping operations.\nReviewing the scale of assessments is always a\nperilous undertaking, but I believe the need to do so has\nbecome urgent. The current system suffers from serious\ndistortions and no longer reflects properly Member States\u2019\nability to pay. We hope the General Assembly will make\nthis a priority issue at the current session.\nIn the final analysis, the future of the United Nations\ndepends on the willingness of its Member States to lend\nit political and practical support. This support depends in\nturn on the degree of support the Organization receives\nfrom our respective citizenries. It is not only Member\nStates\u2019 credibility that is at stake, but, even more\nimportant, that of the United Nations.\nGovernments must strive to work together and in\ncooperation with private enterprise and non-governmental\norganizations to define our new vision of the United\nNations for the next century. This is, in part, why the\nCanadian Government has provided support to the\nCanadian Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the\nUnited Nations. That Committee, which brings together\nleaders from all sectors, has prepared a remarkable\nprogramme of activities to commemorate the anniversary\neverywhere in our country. The emphasis is being placed\non youth education and the main subjects of the United\nNations agenda.\nNext year at this time, all eyes will be turned\ntowards the General Assembly. Let us make that\nanniversary the beginning of a new era for the United\nNations.\n"

        "file_text": "Please accept my most sincere congratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Let me also thank the outgoing President, Ambassador Insanally, who displayed exceptional diplomatic skills in managing the business of the General Assembly this past year.\nI wish to welcome the delegation of South Africa, which has joined us after an absence of many years. We have been following developments in that country with particular attention and are delighted with the remarkable progress it has chalked up. The restoration of South Africa's full membership further augments the universality of the United Nations, which is something we all favour.\nThe Czech Republic takes very seriously the responsibility it shares for the maintenance of international peace and security. This is reflected, on the one hand, in our participation in United Nations operations in the former Yugoslavia, Mozambique, Liberia and Iraq and, on the other hand, in our aspirations to become a member of Atlantic and European security organizations - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Western European Union. This is why we have also joined the Partnership for Peace, one of whose priorities is coordination and cooperation by its participants for peace-keeping missions. The Czech Republic is also participating as best it can in humanitarian assistance to stricken countries. We are fast approaching the time when we will be able to provide direct economic development assistance as well.\nThe active part the Czech Republic is trying to play in the Security Council stems from our belief that we were elected to serve: to serve not our particular interests, but certain fundamental principles, irrespective of where in the world they may be imperilled.\nThe Security Council has in recent months dealt with several truly extraordinary situations. Let me examine some of them.\nWith regard to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, reaching a political settlement is a key objective of world diplomacy. The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has been a critical element in managing this problem, and my country is proud of having a mechanized battalion integrated in this Force.\nBelgrade, in accepting the Contact Group plan, has taken a helpful step towards an overall solution of the area's problems. We also welcomed Belgrade's closing of the border with Pale. In response, the Security Council re- evaluated the extent of sanctions imposed on Belgrade, hoping that its change of attitude would turn out to be serious and lasting. We will, nevertheless, be carefully examining reports of international monitors on how strictly Belgrade keeps its international border with the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina sealed.\nThe mutual recognition of the States of the former Yugoslavia within their internationally recognized borders is the most important next possible step, one that is important for all countries of the region.\nWe are following closely the operations of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) forces and their cooperation with the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). The case of Georgia is viewed by some observers as paradigmatic: this was the first time that a peace-keeping operation - to wit, UNOMIG - included the forces of a Power of the region. It was also the first time the Security Council actually welcomed the use of a force dominated by such a Power - the CIS force - in solving a local conflict. According to this view, cooperation between UNOMIG and the CIS in Georgia might perhaps serve as a model for resolving certain other conflicts elsewhere in the CIS. The Czech Republic, however, strongly believes that each peace-keeping operation is sui generis. Each conflict is different, and each operation therefore has to be evaluated on its own merits.\nAfrica, the continent of the President of the General Assembly, has this year seen some of the greatest tragedies to befall mankind since the Second World War. The scope and ferocity of the genocide in Rwanda is hard to comprehend. It goes far beyond anything that can be considered a \\\"mere\\\" civil war, and we are hard pressed to find any parallel to it. We welcome the conciliatory attitude of the new Rwandan Government.\nThe multinational force in Haiti led by the United States has raised many hopes in the initial phase of its operations. Its difficult task will be to curb and, better yet, prevent violence in a society that has seldom known any other way of solving political differences.\nThe Middle East is, fortunately, moving towards peace, and we congratulate the leaders of Israel, Palestine, Jordan and others who have amply demonstrated that even the most intractable problems of the world can be solved.\nIn some circumstances the United Nations has played a gallant role in the region. The liberation of Kuwait was a case in point. Since the Gulf War, we have insisted that Iraq fulfil all of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. We have great appreciation for the work of the Special Commission (UNSCOM) and have taken serious note of a number of measures Iraq has undertaken to meet the demands of Security Council resolutions concerning weapons of mass destruction. We are still, however, looking for a declaration by appropriate Iraqi authorities recognizing the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait within its internationally respected borders.\nEven this review suggests that a large portion of the Security Council's agenda has to do with peace-keeping operations. Following the end of the cold war, their number increased dramatically, with skyrocketing costs. This could not of course continue unchecked. Exercising restraint in authorizing new peace-keeping operations is the first condition for putting the whole system on a sound footing. In peace-keeping, as in every other aspect of its operations, the United Nations must live within its means.\nThere are of course two financial flows that determine the means at the disposal of the United Nations. On the one hand there is the outflow: a function of how troubled our world is and of which of its troubles we choose to tackle. On the other hand there is the inflow: a function of equity in allocating the financial burden and of the discipline of Members in shouldering it.\nOnly a few operations come to mind as having been largely successful. Let us take a closer look at one of these - the United Nations Operation in Mozambique. In that operation we see the following success factors: a well- crafted peace plan; a realistic mandate for the United Nations force; the fact that the politicians concerned put the interests of their country above all else; the tenacity of United Nations personnel in carrying out their mandate, and the timing of the operation. One wonders whether, today, the necessary troops could even be assembled.\nBy contrast, a number of peace-keeping operations are facing difficulties. Angola's peace plan, for example, was probably not crafted quite well enough; post-election fighting is a consequence of the fact that the antagonists kept their armies intact. In Somalia, the factions do not seem to agree that there ever was a peace plan in the first place. This is perhaps the case in Liberia as well. In the former Yugoslavia, the strength of United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops is in many ways not commensurate with their mandate.\nWe must therefore draw the necessary lessons. It is very important to examine the key success factors of successful operations and to try to ensure that they are present in every peace-keeping operation. But the main lesson is this: the United Nations is not a panacea for all of the world's ills. The Security Council is often sought out by factions who cannot agree on anything among themselves. But we have to insist on one principle: in general, it is the people and the leaders of a country who themselves have to demonstrate a readiness to tackle their problems before the United Nations can come in and assist them.\nSo much, in general, about the outflow of resources. At the same time, the United Nations faces a terrible crisis of inflow.\nA radical reform of the existing system of financing is needed to overcome the crisis in the financing of peace-keeping. We strongly support the idea of replacing the existing arbitrary mechanism with a system based on standard, objective and quantifiable criteria. We also support the idea of establishing an independent body to study the principle of the capacity of countries to pay. This should become the fundamental criterion for determining the scale of assessments.\nThe Czech Republic meets its financial obligations towards the United Nations in full and on time. It has also covered an appropriate share of the obligations of the former Czechoslovakia. My country has not yet, however, been assessed for peace-keeping operations, pending determination of the group in which it should be placed. This matter should be settled in the context of agreement on objective criteria for making such determinations in general.\nThe increase in the number of peace-keeping operations has increased the dangers faced by their personnel. We therefore consider it particularly important to complete as soon as possible the work on a convention dealing with responsibility for attacks on United Nations and associated personnel. Last year we were acutely aware of the need for greater responsiveness on the part of the Security Council to United Nations personnel at large. This need continues, but some slight progress has been attained. Meetings of Security Council members with countries contributing troops to major peace-keeping operations have become more frequent, perhaps even routine.\nImproved cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations would no doubt improve the efficiency of both in dealing with international crises. We are particularly interested in further strengthening the cooperation on the part of the United Nations with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, but also its cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. That is why last January, during our Presidency of the Security Council, we suggested the possibility of a United Nations seminar with regional organizations. Understanding full well that they all have different charters, characters and qualities, we still feel that a continuing exchange of experience can enrich the entire international system of multilateral diplomacy. We commend the Secretary-General for organizing the first meeting along these lines earlier this year.\nThe future shape of the Security Council is one of the most important questions this General Assembly session will deal with. The effort exerted to date is reflected in the report of Ambassador Insanally, Chairman of the ad hoc Working Group. The basic role of the Security Council - maintenance of international peace and security - determines its unique position. There is no question about the need for it or about its impact on international affairs. This exceptional position of the Council should be maintained.\nEfforts to improve its functioning are thus informed by other considerations. It has to earn the greater confidence of Member States. Even after it is reformed, the Council will have to remain rather small to maintain its efficiency. If its work improves, that should not be because of increased size or expanded responsibilities but because of its enhanced authority. The countries that should be considered for new permanent membership are those that have the economic, political and military potential to contribute to the maintenance of global security, are prepared to assume the responsibilities implied by permanent membership, and are ready actively to participate in the implementation of Security Council decisions. The key factor, in our view, is the global influence of candidates. The principle of unanimity and its obverse - that is, veto power - expressed in 1945 the fundamental responsibility of the great Powers for maintaining world peace. Since the dissolution of the bipolar world, this responsibility has, if anything, further increased. We therefore favour maintaining the unanimity principle.\nWe are delighted that our last General Assembly session resulted in the creation of the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights and congratulate Ambassador Ayala Lasso on his appointment. Even during his very first few months in office, he has demonstrated its usefulness. We have no doubt that this Assembly will follow through with the implementation of additional recommendations of the 1993 Vienna International Conference on Human Rights.\nThe danger of nuclear proliferation has not disappeared. Ongoing discussions with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are one example that proves this point. We support an indefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and we will advocate this position at the fifth Review Conference of that Treaty next year. We support an increased role for the International Atomic Energy Agency in verifying how the Treaty is being adhered to.\nWe favour accelerating work on the comprehensive test-ban treaty. We share the view that the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons and of nuclear explosive devices should be banned. We support maintaining a moratorium on nuclear tests and an agreement on banning all such tests, as well as further negotiations on limiting nuclear arsenals and on the measures necessary to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear material.\nOurs is a small world full of problems, with almost 50 years of global peace but replete with local wars; abundance side by side with poverty; success in South Africa, progress in the Middle East, but a Bosnia and a Rwanda torn asunder. All this, and much more, is characteristic of today's world and is reflected in today's United Nations. Our fervent hope is that when the leaders of the world meet here next year, they will be celebrating 50 years of an Organization that will have become even more successful in a world that will be much closer to overall peace, prosperity and democracy.\n"

        "file_text": "I\nshould like to convey to you, Sir, my warmest\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of this\nAssembly and to wish you great success in the performance\nof your duties. With your election, the members of the\nGeneral Assembly recognize in your country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\nthe decisive contribution of Africa to the work of the\nOrganization. I am confident that the General Assembly\nwill follow the course of consensus that was set in the\nprevious session, under the leadership of Ambassador\nInsanally, to whom I should like to pay a warm tribute.\nMoreover, I wish to once again assure Mr.\nBoutros-Ghali, who honoured us last April with his official\nvisit to my country, of the full cooperation of the Spanish\nauthorities in assisting him in the difficult task he faces of\nmeeting the increasingly complex challenges with which\nour Organization is faced.\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Federal\nRepublic of Germany, in his address on behalf of the\nEuropean Union, has set forth our common points of view\nin this general debate. These reflect the advances made on\nthe path to a common foreign and security policy, which is\na major goal of the Union. On behalf of my delegation, I\nwish now to consider some issues in more detail.\nThe fundamental changes in the international system\nthat we have witnessed in recent years have provided the\nUnited Nations with the great opportunity finally to\nestablish itself as the venue for the universal harmonization\nof the efforts of the international community to fulfil the\ncommon purposes contained in its Charter. However,\nthey have also confronted the Organization with one of\nthe greatest challenges in its history. Some have even\ncast doubt on the actual ability of the United Nations to\ncontribute effectively to the solution of the many conflicts\nthat have arisen or have been rekindled over the past few\nyears.\nAfter the first shock, provoked by crises such as\nthose in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and Angola, we\nhave been confronted with appalling situations such as\nthat in Rwanda, where the Organization\u2019s limited means\nhave unfortunately proved insufficient to redress the\nplight of millions of human beings.\nAt the same time, the United Nations, with its\nresources stretched to the limit, is undergoing a financial\ncrisis which can be addressed only with the resolute\ncooperation of the Member States. This should entail,\nfirst of all, the timely payment of their financial\ncontributions, an obligation specified in the Charter. Only\nthen will the Organization have the necessary means to\nachieve its objectives. Moreover, these means must be\nused in the most effective possible way.\nBeyond the efforts for renewal already achieved or\nin progress, we must undertake a process of careful\nconsideration at the highest level, with a view to deciding\nwhether we are willing to provide the Organization with\nthe legal, material and financial instruments it needs to\nmeet successfully the growing demands made on it by the\ninternational community. The credibility of the United\nNations is at stake.\nThe reform of the Security Council is an extremely\nimportant and complex matter, which will have to be\naccomplished through a careful process of dialogue\nleading to an understanding among all Member States.\nSpain, which in the last two years has been a\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council, reiterates\nits position in favour of a revision, without undue haste,\nof the composition and functioning of the Security\nCouncil, based on the criteria of representativity,\nefficiency and transparency, with the ultimate goal of\nreinforcing the legitimacy of the actions of the Council.\nSpain, which has taken and will continue to take an\nactive part in the meetings of the Ad Hoc Working Group\nof this Assembly, favours a moderate increase of the\nCouncil\u2019s membership. This would allow for a more\nfrequent presence in the Council of States with specific\n13\n\n\nweight and influence in international relations, and which\nare, likewise, able and willing to contribute in a significant\nway to the maintenance of international peace and security\nand to fulfil the other purposes of the United Nations. The\nenlarged composition of the Council will also facilitate\nequitable geographical distribution among the different\nregions of the world.\nFrightening events, such as those in Rwanda, make it\nmore necessary than ever to continue the strengthening of\nthe indispensable machinery for action required to execute\nthe increasingly broad and complex mandates given by the\nSecurity Council to peace-keeping operations.\nFirst of all, we must further improve the management\nand control mechanisms here in New York. The Secretariat\nhas already made a major effort to strengthen the\nDepartment of Peace-keeping Operations by adding a\nSituation Centre, enlarging the Office of the Military\nAdviser and giving a boost to the planning unit.\nSecondly, in order to speed up the effective launching\nof operations, the provisions relating to standby\narrangements for peace-keeping should come into effect.\nSpain is prepared to participate in this mechanism, which\nshould be broadened to include the police components of\npeace operations, as well as transport-related equipment and\nlogistics in general.\nThirdly, it is important to face the issues relating to\nthe safety of the personnel of the peace-keeping operations.\nMany casualties have been suffered by United Nations\nforces and humanitarian-assistance personnel, among them\nSpanish nationals who gave their lives in the quest for\npeace.\nThe setting up of an Ad Hoc Committee on the safety\nand security of United Nations and associated personnel, in\nparticular those involved in peace-keeping operations, has\nbeen a step in the right direction, and we hope that the draft\ninternational convention on this matter will be adopted.\nNotwithstanding the continuous efforts of the\ninternational community and of many of the political forces\nin the area, peace has not yet arrived in the Balkans. It is\ntrue that developments have occurred that give us cause for\nhope. We have witnessed a new international cohesiveness,\nwhich we must preserve at all costs. A rapprochement has\ntaken place between the Croat and Muslim communities,\nwhich has led to the agreements reached on federation. I\nam pleased to underscore the important role that the\nEuropean Union is playing in the town of Mostar as a\ncontribution to this process. Spain is actively\nparticipating in this effort; this is the area in which the\nSpanish contingent in the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR) is carrying out its mission.\nWe welcome the establishment of the International\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia.\nWe trust that the experience gained by this ad hoc\ntribunal will serve as an incentive to the General\nAssembly to give favourable consideration to the\nproposed statute of an international criminal court, a\npermanent body with universal jurisdiction, which was\ndrafted by the International Law Commission, and that\nthis idea - which is not new - will come to fruition very\nsoon.\nSpain welcomes the process of political and\neconomic transition in which the countries of Central and\nEastern Europe are currently involved. Their future\naccession to the European Union and their progressive\nintegration in the security mechanisms of the continent\nwill contribute to the stability of Europe.\nWe are also witnessing important moves towards\ndemocracy and a free-market economy in the Russian\nFederation and in the other States that emerged from the\nformer Soviet Union. Spain supports these changes, as\ntheir success will contribute not only to strengthening\nsecurity in Europe but to world peace as well.\nThe community of Ibero-American nations has\nendowed itself with a political forum of considerable\nimportance; this year, in Cartagena, Colombia, it once\nagain voiced satisfaction at the progress made on the path\nto democracy and economic modernization.\nWherever internal armed conflicts are still active, as\nin Guatemala, we are witnessing a negotiation process\npromoted by and under the auspices of the United\nNations, with the assistance of the \\\"Group of Friends\\\".\nBoth the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad\nrevolucionaria nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) are fully\nengaged in this process, with the ultimate goal of\nachieving national reconciliation and full respect for\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThe delicate situation in Cuba calls for an additional\neffort to promote dialogue and cooperation to make\npossible the final incorporation of both the Government\nand the people of Cuba into the democratic current that is\n14\n\n\nflowing through the continent at the present time. Dialogue\nis essential. Inventive solutions among Cubans, without\nexcluding anyone, should be encouraged, with a view to\nopening up new democratic possibilities leading to a\npeaceful transition, with due respect for human rights,\nnational sovereignty and fundamental freedoms. The\nGovernment of Spain, which remains opposed to the\nembargo that has been imposed, notes with satisfaction the\ntalks taking place between Washington and Havana, where\nthese issues can be addressed.\nThe Government of Spain is attentively following the\nsituation in Haiti, with a view to the full implementation of\nSecurity Council resolutions 917 (1994) and 940 (1994),\nwhich will involve the return of the President legitimately\nelected by the Haitian people. The international community\nwill have to concentrate its efforts on the reconstruction of\nthe country, so that democracy may rest on solid\nfoundations guaranteeing constitutional rule of law and\nrespect for human rights.\nSpain attaches particular importance to the\nestablishment of a new process of dialogue and cooperation\nin the Mediterranean that will make it possible to tackle the\neconomic, demographic and cultural differences existing in\nthe region, and to bring peace and prosperity to the\nMediterranean area.\nMy country has special ties of friendship and\ncooperation with the Maghreb countries and is striving to\nmake a practical contribution to overcoming the problems\nexisting in this area, to which Spain attaches great priority.\nThe Spanish Government considers that the solution to\nthe problem of the Western Sahara lies in the holding of a\nreferendum on self-determination with all appropriate\ninternational guarantees. My Government again expresses\nits support for the Secretary-General and his Special\nRepresentative in their efforts to ensure progress in\nimplementing the settlement plan accepted by the parties\nand, in accordance with the relevant Security Council\nresolutions, creating the necessary conditions for the\nforthcoming holding of the referendum to which I have\nreferred.\nThe Spanish Government has expressed on many\noccasions, its profound satisfaction at the progress achieved\nin the Middle East peace process, which started at the\nMadrid Conference. Thanks to the determination and\ncourage of the interested parties, 1994 has been a year of\nsignificant achievements on the path to peace and\nunderstanding. Spain has always supported the need for a\nlasting and comprehensive peace, in conformity with\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nSpain urges the parties and all the States in the region, on\nthe basis of their clear and unanimous rejection of\nviolence and the use of force, to coordinate all efforts\nnecessary to attain the desired goals of peace and\ndevelopment.\nThis year, we have witnessed events of remarkable\nimportance in sub-Saharan Africa. Some have struck a\nmarkedly hopeful note, whereas others - such as the\ntragedy of Rwanda and the difficulties in the peace\nprocess in Somalia - have demonstrated the fragility of\nthe continent\u2019s structures.\nRwanda has appalled us. We have witnessed the\nhorrors of civil war with a feeling of bitterness and even\nof impotence. Despite the efforts of the international\ncommunity, in which my country is actively participating,\nno solution is yet in sight to this crisis or to the problem\nposed by the millions of displaced people and refugees -\na problem which, moreover, is having serious\nrepercussions on the stability of the neighbouring\ncountries.\nThose responsible for the atrocities, including\ngenocide, committed in Rwanda must be brought to\njustice individually. Hence, Spain supports the work of\nthe Commission of Experts established under Security\nCouncil resolution 935 (1994), which we actively\npromoted and co-sponsored, as well as the work of the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special\nRapporteur for Rwanda. These events are extremely\nserious and we must make an urgent legal response to\nthem through the establishment of an ad hoc jurisdiction\nfor Rwanda, following the model already provided by the\nTribunal established to deal with the former Yugoslavia.\nSouth Africa has been the other side of the coin.\nWe are gratified at its return to the General Assembly as\na full-fledged Member of the United Nations, now that\nthe apartheid system has been abolished and a democratic\nand non-racial Government has been installed.\nIn southern Africa, likewise, we are following with\nthe greatest interest, because of their importance, the\nprocesses aimed at peace in Angola and Mozambique.\nWe hope that the Angolan Government and UNITA will\nshortly conclude a lasting peace agreement that will put\nan end to decades of suffering. We hope that in\nMozambique the coming elections will consolidate\nnational reconciliation. Spain will contribute to the\n15\n\n\npeaceful and democratic holding of these elections by\nsending observers.\nThe decolonization of Gibraltar is a priority goal of\nthe Spanish Government. The General Assembly has\nclearly established the doctrine that the decolonization of\nGibraltar is a case not of self-determination but of the\nrestoration of Spain\u2019s territorial integrity. I wish here to\nreiterate the Spanish Government\u2019s firm resolve to continue\nthe process of negotiation with the Government of the\nUnited Kingdom, in a constructive spirit and on the bases\nof the Declaration of Brussels of 27 November 1984, taking\nduly into account the legitimate interests of the population.\nThe Government of Spain expresses its profound hope that\nthese negotiations will put an end to this colonial\nanachronism.\nDisarmament and arms control are fundamental factors\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\nAccordingly, during this year Spain has adopted a unilateral\nmoratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines, has\nratified the 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions\non the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May\nBe Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have\nIndiscriminate Effects and was among the first States to\nratify the chemical weapons Convention. We also support\nthe unconditional and indefinite extension of the non-\nproliferation Treaty and the early conclusion of a nuclear\ntest-ban treaty.\nMoreover, Spain hopes that a final decision on the\nenlargement of the membership of the Conference on\nDisarmament will be adopted shortly, thereby allowing for\nthe full participation of countries which, like Spain, have\ndemonstrated for many years their full commitment to the\nwork of the Conference.\nThe close relationship between peace and development\nis especially well reflected in the report on agenda for\ndevelopment submitted last May by the Secretary-General.\nI wish to state my satisfaction at the publication of this\nreport. We share the approach presented by the\nSecretary-General, which is based on the principle that\ndevelopment is a fundamental right and the strongest\nfoundation for peace. We welcome the idea of defining the\nfive principal dimensions of development that are set forth\nin the agenda - that is, peace as the basic foundation, the\neconomy as the engine of progress, the environment as a\nbasis for sustainability, justice as a pillar of society, and\ndemocracy as a guarantor of good governance.\nWe must now determine what actions are required in\norder to implement the agenda and formulate specific\nrecommendations on the assumption that development\ncannot be reduced to a simple economic dimension, but\nmust, rather, be considered from its political, cultural,\nenvironmental, social and humanitarian angles. Only by\nmeans of this comprehensive approach will we be able to\ntackle the deep inequalities and serious problems affecting\ndeveloping countries.\nFurthermore, the financial resources devoted to this\nend should be used in a more rational and efficient way.\nTo achieve this, we must continue to restructure the\neconomic and social sectors of the Organization and of\nthe United Nations system, particularly by strengthening\neven further the coordinating role of the Economic and\nSocial Council.\nIn activities to promote development the protection\nof the environment should always be taken into account.\nStarting next year, Spain will participate in the work of\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development, which at its\nlast session dealt for the first time with the\nimplementation of \\\"Agenda 21\\\" and of other agreements\nreached at the Rio Summit.\nThe global conferences convened by the United\nNations play an outstanding role in the search for\nuniversal consensus on development. The Programme of\nAction adopted in Cairo by the International Conference\non Population and Development will pave the way for a\nnew demographic policy, and places women at the axis of\nevery population policy. The key role played by women\nin development will also be highlighted during the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing in\nSeptember 1995.\nThe World Summit for Social Development, which\nwill be convened in Copenhagen in March 1995, must,\nlikewise, direct us to a new way of facing social problems\nin the world, based on the principle that human beings\nshould be the core and ultimate goal of development.\nNobody can doubt the importance of the protection,\npromotion and defence of human rights as fundamental\ntasks of both Member States and the United Nations.\nIntolerance, inequalities of all kinds and violations of\nfundamental rights still endanger the lives, the freedom\nand the safety of millions of human beings. In order to\neradicate these evils, we must honour the commitments\nundertaken during the Vienna World Conference on\nHuman Rights and redouble our efforts to put into\n16\n\n\npractice principles that, although universally acknowledged,\nare not universally observed.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights, the office which was created by this Assembly last\nyear, and whose first incumbent is Ambassador Ayala\nLasso, must be able to perform his duties properly. To this\nend, it is essential to ensure that he has the adequate\nbudgetary means and sufficient personnel, as well as the\nsupport and cooperation of all Member States. Such\npersonnel and additional means should also be made\navailable to the Centre for Human Rights.\nIn 1995 we shall commemorate the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations. This will be an opportunity to\nreflect both on the Organization\u2019s accomplishments - which\nare not negligible - and on the challenges it will face. We\nlive in an increasingly complex and dynamic international\nsociety, in which it is no longer possible totally to separate\nnational issues from international ones, nor to divide the\ntasks of the Organization into watertight compartments.\nMankind\u2019s full development will be achieved only when its\nmultiple aspects, which are complementary and\ninterdependent, are taken into account. The path to a better\nworld, in which the United Nations continues to play a\nfundamental role, must be taken together by all the peoples\nof the world, as we are reminded by the motto of the\nfiftieth-anniversary commemoration. That is also the firm\nconviction of the Government and the people of Spain.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I should like to extend to you, Sir,\non behalf of my delegation, my warmest congratulations\non your well-deserved election to the presidency of the\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\nWe are convinced that your outstanding skills and\nyour vast experience will guarantee the success of this\nsession. Your country, the sister republic of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, has always played an effective and moderating\nrole in the search for peace in Africa and throughout the\nworld.\nI should like also to express my most sincere\ncongratulations to your predecessor, Ambassador Samuel\nInsanally of Guyana, for the competence and skill with\nwhich he led the work of the previous session.\nI should like also to express, on behalf of the\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania, our admiration of and\nsupport for the unremitting efforts of Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\naimed at enabling our Organization to achieve its goals.\nOur current session takes place at a time when the\ninternational community is faced with numerous\nchallenges. These include a constant deterioration in the\nterms of trade, the growing disparity between rich and\npoor countries, and an increase in hotbeds of tension. In\naddition, many people in the poor countries are being\ncrushed under a debt burden that is constantly getting\nheavier, with, as a consequence, gloomy prospects for the\nsocio-economic development of the peoples of those\ncountries.\nInstead of the hoped-for prosperity, what we are\nwitnessing today are bloody conflicts which are ravaging\n29\n\n\nentire countries with all their attendant miseries and forms\nof destruction. Such nefarious developments not only\nundermine all the hard-won achievements of the people of\nthose countries, but also afflict them with new types of\nsuffering and make them lose any hope they may have had\nin enjoying a life of dignity, stability and progress.\nThe international economic situation continues to be\ncause for concern for a large number of developing\ncountries that feel the negative impacts of structural\nadjustment programmes, which focus on macroeconomic\nequilibriums and display a marked degree of such\nindifference to the social cost of such adjustments.\nIt should be emphasized that of the 55 countries which\nhave implemented those programmes during the 1980-1989\nperiod, only 7 have been able to improve their economic\nsituation. During that same decade, a downward trend in\nper capita income was noted in 29 countries, while in 13\nother countries there has been a real deterioration of social\nconditions.\nThese crisis elements have been compounded by\nstagnation and the reduction in public development\nassistance, despite the fact that the .7 per cent objective was\nsupposed to contribute to the creation of better conditions.\nIt is regrettable to note that the deterioration in the\neconomic situation is of such a nature that it may well have\na negative effect on the implementation of international\nconventions and programmes, notably those which relate to\nthe environment, the programme of action for children, and\nthe programme of action for the advancement and\nprotection of human rights. Furthermore such deterioration\nwill have an adverse effect on the chances for the success\nof other ongoing negotiations which aim at finding\nsolutions to problems that threaten the prosperity of\nhumankind as a whole.\nAs a matter of fact, the negative effects of the\neconomic crisis are too numerous to enumerate and\nunfortunately, it is the most vulnerable sectors of society,\nsuch as women, children and the poor that bear the full\nbrunt of the situation. If in our time unemployment and a\nhigh crime rate are widespread phenomena, countries with\nlimited resources are apt to be more exposed to their effects\nthan others. The need to devise a preventive approach\nwhich would make it possible to face up to these social ills\nis thus becoming all the more urgent.\nIn this regard, we welcome the forthcoming World\nSummit for Social Development, in Copenhagen, and hope\nthe summit will result in initiatives that will enable\ndeveloping countries to make significant advances in their\ndevelopment.\nIt has become quite clear that development is the\nreal guarantor of world peace and that the miserable\nliving conditions of the overwhelming majority of the\ninhabitants of our planet make it impossible to achieve\npeace and stability in our world.\nThus we place a great deal of hope in the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposed Agenda for Development. Such a\ndocument would deserve our appreciation and should\nobtain widespread support in order for it to become a true\ntool in promoting economic and social development\neverywhere.\nThe fragility of the world economic situation should\nnot obscure the successes achieved in several areas of\ninternational relations.\nIn this context, we welcome the success of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s consultations which aimed at\nresolving the problems posed to certain countries by\nChapter XI of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea, whose coming into force as of 16\nNovember 1994, will mark the beginning of a decisive\nphase in its evolution.\nOur country considers that the United Nations\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\nMigratory Fish Stocks should lead to strict and global\nresolutions that would put an end to the plundering of\nfishing resources as well as to the anarchy that currently\nprevails in the seas.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania has, along with\ncountries threatened by the phenomenon of desertification,\nmade major efforts to conclude a world convention to\nfight drought and desertification, especially in Africa.\nWhile we welcome the positive outcome of those\nnegotiations, we do express the hope that the convention\nwill be the start of positive action on the part of the\ninternational community in favour of those countries\nwhich have suffered the most.\nAll the results achieved thanks to the efforts of the\nUnited Nations highlight the focal and vital role with\nwhich our Organization is entrusted and attest to its\nuniversality.\n30\n\n\nThere is no doubt, however, that a reform of the\nstructures and procedures of the Organization is now\nnecessary. The decisions already taken to revitalize the\nEconomic and Social Council will be no more than a dead\nletter so long as they are not accompanied by the allocation\nof resources that would make it possible to implement the\ndevelopment programmes.\nWe should always bear in mind the fact that all\nconflicts and all the resultant peace-keeping operations,\nwhich mobilize such vast financial resources, have as their\nmain cause the deterioration of the economic and social\nconditions of the countries concerned.\nA rapid overview of our globe and the areas of tension\nis enough to prove that underdevelopment and the problems\nit causes only fuel such tensions.\nAdvances in the area of democracy and human rights\nare, to be sure, the most important achievements the\ninternational community has seen in recent times.\nWhile we commend the progress achieved in these two\nareas, we must not lose sight of the fact that democracy\ncannot be confined to the national frameworks of individual\nStates, but should embrace also international relations\namong nations.\nThis is the reason why we support efforts to expand\nrepresentation within the Security Council by increasing its\nmembership. We hope that such reform will take place in\nline with the tenets of democratic transparency.\nWhatever the final formula adopted for the new\nconfiguration of the Security Council might be, we believe\nit will be necessary to respect the principle of the co-\nequality of Member States, and the fact that, according to\nArticle 24 of the Charter, the Security Council acts on\nbehalf of those Member States, and must, therefore, reflect\nthe views and aspirations of the international community in\nits entirety.\nThe democratic process which was launched in 1986\nin the Islamic Republic of Mauritania through the\nestablishment of democratic institutions and the\norganization of presidential and parliamentary elections in\n1992, has been consolidated further with the organization\nof elections for municipal councils and for one third of the\nsenate seats. Those elections, which have elicited extensive\nparticipation on the part of voters, have been covered\nextensively by the independent national press, following\nelectoral campaigns by several political parties which\nrepresent various trends of opinion.\nThus the Mauritanian people are daily consolidating\nthe foundations of their young democracy, which in the\nwords of the President of the Republic, His Excellency\nMr. Maaouya Ould Sid\u2019Ahmed Taya, is the mainspring\n\\\"of all sovereignty and legality\\\".\nIt is in this democratic environment that the\nMauritanian people are waging a determined struggle\nagainst various aspects of economic and social\nunderdevelopment.\nWe should highlight the important gains made by\nour country through the implementation, in 1984, of a\nseries of economic reforms, as well as the political\nstability, freedom, justice and equality now enjoyed by all\nMauritanian citizens.\nWe should also voice the pride of the Islamic\nRepublic of Mauritania at being one of the few\ndeveloping countries where there have been no political\nprisoners, and where freedom of the press, a multi-party\nsystem, and freedom of trade unions have become\nrealities similar to those which States that value the rule\nof law, such as the countries with longstanding\ndemocratic traditions, pride themselves on.\nThe quest for peace will continue to be our main\nconcern so that we may rise to the challenges of the end\nof this century. The end of the cold war has opened up\nnew vistas for the emergence of a better world where\njustice and peace may prevail. Yet the increasing number\nof hotbeds of tension which require the organization of\npeace-keeping operations leads us to believe that a new\nstyle of diplomacy is becoming a must if we are to\nprevent the recurrence of human tragedies similar to those\nwhich were witnessed in the past or those which we now\nexperience and are unable to stop or to resolve.\nOur country hopes that the recent developments\nwhich have been taking place in the Middle East will\nconstitute the beginnings of a solution to the tragedy of\nthe Palestinian people and that, at last, they will be able\nto exercise their legitimate right to establish an\nindependent State. We believe that the Declaration of\nPrinciples of 13 September 1993, giving autonomy to\nGaza - which was followed up by the Cairo agreement of\n4 May 1994 and most recently, on 25 July 1994, the\nmeeting between His Majesty King Hussein of Jordan and\nIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin - will usher in a\n31\n\n\nnew era. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania hopes this\ninitial success will lead to a just, comprehensive and lasting\npeace based on the implementation of Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nThe United Nations should continue to support peace\nefforts in the Middle East until such time as a final\nsettlement of the problems still pending in the region is\nreached. In this connection, we hope the commitment\nundertaken by donors at their meeting on 1 October 1993\nwill be translated into concrete action that would revitalize\nthe economy of Palestine and help solve its economic and\nsocial problems.\nIn that sensitive region, the after-effects of the Gulf\nwar continue to make themselves felt. The Islamic\nRepublic of Mauritania, which has always affirmed its\nunswerving support for international legality, has made\nclear its total rejection of any violation of fraternal\nKuwait\u2019s independence or territorial integrity or of the\nrights of its citizens, just as it stands against anything that\nmight undermine Iraq\u2019s unity or territorial integrity. The\ntime has come to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi\npeople.\nIn the same sensitive region, my country wishes to\nrenew its unflagging and total support for the recovery by\nthe fraternal State of the United Arab Emirates of its\nlegitimate rights over the islands of Lesser Tumb, Greater\nTumb and Abu Moussa.\nWith regard to the Arab Maghreb, we still hope the\nUnited Nations will be able to eliminate the obstacles which\ncontinue to impede the resolution to the Sahara problem.\nMy country will spare no effort in helping the Organization\nin the implementation of resolutions relevant to this issue.\nOur determination stems from our desire to reach a just and\nlasting solution and to strengthen the process of building a\nunited Arab Maghreb.\nWe also hope the embargo imposed on the Libyan\npeople will be lifted. We are aware that the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya has shown tangible proof of its readiness to\ncooperate with the United Nations and other groups and\nthat the embargo is affecting the interests of all other\npeoples in the Maghreb.\nWith regard to Africa, I should like to express my\ncountry\u2019s satisfaction with the peace-keeping operations\napproved by the United Nations with the aim of putting an\nend to the bloody confrontations in parts of that continent.\nThe Rwandan tragedy, marked by the death of half a\nmillion people in the space of a few weeks, is one of the\nmost horrible ordeals of our era. In this connection, I\nmust commend the excellent organization of Operation\nTurquoise, which has been led and meticulously executed\nby France within the allotted time-frames. The operation\nwas a model of proper and disinterested humanitarian\nintervention. My country took part in that noble\nhumanitarian action that saved tens of thousands of\nhuman lives and provided our Rwandan brethren with an\nopportunity to work together to find a solution to their\nproblem. We hope such international efforts will enable\nthose brethren to heal their wounds and work towards the\nestablishment of national unity and the rebuilding of their\ncountry.\nUnfortunately, Rwanda is not the only place in\nAfrica where an armed conflict is causing fratricidal\nstrife. In Somalia, Liberia and Angola, civil wars\ncontinues to rage, despite the tireless efforts of the United\nNations and the Organization of African Unity to restore\npeace and concord in place of hatred and war between\nbrothers. We hope the citizens of those countries will\nheed the voice of reason and will agree to safeguard their\ninterests and the right of their peoples to enjoy peace and\nsecurity. This objective can be achieved only through\nresponsible and constructive dialogue. Experience has\nshown that the language of arms cannot lead to valid\nsolutions.\nIn Mozambique we are following with special\ninterest the various steps expected to lead to the holding\nof elections on the 27th and 28th of October 1994. We\nhope those elections will embody the spirit of the peace\nagreement concluded in October 1992 and that they will\nbe conducted under proper conditions of peace and\nconcord.\nThe human tragedies that have beset the African\ncontinent should not blind us to the positive events that\nhave taken place, such as the triumph of democracy in\nSouth Africa under the presidency of Nelson Mandela and\nthe settlement of the conflict between Libya and Chad.\nWe welcome the representatives of South Africa. Their\npresence here among us, representing as it does the\nculmination of a decades-long struggle by all African\npeoples, is a source of pride and happiness.\nOn the European continent, which appears to all as\nthe most fertile ground for democracy and respect for\nhuman rights, the outright aggression by the Serbs against\nthe Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a clear affront\nto the human conscience. The efforts of the international\n32\n\n\ncommunity over two long years have failed to put an end\nto the Serbian aggression, which has clearly taken the form\nof \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" vis-\u00e0-vis the Muslims. No serious\nmilitary effort has been made yet to put an end to the\nsuffering of the inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nwho continue to suffer under the embargo that denies them\nthe arms needed for self-defence. Indeed, it is high time\nthe United Nations discharged its full responsibilities under\nthe Charter and used all necessary means, including armed\nforce, to put an end to that terrible tragedy in line with the\nprinciples of the Charter and the Organization\u2019s\nresponsibility to maintain peace.\nIn 1995 we will be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary\nof our Organization. That commemoration should make it\npossible for us to take stock of the progress made over half\na century and to devise better plans and programmes to\ndeal with future problems. Two other events of major\nimportance will take place in the same year and will have\nto do with the search for solutions to major problems which\nare still pending: the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment and the Fourth World Conference on Women\nin Beijing. We hope the results of those two meetings will\ncoalesce with the outcome of the negotiations which aim at\nreforming the Security Council so that the Organization will\nbe equipped with the necessary structures that would enable\nit to deal with the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nToday more than ever, the peoples of the world are\nmaking the United Nations the repository of all their hopes,\nand the Organization must ensure the maintenance of peace\nand promote cooperation for development at one and the\nsame time. By so doing our Organization would crystallize\nhumanity\u2019s aspirations to a world of peace and stability and\nwould then become a true crucible where all nations joined\ntheir efforts to bring forth an era of freedom, democracy\nand respect for human rights.\n"

        "file_text": " It gives me great pleasure to greet all of you here, on behalf of the Haitian people and, with a sense of joy, to address the most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Amara Essy, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Mr. President, as I wish you every measure of success, I wish to make a point of assuring you of the fullest cooperation of the delegation of Haiti.\nTo Ambassador Samuel Insanally, I address my compliments for having so masterfully guided the work of the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nOur congratulations and appreciation also go to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. I thank him with all my heart for the ties of solidarity he has woven with the Haitian people.\nTo all my dear friends throughout the international community, I address my heartfelt thanks for the support they have given the Haitian people throughout these last three years.\nAllow me to address a word of special appreciation to President Bill Clinton, to our special friends the United States, Canada, France, Venezuela, Argentina and to all the States, especially those of the Caribbean Community and common market (CARICOM), that have contributed to the implementation of Security Council resolution 940 (1994) and of the Governors Island Agreement. How happy I am to salute all of you and to thank you lavalassly.\nIn 11 days I shall be in Haiti - at last. Thanks to the heroic courage of the Haitian people and thanks to your solidarity, we will soon be back. Your eyes and our own will contemplate the opening of the flowers of democracy. In eleven days I shall invite you to celebrate this festival of reconciliation, of democracy and of peace at home, in Haiti.\nEven now, with the peaceful launching of the operation \\\"Uphold Democracy\\\" on 19 September last, a tropical smile has shed light upon the faces of those who espouse and love peace. Together, President Clinton and we have managed to open up a channel of hope after so much suffering.\nMy hat is off to the Haitian people.\nHonor and respect to the 5,000 victims among us. Father Jean-Marie Vincent died so that Haiti could live.\n\nThe resistance of the Haitian people has its roots in a historical past where the beacon of liberty has shone day and night. As he was being put on a ship for France, Toussaint Louverture declared quite rightly,\n\\\"In overthrowing me, you have only cut down the trunk of the tree of liberty. Its roots will grow back, for they are many and deep.\\\"\nOn the threshold of the bicentennial of our independence, these roots nourish us with the sap of democracy. The Haitian people will never cease in its struggle to guarantee its inalienable and imprescriptible rights to life, liberty and happiness. We will never cease in the struggle to establish a socially just, economically free and politically independent Haitian nation.\nThus, the first black republic of the world, today tom asunder by the coup d\u2019etat of 30 September 1991, is marching resolutely and definitively towards the establishment of a democratic society.\nThrough diplomacy We attain democracy.\nIn the face of this grim tragedy that has meant three years of suffering, thorns of pain pierce our hearts. None the less, our people excels at coloring the landscape with hope.\nThe brave live in hope and the cowardly in fear.\nBetter late than never: \\\"By following the river you reach the sea\\\", said Plautus as long ago as the second century B.C. To this end, despite the democratic structures set up by Solon and Pittacus in the sixth century B.C., it was necessary to wait for Ephialtes, Cleisthenes and Pericles to achieve the democratization of political life in Athens.\nHope gives life.\nWe have no fear of the Haiti of the year 2004.\nDespite the dreadful spectacle of the last three years, we march towards the year 2004 with optimism. The path that leads there necessarily passes through the historic crossroads where the elections of 16 December 1990 and our return to Haiti meet.\nEleven days from now I shall be there, thanks to the determination of the Haitian people and to your solidarity. This is a history worthy of attention, and there is no history worthy of attention other than that of free peoples. The history of peoples subjugated to despotism is no more than a collection of anecdotes.\nEleven days from now we shall be there. A brilliant light, that of reconciliation, will dazzle us. Between violence and vengeance, reconciliation steps in. Between impunity and iniquity, justice steps in. In other words, we the President of the Republic of Haiti clearly and firmly say.\nYes to reconciliation!\nNo to violence!\nNo to vengeance!\nNo to impunity!\nYes to justice!\nWe shall brew a coffee of reconciliation through the filter of justice so that no trace of violence, no vengeance will be found. \nWith reconciliation, all hearts - rich and poor, civilian and soldier - must be embraced by enthusiasm. With reconciliation, our proud eyes must no longer be flooded with tears.\nYou, parents and friends of our 5,000 victims,\nyou who endure this crushing yoke,\nall of you, rich and poor, soldier and civilian:\nsoon a stream of light will flood\nthe deepest wells of your heart.\nSurely it is the light of reconciliation.\nOtherwise, how can we dispel the gloom of subhuman abjectness? How can we pass from wretchedness to poverty in dignity?\nA study of the countries of the third world shows us that 20 per cent of the population in developing countries know hunger every day, 25 per cent are deprived of the essential means of survival, 33 per cent languish in abject poverty. The World Summit for Social Development, to be held in Copenhagen in 1995, must offer new possibilities for alleviating the distress of more than a billion human beings preyed upon by hunger, disease and utter helplessness.\nIn Haiti in 1994,750,000 children attend school; more than 1,250,000 stay at home or work plots of land. Yet our Constitution stipulates that education is a right of all citizens. It is a duty the State cannot shirk. In these circumstances, 10 years from now we will have to attend to 3,000,000 school-aged children, which will mean increasing the number of teachers from 35,000 to 100,000 and the number of schools from 8,000 to 20,000.\nOn our return we shall undertake a literacy campaign making it possible to attain a significantly low rate of illiteracy: 5 to 10 per cent. Reconciliation among all is of course imperative. Everywhere and always, reconciliation and peace are intertwined.\nThe dissolution of the Soviet bloc has favor\nfavored the opening of a new era after decades of bipolarization. Yet we have the responsibility of protecting peace within our own States. Between 1989 and 1992 there were 82 armed conflicts, only three of which were between States.\nIn our country, institutionalized violence did not unleash a civil war but, rather, a genocide. Even today, despite the presence of the multinational force, acts of violence against our population continue. The disarming of paramilitary groups, notably FRAPH and its attaches, is indispensable if peace is to reign throughout our country.\nThis operation is proceeding to the complete satisfaction of the Haitian people. Obviously, the restoration of democracy will bring reconciliation for all, peace to all of us and respect and justice to every single citizen.\nLavalas brings a message of peace.\nThe guns must fall silent if we are to have peace.\nThe professionalization of a 1,500-strong army and the creation of a police force that is separate from the army fall within this peace process. Peace must be protected and guaranteed for the sake of the happiness of all Haitian men and women.\nArticle 265 of our Constitution stipulates:\t\\\"The\nArmed Forces of Haiti are apolitical\\\". Article 264 says: \\\"They are set up to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of the Republic\\\".\nArticle 269-1 says:\n\\\"The Police must ensure the maintenance of public order and the protection of the lives and the property of the citizenry\\\".\nIt is time to create a stable environment that will make national reconciliation possible in our land. We shall no longer have an army of 7,000 absorbing 40 per cent of the national budget. Globally speaking, military expenditures have declined considerably over the last six years, at an average rate of 3.6 per cent per annum. Why, then, do we have one soldier for every 1,000 Haitians and 1.8 physicians for every 10,000 inhabitants, while the industrial countries average one physician for every 400 inhabitants?\nOnce back home, we shall set in motion our program to correct the current health situation where\nthere are 1,000 physicians for 7 million inhabitants, one nurse for every 2,200 inhabitants, and one hospital bed for every 1,300 inhabitants. Our goal is to care for 8 million Haitians with 2,000 physicians and 8,000 nurses and to increase the number of hospital beds to one for every 400 inhabitants by the year 2004. We will have to open a health center in every district; we shall then have 52. Each municipal area will have its own dispensary. The measures to be adopted will allow us to reduce the infant mortality rate from 135 to 40 per 1,000. The average life expectancy of our population will rise from 54 to 65 years.\nReconciliation and reconstruction are intimately intertwined:\nWe shall prepare the coffee of reconciliation in the filter of justice so that we shall no longer find any trace of violence or vengeance.\nAbove and beyond our national boundaries, the tragedies of Rwanda, Burundi and Bosnia-Herzegovina have confronted us day after day. The suffering of one man is the suffering of mankind. Every person represents humanity. Since the end of the Second World War, over 23 million people have been killed in armed conflict. How can one remain indifferent when confronted by the tempests of violence that have scourged so many countries with which we enjoy fraternal ties, such as Liberia, Somalia, Georgia, the Sudan and Armenia, to cite just a few?\nFortunately, certain conflicts have taken a turn towards peace in the course of the last two years. We hail with hope the peace between Israel and Palestine that has begun to emerge in the Middle East, and we likewise salute South Africa, where the first non-racial, free elections have been held.\nNeither racial barriers nor barriers of class must exist. On the threshold of the year 2004, the Haitian diaspora - our tenth Department, as it were - is our focus par excellence for celebration of the reconciliation between Haitians and Haiti.\nBravo for our tenth Department. Haiti is the Haitians' greatest wealth. Haiti always will be our \\\"chez nous\\\", our home. Come back home. We can make our homeland as beautiful as a rainbow.\nAt the present time 17.4 per cent - 740 kilometers - of our roads are paved; the remaining 2,960 kilometers are mud roads. Ten years hence, a network of some 2,500 kilometers of paved roads will link all of our major and secondary cities and towns. Some 3,000 kilometers of local roads will be laid down.\nIn 1994, only 1.3 per cent of our forest cover remains. At this rate there will be no forests in Haiti by 1998. With the major reforestation drive that we are going to set up, over 6 million trees will be planted each year. By the year 2004, one-third of our territory will be reforested.\nIt goes without saying that a climate of political stability will allow us to promote economic growth. In 1991, the economic policy and fiscal discipline adopted by the Lavalas government brought in $500,200,000 in customs revenue, domestic revenue and transfers from public enterprises. It was a historic performance for our country. By the year 2004, at a growth rate of 10 per cent per annum, the same revenue would bring in $1.26 billion.\nIn monetary terms, the results were just as satisfactory: an increase in foreign exchange reserves of $20 million dollars; a decrease in the devaluation of our gourde, the national currency, from 58.8 to 47.6 per cent; inflation reduced from 20 to 12 per cent.\nBut what remains of these achievements after three years of plunder? The debt ceiling has been raised twice. Inflation is estimated at 60 per cent. Our national currency, the gourde, has been devalued by 300 per cent relative to the dollar. Public finances are in bankruptcy and the public treasury has recorded a $100 million loss for the fiscal years 1992-1994.\nThis is why there is an absolute need for this reconciliation between Haitians and Haiti, which is a sine qua non for creating a modem State by rebuilding the economy. We have to open up the economy to attract foreign investment and to provide goods at better prices to Haitian consumers. Synergistic relationships between the private sector and the State are indispensable. \n\nAt the level of developing countries, foreign debt has multiplied fifteen-fold in two decades. From $100 billion in 1970, it rose to $650 billion in 1980 and to more than $1.5 trillion in 1992. This debt is an enormous brake on the development of third-world countries. In 1992 these countries had to shoulder debt servicing of $160 billion: more than twice the amount of official development assistance. However, one can see signs of a turn around. In Haiti, back home, payments arrears rose to $42 million in September 1993 and will surpass $81 million in December of this year. After I return, $13 million will be freed up as the government's contribution to the reduction of these arrears.\nSetting up a State based on the rule of law also implies reconciliation between Haitians and Haitians: citizens of a country where every man and every woman is a human being, equal before the law. The administration of real justice will free us from the vicious circle of violence and vengeance. Today, the people of Haiti have no access to a system of justice. For our 565 municipal areas, there are only 170 courts and 300 attorneys. However, the rule of law remains an indispensable tool for building the kind of world we aspire to by the year 2004. Between now and then, each and every one of our communal areas will have to get its own court. The number of attorneys will double to 600. A reformed judicial system, backed by an independent, national, civilian police force 10,000 strong, will restore confidence to our citizens. Thus, the restoration of democracy will bring about respect and justice for everyone.\nIn the year 2004, after 10 years of sound democratic management, we shall have achieved a structured civil society where the bread of tolerance will be shared among political parties, the parliament, elected local officials, trade unions, socio-professional organizations, women on the farms, grassroots organizations, religious and ecclesiastical groups and communities - Protestants, Catholics and practitioners of voodoo alike - cooperatives, nongovernmental organizations, and so forth.\nOn the threshold of the third millennium, the principle of \\\"One man, one vote\\\" can only accelerate the form and movement of democracy globally. From one-half to three- quarters of the world's population lives under relatively pluralistic and democratic systems of government. In 1993, elections were organized in 45 different countries, sometimes for the very first time.\nIn Haiti in 2004, we shall already have held four municipal elections, six legislative elections and three\npresidential ones. Public administration will already have been strengthened by the modernization of ministries and public institutions. Political life will be more active at the local level because most of the major decisions will be taken at the level of the 565 municipal areas and the 135 municipalities.\nMr. President, distinguished diplomats and dear friends in the international community, thanks to your support and the determination of the Haitian people, we shall soon see that brighter tomorrow.\nCreated to spare the world from the scourge of a new world war, the United Nations has, over the years, seen its role expand and its responsibilities take on ever increasing importance in a totally changed international setting. As we gather here for this forty-ninth session, on the eve of the commemoration of the United Nations fiftieth anniversary, I would voice the hope that the Organization may always respond effectively to the new challenges the world will proffer.\nTo the people of Haiti, the children of Haiti, the source of our pride and our dignity, I say \\\"To save our beloved Haiti, let us all be united beneath that spreading palm, topped with the crown of freedom, the shadow of whose fronds protects those words inscribed in golden letters: \u2019Unity is strength.\nOur universe is expanding. The hundred billion galaxies of which it is composed are speeding farther and farther apart while we Haitians, men and women, are moving closer and closer together. Our slogan is: \\\"Reconciliation of one and all and justice for all.\\\"\nIn its elliptical orbit around the Sun the Earth moves at 30 kilometers a second. May the land of Haiti revolve around the sun of justice at like speed.\nWe are all present at this rendezvous of reconciliation, setting forth together towards the year 2004, the bicentenary of our independence. I say:\n\\\"Spread the word among you, without violence or vengeance. Let us triumph through gentle democracy. I count on you, and you can count on me. For now, farewell - soon we will meet again.\n\n\\\"Alone, we are weak. Together, we are strong. United we are Lavalas.\\\"\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to join others in\ncongratulating the President on his election to preside over\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The\nwealth of his political and professional experience and his\npersonal qualities will undoubtedly benefit the work of the\nAssembly in the coming months.\nHe takes over his new responsibilities from His\nExcellency Mr. Insanally who, as President during the\nforty-eighth session, continued to give the presidency that\nforward-looking spirit which is so important as the United\nNations system and, at its very centre, the General\nAssembly increasingly become the effective focal point of\ninternational life.\nFive years after the end of the Cold War, the\ninternational community continues to witness painful\nsituations of political, economic and social strife.\nDaily the media bombard us with images of misery:\nvictims of wars fleeing combat zones, abandoning all they\nhad worked for and accumulated in a life-time; refugees\ncrossing deserts or oceans in superhuman efforts to\ndistance themselves from situations where human dignity\nis trampled upon, where the essence of human rights has\nlong been lost; the poor and the needy nurturing hopes of\nescaping from communities where development is absent\nor denied.\nThe list of anguish is endless. Most of us are\ndisturbed and angered at the apparent impotence of the\ninternational community to attack the root causes of such\nmisery.\nWe tend to link many of these situations to the end\nof the Cold War and its aftermath, aware that the\ntransition in international power relations has had an\neffect which goes far beyond its immediate political\nimpact. It has influenced in different ways the economic\nand social dynamic not only of those States undergoing\nthe process of transition, but even others - a spill-over\neffect which is as difficult to contain as it is difficult to\nidentify and map out.\nWe have entered a historical phase marked and\nchequered by regional conflicts - wars which sow death\nand destruction and erase social and economic\nachievements in a matter of weeks if not days.\nThere is the temptation to develop an immunity to\nthe tragic consequences of these ills by giving up on our\ncollective responsibility to alleviate suffering. Every time\nthe international community gives in to this temptation it\nis rudely awakened by degenerating situations which we\ncannot but find shocking.\nAntagonisms with roots which go back in time have\nexploded into situations of conflict and civil strife,\nexposing a heritage of ethnic, religious and tribal\nanimosities. Massacres on an unprecedented scale have\ndevastated our collective conscience.\nThe transition has created a vacuum. In attempting\nto fill this vacuum, the new and frail forces of democratic\npolitical leadership often have to encounter antagonistic\neconomic, political and social forces interested in carving\na niche for themselves through the perpetuation of\n10\n\n\ninstability. Illegal drug and arms traffickers, money\nlaunderers and unscrupulous economic operators stand to\nprofit from an unregulated fiscal, political and social\nenvironment. They often join forces in efforts to\nundermine the consolidation of democracy and the rule of\nlaw. The international community has long realized that\nsuch ills cannot be tackled in isolation. Cooperation has\nbeen strengthened in areas where borders fail to stop the\nspread of criminality.\nThe ills of the present age also require enhanced\nbilateral and regional cooperation. Regions may learn\nlessons from each other as different illicit trade routes\nranging from drugs to plutonium, appear to spread their\ntentacles to encompass the globe. The heart of the matter\nlies, however, in rehabilitating those social environments\nwhich the illicit trade invades, thrives upon and exploits.\nSafeguarding the dignity of every human being,\nthrough the full respect for the right to life, liberty and\nsecurity of person must remain the basis of our collective\naction.\nWe all declare ourselves committed to the principles\nenshrined 46 years ago in the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. This commitment, however, has oft fallen\nvictim to that pragmatic approach which demands looking\nthe other way - a philosophy that justifies living with the\nlesser evil, supposedly to avoid the greater evil. The\nfallacy of this approach has been seen in many and varied\ninstances, ranging from corruption within the body politic,\nto totalitarianism at the national level, to trans-boundary\ncrime and terrorism at the international level.\nFor five years we have been speaking of the creation\nof a new international order. The words and setting were\npraiseworthy, as was the commitment to do good. In our\neuphoria, we assumed that our desire for a new world\ncommunity where law, order and development should\nprevail was universally shared.\nCrude realities have proved that in making this\nassumption we failed to note that our desire for good could\nbe matched, indeed challenged, by the evil intentions of\nothers. It was thought that this challenge could come only\nfrom existing regimes which we rightfully tried to treat as\noutcasts - little realizing that the roots of the issue were\nmore widespread and lay in the lack of balance and\nharmonious development of economic and socio-political\nsystems.\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round this year and\nthe setting up of the World Trade Organization could\nprovide us with a channel where trade practices become\nmore transparent and fair. Trade is the driving force\nbehind economic growth and social stability. Lack of\nviable economic activity erodes the basis of democratic\nsocieties, rendering them fragile and subject to instability.\nOne cannot but praise the efforts of the peoples and\nGovernments of many States in striving to build stable\neconomic infrastructures. Their enterprise cannot be\nachieved without the constant support of developed States\nwith long-established free-market economies.\nA new approach requires that we gird ourselves\nproperly to face the challenges ahead. On the national\nlevel, political and socio-economic structures must ensure\ndignity for one and all.\nOn 21 September, Malta celebrated the thirtieth\nanniversary of its independence. During these three\ndecades, many were the challenges faced and the lessons\nlearnt. Democracy based on the dignity of each citizen is\na task that requires an ever-renewing commitment by all\nsocial forces to the right to freedom of opinion.\nPluralism is an essential catalyst in the democratic\nprocess and requires that we honour its full meaning in\nthe different areas where it manifests itself. However\nmuch this impetus is strengthened when fired by\nGovernments, it is handicapped each time an authoritarian\nGovernment assumes that it can rule by diktat. During\nthe past seven years my Government has committed itself\nto strengthening pluralism in such vital areas as\nbroadcasting, education and trade. Pluralism is a vote of\nconfidence in the people, and a democratically elected\nGovernment cannot but reciprocate the trust bestowed by\nthe electorate.\nThe consolidation of democracy was not the only\nchallenge we had to face. During these 30 years we\nradically transformed an economy entirely dependent on\nthe presence of foreign military bases into one benefiting\nfrom thriving financial, industrial and tourism sectors.\nThis transition has given Malta the economic buoyancy\nrequired of it as a prospective member of the European\nUnion. We note with satisfaction the decision, taken last\nJune at the Corfu Summit, that Malta will be included in\nthe next phase of the enlargement of the European Union.\nThis state of economic well-being has enabled the\nGovernment to consolidate a social policy inspired by the\nconcept of solidarity. Over three decades we have\n11\n\n\nintroduced schemes ensuring equal access for men and\nwomen by providing appropriate formal educational and\nsocial structures.\nIn enacting this policy, the Government has not\nignored its responsibility to ensure a dignified life for all\nthrough programmes that range from free medical aid for\nall citizens to care of the elderly and integration of the\nhandicapped.\nToday, Malta can rightfully claim to be a nation at\npeace with itself and with others. Though conscious of our\nlimitations, we have never let size inhibit our mature\ninvolvement in the international arena. On the occasion of\nthe recent signing of the Agreement on the implementation\nof part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of\nthe Sea, many representatives acknowledged Malta\u2019s role in\nlaunching the concept of common heritage - a concept that\ntoday is the guiding principle in a number of conventions.\nMalta stands committed to the creation of a global society\nbased on the principles of dignity and solidarity.\nThroughout the centuries, Malta has had its existence\nmarked by the contradiction between its size and its\nstrategic importance. This has necessitated an\nunderstanding of the importance of regional stability\nthrough cooperation. Since independence, we have\ncultivated an awareness of the importance of stability in the\nMediterranean. The progress registered in the Middle East\npeace process following the signing of the Declaration of\nPrinciples and the Washington Accords of 13 September\n1993 makes it easier to understand the importance of the\ninterdependence of European security and Mediterranean\nsecurity.\nMalta has been the first in international forums - and\nhas sometimes been alone - to advocate the need for a\nMediterranean dialogue, and it has been consistent in\nadvancing proposals to this end. Over the years since the\nHelsinki Summit Declaration we have promoted the link\nbetween security in Europe and security in the\nMediterranean.\nToday, the Mediterranean dimension is high on the\ninternational agenda. From both sides of this sea of destiny\nthe need for a Mediterranean forum has been underlined -\nnot for the sake of creating another international body but\nas an aspect of the logic of existence in the light of the\nmany problems in the region. These problems range from\nunemployment to overpopulation, terrorism and ethnic strife\n- all in a narrow highway that affects stability in the region\nand beyond, thus threatening the future of millions.\nWe cannot, therefore, but identify ourselves with\nForeign Minister Alain Jupp\u00e9, who, in his address to this\nAssembly at its 8th plenary meeting, stated that France\nwould like to see Europe organizing a forum for\ncooperation involving all the Mediterranean States, and\nwould be making this one of the main goals of the\nforthcoming French presidency of the European Union.\nWe also welcome the statement made at the 6th plenary\nmeeting by the President of the Council of Ministers of\nthe European Union - Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel -\nthat Europe attaches great importance to security in the\nMediterranean.\nPrincipled cooperation reflects a fundamental and\nessential Maltese social reality. It was through the\nextension of this matured concept to the broader European\nand international level that, within the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), Malta\nlaunched the initiative for the Conference to declare itself\na regional arrangement for the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity in the terms of Chapter VIII of the United\nNations Charter - a declaration adopted by CSCE Heads\nof State and Government at the Helsinki II Summit.\nIn calling for a new approach at the regional level,\nwe cannot but renew our support for, and our\ncommitment to, the CSCE process. The CSCE was the\nfirst body to give tangible form to the connection between\nthe political, economic and human dimensions. The\nCSCE need not be copied in its detail by other regions,\nbut it provides a model of confidence-building to which\nother regions can aspire.\nThe need for a new approach has long been felt at\nthe United Nations. Initiatives taken by Malta when it\noccupied the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nforty-fifth session, four years ago, are slowly bearing\nfruit. However, it is only legitimate to ask whether the\nresults are proportionate to the efforts made. My\nGovernment welcomes as a step in the right direction the\nrecently adopted resolution on revitalization of the\nGeneral Assembly. Important as it is, this step cannot but\nlead to others meant to enhance the role of this forum.\nWe have to maintain the central role of the General\nAssembly in the framework of the United Nations. This\nis the only forum where all members are permanent\nmembers. We believe that the General Assembly has to\ndevelop and define the fact-finding mechanism that\npertains to it. We also have to ensure what former\nSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar referred to as\n\\\"a balanced constitutional relationship\\\". The maintenance\n12\n\n\nof this relationship with and between the principal organs\nof the Organization, including the General Assembly, the\nSecurity Council and the Secretariat, is important not as an\nissue of the internal working of the Organization but\nbecause \\\"it bears on the guardianship of peace exercised by\nthe United Nations \\\".\nIn his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", Secretary-\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali underlines the relevance of\nthe General Assembly as a universal forum by calling for\nrecognition of its capacity to consider and recommend\nappropriate action in the maintenance of international peace\nand security. He says:\n\\\"To that end it is essential to promote its utilization by\nall Member States so as to bring greater influence to\nbear in pre-empting or containing situations which are\nlikely to threaten peace and security.\\\" (A/47/277,\npara. 36)\nIn this respect, the reforms related to the restructuring\nof the Security Council, which we hope will be negotiated\nby next year, have a bearing because of the qualitative\nchange they would generate. My Government is studying\nthe proposals already submitted, including the Italian\nproposal presented yesterday by Foreign Minister Martino.\nNext year we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations system. The international community\nis becoming more aware of the vast extent of common\nconcerns which bond our fate as a global community. A\nnumber of international conventions today make specific\nreference to the common heritage of mankind.\nThe universal acceptance of this principle is to our\ncollective credit. It is proof of the sense of responsibility\nand equity that inspires Member States in their obligations\ntowards present and future generations. Only an underlying\nsolidarity can ensure the survival of the planet. This sense\nof inter-generation solidarity truly dignifies humanity.\nMalta has underlined the need for a unit to coordinate\nand monitor areas related to the common heritage. A\nconvergence of all efforts becomes instrumental to the\nefficiency with which such initiatives, born of conventions,\nmay work and bear fruit.\nA scenario marked by institutional fragmentation can\nbe avoided only by establishing institutional oversight in the\ninterest of the areas we hold in trust for future generations.\nRather than reinventing the wheel, we are proposing a\ntransition and evolution in the role of Trusteeship Council,\nfor we are convinced that the Trusteeship Council could\nbe such a point of convergence.\nWe have taken note of the part of the report of the\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization which\ndeals with the Trusteeship Council and, in particular, the\nrecommendation that the General Assembly proceed with\nsteps to eliminate that organ in accordance with Article\n108 of the Charter. We agree with the Secretary- General\nthat with the end of the Trusteeship Agreement on Palau\nthe Council, as conceived, has concluded its task.\nThe concept of trust - a concept of English Common\nLaw which is fundamental in its fiduciary nature - is one\nthat reflects the mission of the League of Nations and\nlater the United Nations in so far as certain Territories\nwere concerned. We have to apply the concept of trust\nto new realities. We believe that the United Nations\nholds in trust for humanity its common heritage and its\ncommon concerns: the environment; the resources of the\nsea and of the seabed; the climate; the rights of future\ngenerations; and the safeguarding of the rights of peoples\nin situations of complete breakdown of the organs of the\nState. We believe that we hold these in trust for\nhumanity, and an enhanced and redefined Trusteeship\nCouncil can be the right organ for this purpose.\nThe challenges of the present times demand that we\nlook at the United Nations system with innovative eyes.\nWe cannot aspire to a new world order and yet persist in\nviewing the institutional mechanisms of the United\nNations through the same cold-war lenses, which are ill\nfocused for our times and now shattered by the course of\nhistory. We need to view the United Nations as a\ncomplex adaptive system, a system which, without\nrenouncing its original ideals and basic principles,\nresponds adequately and promptly to contemporary needs,\na proactive United Nations rather than a reactive one, a\nUnited Nations which moulds a new mentality apart from\nironing creases and mending tears in the fabric of\ninternational relations.\nThe challenge today is not a physical dividing wall.\nThis generation can one day look back with pride at what\nit has achieved. The recent ceremonies marking the\ndeparture of foreign troops stationed in Germany is a\nreminder of how significantly different political realities\nare today from the days when the Berlin Wall cut across\na city, a nation and a continent with the same callousness\nwith which it cut across the soul and spirit of Europe.\n13\n\n\nEqually breathtaking was the transition from a South\nAfrica built on the bastion of apartheid to a democratic\nSouth Africa which cherishes the dignity of all of its\ncitizens.\nThe walls of division are also being dismantled in the\nMiddle East, where political determination and goodwill\ncan and should ensure the full enjoyment of sovereignty\nand political rights for all peoples living in the region.\nHowever, there are many other situations at which we\nshall some day look back in anger. The challenge to our\npolitical will today is the tragedy of the children in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, the rotting, butchered bodies floating in\nthe rivers of Rwanda, the millions of refugees with their\nlives wasted in never-ending waiting, the other millions of\ndepressed and oppressed living an existence without\ndignity.\n1995 is a year of challenge. It is the year of the\nWorld Summit for Social Development and of the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women, the next two links in the\ntriad begun with the recent International Conference on\nPopulation and Development at Cairo. Three Conferences\nwhich, with Habitat II, require a global approach focused\non development rather than on the promotion of hidden\nagendas which are irrelevant in the resolution of essential\nissues - essential issues which represent a billion people\nliving in abject poverty, half of whom go to bed hungry\nevery day.\nThere is a poverty curtain which continues to create a\ngreat divide and which becomes more impenetrable when\nwe wilfully shut our eyes to the concept of solidarity.\nEmpowerment becomes a mere clich\u00e9 if it fails to ensure a\nlife in dignity for this ocean of humanity denied of its most\nbasic right to life, liberty and security of person.\nIn issuing declarations we do well to underline our\ncommitment to eradicating the root causes that generate so\nmuch misery, anguish and pain. We do even better when\nwe make firm commitments on assistance to States which\nrequire our solidarity, States in need that require us to\nmatch our words with deeds.\nSolidarity means reaching out rather than holding out.\nSolidarity is the building block of greater security to ensure\nthe livelihood and dignity of millions. Solidarity is a key\nfactor in the promotion of development in the lives and\nminds of men, and hence in the complex relations that\nguide the international community.\nOur legacy to future generations would be a poor\none if development and solidarity were not matched by\ncompliance with international standards of human rights.\nThe importance of the rule of law and democracy requires\nthat the international community safeguard human rights.\nDenial of liberty is the refusal of that oxygen that enables\na developed community to live in harmony with itself and\nothers. The challenge of the twenty-first century is not\nliberty in the abstract: it is the responsibility of the\nUnited Nations to be an instrument in forging principles\ninto concrete action.\nA second-generation United Nations facing the\nchallenge of solidarity must serve as a guidepost to\nhumanity in its long walk towards peace in freedom.\n"

        "file_text": " I\nshould like to convey to Mr. Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire our\nsincere congratulations on his election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I am\ncertain that his experience will be a positive factor in\nensuring the success of the session\u2019s deliberations.\nIraq is one of the founding Members of the United\nNations. Over the past five decades it has taken an active\npart in all the Organization\u2019s activities, has cooperated\neffectively with its various organs and has contributed\ngenerously when it was able to do so. Iraq has also\nadhered to the decisions of the Organization in\naccordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter.\nAt the international level, Iraq has participated\nactively and responsibly in the Movement of Non-aligned\nCountries, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and\nthe League of Arab States. During the 1970s it provided\nassistance and soft loans amounting to about $10 billion\nto developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin and\n15\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nCentral America. Iraq has called for justice in political and\neconomic relations and has affirmed the need to respect\ninternational law. These positions of Iraq are known to all.\nWhat now concerns my country is the nature of the\ncurrent stage of the relationship between Iraq and the\nSecurity Council, which is based on the Council\u2019s\nresolution 687 (1991), adopted in April of that year. That\nresolution, which imposed a number of obligations on Iraq,\nhas no precedent among United Nations resolutions\nthroughout the history of the Organization. This is how it\nis seen today in international circles, both legal and\npolitical. However, despite its cruel and extraordinary\nnature, Iraq informed the Security Council that it was ready\nto comply with it within the requirements laid down by the\nCharter\u2019s provisions regarding resolutions adopted under\nChapter VII.\nSince that date, despite the harsh conditions obtaining\nin our country as a result of the total war waged by the\nmost powerful States of the world \u2014 a war in which more\nthan 100,000 tons of explosives were dumped on civilian\nutilities throughout the country \u2014 and despite the effects of\nthe comprehensive and harsh embargo, Iraq has striven to\nimplement the resolution.\nIn March 1992 \u2014 less than a year after the adoption\nof the resolution \u2014 and in November of the same year we\ncame to the Security Council to explain the substantial and\nserious steps that had been taken by Iraq in the process of\nimplementing its provisions. On both occasions, we\nrequested that positive and fair consideration be given to\nwhat had been achieved and that steps be taken towards\neasing the comprehensive blockade imposed upon Iraq in\naccordance with the terms of the resolution and,\nspecifically, the unbearable suffering of the 20 million\npeople of Iraq. However, our requests were not heeded.\nIn the middle of 1993 Iraq\u2019s relationship with the\nSpecial Commission and with the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) saw a breakthrough in the field of\npositive and constructive cooperation with a view to\ncompleting the implementation of part C of Security\nCouncil resolution 687 (1991) \u2014 the provisions relating to\nproscribed weapons, which the resolution legally ties to the\nlifting of the embargo on oil exports.\nIn the process of this cooperation \u2014 on\n26 November 1993 \u2014 we presented our official letter\nconcerning compliance with Security Council resolution 715\n(l991). The letter dealt with the monitoring of weapons.\nThis was done after we had been assured that Iraq\u2019s official\nacknowledgment of compliance represented the most\nexpeditious means of securing the application of\nparagraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991). This clear and\ncategorical assurance is referred to in the report issued as\ndocument S/26571 on 12 October 1993. However, what\nwe were told would be done has not been done.\nDuring the past 11 months we have witnessed\ntransparent tactics to delay and obstruct. These have\ntaken various forms. Their purpose is to delay\nindefinitely the lifting of the embargo. In spite of the\nofficial acknowledgment by the Special Commission and\nthe IAEA of the relevant Iraqi authorities\u2019 continuing\ncooperation, as well as the notable achievements of\ncompletion of the work required by those bodies over a\nperiod of more than a year, we still confront deliberate\nambiguity with regard to the Security Council\u2019s discharge\nits obligations under paragraph 22, which permits the\nexport of Iraqi products and commodities, including oil.\nThe blockade imposed on Iraq represents the most\ncomprehensive regime ever imposed by the Security\nCouncil in all its history. With the exception of food and\nmedicine, it includes everything and affects all aspects of\nlife. As a result of the freezing of Iraqi assets in foreign\nbanks, Iraq is denied all the financial resources that would\nenable it to pay for the food and medicines its people\nneed. This has rendered practically redundant the\nexceptions relating to food and medicines.\nIn addition, the Sanctions Committee, which the\nSecurity Council entrusted with the task of authorizing the\nimportation of material to Iraq, agreed on the consensus\nmethod of making decisions. However, the reality is\nexactly the opposite: decisions are required to be\nunanimous.\nIt is sufficient for the objection of one member to\nfrustrate any request for imports. It is worth noting that\nonly three of the members of the Committee have been\nthe source of constant objections on the vast majority of\nthe import requests relating to the provision of\nhumanitarian civilian needs. What has made the situation\nin the Sanctions Committee even worse is that it proceeds\non the basis of procedures which do not recognize\nprecedents and deals with each case individually. This\nhas led to confusion, disorder and ambiguity in the work\nof the Committee in regard to what is permitted, both in\nrelation to quantity and quality. It is not difficult to see,\ntherefore, the harmful negative consequences of this\nmethod of work by the Committee on the flow of\n16\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nhumanitarian goods, which are of a limited quantity\nanyway.\nLet me refer to some glaring examples. The Sanctions\nCommittee refused on numerous occasions to permit the\nimportation of shrouds, pencils, cloth of all kinds including\nthe type used for hospital bed sheets, threads of all kinds,\npaper for printing school books, leather, car tires including\nused tires, nails; the list is long and it is well documented\nin the records of the Committee.\nThis situation makes it incumbent upon the\ninternational community to reflect upon the philosophy of\nthe sanctions regime of within the Charter of the United\nNations. Is that regime a means to an end or is it an end\nin itself? Further, what is the nature of that regime? Is it\npunitive, or is it a series of procedures designed to achieve\nthe purposes of the Charter irrespective of the unilateral\ngoals and whims of foreign policies of Member States? It\nis well known to all that the sanctions regime under the\nCharter is nothing but a series of procedures adopted to\nachieve certain results that lead in turn to the achievement\nof the purposes and principles of the United Nations, and\nthat such procedures should end with the cessation of their\ncauses. What then is the state of correct application of\nthese procedures following all the cooperation and progress\nachieved in complying with the resolutions of the Security\nCouncil by Iraq? What is clear to us is that the application\nof sanctions and the embargo in the manner described\nagainst Iraq is a process of vengeance, a process aimed at\ndepriving the people of Iraq, a nation of with great history,\na nation which has contributed immensely to human\ncivilization, depriving it of the simplest requirements of\nhuman life.\nThe reports of the relevant specialized agencies\nindicate the continuing deterioration of living conditions of\nthe Iraqi citizens. The Iraqi Government makes available\nto every citizen a limited rations of flour, rice, tea, cooking\noil, soap, baby formula and whatever other items might be\navailable. This share is however to meet the basic\nnutritional needs of human beings. Of late, we have been\nforced to reduce this ration due to the lack of financial\nresources and as well as poor agricultural output resulting\nfrom the embargo. Consequently, the largest number of\ncitizens cannot buy what they lack of these and other items\nbecause of the high prices, especially for protein items, and\nthey are therefore suffering from malnutrition. This\nsituation has affected the physical wellbeing of the\nindividual citizen in Iraq.\nDespite the efforts of the Government to support and\ndevelop the agricultural sector, great difficulties continue\nto be faced due to the embargo. For example, the lack of\npesticides, insecticides, agricultural machinery and\nequipment, water pumps and fertilizers. We do not have\nthe financial means to offset these shortages; and when\nwe do have some financial resources, the Sanctions\nCommittee promptly obstructs their importation.\nThe Joint Mission of the Food and Agricultural\nOrganization and the World Food Programme, which\nvisited Iraq in June 1993, did indicate in its Special Alert\nNo. 237 (1993) the magnitude of the danger resulting\nfrom the blockade on the agricultural capabilities of Iraq,\nwhich caused the loss of food-security and generated\npersistent deprivation, chronic hunger and endemic\nmalnutrition among the vast majority of the population.\nThe third FAO Special Report of May 1994 dealt with the\ngrave problems of providing food and crops in Iraq due\nto the shortages of agricultural requirements. The same\nReport noted that these problems cannot be solved by the\nprovision of food aid and that the permanent solution to\nthe present food crisis lies in reviving the Iraqi economy\nwhich cannot be achieved without resuming the activity\nof international trade. It is also indicated that the\nrationing system used by the Iraqi Government, though\nvery successful, provides only about one-half of the\naverage caloric intake which used to be available to the\ncitizens of Iraq before the imposition of the sanctions.\nIn the public health sector, health services have\ndeteriorated, after they had been amongst the relatively\nadvanced in the world. Due to shortages of medicine and\nthe deterioration of medical equipment, cases of death\nhave reached 384,022 cases from August 1990 to March\n1994. The cases of death among infants have also\nincreased and now reach 126 cases per l00,000 live births\nwhereas it had been only 32 per thousand in the period\n1985 to 1990.\nThere are those who claim that the Government of\nIraq is the party responsible for not making available\nfood, medicine and essential civilian needs to the people\nbecause it has refused to accept Security Council\nresolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Such allegations\nare mere falsifications.\nFair and objective consideration of the full picture of\nthe arrangements adopted in these two resolutions would\nlead one to the conclusion that they do represent\n17\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\na political programme aimed at violating the sovereignty of\nIraq, interfering in its internal affairs and dividing its people\nalong ethnic and sectarian lines, rather than ensuring the\nsatisfying of humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq.\nThrough five rounds of talks with the Secretariat in Vienna\nand New York in 1992 and 1993 we have sought to reach\nacceptable modalities through sound arrangements in order\nto ensure the satisfaction of the humanitarian civilian needs\nof our people. However, despite the sustained efforts that\nhave been made, such efforts have failed to reach an\nappropriate solution, a solution free of the objectives of the\nbiased political programme through the pressures brought\nto bear by the United States. One of the major ironies\nduring those talks was that the oil and banking experts who\nwere part of the United Nations delegation did acknowledge\nthat the arrangements adopted in the two said resolutions\nwere not at all customary in the oil and banking fields.\nCould it be deemed reasonable by anyone involved in\nthe oil industry that the signing of an oil-export contract\nshould require no less than 30 procedural steps? Do\nMembers realize that the banking arrangements stipulated\nby the two resolutions totally ignore the existence of a\ndeveloped banking sector in Iraq? Do Members realize that\na simple contract for the importation of food or medicine\nrequires no fewer than 20 bureaucratic steps in order for\nthose goods to reach Iraq, and that even after their arrival\nthey are subject to monitoring by hundreds of United\nNations monitors from the time they leave the Iraqi border\nuntil they reach the consumer? This is the true story of\nresolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Those two\nresolutions were never intended to meet the humanitarian\nneeds of the people of Iraq.\nIn the course of the Security Council\u2019s periodic\nreviews, which take place every 60 days and the latest of\nwhich took place on 14 September last, the United States\nfalsely accused Iraq on various counts in order to justify its\nposition of delaying the lifting of sanctions indefinitely.\nWe find it useful to refer to some examples of these\naccusations so that the General Assembly may see the\npicture clearly.\nThe United States charges that Iraq\u2019s cooperation with\nthe Security Council has been sporadic, selective and\nopportunistic. This is a baseless accusation. It is well\nknown that Iraq agreed to comply with the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council and sought persistently\nto implement their provisions correctly and legally. We\nbelieve that the majority of the members of the Security\nCouncil do not join the United States in its accusation.\nThe United States also charges that Iraq\u2019s record\nwith respect to the implementation of its obligations in\nthe area of proscribed weapons was a partial and grudging\nacquiescence to United Nations demands. The facts,\nhowever, prove otherwise. This is made clear in the\nreports of the Special Commission and the International\nAtomic Energy Agency, especially those issued since July\n1993. The latest of those reports, circulated in document\nS/1994/860, states,\n\u201cThe Special Commission and the IAEA noted\nwith appreciation the constructive cooperation\nreceived from Iraq and the efforts made by the\ncompetent Iraqi authorities in the conduct of their\ntasks.\u201d (S/1994/860, para. 6)\nAnother accusation is that the Government of Iraq cut off\nelectricity from certain areas in the northern Iraqi\nGovernorates. Those who make this accusation ignore the\nfact that the comprehensive embargo imposed upon Iraq\ndoes not make sufficient financial resources available to\nthe Government to import spare parts and equipment for\nensuring the maintenance of electrical service in the\ncountry. Moreover, the accusers are the very ones who\nconstantly object in the sanctions Committee to Iraqi\nrequests for importing material with which to maintain the\nelectricity grid, in the event we have some resources\navailable to that end.\nThe United States also accuses the Government of\nIraq of draining the marshes in the southern part of the\ncountry in pursuit of a political programme aimed against\nthe population of the area. According to the allegation,\nthis action destroys their cultural heritage and causes\nharm to the environment. I say that this accusation, like\nthe others, is baseless. It is utterly at odds with the sense\nof objectivity expected of a permanent member of the\nSecurity Council.\nThe truth is that the Government of Iraq carried out\nextensive irrigation projects in the southern part of the\ncountry, including the area of the marshes, in order to\nreduce salinity in the water and soil, which is a problem\nin central and southern Iraq, thereby increasing the\namount of arable land. The planning for these projects\ngoes back to the days of the Rehabilitation Board in the\nfifties. American, British, French, German, Dutch,\nRussian and Canadian companies and consultants\nparticipated in drawing up and revising the plans and, in\npart, in their implementation.\n18\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nAfter the imposition of the comprehensive blockade\nthe competent Iraqi authorities completed the projects by\nthemselves. One of the ironies of the situation is that the\nprincipal proponent of draining the marshes of southern\nIraq in the fifties was an American expert working for the\nIraqi Board. It is also ironic that one of the rivers in the\narea is still called the Dutch River because a Dutch\ncompany carried out a project there.\nI have been prompted to mention some of the\naccusations levelled at Iraq in order to shed light on the\nreal situation and the fabrications and falsifications used as\npretexts to prolong the iniquitous blockade against us. But\nit is even more important to refer to some glaring examples\nof the conduct of those who accuse us, to wit, the United\nStates of America.\nThe United States, the State that is so concerned with\nrespect for Security Council resolutions, imposes two no-fly\nzones in the north and the south of Iraq without any\nauthorization from the Security Council or any legitimate\njustification under international law. The United States\nAdministration, which pretends to be so concerned over the\nrights of the Kurds in Iraq, was the very party that\nprevented the leaders of the Kurds from honouring an\nagreement that, after four months of dialogue, was freely\nentered into with the Government of Iraq in 1991. The\nUnited States Administration stated openly that that\nagreement would have strengthened the authority of the\npresent national Government in Iraq, which was contrary to\nthe United States objective of changing that Government.\nIs this attitude in harmony with the Security Council\nresolutions that provide for respect of sovereignty and the\nachievement of international peace and security and stability\nin the region? Is it acceptable, under the resolutions of the\nSecurity Council, for that Administration to obstruct the\noperation of flights transporting pilgrims from a friendly\nMuslim State to Iraq\u2019s sacred religious shrines under the\npretext that a number of politicians from that State were\namong the pilgrims? That very Administration also\nobstructed, under flimsy pretexts, the aerial shipment of\nmeat from the Sudan to Iraq.\nLastly in this connection, I should like to affirm that\nIraq expressed, in the words of its leader, President Saddam\nHussein, its sincere desire to turn a new leaf with its\nneighbouring Arab countries in order to establish relations\nbased on the Charter of the League of Arab States, the\nCharter of the United Nations and on the basis of mutual\nrespect for one another\u2019s sovereignty and regard for each\nother\u2019s interests. However, it is well known to all that the\nUnited States Administration is the party that obstructs\nthose efforts and brings pressure to bear on the States of\nthe region to prevent dialogue with Iraq. The article by\nUnited States Secretary of State Warren Christopher\npublished in The New York Times last April is, we\nbelieve, the most telling evidence in that respect.\nDespite the harshness of the Security Council\u2019s\nresolutions concerning Iraq, we have implemented many\nof their provisions fully. We are legally and correctly\ncontinuing with the implementation of whatever\nprovisions remain in the relevant resolutions. Within this\nprocess, we are also prepared to satisfy and allay the\nconcerns of the members of the Security Council of\nwhich we have become aware in our contacts, although\nsome of them have been introduced in legally irrelevant\ncontexts.\nIn the meantime, however, we wonder: is it the duty\nof the State in question under the Charter to implement\nthe provisions of the Security Council resolutions adopted\nunder Chapter VII, without expecting any counter-\nobligations from the Council to implement the same\nprovisions? The just, legal view is that resolutions of the\nCouncil adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter are\nbinding upon the State in question and all other States,\nparticularly the members of the Security Council, and\neven more particularly the Permanent Members of the\nSecurity Council. This, undoubtedly, is the rule of the\nCharter. It is therefore a foregone conclusion that the\nmembers of the Security Council, and especially its\nPermanent Members, should be keener than any other to\nabide by the resolutions they themselves adopt. However,\nthe facts of the situation now are that one Permanent\nMember, namely the United States of America, is\npersistently obstructing any steps towards the correct legal\napplication of the resolutions of the Council, particularly\nthose provisions relating to the lifting of sanctions from\nIraq, and is conducting itself on the basis of biased\npolitical motives that bear no relation to either the\nresolutions of the Council or the Charter.\nThe General Assembly is the general organ entrusted\nwith deliberating on the world Organization as a whole\nunder the Charter. Under the Charter, Member States\nhave conferred on the Security Council the primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\nand security, and have agreed that in carrying out its\nduties under this responsibility, the Security Council acts\non their behalf, in accordance with the Purposes and\nPrinciples of the United Nations Charter. Consequently,\nunder the Charter, the members of the Security Council,\n19\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nboth individually and collectively, bear the joint\nresponsibility of the membership of the Organization. The\ncollectivity of membership, as represented by the General\nAssembly, does not, on the basis of the delegation of\npower, lose the right to seek, through all available means,\nthe correction of any failure that might arise in performing\nthat responsibility.\nProceeding from this, we request that the members of\nthe Security Council, the General Assembly and the\ninternational community as a whole look into the iniquitous\nand illegitimate situation in which one or two Permanent\nMembers obstruct the correct legal application of the\nresolutions of the Security Council and consequently\ncontinue to impose upon the Iraqi people, a nation of\nancient history, cruel suffering afflicting all aspects of\nhuman life.\nIt is within Iraq\u2019s right to demand strongly that this\niniquitous and illegitimate situation be changed as soon as\npossible and to seek full clarification of the position of the\nSecurity Council on its just demands.\n"

        "file_text": "May I, on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Jamaica, convey warmest\ncongratulations to Mr. Amara Essy on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.\nI wish to assure him of the full support and cooperation of\nthe Jamaican delegation in the deliberations on the many\nimportant issues before the Assembly.\nLet me also take this opportunity to congratulate\nAmbassador Insanally of Guyana on the skilful and\ninnovative manner in which he presided over the forty-\neighth session. We in the Caribbean are justifiably proud\nof his contributions to the Assembly\u2019s deliberations.\nLast year I emphasized that the international\ncommunity was at a crossroads where we were faced not\nonly with matters of economic progress but also with an\nenvironment full of conflicts and strife. My outlook was,\nand still is, one of optimism, an optimism rooted in the\nrecognition that the old political and military order has\npassed and that history has, for the second time in less\nthan two generations, provided us with the opportunity to\nembark on a process of international consensus-building.\nThis is an exciting and daunting task, particularly for a\nsmall island State like Jamaica, whose faith and\ncommitment to multilateralism and the United Nations\nremain unwavering.\nOur most pressing collective challenge is to make\nthis Organization a more effective instrument for peace\nand development. The United Nations is being called\nupon to respond to a host of new challenges, including\nemergency humanitarian assistance, peace-keeping,\npeacemaking, development and post-conflict rebuilding.\nThe past year has seen human misery and dislocation of\nfearful proportions in Haiti, on the high seas of the\nCaribbean, in Rwanda, in the refugee camps of Zaire and\nTanzania, in Bosnia and in Afghanistan. Their underlying\ncauses are political, social and economic. The United\nNations can and should bring to these and other situations\na broadly encompassing view of the indivisibility of\npolitical, economic and social processes.\nThe Organization and its resources and the will and\nvision of its Members must be mobilized to address the\nimperatives of social and economic development. We\nmust seek to promote a new era of international\ncooperation for global human security.\nThe global nature of this challenge is inescapable.\nIt has become evident that no State by itself can control\nthe spread of environmental degradation and pollution,\ntransnational migrations and diseases such the AIDS\nepidemic. Economic globalization and the accompanying\nliberalization of trade and financial flows, now link\ndeveloped and developing economies, North and South,\nEast and West. Global solutions and coordinated\nstrategies must consequently form the basis of our\nactions.\n10\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nGlobalization brings new opportunities, but it also\nbrings new dangers. Despite the general trend towards\nimproved economic management, economic disparities are\nwidening. Developing countries are being marginalized\nfrom the growth trends in the international economy. This\nis a matter of concern to Jamaica as we, like a large\nnumber of other developing countries, have placed high\ndevelopmental priority on export-led growth and on\nattracting investment flows. Structural adjustment\nprogrammes have also been undertaken at great social cost.\nThe contributions of the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies in areas such as institution-building, poverty\nalleviation, productivity enhancement, small enterprise\ndevelopment and financing, and the strengthening of human\nresources, continue to be vital elements in enhancing the\nproductive potential of developing countries. This will, in\nturn, enable our countries to benefit more fully from and to\nparticipate more effectively in a liberal and increasingly\norganic global economy.\nThe United Nations must now work vigorously\ntowards the implementation of an agenda for development.\nA meaningful agenda for development must set priorities in\nprogrammes and resources that respond to the challenges\nposed by the international environment for developing\ncountries. These priorities must address all issues to which\nadequate multilateral solutions have yet to be found. These\ninclude the burden of debt; inadequate flows of official\ndevelopment assistance; the debilitating brain drain; the\nreverse transfer of resources to multilateral financial\ninstitutions; the social costs of structural adjustment and the\nnon-transparent trade barriers and protectionist measures\nthat remain in place in industrialized countries against the\nproducts of developing countries even as the general trend\ntowards liberalization and trade in goods and services is\naccelerating. The agenda must strengthen the role of the\nUnited Nations in the area of international economic policy-\nmaking and coordination. It must seek to enhance the\nrelationship of the United Nations with the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the International Monetary Fund and the\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the\ntwo Bretton Woods institutions established under the\numbrella of the United Nations. I wish to emphasize that\nwe should continue to examine the roles and policies of\nthese institutions. We must make the changes that five\ndecades of experience indicate are necessary so as to\nimprove the prospects for growth and development of\ndeveloping countries \u2014 change which can be carried out\nwithout undermining the health and vitality of the\ninternational economy or the fiscal integrity of these\ninstitutions. Major developed countries should re-examine\ntheir opposition to the sound proposals for change that\nhave been put forward repeatedly by developing\ncountries \u2014 proposals that range from increasing\ninternational liquidity to longer adjustment periods. Over\nthe years, the International Monetary Fund has moved\nfrom the supervision of a fixed exchange rate system to\nassisting developing countries through financial crises,\nwhile the World Bank has made the transition from post-\nwar reconstruction to funding development in the third\nworld. Now is an opportune time to reassess their\nrespective roles, given new global dynamics and changing\npatterns of trade and investment. The Fund and the Bank\nneed to quickly adapt to the current global economic\nsystem if they are to remain relevant to contemporary\nrealities.\nTwo important conferences were held this year\nwhich offered opportunities for international attention and\naction. In Barbados, the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates adopted a programme of action which now requires\nthe support and assistance of the United Nations system\nand the donor community for its speedy and effective\nimplementation. The recently concluded International\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo\nproduced a landmark document highlighting the\ninextricable linkage between population, sustained\neconomic growth and sustained development. Next year\nin Copenhagen, the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment will endeavour to adopt a global approach\nto the eradication of poverty, the generation of productive\nemployment and the enhancement of social integration.\nWe will also meet in Beijing at the Fourth World\nConference on Women to continue to put in place\nmeasures which will create an enabling environment for\nwomen. Jamaica will actively participate in these\nimportant processes.\nI have chosen to focus at the outset on what Jamaica\nsees as the development imperative and priorities of the\nUnited Nations because we are convinced that the path to\ndevelopment and the path to peace are one and the same.\nJamaica fully supports an open, non-discriminatory\ntrading system governed by transparent rules and with an\neffective mechanism for settling disputes. We therefore\nawait the implementation of the conclusions of the\nUruguay Round and the establishment of the World Trade\nOrganization. We will work actively within the new\norganization to ensure the promotion of development\nthrough trade, placing special importance on those\n11\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nprovisions in the conclusions of the Uruguay Round which\nseek to ensure a regime of fairness and equity in the overall\ncontext of a programme of free trade.\nThe international community and its institutions are\ndynamic. The choice is whether we actively shape the\nchange that inevitably comes with the passing of time and\nwith new circumstances, or whether we merely react to\nevents. The World Trade Organization is an example of\npurposeful design by the international community. Yet\nanother \u2014 a truly historic one \u2014 is the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. As is widely known,\nthe Convention, which establishes a regulatory mechanism\nfor the oceans, the seas and their resources, will enter into\nforce on 16 November of this year. The inaugural meeting\nof the International Seabed Authority will be held in\nKingston on that date. This will be both an end and a\nbeginning. The event will mark the end of a process that\nbegan nearly twenty years ago and the opening of a new\nand historic chapter in international juridical and economic\nrelations.\nThe inaugural meeting will see the establishment of\nthe International Seabed Authority. We are extremely\nproud that Jamaica will host this important organization,\nwhich has responsibility for regulating and exploiting the\nworld\u2019s vastest resource base. It must be emphasized,\nhowever, that the success of the Authority will require the\ncooperation of all parties concerned, in order to ensure that\nthe goal of universality is achieved. It is important that the\nAuthority receive the necessary resources to enable it to\noperate effectively, in a way consistent with principles and\npractices applied to institutions within the United Nations\nsystem.\nI wish again to pay tribute to those who have\ncontributed to the United Nations Convention on the Law\nof the Sea, to its ratification and to the establishment of the\nInternational Seabed Authority.\nWe invite all States to join in the momentous first\nmeeting of the Authority in Kingston from 16 to 18\nNovember. We look forward to welcoming the Secretary-\nGeneral of this Organization, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, who has graciously accepted the invitation\nof the Government of Jamaica to be at the inaugural\nmeeting.\nSince I spoke to this body last year, the Republic of\nSouth Africa has resumed its seat in the General Assembly.\nThe installation of a majority government in that country,\nunder the leadership of President Nelson Mandela, is a\nhistoric development of which the entire international\ncommunity is justifiably proud. The dismantling of\napartheid was a consequence of the long and valiant\nstruggle waged by the South African people. It was also\na victory for multilateralism and an important reminder of\nthe critical role that multilateral organizations such as the\nUnited Nations can play in resolving difficult international\nissues. The Government and the people of Jamaica\nwelcome a non-racial, democratic South Africa into the\ninternational community of nations.\nIn our own region, the situation in Haiti has been of\ngreat concern to Jamaica and our Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) partners. The wanton abuse of human\nrights that led to the death of Haitians within Haiti and of\nmany of those who fled in unsafe vessels simply had to\nstop.\nWe welcome the most recent developments in Haiti\nand the reaffirmation by the international community of\nits commitment to the Governors Island Accord. There\ncan be no deviation from the critical elements to which\nwe subscribed. The recent Security Council resolution\nsends a strong signal to the military authorities that the\ninternational community will accept no less than the\nprompt return of the legitimately elected President, the\nrestoration of the constitutional authority of the\nGovernment of Haiti, the reform of the army and the\npolice force, and the building of lasting democratic\ninstitutions. Jamaica, along with several of our\nCARICOM partners, is playing its part in this process by\nparticipating in the multinational force and in the United\nNations Mission in Haiti.\nDevelopments in Haiti have underscored the wisdom\nof the philosophy of the countries of the Caribbean that\nmaintaining peace and stability, within the context of\ndemocratic institutions and practices, must be the\nfundamental basis for the development of our region.\nWithin the wider Latin American and Caribbean region,\nwe are actively strengthening and widening cooperation\namong our countries. The establishment of the\nAssociation of Caribbean States (ACS) in July of this\nyear was a historic development that provides for even\nstronger collaboration and cooperation.\nWe hope that in the interest of the entire region, a\nprocess of sustained dialogue and accommodation\nbetween Cuba and the United States can be initiated, and\nthat this will lead to conditions that permit the eventual\nfull reintegration of Cuba into the region and into the\nhemispheric community. Jamaica welcomes the call\n12\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nmade by the Rio Group at its recent Eighth Summit\nmeeting for the lifting of the trade embargo against Cuba.\nThe trade and economic prospects of countries in the\nregion can be strengthened only by the priority now being\naccorded to regional and hemispheric relations and by the\ngrowing role, actual wand envisioned, for regional and\nsubregional organizations, such as CARICOM and the\nnewly established ACS, as well as by arrangements such as\nthe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In\nthe case of NAFTA, which we support strongly, Jamaica\nand other participants in the Caribbean Basin Initiative\n(CBI) programme continue to press for the adoption, by the\nUnited States Congress of the Interim Trade programme,\nwhich would significantly offset adverse consequences on\nexisting conditions of access under the CBI.\nI feel compelled to return in these final comments to\nthe mission of this Organization \u2014 peace and development.\nThere can be little cause for comfort when, since 1945, 20\nmillion people have died in wars and other conflicts. It is\ndisturbing and instructive to learn that some 80 million\npersons now live in foreign lands, and that a million\npersons immigrate permanently each year, while another\nmillion seek political asylum as they flee both poverty and\ninternal strife. The increasing flows of refugees and\ndisplaced persons worldwide threaten peace and stability\nand exacerbate tensions and conflicts between countries and\nin entire regions. We must strengthen international\ncooperation in this area and streamline national and\ninternational procedures for dealing with this grave\nproblem.\nTo be true to its mission, the United Nations must be\nan Organization that reduces both want and war. This is\nwhy I underscored earlier my delegation\u2019s strong belief that\nthis Organization must become increasingly active in the\npromotion of long-term development, which is the\nnecessary underpinning of a genuine and lasting peace.\nThe United Nations must not shrink from this aspect of its\nmission.\nThe military and ideological realignment of recent\nyears has created new opportunities for peace. But these\nunprecedented developments must be supported by\ninstitutional reforms and by new approaches on our part.\nThese institutional reforms must inevitably include the\nreform of the Security Council, the principal organ charged\nwith the maintenance of international peace and security.\nIn this regard, Jamaica fully supports the call for its\nenlargement. We believe that the Security Council must be\ntruly representative in order to be fully effective.\nExpenditure on armaments continues to consume\nresources and to divert spending away from human\ndevelopment needs in both developed and developing\ncountries. Military downsizing, particularly by\ndeveloping countries, has yet to gather the momentum\nthat was expected at the end of the cold war. The United\nNations has a legitimate role to play in providing\ntechnical and other assistance to help developing and\nother countries shift human and material resources from\nmilitary to civilian use. We note that the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council are also the world\u2019s\nleading exporters of conventional weapons. This is an\nissue that should be addressed both in terms of reducing\narms exports, as well as in terms of converting the\nresources to the requirements of peace and development.\nIt would be remiss of me if I concluded my\ncontribution to this debate without referring to the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, to be celebrated next\nyear. As we all prepare for this historic occasion, we\nmust reflect on the fact that this achievement is in itself\na vindication of the principles on which the Organization\nwas founded. If we are to survive beyond that milestone\nwe must remain steadfast to these principles.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, Sir, please allow me, on behalf of\nmy country, my delegation and speaking for myself, to join\nprevious speakers in most warmly congratulating you and,\nthrough you, your country on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. Your excellent qualifications, extensive\nexperience, wisdom and detailed knowledge of international\naffairs, give us confidence in that you will guide the\ndeliberations at this session to successful conclusions.\nI should like to take this opportunity also to express\nour gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor,\nMr. Samuel Insanally, for the important role he played in\nthe forty-eighth session and for his tireless activity\nthroughout it. Similarly, fairness compels us to express our\nadmiration and great appreciation to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his invaluable and\nunremitting efforts since he took up his post, to increase the\nimportance of the United Nations, make it more effective\nand maximize its ability to carry out its duties properly, and\nthereby to increase the confidence of mankind in general,\nand every nation in particular, in the credibility of this\nOrganization\u2019s commitment to the purposes and principles\nof its Charter. Foremost among those is the maintenance\nof peace and security on the basis of justice and equality.\nIt is our hope that he will continue to play his role with the\nsame enthusiasm and high-mindedness.\nHaving studied the annual report on the work of the\nOrganization, which we have all received, we can say it is\ncomprehensive and accurate. The Secretary-General\ndeserves our gratitude and appreciation for the outstanding\neffort he has put into drawing up that report, and in\npresenting it in such a satisfactory form. However, we\nshould like to make some remarks on the references made\nin the report with regard to Yemen.\nAs members are aware, our country, the Republic of\nYemen, was earlier this year exposed to bloody sedition as\na result of a dangerous conspiracy on the part of a handful\nof treacherous mercenary elements who chose to isolate\nthemselves from the rest of their fellow countrymen, to\nrebel against legitimate institutions, overturn constitutional\nlegality and trample on the Constitution, law and order,\nwith the aim of destroying the unity of the country, burying\nit alive and aborting our experiment in democracy based on\npolitical and party pluralism, which was successful despite\nthe shortness of the period during which it has been in\nplace.\nFirst, I should like to point out that history shows\nthat throughout the ages our country, Yemen, has always\nbeen a single political unit, with the exception of a few\nperiods of varying lengths during which it was subjected\nto division or segmentation. Sometimes this was the\nresult of a power struggle, and sometimes the result of\ntotal or partial occupation by one or more foreign powers.\nHowever, it was never long before Yemen regained its\nunity at the hands of its own people, who never lost sight\nof the fact that they are a single Muslim, Arab, Yemeni\npeople, and never forgot for one moment that they\nbelonged to one nation. Throughout the earlier decades\nof this century, wherein our people struggled against the\ndictatorial rule of the Imam in the North and British\ncolonialism in the South, the unity of Yemen was the\nloftiest ideal of our people and its dearest national\naspiration. Even after another State was established in\nthe South once it became independent of the United\nKingdom on 30 November 1967, and after the revolution\nof 26 September 1962 in the North, which swept away\nthe reactionary rule of the royalist Imam and replaced it\nwith a republic, the return to Yemen of unity in the form\nof a single State remained an all-embracing, popular and\ninsistent demand. Our people never accepted that the\nseparation should continue once its national soil had been\nliberated from the yoke of occupation. They persisted in\nrefusing to accept that abnormal situation and in resisting\nit by every means. Each of the two former Yemeni\nStates adopted a name which emphasized the fact that it\nbelonged to one State called Yemen. Their rejection of\npartition led each of those States to refer to the other as\nits \u201cother half\u201d.\n\nAwareness of this strength of feeling among all our\npeople in support of the unity of Yemen and of their\nrejection of partition made the successive leaders in both\nSana\u2019a and Aden spare no effort in vying with each other\nand pressuring each other on the question of unity. This\nled to two outbreaks of hostilities between the two parts,\nthe first in 1972 and the second in 1979 and, throughout,\ntension and conflict between them persisted and continued\nto flare up from time to time.\nHowever, developments since the beginning of\n1986 \u2014 starting with the tragic civil strife between the\npartners in power in the South and the comrades of the\nSocialist Party, the sole ruling party, followed by the\npolicy changes in the Soviet Union culminating in the fall\nof regimes in the countries of what used to be called the\n16\n\n\nsocialist, or Eastern, bloc and, finally, the end of the cold\nwar \u2014 all this created the right conditions for re-uniting\nYemen.\nAnother factor was that the regime in the South, which\nhad been tightly linked to the Soviet Union and its socialist-\ncountry allies, found itself unable to oppose internal and\nexternal enemies without strong international backing. It\nwas therefore possible to agree to unite the two halves of\nthe country on 30 November 1989, during President\nLieutenant-General Ali Abdullah Saleh\u2019s visit to Aden on\nthe twenty-second anniversary of the South\u2019s independence,\nand to persuade the then ruling Socialist Party leadership to\naccept unification.\nOn 22 May 1990 unity was peacefully and voluntarily\nestablished in the form of a single State called the Republic\nof Yemen, a Republic based on democracy and pluralism.\nThe first general parliamentary elections were scheduled to\ntake place at the end of a period of transition of two and a\nhalf years, during which time Yemen was to be governed\njointly by elements drawn from the leadership of each of\nthe previous two \u201chalves\u201d of the country. However, as\ntime passed and the agreed date for the scheduled\nparliamentary elections drew near, some high Government\nofficials from the leadership of the Socialist Party \u2014 the\nother governing partner at that time \u2014 began to create\nproblems and crises in order to prevent the holding of\nelections on the agreed date. As a result, the elections were\npostponed from November 1992 to 27 April 1993.\nThe elections, when they finally took place, were\nindeed free and fair, as was attested to by all those who\ntook part in monitoring them. Those monitors included\nrepresentatives of States, organizations and institutes\nconcerned with democracy and the protection of human\nrights and freedoms, side by side with journalists and\ncorrespondents from Arab and non-Arab news agencies. In\nan editorial published at the time of the elections, The New\nYork Times described them as\n\u201ca true revolution in the furthest part of the Southern\nArabian peninsula\u201d.\nDespite the fact that the results of the election gave\nthe General People\u2019s Congress, under the leadership of His\nExcellency President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Chairman of the\nPresidential Council at that time, the sole right to form a\nGovernment, the President and his party favoured a\ncoalition with the other two important parties: the Islah\nparty, the Yemeni Alliance for Reform (YAR) and the\nYemeni Socialist Party. This was inspired by a genuine\ndesire to strengthen the bonds of national consensus, to\nguarantee secure foundations and support for the\nsuccessful establishment of national unity, particularly in\nits early stages, and to guarantee continuity and survival\nfor a democratic experiment which was still in its cradle.\nThey also aimed at preventing conspirators and\nopportunists from having any leeway to exacerbate\ndisagreements or provoke armed conflict.\nOnly a few weeks after the formation of the\ncoalition Government, on 31 May of that year, while the\nfreely and directly elected Parliament was preparing to\ncarry out its work and discharge its duties, there began to\nappear certain indications that a suspect plot was being\nhatched. It was clear that elements of the leadership of\nthe partner in the governing coalition, the Socialist Party,\nwho held important positions in the constitutional\ninstitutions and, more precisely, in the Presidential\nCouncil and the Cabinet of Ministers, were behind the\nplan. The prevailing belief was that the matter was\nnothing more than an attempt to exert pressure in order to\nextract more concessions and a bargaining chip they used\nto obtain more government posts or, in the very least, to\nmaintain positions in the Presidential Council when it was\nre-elected, if that was decided. Again, it could have been\nan attempt to secure the post of Vice-President of the\nRepublic if the form of the Presidency of the State was\ngoing to be changed from a Presidential Council to a\nrepublican presidency. Naturally, the results of the\ngeneral elections did not suit the ruling elements of the\nSocialist Party, despite their sharing in power and the\nimportant leading positions they held. That was perhaps\ndue to their addiction to being the sole ruling centralized\ntotalitarian authority, their love of ruling without partners\nand the fact that they lacked belief in the country\u2019s unity,\nand had no deep-rooted confidence in democracy, political\npluralism or in free direct elections.\nSuddenly, without any reason or justification, in\naccordance with a carefully planned time-table, those\nelements created a political crisis, and matters reached the\npoint where an attempt was made to ruin or at least to\nparalyse the institutions and apparatus of the State and to\nusurp the constitutional legality derived from the will of\nthe people through the ballot box and replace it with a\nlegality derived from decisions taken as result of dialogue\nbetween different parties. Those conspiring elements\nwere not satisfied with that, despite the grave risks\ninvolved. Rather, their arrogance and disregard of\nlegality were carried to the point of wanting to impose\ntheir tutelage over the people and to impose an\nundeclared partition through the continual use of an\n17\n\n\niron-fist policy and absolute control over a number of\nGovernorates, which they used to rule by force and\noppression in the days before unification.\nDespite all the generous concessions that continued to\nbe made from time to time by the leadership of the\nmajority, under the direction of His Excellency President\nAli Abdullah Saleh, who was at that time Chairman of the\nPresidential Council, the elements bent on separatism\nstepped up their challenge and their disregard of\nconstitutional legality to the point of triggering hostilities in\nthe hope of bringing Arab or international forces to separate\nthe combatants and force each side to withdraw beyond the\nold borders dividing the two halves. Their aim was to put\nan end to unification, to declare another separate State on\npart of the territory of the homeland, and thereby to revert\nto the situation that existed before 22 May 1990.\nHowever, our people stood behind our armed forces\nand security forces, whose loyalty set them squarely on the\nside of legality. Those forces were able to turn the fighting\ndecisively in favour of unity and democracy, and by so\ndoing were able to abort the suspect plot and to maintain\nYemen as the unified single State it has been throughout its\nlong history.\nToday, Yemen has regained its stability and ensured\nits security, after that ordeal, and has put an end to sedition.\nA general amnesty has been declared, and national\nreconciliation has been achieved. Those who fell prey to\ndeceit and disinformation have returned to the nation to\nparticipate in political life, and they benefit from the spirit\nof tolerance which characterizes the political leadership of\nPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh. Here I should like to\nemphasize to you and to the Secretary-General that no harm\nhas befallen any of those people and that none of them has\nbeen put on trial. Most of them have gone back to their\nnormal lives quite naturally. That was not all: the Socialist\nParty itself spontaneously elected a new leadership which\ncontained many elements of the former leadership, and\nwent back to participating in political activity in complete\nfreedom. Its representatives in parliament participate in\nparliamentary life just as they did before.\nWithin the framework of the leadership\u2019s attempts to\nensure the success and continued progress of our\ndemocratic experiment, and in order to expand the basis of\npopular power sharing, the elected parliament, on 27\nSeptember 1994, unanimously passed a number of\nconstitutional amendments which provide for the\nintroduction of a local governmental system based on the\nprinciple of free and fair elections. They also decided to\ncreate a consultative council to be established by\nrepublican decree from experienced and highly qualified\npersonalities from various regions of Yemen to widen and\nexpand the basis of representation and opinion.\nLast Saturday, 1 October 1994, the Chamber of\nDeputies \u2014 again in complete freedom \u2014 elected\nLieutenant General Ali Abdullah Saleh President of the\nRepublic in accordance with the amendment approved by\nthe Parliament regarding the organization of the national\npresidency, which was amongst those constitutional\namendments.\nOur choice of the democratic option based on\npolitical and party pluralism was not the result of pressure\nfrom any side, rather it was motivated by our conviction\nthat democracy is the best contemporary method of\ngovernment. It represents the path leading to\ndevelopment, progress, security and stability. However,\nthe continued success of our democratic experiment\nremains subject to economic growth. That requires an\nend to the economic war that continues to be waged\nagainst our country. This is a war which takes many\ndifferent forms, including the closing of markets in other\ncountries of the region to our agricultural and industrial\nproducts. We therefore appeal to all our brethren in\nneighboring countries to lift all the barriers and remove\nall the obstacles to free trade and the movement of locally\nproduced goods as an important step towards the\nnormalization of relations, and the strengthening of\nbrotherly ties and regional cooperation.\nAs an extension of the national reconciliation\nprocess which we have begun to implement within\nYemen, despite all the events which have taken place,\nhand in hand with that and in the same spirit, we call\nupon all neighboring countries to respond positively to\nour sincere initiative, to end the causes of dispute and\nresume normal relations, which will strengthen security\nand stability in the Arabian Peninsula region, based on\ngood-neighborliness, mutual respect and non-interference\nin internal affairs. The Republic of Yemen has an\nimportant geographical and strategic position, as\nrepresented by its control over Bab al-Mandab, and the\nRed Sea and the Arabian Sea, which meet in its territorial\nwaters in the Gulf of Aden. The Republic of Yemen is\naware of its responsibilities and of the importance of the\nrole it plays in the maintenance of security and stability\nin the Arabian Peninsula region, of the Gulf in particular,\nand the world in general.\n18\n\n\nIn this context, we would like to appeal to the Security\nCouncil to lift the sanctions which are still in place against\nIraq after such a long time, as the justifications for such\nsanctions no longer exist. The suffering of the Iraqi people\nhas reached intolerable levels. Insistence on maintaining\nsuch measures will lead to deepening enmity and hatred\nbetween the States of the region. It is necessary to turn a\nnew leaf and have recourse to dialogue in order to ensure\nthe security and safety of all sides concerned, in a spirit of\nlove and fraternity, and on the basis of respect for the\nindependence and sovereignty and legal rights of every\nparty.\nOn the basis of our membership in a wider nation, we\nfeel impelled to appeal to the Security Council to review its\nresolutions against Libya, our sister country, and accept the\nreasonable solutions put forward by the Arab League,\nwhich include the trial of the Lockerbie suspects before an\ninternational court, in accordance with the law of Scotland.\nWith regard to the three islands disputed by the United\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran, we would\nlike to ask both countries to work towards resolving this\ndispute between them through dialogue and mutual\nunderstanding based on respect for legitimate rights in\naccordance with legal evidence.\nIt is very important indeed that cooperation and\ncoordination between the United Nations and the League of\nArab States should be strengthened, in the interests of the\nArab world in particular, and of the rest of the world in\ngeneral.\nThe Middle East peace process has so far achieved an\nagreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization\nand Israel on the one hand, and Jordan and Israel on the\nother. However, a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in\nthe region remains linked to the withdrawal of Israeli forces\nfrom the Golan Heights and South Lebanon, the\nrenunciation of the logic of power by the Tel Aviv\ngovernment, and its acceptance of an independent\nPalestinian State in Gaza and the West Bank, including\nHoly Al Quds.\nWe cannot forget our beloved brotherly Sudan. We\nunderscore the need to respect and safeguard its unity and\ncall for commitment to help it maintain that unity both on\nthe territorial and the human levels.\nThe fact that our sister country Somalia remains in the\ngrip of fragmentation, anarchy and fighting, is deeply\ndistressing to us and makes our hearts bleed. We will do\nall we can to help our neighbour and its fraternal, Arab,\nMuslim people to emerge from its terrible trial, by\nparticipating with other fraternal countries in the\nCommittee which it was decided to form by the last\nsession of the Arab Foreign Ministers which was held in\nCairo. We hope this Committee will receive the\ncooperation of the United Nations.\nIt is also a cause of deep sorrow that the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina remains a target of terrible\naggression and continuous shelling by the Serb\naggressors, while the world does nothing but make\nstatements and threaten to take measures which have yet\nto materialize. Perhaps the least that could be done as a\nfirst step towards showing some determination in the face\nof Serb persistent disregard for peace and security in that\nimportant region, their trampling of the resolutions of\ninternational legality, would be to immediately lift the\narms embargo and to begin to supply arms to the people\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, to enable them to defend\nthemselves against aggression.\nWe have become ever more convinced that right will\ntriumph over injustice, the same as the people of South\nAfrica have done by eliminating apartheid and racial\ndiscrimination following such a long arduous struggle.\nWe would like to express our happiness at seeing this\nnew African State among us. We should also like to\nexpress to the pioneer of freedom fighters, President\nNelson Mandela, our appreciation and respect. May we\nwish him all success and progress in leading his country,\nparticularly after leading his people a phase of struggle\nwith courage, resistance and steadfastness.\nIt is important to mention here before concluding my\nstatement, that the accusations against Islam and judging\nIslam from the point of view of certain acts of terrorism\ntaking place here or there because there are others who\nare not Muslims who perpetuate acts of terrorism in\nvarious parts of the world without having any accusations\nlevelled against their religions or their creeds. We\ntherefore believe that we should all stand against any\nattempt to distort the concept and image of Islam and\nagainst any allegations against it because Islam is a\nreligion which rejects violence and terrorism, a religion\nthat calls for love, coexistence and peace.\nIn order to show its respect and appreciation for the\nUnited Nations, the Republic of Yemen has formed a\nnational committee to organize celebrations for the fiftieth\nanniversary of the founding of this international\n19\n\n\nOrganization. We want our celebrations on this occasion\nto reflect the importance we attach to it.\nWe should not miss the opportunity to refer also to the\nimportance of working to enlarge the representative base of\nthe Security Council, so as to take into consideration the\ninternational changes that have taken place since the\nestablishment of the United Nations. One of the most\nimportant of these is the emergence of two major economic\npowers - Japan and Germany. They should join the\nSecurity Council as permanent members. There should also\nbe just, permanent representation of regional groupings,\nincluding the Arab region.\nFinally, we hope that the fiftieth anniversary of this\nOrganization will be an incentive for renewing the vitality\nand effectiveness of the United Nations, and an\nintensification of its role, in order to achieve the aims of\nthe Charter in the light of the needs and requirements of the\nnew international changes.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Nigerian\ndelegation, I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session. Your election is a tribute not only to\nyou personally and to your great country, but to Africa as\na whole. As a representative of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, a country\nwith which Nigeria enjoys excellent and brotherly\nrelations, you have our full confidence in your ability to\nsuccessfully discharge the responsibilities of your high\noffice.\nI wish to express our sincere appreciation to your\npredecessor, Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for the\nadmirable and effective manner in which he conducted\nthe business of the forty-eighth session.\nLet me also commend our esteemed\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the\npurposeful manner in which he has discharged the duties\nof his office.\nMy Government heartily welcomes South Africa\nback to the General Assembly. For decades, the policy of\napartheid kept that great country from participating in the\nwork of the Assembly. Happily, apartheid has now been\nconsigned to history. We salute all those who identified\nwith, and contributed to, the long struggle to eradicate\napartheid and racism in South Africa. A special tribute\nmust be paid to our brothers and sisters in South Africa\nwho were the direct victims of that evil system and who\nled the struggle for its eradication.\nWe commend the vision and statesmanship of\nPresident Nelson Mandela for his effective leadership in\nmanaging so skilfully the transition of a once-divided\nsociety to a united, non-racial, democratic nation. We\ncommend the courage and the untiring efforts of his\nGovernment and the entire people of South Africa to heal\nthe wounds of the past and launch their country on the\npath of economic growth and prosperity on a foundation\nof justice and equity for all its citizens. We are confident\n11\n\n\nthat the new South Africa will contribute positively to the\nwork of the United Nations.\nIn the last few years we have witnessed rapid and\nprofound changes on the international scene. Not only have\ncomplex challenges arisen, but also new opportunities for\nthe United Nations to redouble its efforts and contributions\nto the quest for peace and security and to build a world\ncharacterized by cooperation and an international\ncommunity nurtured by a common concern for humanity.\nIt is a matter of serious concern that the peaceful\nworld expected to be ushered in by the end of the cold war\nhas not materialized. The world continues to face some of\nthe worst forms of conflict and new threats to international\npeace and security. Violent conflicts arising from resurgent\nnationalism and religious intolerance between and within\nStates have proliferated. The unresolved situations in\nRwanda, Liberia, Somalia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, parts of\nthe former Yugoslavia and parts of the former Soviet Union\nhave caused wanton loss of life and destruction to property\nand have given rise to humanitarian crises of immense\nproportions. We must find early and lasting solutions to\nthese conflicts, as they constitute continuing threats to\nregional stability and to world peace.\nAgainst this backdrop, the United Nations, as the focal\npoint of international cooperation, should seek to redefine\nits role and establish new structures and mechanisms that\ncan respond effectively to the challenges of crisis\nmanagement and conflict resolution. The United Nations\nmust retain its primary responsibility for taking the lead in\naddressing these problems. The Secretary-General\u2019s\nAgenda for Peace provides a novel and imaginative\nframework towards this end.\nIn the emerging world order Africa must not continue\nto remain a continent beset with crises and dependent on\nothers for resolution of its internal conflicts. In realization\nof this, the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nestablished in 1993 a Central Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention, Resolution and Management. However, it is\nevident that the OAU\u2019s capacity to effectively mobilize the\nrequired financial and logistic resources for this purpose is\nseverely limited. There is, therefore, a necessity for the\ninternational community and the United Nations to\nencourage, through increased financial and logistic support,\nAfrica\u2019s efforts at peaceful settlements of disputes through\nregional and other arrangements, in accordance with the\nUnited Nations Charter. We urge the international\ncommunity to contribute urgently and generously to the\nAfrica Peace Fund, established by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity.\nThe capacity of the United Nations to respond\npromptly and effectively to the demands made on it for\npeace-keeping operations depends on the willingness of\nMember States to accept that there is a primary role for\nthe United Nations and that they be ready to contribute\nthe necessary resources to enable it to fulfil such a role.\nSince our admission 34 years ago, Nigeria has been an\nactive participant in global efforts at peace-keeping,\nconflict resolution and crisis management. Our\nexperience over the years has convinced us that there is\na clear need to re-examine and reorient the peace-keeping\nefforts of the United Nations. Since initiating in Liberia\nthe Economic Community of West African States Military\nObserver Group (ECOMOG), a subregional peace-keeping\nforce, Nigeria has become Africa\u2019s and, indeed, the\nworld\u2019s largest troop contributor to international\npeace-keeping operations. Even though one or two\nMember States may choose not to recognize its\ncontribution, the records at the disposal of this\nOrganization will clearly show Nigeria\u2019s significant\ncontribution to the shared responsibility of global peace-\nkeeping, with its attendant sacrifices, including loss of\nNigerian lives.\nThat is why we are concerned at the incessant\nharassment, kidnapping and killing of peace-keeping\npersonnel in various theatres of conflict. As an\nencouragement to other countries to participate in these\ncostly and often dangerous operations, the United Nations\nmust develop a capacity of effective deterrence against\nsuch attacks and adopt appropriate measures to provide\nprompt and adequate compensation for the victims.\nOne of the disturbing consequences of the\nproliferation of conflicts is the increasing incidence of\nrefugees and displaced persons. It is our firm conviction\nthat Governments must create structures and suitable\nconditions which will enable peoples to live in a secure\nand safe environment in full enjoyment of their human\nrights and fundamental freedoms. Regrettably, Africa has\nthe largest number of refugees and displaced persons in\nthe world. This imposes additional and enormous\nfinancial, material and social burdens on the already\ndistressed economies of receiving States. We commend\nthe efforts of the international community in addressing\nthe refugee problems through the provision of\nhumanitarian assistance. We call on all Governments to\neradicate the root causes of the existence of refugees and\ndisplaced persons and to create the appropriate conditions\n12\n\n\nfor facilitating their voluntary return to their various\ncountries.\nDespite the end of the cold war, nuclear weapons\ncontinue to pose the greatest threat to international peace\nand security. Consequently, the need to reduce substantially\nand ultimately eliminate them must remain our primary\ngoal. Recent reports of a rising trend of trafficking in\nnuclear materials represent a disturbing new dimension to\nnuclear proliferation which must be checked as a matter of\nurgency.\nNext year\u2019s review and extension conference of the\nnon-proliferation Treaty, which has so far served the\ninternational community rather well, must be pursued with\nvigour. The review and extension of the Treaty must be\nconsistent with objective reality and the basic expectations\nof Member States.\nQuestions of peace and security are inextricably linked\nto issues of development. We therefore welcome the\npresentation by the Secretary-General of \\\"An Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\" (A/48/935), which is a fitting complement to\nhis earlier proposals in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277).\nIn \\\"An Agenda for Development\\\", the Secretary-General\nhas identified five strands: peace as the foundation for\ndevelopment; the economy as the engine of progress; the\nenvironment as a basis for sustainability; justice as a pillar\nof society; and democracy as good governance. Nigeria\nwelcomes these presentations because we believe that the\npeople must be at the centre of all governmental activity,\nincluding the goals of development, peace and security.\nGlobal efforts in addressing the crisis of development\nhave, over the years, reflected a dichotomy of perception\nbetween the industrialized countries of the North and the\ndeveloping countries of the South. We must recognize that\ndevelopment, like peace, is indivisible. It is therefore of\nvital importance that the North and the South should see\ncooperation in development in terms of mutuality of interest\nand partnership. The expectation that the end of the cold\nwar would make more resources available for development,\nespecially in developing countries, has regrettably remained\nunfulfilled. In the circumstances, the international\ncommunity should initiate bold and imaginative measures\nto bridge the widening gap between the rich and the poor\nnations. Affluence in the midst of poverty provides neither\npeace nor security either to the rich or to the poor.\nAfrica continues to face grave economic difficulties,\nat the heart of which is the debt crisis. The perennial\nproblems of declining investment, capital flight and fall in\ncommodity prices remain. The response of the\ninternational community has been feeble and rather\ninadequate. The United Nations Programme of Action for\nAfrica\u2019s Economic Recovery and Development\n(UNPAAERD) did not achieve its desired objectives. It\ndoes not appear that the New Agenda for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment in the 1990s will meet with much success\neither. It is therefore imperative that Africa should be\nenabled to make a fresh start to address these problems\neffectively through an imaginative solution to the debt\ncrisis and the diversification of its economies.\nFor our part, we recognize the need for credible\nmacro-economic policies, as well as for fundamental\nreforms of our political institutions and processes, and we\nare taking measures in this regard. However, there is a\nneed to evolve new mechanisms and strategies for\ninternational cooperation and partnership.\nIn the wake of the efforts made in structurally\nreforming our economy and the democratizion of our\npolitical institutions, Nigeria, like many other African\ncountries, has come to grips with certain realities, the\nramifications of which are usually misconstrued and need\nto be fully understood.\nPolitical pluralism, as a facet of democratization, is\nso deeply ingrained in our national way of life that over\nthe years we have tried to evolve appropriate democratic\ninstitutions and values arising from and responding to our\nspecific national experiences, circumstances and\naspirations. We remain committed to this process, which\nis on course, despite its difficulties and challenges.\nToo often the process of democratization in Nigeria\nand, indeed, in several other parts of Africa, has not been\ncorrectly presented to the international community.\nRecent advances in information technology and our lack\nof resources and capacity for information delivery have\nhampered our ability to objectively project developments\noccurring in our societies. For instance, in Nigeria, we\ncontinue to make impressive progress in rebuilding\nsustainable democratic structures and institutions. A\nConstitutional Conference whose members were largely\nelected and representing a wide spectrum of our society\nand diverse interests, has been working assiduously to\ncreate an environment conducive to mutual trust,\nconfidence and common purpose among our people. The\nobjective of the Conference is to establish appropriate\nmodalities, institutions and frameworks for a viable\ndemocratic order, by laying down the ground rules for the\nformation of political parties, and for conducting free and\n13\n\n\nfair elections at all levels of government. The\nConstitutional Conference will complete its work by\nNovember 1994. Following the progress made so far,\npolitical activities have already commenced and full-fledged\npolitical party activities leading to general elections will\ncommence early in the new year. The resolve and\ncommitment of the Nigerian people and Government to\ndemocracy remain firm and unshakeable in the full\nrealization that the task of democratization is primarily our\nresponsibility and is for the good of our people.\nThe United Nations has no doubt distinguished itself\nsince its inception as an indispensable forum for\nharmonizing the actions of nations. We are confident that\nit will continue to serve in the years ahead as a platform for\ngalvanizing and channelling our collective efforts towards\nlasting peace and justice. This is especially so if we look\ninwards with a view to revitalizing and strengthening the\nOrganization itself. The Government of Nigeria endorses\nthe view of the Secretary-General in his report \\\"An Agenda\nfor Peace\\\" to the effect that to meet the challenges of a new\nera, the United Nations must reinforce its capacity to\nrespond as well as to reorient its approach to issues which\nconfront it. We subscribe to his recommendation that\nMember States provide the necessary political commitment\nand financial resources to enable the Organization to\nexpand, adapt and reinvigorate its work.\nThe reforms undertaken by our Organization so far\nhave been essentially piecemeal and incremental. We have\nmade it clear on several occasions that the time was ripe\nfor a fundamental restructuring of the United Nations\nsystem. The present composition and the decision-making\nprocess of the Security Council do not adequately reflect\ncurrent realities brought into sharp relief since the end of\nthe cold war. As an instrument for multilateral cooperation,\nthe United Nations must be transparent, efficient and\ndemocratic.\nThe Security Council, as the most important organ of\nthe United Nations, should embody the global quest for\ndemocratization in its structure, composition and\ndecision-making processes. In this regard, Nigeria attaches\nparticular importance to the work of the Open-Ended\nWorking Group on the question of equitable representation\non and increase in the membership of the Security Council.\nIt is our expectation that the recommendations that will\nemerge will make the United Nations more responsive to\nthe needs of the international community. We also expect\nthat the criteria for permanent membership of the Council\nshould include such considerations as population, capacity\nto contribute to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, and a track record assessed over a period of time\nin international peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts.\nAll permanent members should enjoy the same status and\nprivileges and assume the responsibilities incumbent on\nmembership. No less important is the imperative of\nequitable geographical representation, which must include\npermanent membership for Africa in the Security Council.\nIn this connection, it is appropriate that I reconfirm\nNigeria\u2019s offer to serve the international community as a\npermanent member of the Security Council.\nIn this last decade of the twentieth century, two\nissues have preoccupied the United Nations: the\npromotion of peace and security and the intensification of\ninternational cooperation for development. On both\nissues, the United Nations has responded to our collective\naspirations with varying degrees of success. As we\napproach the twenty-first century, we must dedicate\nourselves anew to the full realization of these core goals\nand objectives of our Organization so that mankind can\nenjoy peace, freedom and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me to extend my delegation\u2019s\ncongratulations to you and your country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on\nthe occasion of your election to the high office of the\npresidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session. There is absolutely no doubt in my\nmind that with your proven diplomatic skills and\nconsiderable experience the affairs of the General Assembly\nwill be conducted in a manner that will redound to the\ncredit of this institution. At the same time I must express\nmy delegation\u2019s heartfelt appreciation and thanks to your\nimmediate predecessor in office, Ambassador Samuel\nInsanally, for the competence which he demonstrated in the\ndischarge of his duties. His commendable performance is\na source of pride to me as it is to all citizens of the\nCaribbean region.\n(spoke in French)\nI am very happy that we are here with you today,\nSir.\n(spoke in English)\nWhile the maintenance of peace and security remains\nthe main objective of the United Nations, the global\nenvironment, the widening gap between rich and poor\nnations, the failure of the ill-defined new world order to\nmaterialize, and the forces released by the ending of the\ncold war present the Organization with new problems and\nchallenges. As regional conflicts erupt, the consequential\nincrease in the number of displaced persons and refugees\nexerts greater pressure on the United Nations peace-\nkeeping apparatus at a time when its available resources\nare already severely taxed. It is imperative, therefore,\nthat the United Nations continue with its restructuring\nprogramme and with those initiatives calculated to\nincrease efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the\ncapability of the Organization to achieve desirable results.\nHowever, cost-effectiveness, commendable as that may\nbe, should not be at the expense of those worthwhile\nprogrammes designed to benefit small developing nations.\nWe firmly believe that the United Nations has the\ncapacity to maintain those programmes while it strives\nsimultaneously to exercise the necessary budgetary\nrestraints.\nThe ethnic and tribal conflicts in the former\nYugoslavia and Rwanda and the reported acts of genocide\nand other atrocities are troubling and must exercise the\nminds and hearts of human beings everywhere. The\ninternational community cannot appear to condone such\nreprehensible acts, and appropriate measures must be\ntaken to punish those responsible. Accordingly, Dominica\nunhesitatingly supports the establishment of international\ntribunals for the trial and punishment of those persons\nfound guilty of crimes against humanity.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica supports the\nindefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and as we look\nforward optimistically to a nuclear-free world we call\nupon all nations possessing weapons of mass destruction\nto join in a cooperative effort to reduce and finally to\neliminate those weapons from the face of the Earth. We\nmust also express concern at the apparent unwillingness\nof the international community to stem the increase in the\nrate of production of conventional arms of increasing\nsophistication and potential for destruction. Acquired in\n11\n\n\nmany instances by third world nations, ostensibly to\nmaintain secure borders and deter aggression, these\nweapons very often become effective instruments of\ninternal repression and the cause of national and regional\ninstability. Time after time the United Nations is called\nupon to expend its limited resources in repairing the\ndamage and in alleviating the consequential suffering and\nmisery. We are consistent in maintaining that a reordering\nof priorities is called for and that a slight shifting of\nresources away from the acquisition of unnecessary arsenals\nand into development programmes would result in\ntremendous social and economic benefits to the citizens of\nmany developing countries.\nIn many countries human rights abuses occur on a\ndaily basis. Dominica\u2019s respect for human rights and its\ncommitment to ensure that the rights of every citizen are\nprotected cannot be questioned. It is in keeping with that\ncommitment that the Commonwealth of Dominica applauds\nthe establishment of the Office of the High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights and will support efforts to make that\nOffice and the Centre for Human Rights effective\ninstruments in the promotion and protection of human\nrights. We believe, however, that in the discharge of his\nresponsibilities the task of the High Commissioner would\nbe significantly strengthened if the United Nations General\nAssembly were to abandon its present selective\ncondemnation of human rights abuses. Human rights\nabuses should be condemned wherever and whenever they\noccur and no nation should be permitted to take comfort\nfrom the fact that its violation of human rights covenants\nwill escape the glare of publicity and the strictures of the\ninternational community.\nThe readmission of a democratic, non-racial South\nAfrica to the United Nations on 23 June 1994 is a source\nof tremendous pleasure for my delegation and a tribute to\nthe many persons and organizations, both inside and outside\nthe United Nations, who worked so tirelessly in the long\nand hard struggle to put an end to the pernicious system of\napartheid. The majority of the people of South Africa must\nbe congratulated on their sustained effort and determination,\nas well as on their conciliatory attitude which augurs well\nfor the new South Africa. Above all we must congratulate\nand applaud the President, Mr. Nelson Mandela, and his\nSecond Deputy President, Mr. de Klerk, on the courage,\nconsiderable skill and political enlightenment which they\njointly and effectively harnessed in reaching an\naccomplishment that may eventually be regarded as a\nmodel for the world. The journey has only just begun.\nMany difficulties lie ahead but there are reasons to be\noptimistic. With the assistance and support of the\ninternational community South Africa will succeed.\nThe progress that has been made in the bilateral\nnegotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbours in the\nMiddle East is heart-warming indeed. With the first steps\nhaving been taken on the road to Palestinian autonomy in\nthe West Bank and Gaza, and with the signing of the\naccord between Jordan and Israel, there appears to be an\nexcellent opportunity for an eventual resolution of the\nconflict that has plagued that region for too long.\nOptimism must be tempered with caution, however. The\nimplementation of the accords and full realization of\nPalestinian autonomy will depend for their success on\ngenerous financial support, both private and public. And\nwhile the United Nations must not be intrusive, its interest\nin seeing that the legitimate hopes, aspirations and\nsecurity needs of the people of the area are realized\nimposes upon it a duty to continue to be seized with the\nsubject-matter and to continue to monitor the process and\nthe progress towards a full and just peace in the Middle\nEast.\nIn different forums and at various times since\nSeptember 1991, the Commonwealth of Dominica has\nconsistently called for the ousting of the military regime\nin Port au Prince, the return of President Aristide to Haiti\nand the restoration of democracy and the rule of law to\nthat country. For three years the military leaders in Haiti\nhave authorized, encouraged and condoned brutal acts of\nrevenge and wanton violence against the citizens of Haiti\nand have continued to exercise governmental power in\ndefiance of world opinion. They temporized by entering\ninto the Governors Island Agreement, which they later\nfailed to honour. Their intransigence and unreliability led\nthe Security Council to conclude that the unique character\nof the situation in Haiti required an exceptional response\nand that there was need for the use of all necessary means\nto facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military\nleaders and the prompt return of the legitimately elected\nPresident.\nFaced with the prospect of having to confront an\noverwhelming multinational force, the military leaders\nhave finally decided to step down, and while recent\nevents give reason for pause, the prospect of the\nrestoration of democracy to Haiti seems decidedly\nbrighter than at any time in the last 36 months. When the\nHaitian people were the victims of officially sanctioned\nbrutality and violence, we felt their pain. When President\nAristide returns, we will rejoice with them. We wish the\nHaitian people well, and we will do whatever we can to\n12\n\n\nassist in their efforts to attain that measure of freedom that\ncan come only from a government established on\ndemocratic principles. President Aristide is devoted to\nHaiti and the well-being of Haitians. We must support him\nand encourage him in this daunting and lonely task that he\nhas undertaken for his people.\nHowever, as friends of the Haitian people, we plead\nwith them to understand that democracy cannot be imposed\nfrom outside; it can only develop from a genuine desire of\nthe people of Haiti of all persuasions. A political\nenvironment of intense hatred and passionate desire for\nrevenge is not fertile ground for a young and fragile\ndemocracy. Success in their new endeavour will require\nthat nobility of spirit that seeks the path of reconciliation\nand trust and eschews vengeance and recriminations. No\none can pretend that the task will be easy, but the following\nexcerpt from a speech delivered by Archbishop Desmond\nTutu at the commemoration of the Day of the African Child\non 16 June 1994 might be instructive to the Haitian people.\nSpeaking of his beloved South Africa, the venerable\narchbishop said:\n\u201cThe Minister of Justice of South Africa was detained\nseveral times. He suffers from a heart condition. The\nsecurity forces tried to kill him by swapping his\ntablets. Today he is writing, drafting the legislation\nfor an amnesty to forgive the security forces that\nwanted to kill him. If it can happen in a South Africa\nwhere it is said the problem is so intractable, no\ncountry in the world can ever again have an excuse\nfor not being able to resolve its problem. God is\nsaying, I set before you South Africa as a paradigm.\nThis is how it can be done. There is hope for the\nworld when South Africa can become as it has\nbecome.\u201d\nWe are in accord with Archbishop Tutu, and we are firmly\nof the view that if it can be done in South Africa it can and\nmust be done in Haiti.\nThe exclusion of the Republic of China on Taiwan\nfrom membership in this body and from participation in the\nactivities of its various agencies continues to be of concern\nto us. It appears incongruous to us that an industrial\ncountry of 21 million people with a democratic\nGovernment, with full membership in the Asian\nDevelopment Bank, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\nForum, the Pacific Basin Economic Council and the Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation Council, and with the capacity to\nmake meaningful and worthwhile contributions to the\nactivities of the United Nations is denied membership when\neveryone agrees that it exercises sovereign authority over\na defined geographical area. On the principle of\nuniversality alone, the request of the Republic of China\non Taiwan for membership in the United Nations is\njustifiable. We do not believe that the admission of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan precludes eventual\nunification. On the contrary, in our view it is likely to\nhelp the process along, and no one can pretend that\nparallel representation stands in the way. The citizens of\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan deserve to be accorded\nthose rights and privileges enjoyed by citizens of all\nsovereign States, and the commonwealth of Dominica\nadvocates and supports the admission of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan to full membership in the United\nNations.\n\nWe are gratified that the participants at the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\nin Cairo have wisely arrived at a consensus that gives\nsupport to the view that, in the words of one\ncommentator, \\\"sustainable development cannot be realized\nwithout the full engagement and complete empowerment\nof women\\\". That proposition has long been\nacknowledged and incorporated into our decision-making\nprocesses, to the extent that today women have equal\naccess to education at all levels and gender equality\nmanifests itself in all facets of life in Dominica. We\nrealize that the plan of action requires increased spending\non social programmes for its viability, and it is hoped that\nat the Conference in Copenhagen in 1995, participants\nfrom donor and recipient countries will arrive at a\nreasonable formula in that regard.\nWe support the establishment of the World Trade\nOrganization and the liberalization of trade practices, but\nwe need to remind the international community that\nfragile economies of small island states can be easily\ndestroyed if free trade does not embody that measure of\nfairness necessary for their survival. We require that the\nlarger and economically successful States be mindful of\nthe need for poor small States to survive. The recent\nformation of the Association of Caribbean States will, we\nhope, provide a framework for increased trade among the\nStates in the area and enhance the capability of the region\nin its search for ways to reach beneficial accommodation\nwith more powerful trading groups in the hemisphere.\nWe look forward to the forthcoming Summit of the\nAmericas and the proposed frank and detailed\nexamination of such issues as the hemispheric integration\n13\n\n\nprocess - including a hemispheric free trade zone - the role\nof multilateral financial institutions, sustainable\ndevelopment, and resource flows and debt in hemispheric\ndevelopment. We hope that out of that gathering will come\nnot only a keener appreciation of the vulnerabilities of the\nsmaller States in the region but also a greater impetus for\ncollaboration on matters of regional trade and development.\nAfter 49 years, its imperfections notwithstanding, the\nUnited Nations remains the world\u2019s greatest deliberative\nbody and mankind\u2019s greatest hope for survival in a\nreasonably well-ordered and peaceful global community.\nAs the United Nations prepares to celebrate its fiftieth\nanniversary, we need to place on record our recognition of\nits many worthwhile accomplishments, and we hope that it\nwill continue in its search for new and innovative ways to\nmeet the challenges of the future.\n"

        "file_text": "\nThe international community is meeting once again,\nassembling the great diversity of the nations which are its\nmembers, to consider the state of the world and to chart the\npaths of progress for the 12 months that lie ahead.\nWe give thanks to God for having inspired the\ndelegations here present in their choice of His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the sisterly\nand friendly Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, as President of the\nAssembly at this session. His election is both an honour to\nhim personally and a tribute to his country inasmuch as the\nworld recognizes and acknowledges the great dedication of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to everything affecting peace and\nunderstanding among people. It does so thanks to the\nvision of the late President Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, which\ncontinues to be carried on by his illustrious successor,\nPresident Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9.\nThe personal joy and pride which I feel concerning\nhim as our friend and brother is shared by my entire\ndelegation as well as in Senegal which, since time\nimmemorial, has had numerous ties of friendship and\ncooperation with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Hence, the\nacknowledgement of his merits by the international\ncommunity was received and hailed in Senegal with the\nsame intensity as in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The President can count\non the support of the delegation of Senegal to contribute to\nthe success of his mission. The warmth of the\ncongratulations we extend to him today is equalled by the\npride which we feel at seeing him preside over the forty-\nninth session of the General Assembly.\nWe pay a tribute to his predecessor, the Permanent\nRepresentative of Guyana, Ambassador Insanally, for the\nskill and authority with which he guided the work of the\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session.\nI should like also to repeat our gratitude to our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the\nenergy and dedication which he continues to devote to his\noutstanding mission at the head of our Organization, a\nmission which he is carrying out with the same efficiency\nin an ever more difficult global context.\nFinally, allow me to thank delegations for the\nunanimous decision to elect the Permanent Representative\nof Senegal to the United Nations, Mr. K\u00e9ba Birane Ciss\u00e9,\none of our most outstanding diplomats, as Chairman of\nthe Third Committee. In so doing this mission is\nentrusted to Senegal, whose dedication to human rights\nand to the other areas falling within the competence of\nthis important Committee, is known to all. Mr. Ciss\u00e9 and\nall of us intend to dedicate ourselves fully, together with\nthe other countries represented here, to ensure that the\nwork of the Third Committee is crowned with success.\nIf there are years which the history of the world\ncannot ignore, the twelve-month period that has just\nelapsed is doubtless among them. It has been extremely\nrich in events of great political significance characterized\nby the positive developments of the situation in South\nAfrica which saw the end of apartheid and which, only a\nfew months ago, saw the advent of a democratic Power.\nIt was also a period marked by the political and\npsychological upheavals that have taken place in Arab-\nIsraeli relations. In this context, we are gratified to see\nSouth Africa now occupying its rightful place in the\nfamily of nations.\nThe truth always wins in the end. It is in the name\nof that inevitable reality - which is the token of the\nultimate objective of just causes - that the chronic\nproblem of the Middle East - at the heart of which is the\nquestion of Palestine - has, since the Declaration of\nPrinciples of 13 September 1993 in Washington, seen\ndevelopments marked by the continued collapse of\nimportant panels of that psychological wall that has so\nlong divided Arabs and Israelis.\nThus, in the region which was the cradle of the\nsublime spiritual messages of the religions of the Book,\nsuch developments now justify hope - the hope of finally\nseeing the creation of a space for lasting coexistence\nbetween Israelis and Palestinians, between Israel and the\nArab countries, with genuine respect for the inalienable\nrights of the peoples and States of the entire region.\nThey justify the hope of seeing the establishment,\nbetween those States and peoples, of cooperation at all\npossible levels, to manage, together, their vital support\nsystems.\nIt is only fitting that in mentioning those hopes we\npay a tribute to all those involved in this positive\ndevelopment whose efforts have made possible the\nopening of this new window of opportunity on the\nconflict in the Middle East, especially the Palestinian and\nIsraeli leaders who, thanks to their political courage and\nsense of history, finally agreed to set out on this path\ntowards a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n21\n\n\nIn again expressing to His Excellency President Yasser\nArafat Senegal\u2019s support and admiration for the courage\nand political farsightedness which led him to keep a firm\ngrip on that olive branch of which he spoke here in 1974,\nI should like on behalf of Senegal to formulate the hope\nthat as he takes the additional steps necessary to reach an\noverall solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict all the other\naspects of this matter will be dealt with in accordance with\nthe positive trend of present developments, and that a\nsettlement will be reached in keeping with the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council.\nWe also wish wholeheartedly to extend these\ncongratulations and expressions of encouragement to the\nIsraeli Prime Minister, His Excellency Mr. Yitzak Rabin,\nand to his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Shimon Peres,\nfor their sustained efforts to achieve a settlement of the\nMiddle East crisis. Such efforts must be pursued, stepped\nup and encouraged.\nHowever, the past year, although marked by such\npositive and historic events, was not free from reasons for\nconcern and even, at times, despair. Indeed, despite our\nconstantly renewed efforts, a number of conflicts persist\nand are even sometimes becoming mired down in scenes of\nhorror we had hoped never against to witness.\nFrom Angola to Bosnia and Herzegovina, from Liberia\nto Somalia, and recently in Rwanda, we have received the\nechoes and images and witnessed the piercing horror of\npersistent crisis situations that leave us no choice other than\nto continue doggedly to strive for dialogue and concerted\naction to find lasting solutions based on equity, based on\njustice, based on law and based on the unshakeable will to\nlive finally in peace in a community made up of human\nbeings.\nIn the conflict situations on the African continent,\ntoday, more than ever before, machinery for the prevention,\nmanagement and settlement of African conflicts must be\nimplemented through respect for the various peace\nagreements that have been signed among factions that are,\nsadly, continuing to kill each other; our continent of Africa\nmust be committed once and for all to the only battle worth\nthe candle, namely, the battle for democratic development\nand the advancement of human rights.\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU) has\ndedicated itself to this task, and it has done so persistently\nand courageously. Today, it needs the support of the whole\nof the international community.\nThe question of Angola must be peacefully and\nfinally resolved in the spirit of the Lusaka negotiations,\nunder the aegis of the United Nations. After having\nhailed the meritorious efforts undertaken by the\nauthorities in Luanda, we must launch another strong and\nconcrete appeal to UNITA to allow peace finally to reign\nin Angola.\nIn connection with the problems in Somalia and\nRwanda, I should like to recall certain specific facts\nconcerning the position that my country, Senegal, has\ntaken on these questions of such concern to everyone.\nIn Somalia, the peace so long sought by the\ninternational community can obviously come about only\nthrough an overall political settlement that would deal\nwith all aspects of that fratricidal conflict. Moreover,\nbecause he understood this at a very early stage, His\nExcellency President Abdou Diouf - then the Chairman of\nthe OAU, and also in his capacity of President of the\nSixth Summit Meeting of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference - speaking from this rostrum in 1992, put\nforward the idea of convening an international conference\ndevoted to Somalia. The General Assembly at that time\nresponded to the appeal by the Senegalese Head of State\nby adopting a resolution to that effect that is still highly\nrelevant. Given the persistence of the problem of\nSomalia, which today seems more than ever likely to take\nanother tragic turn, it would appear that the time has\ncome to re-examine that initiative.\nIn Rwanda, a human tragedy on a virtually\nunprecedented scale took place following the events of\nlast April. In this connection, I should like to note that\nour country has been actively involved in the search for\na solution to this conflict since 1992. Indeed, President\nAbdou Diouf, then the Chairman of the OAU, presided\nover the lengthy negotiations that culminated in the\nArusha Agreements. In addition, officers from the\nSenegalese national army were part of the Group of\nNeutral Military Observers of the OAU entrusted with\nsupervising the cease-fire, a group that was as we know\nreplaced in 1993, with the signature of the Arusha\nAgreements, by the United Nations Assistance Mission\nfor Rwanda (UNAMIR), in which Senegal has\nparticipated and continues to participate.\nThus, it was quite natural that on 22 June of this\nyear, faced with the inadmissible continuing massacre of\ncivilians, the Security Council adopted resolution 929\n(1994), which established a multinational force for\n22\n\n\nhumanitarian purposes, and that Senegal decided to\nparticipate in it.\nWith regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, need we\nrecall that this is a United Nations Member State to whose\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty the international\ncommunity is committed. This places full responsibility on\nthe community of nations, gathered together here, to settle\nthe conflict after identifying the aggressor.\nHowever, it is as though the Bosnian Serbs had been\nactually authorized to defy with impunity and in an ongoing\nfashion the expressed will of the international community.\nThe attacks against the personnel of the United Nations\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR), the repeated violations of\nsecurity zones, the rejection of the latest peace plan\nproposed by the Contact Group of five Western countries,\nare all part of a pattern of confrontation with which the\ninternational community must finally deal, firmly and with\ndetermination.\nIn this connection, we believe that the adoption on 23\nSeptember 1994 of Security Council resolution 943 (1994),\nwhich suspended the economic sanctions against the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), is not\nonly premature but untimely, given the deterioration in the\nsituation.\nIt is our opinion, one shared by the majority of States\nhere present, that the sanctions should be, if not\nstrengthened, at least maintained until favourable conditions\nhave been created - that is, the establishment of an effective\nsystem of international monitoring of the border between\nSerbia and Montenegro, on the one hand, and the territories\noccupied by the Bosnian Serbs, on the other; the lifting of\nthe siege of Sarajevo; the sincere commitment by the\nBosnian Serbs to cooperate in reaching a comprehensive\npolitical settlement of the crisis; the lifting, where the\nBosnian Government is concerned, of the arms embargo\nimposed by Security Council resolution 713 (1991) in order\nto restore to Bosnia and Herzegovina the means for its self-\ndefence as set forth in Article 51 of the United Nations\nCharter.\nIt is also important that the international community\ndedicate itself to the reconstruction of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, a country that is today being battered and\ndevastated by blatant aggression.\nIn our view, those measures represent the minimum\nwe should expect from the international community in order\nto give credibility to the peace process being pursued in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. On this delicate issue, Senegal,\nwhose Head of State is also the current President of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, will continue to\nact within the framework of international law to ensure\nthat the Bosnian people, finally reconciled among\nthemselves, may know lasting peace based on an equality\nof rights and duties among its various components.\nThe economic problems today are of such a\nmagnitude that a new concept of world security has been\ngenerated. Today, indeed, the feeling of insecurity\nemanates more often from the vicissitudes of daily life\nthan from any fear of global cataclysm. That is the\nconclusion reached in this year\u2019s report by the United\nNations Development Programme on human development.\nJob security, health security and environmental\nsecurity are the forms that the global problem of security\ntakes today. This development naturally raises the\nquestion of the definition of a new \\\"social pact\\\", which\nmust give further priority to human solidarity - solidarity\namong the communities of men - and it demonstrates the\ngreat importance that Senegal attaches to the Summit on\nsocial development that is to be held in Copenhagen next\nMarch. On that occasion we shall have to restructure our\nthinking about development, and it will be necessary to\nhighlight better the human aspect of development based\non greater international solidarity.\nIt was in this spirit that, here on 30 September 1992,\nSenegal\u2019s Head of State proposed to the international\ncommunity the conclusion of a general agreement on\nsolidarity - a gentlemen\u2019s agreement on solidarity. It is\na positive thing that this proposal has been largely taken\non board in the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s\noutline, Agenda for Development, which is designed to\npromote a genuine culture of development that will take\ninto account all aspects of the human condition.\nFor the same reasons Senegal welcomes warmly the\nreforms of United Nations bodies that are under way - in\nparticular, those bodies that are responsible for questions\nof economic and social development.\nWe favour the formula \\\"Trade, not aid\\\", which has\noften been used to indicate that global trade is the\ngenuine driving force for economic progress - more so\nthan aid for development. It is beneficial that, along\nthese lines, on 15 April last, in Marrakesh in the\nKingdom of Morocco, the representatives of 126 countries\nsigned the agreement that created the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO).\n23\n\n\nWe hope that the birth of the WTO represents the\ncompletion of the structure that was conceived half a\ncentury ago in Bretton Woods as international trade has\nbeen raised to the same status as monetary policy and\nfinance for development. Thus, the Marrakesh Final Act\nopens the way for a new dynamic of concerted action, of\nconsultation and solidarity, that will finally allow for the\npromotion of a more just and more balanced system\ndesigned to govern international trade.\nIf it is to do so, its practical application will have to\ninvolve integration of the specific needs and specific\nproblems of the group of developing countries - such as\ngreater justice in the definition and application of new\nmachinery designed to govern international trade; regional\neconomic integration; immigration policies; professional\ntraining; job creation; and the transfer of technologies to\nmeet the needs and aspirations of the countries of the\nSouth.\nIn this regard, I must mention an event of great\nimportance: the adoption, in Paris on 18 June 1994, of the\nInternational Convention to Combat Desertification in\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa. Many of us here\nrepresent those countries.\nThis is the outcome, in terms of action, of one of the\nmajor recommendations to emerge from the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development. As an\ninitiator of the Convention, our continent - Africa - cannot\nbut welcome the conclusion of this multilateral legal\ninstrument, which recognizes the existence of such a\nworrying environmental problem.\nIt is desirable that there should be available to this\nConvention, as to others of the same type, sufficient\nfinancial resources to enable it to halt and reverse the\nprocess of desertification, which is a real scourge for the\nAfrican continent.\nThe changes of considerable scope that have taken\nplace on the world stage over the past few years confront\nthe United Nations with new challenges and new missions.\nFor example, how can the Organization deal with identity\nclaims, domestic difficulties and civil wars while respecting\nthe principle of the sovereignty of States, which is the\ncornerstone of the San Francisco Charter?\nIn what way can it - must it - react when individuals\nand groups perpetrate all types of serious violations of\nfundamental human rights, as happens in the case of the\nconflicts that prevail in the former Yugoslavia, Angola,\nSomalia and Rwanda? What barriers can be erected\nagainst terrorism and civil war in order to cope with the\nfragmentation of State entities, which are factors for\npeace? In these difficult areas, as in others, our\nOrganization will have to demonstrate its ability to\nengage in innovation and adaptation.\nThe establishment of an international Tribunal to\ndeal with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia; the plan\nto set up an international criminal court; the deliberation,\nbegun last year, on reform of the Security Council and on\nbetter implementation of Chapter VIII of the Charter -\nthese all demonstrate that the United Nations has\ncommitted itself firmly to that course.\nAs regards the Security Council in particular, the\nreform that is envisaged should be carried out with\nconcern simultaneously for efficiency in the functioning\nof this body and for real representativeness in keeping\nwith the new realities of the world.\nThe changes that have taken place in the world\nduring the last few years have as their essence the\nfundamental aspiration of peoples to freedom, justice and\ndevelopment in a spirit of human solidarity. If it is to\nlast, the wind of democratization that they have created at\nthe national level requires parallel action at the\ninternational level. Indeed, we must all ensure the equal\nparticipation of all States in the establishment of new\nnorms that can give international life a more solid\nfoundation and provide better security for all. Such\nsecurity can be founded only on shared confidence in the\nprinciples that govern our collective contribution to a\nbetter future for the world - to the salvation of mankind.\nTherefore, on the eve of the celebration of the\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization, let us, hand in\nhand in a spirit of friendship and solidarity, behave in\nsuch a way that the new era will shine with the radiance\nof justice, peace and solidarity so that we may bequeath\nto future generations a world of peace, justice and\nfriendship.\n"

Allow me to emphasize\nmy delegation\u2019s complete readiness to cooperate with him\nand other delegations during this session. I also wish to\nexpress my satisfaction at the presence of the delegation of\nthe democratic Government of South Africa at this session.\nOn the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, this session of the General Assembly presents us\nwith the opportunity to envisage a better world based on the\nprinciples of the Charter and the shared values and\naspirations of its members. The only path to the\nachievement of this vital goal is the examination of past\nperformance, a sober analysis of present circumstances and\nthe formulation of a renewed vision of the future of\ninternational relations in accordance with the Charter.\nIn the past 50 years the United Nations has succeeded\nin some areas, including decolonization. Yet the rivalries\nbetween the two super-Powers did not allow the\nOrganization to accomplish its mission in full. In the area\nof disarmament, the United Nations was not able to play a\nsignificant role, and substantive negotiations were\nconducted outside the United Nations system. By the same\ntoken, the role played by the Organization in economic\ndevelopment was heavily influenced by similar rivalries\nbetween East and West, resulting in economic relations\ndevoid of justice and parity. In addition, the cold war was\na factor in shaping the structural make-up of the\nOrganization, and so the United Nations was deprived of\nthe opportunity to be a true agent of change.\nDuring the past 50 years of its existence the United\nNations has had its share of challenges. Yet never before\nhas the Organization faced such a historic and serious\nchallenge in self-renewal as it does at present, when we\nhave reached a crossroads in the history of international\nrelations. Naturally, to meet the challenge of today\u2019s\nnumerous rapid changes, the Organization must rid itself\nof the very constraints imposed upon it by the era of\nrivalry between the super-Powers.\nBut, alas, a few self-proclaimed victors of the cold\nwar feel entitled to dictate the new criteria that determine\ninternational relations and guide the United Nations and,\nmore specifically, the Security Council, arrogating to\nthemselves the right to impose their own vision and\nself-serving interpretations on the rest of humanity. The\ntransformation of the Security Council into an instrument\nfor justification or enforcement of policies of a number of\npermanent members is not at all compatible with the spirit\nof the Charter and contradicts the very letter of Article\n24, according to which the Council acts on behalf of the\nentire membership of the Organization. Contrary to the\nassumptions of a few, the Security Council is no one\u2019s\nprivate domain and should not be abused to revive the\ngunboat diplomacy of some Powers. A body charged\nwith the grave responsibility of maintaining international\npeace and security must not be influenced and\nmanipulated by those Powers that have historically sought\nto serve their own self-interest at the expense of\ninternational peace.\nThe failure of the Security Council to adopt a\nbalanced approach in dealing with various crises and its\npersistent application of double standards, due to\nmanipulation by some permanent members, have in effect\nprevented the Council from discharging its primary\nresponsibility in accordance with the Charter. The most\nvivid illustration has been the silence of the Security\nCouncil and its failure to adopt resolute measures in the\nface of repeated acts of aggression committed by Israel\nagainst the people of Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria. How\ncan the Security Council supporters of the regime\noccupying Palestine allow this expansionist regime to\ncontinue its aggression against neighbours, while repeated\nresolutions of the Council demand an end to occupation?\nWhat motives underlie the silence of the Security Council\nin the face of overt official terrorist acts by Israel in the\noccupied territories and in South Lebanon? The massacre\nof Muslims in the Al-Khalil Mosque, the bombing of\nresidential areas in South Lebanon, the kidnapping of\nLebanese citizens, and other such incidents portray the\nbitter reality that Israel has come to believe that, with the\nsupport of a number of powerful States, it can continue\nsuch behaviour with impunity.\nIsrael\u2019s real and ultimate objective has been to\ncontinue its occupation. Today, under the disguise of the\npeace process, this very policy is being pursued through\n37\n\n\nthe repression of Muslims and all opponents of the illegal\nand aggressive Israeli occupation. Therefore, in our view,\nthe current process lacks realism, fails to adhere to\nuniversal principles and therefore will not lead to real\npeace. The comprehensive and just solution to the\nPalestinian issue lies in the full realization of all the rights\nof the people of Palestine, including the return of all\nPalestinian refugees to their own land, enabling them to\nexercise their inalienable right to self-determination, and the\nliberation of all occupied territories.\nThe unprincipled approach of the Security Council\nvis-\u00e0-vis different crises and aggressions is also\ndemonstrated by its questionable handling of the aggression\nagainst the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. For more\nthan two and a half years, the defenceless Muslims of\nBosnia have been resisting foreign aggression, \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\", massacre and the gradual annihilation of their\nnation. Despite the adoption of countless resolutions and\nstatements, and in fact because of the lack of political will\nto deal with the roots of the crisis, the Security Council has\nnot only failed to implement its own resolutions, but in fact\nhas empowered the aggressors to continue their atrocities\nand has prevented a State Member of the United Nations\nfrom exercising its inherent right of self-defence through its\nresistance to the appeal of the international community to\nlift the unjustifiable arms embargo against the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nFrom the very beginning of the crisis, the Government\nof Bosnia has participated in all negotiations in good faith,\neven though most of the peace plans proposed by mediators\nhave been unjust. The Government of Bosnia has amply\ndemonstrated its sincere desire for peace. On the other\nhand, the aggressors and their supporters have, through a\npolicy of procrastination, created an impasse in the\nnegotiations by mocking all the decisions of the Council\nand all proposals for peace. However, regrettably and in\nspite of previous commitments, no measure to encourage\ncompliance and punish intransigence and non-compliance\nhas been adopted by the Council. It was a source of deep\nanguish and astonishment to witness a few days ago the\nSecurity Council prematurely rushing to reward Serbia for\nnothing more than a tactical move, while months after the\nacceptance of the latest peace plan by the Government of\nBosnia and its rejection by the Serbs, no decision has been\nmade to fulfil the commitment of the five-nation Contact\nGroup, including the lifting of the unjustified arms embargo\nagainst Bosnia.\nIn their recent gathering in Islamabad, Islamic\ncountries expressed their determination to contribute\nindividually and collectively to the legitimate defence of\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At this\njuncture, a decisive majority among United Nations\nMember States are of the view that the implementation of\nthe arms embargo against Bosnia is illegal. Many of\nthese countries, in tandem with public opinion, consider\nany further waiting for a final pronouncement by the\nCouncil as unjustifiable in the present circumstances.\nThus, we believe that in the interest of its own credibility,\nthe Council must take action without further ado and\nshow its respect for the views of an undisputed majority\nwithin the international community.\nThese examples and the debates of the past year on\nrestructuring the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil have clearly shown that the procedures and\nmethodology of the Security Council must be re-evaluated\nand changed in order to enable it to address transparently\nand in a just and serious manner issues affecting\ninternational peace and security. Many also agree that the\nauthority of the General Assembly in attending to matters\nof peace and security, as asserted by the Charter, and the\nneed for greater accountability of the Security Council to\nthe Assembly must be translated from mere words into\nreality. The Council must scrupulously fulfil its\nobligations towards the membership of the Organization\nat large, on whose behalf the Council operates.\nThe United Nations will be able to deal with world\nissues effectively only when and if all its Members are\nallowed to participate equally in decision-making. Most\ncontemporary international developments cannot be fully\nappreciated if looked at in the perspective of 50 years\nago. If we are sincere in our belief that the world is so\nchanged that we must eliminate all references to \\\"enemy\nStates\\\" from the Charter, then why not also acknowledge\nthat there is no further justification for holding on to\nprivileges granted to the war victors of that time?\nAnother fundamental issue which must be carefully\nconsidered in our assessment of the first 50 years of the\nUnited Nations activities pertains to the role of the United\nNations in all matters concerning disarmament, including\nmultilateral efforts to effect total, comprehensive and\nnon-discriminatory disarmament in the world. Today, one\nof the main preoccupations of the international\ncommunity is the future of arms control, particularly that\nof weapons of mass destruction, which have no\njustification in the post-cold-war era. The international\ncommunity must identify the hazards attached to\nstockpiling and horizontal and vertical proliferation of\nthese weapons. It must then move to establish\n38\n\n\ncomprehensive, universal and non-discriminatory\ninternational treaties to ensure the elimination and\ndestruction of these weapons in the shortest possible time.\nShortly after the suspension of the current session,\nStates parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons will gather to review the effectiveness of\nthis Treaty over the past 25 years and to decide upon the\nextent and conditions of its renewal. To reach a rational\nand practical decision, one must answer the question\nwhether the international community is prepared to accept,\nas it has done for the past 25 years, that the nuclear\nPowers, on the one hand, be for ever equipped with these\nweapons of destruction and that, on the other, the majority\nof the signatories to the non-proliferation Treaty remain\ndeprived of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy.\nIran was one of the first signatories to this Treaty and\nhas remained faithfully committed to it. But at the same\ntime, it is one of the many developing countries deprived\nof the possibilities of progress and development offered by\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy as recognized in the\nTreaty. We believe that the unconditional and indefinite\nrenewal of the non-proliferation Treaty will only lead to the\npossession of these destructive and anti-human weapons by\na handful of nuclear Powers and that the rest of the\ninternational community will be forced to live in fear in the\ndark shadow of these weapons. The founding of a new\nworld order on the encouragement and institutionalization\nof discriminatory and vague norms, including the conferring\nof permanent status such treaties and the proliferation of\ndiscriminatory, selective and non-universal regimes such as\nthe Australia Group or the London Club, does not augur\nwell for the future of the international community and the\nemerging world order.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, as a victim of weapons\nof mass destruction, has under no circumstances attempted,\nnor will it ever attempt, to develop or possess these\nanti-human weapons. It thus attaches great value to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\ndespite that instrument\u2019s many inherent shortcomings.\nHowever, in our view a limited renewal of the Treaty can\nserve the objective of nuclear disarmament only if careful\nattention is paid to the following considerations: first,\nnuclear Powers should abandon the doctrine of nuclear\ndeterrence and commit themselves to a target date for the\ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons; secondly, the\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty should be finalized and\nunconditionally signed; thirdly, the production,\ndevelopment, stockpiling of and trade in all fissile materials\nfor nuclear-weapons purposes must be permanently banned;\nfourthly, the security of non-nuclear States must be\nguaranteed against the threat of the use of these weapons\nby others, which will be possible through an effective\ninternational treaty; and, lastly, access by Governments to\nnuclear technology for peaceful purposes should be\nguaranteed.\nThe future of the nuclear-proliferation Treaty also\nrequires serious consideration of the critical situation in\nthe Middle East and the nuclear threat posed by Israel.\nIsrael\u2019s nuclear programme has exacerbated the arms race\nin the region and has forced others within the area to turn\nto more advanced conventional weaponry. Some States\nin the region have made their accession to a number of\ndisarmament treaties conditional upon Israel\u2019s acceptance\nof international regimes established to prevent the\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. Israel\u2019s refusal to do\nso, which regrettably enjoys the support of a number of\ndeveloped nuclear-weapon States, will affect the\nperspective of States in the Middle East on the future of\nthe non-proliferation Treaty after 1995.\nIn addition to Israel\u2019s continuous threats, interference\nby foreign Governments in the affairs of regional States\nhas led to negative perceptions and perspectives within\nthe region that have impeded serious dialogue and\nconsideration of constructive suggestions for creating\npeace stability and security in the Middle East and the\nPersian Gulf.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, which possesses the\nlongest shoreline along the Persian Gulf and the Sea of\nOman, has been well aware of its role and responsibilities\nin promoting and maintaining peace and security in the\narea and has spared no effort in this regard. Today, the\nlargest portion of Iran\u2019s national budget is devoted to\neconomic and social development and to reconstruction.\nMany of our military industries have been transformed\ninto non-military units. Despite the volatile nature of our\nregion and our own bitter experience as a victim of\naggression, only an average of 1.6 per cent of Iran\u2019s gross\ndomestic product is allocated to national defence, while\nsome neighbouring countries continue their purchase of\nhuge stockpiles of weapons.\nWe firmly believe in the imperative of developing\nregional security arrangements that ensure the\nparticipation of all Persian Gulf countries. Such\narrangements would diminish the arms race and guarantee\nthe free flow of oil and economic development and\nprosperity in the area. The religious, cultural, historical\nand commercial commonalities of the countries of the\n39\n\n\nregion make it incumbent upon us to effect and expand\ntrust and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral\ninitiatives. We propose here the creation of a forum, with\nthe participation of the Persian Gulf countries, to review\nand develop confidence-building measures compatible with\nthe requirements of the region. The maintenance of\nsecurity in the Persian Gulf is the responsibility of the\ncountries surrounding this strategic waterway. Foreign\nGovernments, which have often been the source of\ninstability and insecurity in the region, should support\ncollective regional initiatives for cooperation and refrain\nfrom sowing discord and tension and from other divisive\npolicies to which they have historically resorted in order to\npreserve their interests and justify their presence.\nThe efforts of the Islamic Republic of Iran to reduce\ntension in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kashmir and Karabakh\nand its consistent affirmation of the principle of respect for\ninternationally recognized borders, territorial integrity and\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of others are in line\nwith its overall policy geared toward the maintenance and\nstrengthening of stability, security and economic\ndevelopment in the region.\nOur policy concerning Afghanistan has focused on\nefforts to prevent war and fratricide and on attempts to\npersuade warring factions to negotiate and reach\nunderstanding. In attaining these objectives we have had\ncomprehensive and constructive cooperation with the United\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\nMeanwhile, we have continued our humanitarian assistance\nto Afghanistan and now act as host to about 1.5 million\nAfghan refugees remaining in our country.\nIn efforts to settle the crisis in Tajikistan, while\ncooperating with the Secretary-General of the United\nNations and organizing the second round of inter-Tajik talks\nin Tehran, we have continued our high-level contacts with\nthe warring parties and others concerned. Last week,\nfollowing an extensive mediation effort by Iran, it was\npossible to arrange serious meetings and negotiation in\nTehran between the two parties, represented at the highest\nlevel. As a result, an agreement to halt hostilities and to\nrelease prisoners and war captives was signed by both sides\nin Tehran in the presence of representatives of the\nSecretary-General and the Russian Federation.\nIn all these peace-making efforts we have welcomed\nconsultation and cooperation with all interested States and\ninternational organizations to contain these crises and\nprevent or mitigate their disastrous humanitarian\nconsequences.\nIn Central Asia and the Caucasus, expansion and\nstrengthening of relations in all spheres, particularly those\nof economic and cultural cooperation with neighbouring\ncountries, are being vigorously pursued to facilitate and\nensure sustainable development in the region, build an\natmosphere of mutual understanding and consolidate\nstability. As a founding member of the Economic\nCooperation Organization (ECO), the Islamic Republic of\nIran is actively engaged in promoting free trade and joint\nventures among the States members of this organization.\nIran is hopeful that ECO\u2019s observer status at the United\nNations attained last year will help enhance collaboration\nbetween ECO and various United Nations organs and\nagencies.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has also endeavoured\nto establish a Caspian Sea cooperation council that would\nensure and monitor environmental protection and proper\nutilization of its resources by littoral States. These\nregional efforts have laid the groundwork for multilateral\ncooperation between Iran, Central Asian States and\nindustrialized countries.\nAnother major problem in the United Nations during\nthe past decades has been the selective recourse to - and,\nindeed, manipulation and exploitation of - human\nconcerns and anxieties to meet questionable political\nagendas. In this body a minority, whose past records are\nfar from impeccable, have arrogated to themselves such\nconcepts as human rights and democracy and\nsystematically used them as instruments of political\npressure without any basis in reality or any justification.\nSuch an approach makes human rights subservient to\npolitical interest and is designed and is being followed\nsolely to further political ambitions and impose the values\nof a specific group over the historical, political, economic,\nsocial, religious, and cultural values of others.\nAt the World Conference on Human Rights in\nVienna and the recent International Conference on\nPopulation and Development in Cairo, the failed attempts\nof a minority discontented with divine moral values to\nimpose their ideas and ways on the religious majority\nillustrated the undisputed imperative for developing a\nclear and precise appreciation of and respect for divine\nteachings and values and religious beliefs. These two\nConferences showed that a good number of States,\nparticularly Islamic countries, cherish their religious\nvalues enough to attribute more priority to defending their\ndivine values and Islamic teachings, which guarantee the\nmoral and material health of our societies, than to\npolitical considerations; they resisted, in a united front,\n40\n\n\nany attempt to disregard, undermine or desecrate these\nvalues.\nFor Muslims, the remarks made by the leader of the\nNorwegian delegation at the Cairo Conference were\nespecially intolerable, insulting and simply erroneous. We\nrepeat our call to the Norwegian authorities to take the\nnecessary remedial measures, to refrain from repeating such\nstatements manifesting religious intolerance and to begin to\nrecognize and respect the rights of the majority of\nhumanity, who believe in divine religions.\nBy the same token, the dangerous phenomenon of lack\nof respect and tolerance for the values and beliefs of others\nis, regrettably, gaining momentum in Western countries\nagainst Muslim communities. This has resulted in the\nviolation of their most fundamental human rights and in\ntheir being forcibly deprived of their basic right to maintain\nand practise the values and teachings of Islam. We\ntherefore believe that greater efforts should be made to\nfoster and promote understanding of, and respect for, the\ndiverse values of different peoples and nations through,\ninter alia, constructive dialogue and the implementation of\na strengthened system of consultation.\nA similar problem is manifested in the approach of the\ninternational community vis-\u00e0-vis the threat of international\nterrorism in all its forms. Political considerations and\nreluctance to prevent terrorist activities by groups whose\npositions correspond with the policies of certain hegemonic\nPowers have indisputably impeded international efforts with\na view to eradicating international terrorism and are thus\nunjustifiable. How can the supporters of the overt official\nterrorism of Israel declare themselves champions of the\nstruggle against terrorism and yet have the audacity\narbitrarily to accuse others of supporting terrorism? Why\ndo these countries prevent any meaningful action against\nthe Zionist terrorist atrocities in the Ibrahimi mosque in\nAl-Khalil? How do they remain totally indifferent to, and\nindeed acquiesce in, the recent terrorist explosion that killed\nand wounded many innocent pilgrims in the holiest shrine\nin our country? In our view, the only way to combat\nterrorism is through a comprehensive, uniform and across-\nthe-board campaign. We need to work together at the\ninternational level to eliminate this anti-human phenomenon\nin all corners of the world, regardless of the race, religion,\nideology or political affiliations of the victims or of the\nculprits.\nAnother important challenge facing the United Nations\nis the need for political realism and serious consideration of\ncurrent and future socio-economic circumstances and their\ndirect correlation with social stability and peace.\nIncreasing social complications are directly linked to\nchronic economic conditions and the ever-worsening\ninequitable international economic relations at the expense\nof developing countries. Unless this correlation is\nacknowledged realistically and addressed responsibly in\nthe decisions of international forums, and unless effective\nremedial measures are implemented with the necessary\ninternational support and cooperation, further exacerbation\nof international economic and social crises will continue\nto pose a grave and alarming threat to us all. It is thus\nimperative to utilize every opportunity to translate\nunderstandings into action-oriented programmes in order\nto bring about the needed improvement in the world\nsocial situation on the eve of the twenty-first century.\nYet one must not forget that what prevents today\u2019s\nUnited Nations from carrying out its economic and\ndevelopmental responsibilities is not the absence of\nlegislation or plans of action. Indeed, the main obstacle\nto the implementation of significant existing decisions is\nthe glaring absence of political will and financial and\ntechnical resources. Therefore, the Agenda for\nDevelopment should envisage explicit and practical\nmechanisms for the effective and expeditious\nimplementation of these international agreements.\nThe experience of the past five decades has\ndemonstrated that because of the primacy of political\nconsiderations over humanitarian values and the principles\nof the United Nations Charter, it has not been possible to\nutilize properly the varied and unique potential of the\nOrganization as a formidable instrument for enhancing\ninternational cooperation, strengthening understanding and\ntrust, preventing and resolving crises and upheavals,\nfacilitating economic development, battling social and\ninternational ills such as terrorism and drugs, reinforcing\nrespect for the exalted dignity, worth and rights of human\nbeings, and ensuring the common good.\nPreparations and planning for the second\nhalf-century of the existence of the United Nations should\nbe conducted in full cognizance of this shortcoming, and\nwith a view to enhancing the effectiveness of the\nOrganization in carrying out those agreed tasks that are of\ninterest and importance to the international community in\nits entirety. Old methods that have lost their credibility\nmust be abandoned. New ways that are compatible with\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter while\ncorresponding to the changing international environment\nmust be developed. The delegation of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran reiterates its full readiness to offer\n41\n\n\nunreserved cooperation to Mr. Amara-Essy and to other\ndelegations to achieve these goals.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Namibian\ndelegation, I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nunanimous election as President of the General Assembly\nat its forty-ninth session. As a distinguished diplomat and\npublic servant with long experience, you bring to your\noffice an outstanding record of wisdom, excellence and\nindustry. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Namibia have maintained close\nrelations of friendship and cooperation. On a personal\nnote, I take great pride in your brilliant election and extend\nbest wishes to you.\nDuring his term of office, your distinguished\npredecessor, Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana,\nintroduced practical steps aimed at enhancing the work of\nthe General Assembly and promoting further our common\nendeavours towards peace, partnership, development and\nprosperity. We commend him for all this.\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our illustrious\nSecretary-General, has always kept his plate full in the\nservice of our Organization and its Charter. He has also,\non a continuous basis, kept intensifying his tireless efforts\nin furtherance of world peace and security and, not least,\ndevelopment and regional conflict management and\nresolution. The Secretary-General\u2019s report \\\"An Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\" is an important and timely complement to\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". Together they reinforce General\nAssembly resolution 48/165 on the \\\"Renewal of the\ndialogue on strengthening international economic\ncooperation for development through partnership\\\". I can\nassure the Secretary-General that he can count on\nNamibia\u2019s support in the discharge of his mandate.\nFollowing our independence, the Government and the\npeople of Namibia strongly felt that the decolonization of\nour country was not complete because parts of our national\nterritory still remained under colonial occupation. In 1991,\nfrom this rostrum, I called on the international community\nand, particularly, the permanent members of the Security\nCouncil to live up to their commitment, collectively and\nseverally, by ensuring the early reintegration of Walvis Bay\nand the Offshore Islands into Namibia, in accordance with\nSecurity Council resolution 432 (1978). Since then, I have\nkept the international community abreast of the\nnegotiations to this end between the Governments of\nNamibia and South Africa. In 1992, I reported on the\nestablishment of the Joint Administrative Authority, and\nlast year I announced the agreed date for the\nreintegration.\nIt is with pride and satisfaction that I am now finally\ninforming the General Assembly and the world\ncommunity as a whole that, on 1 March 1994, Walvis\nBay and the Offshore Islands were reintegrated into\nNamibia. Security Council Resolution 432 (1978) has\nthus been fully implemented. On that emotional but\nindeed solemn occasion marking the second independence\nof Namibia, Mr. Sam Nujoma, President of Namibia,\nproudly declared that at last Walvis Bay and the Offshore\nIslands were forever liberated and reintegrated into\nNamibia and he thanked the people of South Africa for\ntheir role in making this possible. A huge and tumultuous\ncrowd of Namibians and friends from abroad who were\ngathered there confirmed this truth with their loud cheers.\nIn the end, diplomacy has triumphed over confrontation.\nI would like to place on record Namibia\u2019s gratitude\nto the Secretary-General, as well as the\nSecretaries-General of the Organization of African Unity\nand the Commonwealth, the member States of the South\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) and the front-\nline States, as well as many other good friends who\nrendered support and encouragement to Namibia in the\nnegotiating process.\nAt this point let me reiterate what I said then, that a\nsuccessful resolution of this issue will not only\nconsolidate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our\ncountry but will also create enormous opportunity for\neconomic integration, community- building and prosperity\nfor the SADC region. New vistas for trade, transport and\ncommunication would be opened up throughout southern\nAfrica. And this will further stimulate free movement of\ngoods, services and people in the area. Walvis Bay will\ngreatly complement other ports in the region.\nIt is a truism that peace, democracy, political\nstability and good governance are among the basic pillars\nfor development. The southern African region presents a\ngood example of transformation from war, conflicts,\neconomic destabilization, political instability, social\ndisintegration, suppression and denial of human rights to\nthe new situation of peace, democracy, stability, regional\ncooperation and hope for a more prosperous future for us\nall. The former Southern Africa Development\nCoordinating Conference (SADCC) vigorously sought to\ncounteract the destabilization and subversion of the\n17\n\n\ncountries of the region by the apartheid regime of South\nAfrica. The front-line States, with vigour and\ndetermination, also pursued the fight for liberation, peace,\npolitical stability, democratization and promotion and\nprotection of human rights. Now, with the eradication of\napartheid in South Africa and the installation of the first\ndemocratically elected Government, the struggle for\nfreedom and political emancipation in southern Africa was\ncrowned with a gigantic victory.\nThe people of South Africa finally triumphed over the\napartheid system. The epoch making inauguration of\nPresident Nelson Mandela, on 10 May 1994, was a victory\nfor humanity and a vindication of the untold sacrifices of\nthe South African people. The international community,\nand in particular the countries and the peoples of southern\nAfrica, celebrated this joyous event, confident in the\nconviction that peace had finally come to our region. We\nin Namibia are particularly gratified to welcome the new\nSouth Africa into the fold of the community of nations.\nJust as we struggled together during the apartheid era, we\nlook forward to strengthened partnership for development\nand prosperity for our people and the region.\nThe time for reconstruction and economic cooperation\nin the region has finally dawned. We are convinced that\nthe transformation in 1992 of the Southern African\nDevelopment Coordinating Conference into the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) will further\nconsolidate regional economic cooperation and all-round\ndevelopment for the prosperity of all our people.\nThis will indeed serve as a formidable building-block\ntowards the realization of the goals of the African\nEconomic Community, especially in the field of inter-Africa\ntrade, investment, capacity-building and human resource\ndevelopment. In this context, Namibia welcomes with\nappreciation President Clinton\u2019s announcement yesterday in\nWashington that the United States Government will make\na substantial financial contribution to reconstruction and\ndevelopment in South Africa, as well as in other countries\nin the region. It is good news for us that a friend of\nAfrica, Ambassador Andrew Young, will coordinate this\nprogramme.\nLet me mention here the recent first-ever meeting\nbetween Foreign Ministers of the European Union and\nSADC held last month in Berlin. The meeting was historic\nand elevated the interaction and cooperative relations\nbetween the two regions to a higher political and economic\nlevel.\nThe past four years have seen throughout Africa a\nprocess of free and fair elections, multi-party democracy,\nthe protection of human rights, press freedom, the rule of\nlaw, and market-oriented economies. This process has\ntaken a firm direction and produced positive results in\nsouthern Africa and in other parts of Africa. In 1989,\nsuccessful independence elections were held which\nculminated in a free and independent Namibia in 1990.\nIn 1991, democratic elections were held in Zambia; in\n1992 free and fair elections were held in Angola, though\nregrettably UNITA refused to accept the results and\nrestarted the fighting; Lesotho held multi-party democratic\nelections in 1993; and this year, South Africa and Malawi\nunderwent democratic transformations. In October,\nBotswana and Mozambique will hold democratic\nelections. Multi-party democratic, presidential and\nparliamentary elections are scheduled in Namibia in\nDecember this year. Likewise, 1995 will see multi-party\ndemocratic elections in Tanzania and general elections in\nZimbabwe. This would mean that the vision for\ndeepening democratization, peace, prosperity and true\npartnership in SADC will be greatly boosted.\nIn the emerging world order resulting from the end\nof the cold war and the victories scored by the forces of\nliberation, the front-line States decided that the time had\ncome to transform themselves into a mechanism for\npolitical consultations, conflict resolution, peace and\nsecurity in the SADC region. The new body which is\nnow being put together is intended to augment the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) mechanism for\nconflict resolution and peace-keeping, and will serve\nprimarily as the political and security arm of SADC itself.\nThe countries of SADC, through this mechanism, are\ncommitted to defend and protect constitutional order and\nthe rule of law. Through their common vision for peace\nand development, a task force of three Heads of State\nrecently succeeded in peacefully redressing the attempted\noverthrow of the democratically elected Government of\nLesotho. It was a first major test, and the SADC leaders\nrose to the occasion and defused what was potentially an\nexplosive situation with serious consequences for the\nwhole region.\nAfrica needs to produce similar success stories,\nthrough concerted regional initiatives, in other conflict\nsituations such as Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Somalia, the\nSudan and others. Naturally, we welcome the serious\nefforts which are being made by neighbouring African\nStates in and relating to each one of these trouble spots.\nTo this end, Africa and the international community alike\nshould heed the appeals for contributions to the OAU\n18\n\n\nPeace Fund. In Namibia, we believe that once given\nadequate financial and human resources Mr. Salim Ahmed\nSalim, the OAU Secretary-General, and his staff are\ncapable of implementing expeditiously the relevant\ndecisions of the succeeding summits of African leaders.\nIn Angola, it is our strong expectation that the\nprotracted negotiations currently under way in Lusaka\nappear poised for an imminent and successful conclusion.\nThe Government and the people of Namibia are indeed\nawaiting the successful resolution of this bloody conflict.\nIn their own modest way, the Government and the people\nof Namibia will continue to play a constructive role to\nhasten this process. The statement made last week from\nthis rostrum by the Foreign Minister of Angola\ndemonstrated once again the flexibility and genuine\ngoodwill of the Angolan Government to reach a peaceful\nsettlement in the interest of the suffering Angolan people.\nUNITA, it is sad to say, continues to obstruct progress and\nwage war. It should be made to heed the urgent warnings\nof the Security Council. The United Nations should, in the\nmeantime, keep itself in readiness to increase its personnel\nin Angola as soon as a cease-fire is restored. The ever-\nincreasing peace-keeping missions of the United Nations\nneed sound financial support, if indeed peace is to be\nachieved and preserved. I therefore urge the States\nMembers of our Organization to heed the\nSecretary-General\u2019s call in his current report for adequate\nfunding for peace-keeping operations.\n\nNamibia is very much encouraged by the recent\nconclusion of an agreement between the Governments of\nthe United States of America and the Republic of Cuba on\nimmigration issues. It is our fervent hope that the signing\nof this agreement will serve as the beginning of serious\nnegotiations to resolve all aspects of the long-standing\ndispute between them, in the interest of peace, trade,\ndevelopment and good neighbourliness. I made the same\nplea last year from here, and the latest development helps\nto keep my hope alive. Namibia enjoys excellent friendly\nand productive relations with both countries. It is in this\nspirit that we advocate rapprochement between them.\nWe consider that in both elections and governance\npopular participation is a prerequisite for development and\nprosperity. At independence, however, Namibia inherited\na dual economy that was based on an unequal distribution\nof wealth and disparity of income resulting from apartheid.\nAs a result, the majority of the population has incomes that\nare far below the national average. To redress these\nimbalances, the Government has been pursuing prudent\neconomic policies aimed at improving the lives of the\nmajority of our citizens. The direction is clear, although\nthe road ahead is replete with pitfalls. However, I must\nsay that the Government\u2019s will and determination to\nsucceed cannot be doubted.\nIn 1991, Namibia sought least-developed-country\nstatus to redress imbalances in education, health, housing\nand employment. The granting by the General Assembly\nof the \\\"as if\\\" least-developed-country option to Namibia,\nif not the full status of least-developed country,\nnonetheless allowed us to lay the foundation for the\nreconstruction of our economic and social structures.\nIn spite of the Government\u2019s best efforts in these\ncritical areas, imbalances persist in our society.\nProvisional figures from the ongoing 1993-1994 National\nHousing, Income and Expenditure Survey provide clear\nevidence of skewed income distribution. Using private\nhousehold consumption as an indicator, preliminary\nsurvey estimates show that 50 per cent of the poorest\nhouseholds account for about 13 per cent of the total\nconsumption. The richest 10 per cent of the households\nconsume about 33 per cent.\nThe low literacy rate, the low level of manufacturing\nindustry and the extremely skewed distribution of income\nare a result of institutionalized social inequality over long\nperiods. These social and economic sequels of the old\napartheid order continue to bedevil the Government\u2019s\ndevelopmental efforts. In accordance with our current \\\"as\nif\\\" status, and with the assistance of the World Bank, the\nNamibian Government is at present preparing a public\nexpenditure review. The findings so far point to dramatic\nincome disparities, in spite of the efforts by the\nGovernment that I alluded to earlier.\nIt is in this context that Namibia wishes to appeal\nonce again to the States Members of our Organization for\nan extension of the \\\"as if\\\" least-developed-country status\nfor an additional number of years. This will be an\nenormous contribution to our determined efforts to\nimprove the quality of life for disadvantaged Namibians.\nWe thank those States and agencies that have\nimplemented resolution 46/204, on \\\"as if\\\" least-\ndeveloped-country status and appeal for their continued\nassistance, which will strengthen the foundation we have\nlaid for development and further consolidate our\ndemocracy.\n19\n\n\nThe United Nations is centrally placed to address the\nmajor global problems facing us. Its focus, however,\nshould not be limited to the issues of peace and security.\nThe other critical issues, reconstruction and development,\nmust be given the same serious attention. The World\nSummit on Social Development, for example, must be a\nforum for us to renew our commitment and political will to\neffectively address the diverse social and economic\nproblems. We must come away from Copenhagen to act;\nthe international community this time will need to summon\nmore courage in order to translate into action the bold\ndecisions we shall take. There is a linkage between the\nPlan of Action and follow-up mechanisms adopted at the\nCairo population Conference and the goals of the\nCopenhagen and the Beijing Conferences in 1995. This\nrequires greater and systematic coordination, so as to ensure\neconomy, efficiency and the achievement of goals we all\nshare.\nThe continued marginalization and exclusion of\nwomen from many spheres of life are a challenge to us all.\nThe platform for action to be adopted at the Fourth World\nConference on Women, to be held in Beijing next year,\nmust therefore assure the full and equal participation of\nwomen at all levels of society. Namibia\u2019s Constitution\ncalls for affirmative action and enlightened policies to\neffect positive change in this area of human endeavour.\nNamibia is an active member of the Zone of Peace\nand Cooperation of the South Atlantic and will continue to\npursue the vigorous promotion of trade in the South\nAtlantic region, including the development of fisheries and\nmarine resources as well as tourism on a sustainable basis.\nThe South Atlantic region comprises a great expanse of\nwaters, which the countries of the Zone are committed to\nkeep nuclear-free. Similarly, African countries are about to\nsign a treaty for the denuclearization of the continent.\nIn recent weeks, important meetings of Ministers and\nofficials of the African and Latin American countries have\ntaken place in Punta del Este, Uruquay, and Brasilia, Brazil,\nto further advance dialogue and cooperation on issues of\ncommon interest. It was in this spirit of South-South\ncooperation that Namibia supported the establishment of the\nSouth Centre, towards whose operations we have already\nmade a significant contribution.\nI should now like to state Namibia\u2019s position on the\noverall reform of the United Nations, and in particular\nequitable representation on and increase in the membership\nof the Security Council. Namibia does not believe that the\npresent decision- making machinery of the Security\nCouncil will effectively serve the international community\nin the twenty-first century. Change towards a more\nrepresentative Council would enhance its legitimacy,\ncredibility and effectiveness.\nRepresentation on the Security Council must reflect\nthe phenomenal numerical growth in the membership of\nthe General Assembly. In line with the principle of\ngeographical and equitable representation, Africa is\nentitled to an appropriate representation of no fewer than\ntwo permanent seats on the Security Council. For us,\nSecurity Council reform means more than merely adding\ntwo or more industrialized permanent members. What is\nrequired is democracy, transparency and fair play.\nNamibia reiterates its position that the veto power is\noutdated and undemocratic and should be abolished.\nEqually, the General Assembly should not be allowed to\nlose its authority, competence and relevance in the reform\nprocess. Rather, it too needs further strengthening in all\naspects.\nNamibia is of the strong view that the United\nNations, and Africa in particular, should leave no stone\nunturned to ensure that the people of Western Sahara are\nnot left to face their fate alone. The decolonization and\npolitical emancipation of Africa cannot be declared\ncomplete without self-determination for them as well\nthrough a democratic referendum jointly supervised by the\nUnited Nations and the OAU.\nWith regard to the dispute between two of our\nesteemed friends, India and Pakistan, on the question of\nJammu and Kashmir, Namibia urges them to pursue\npeaceful dialogue and promote bilateral negotiations\nwithout public confrontation.\nOn another issue, we are encouraged by Libya\u2019s\nacceptance of Security Council resolution 731 (1992) and\nits expressed willingness to resolve the Lockerbie crisis\nwith the three Western Powers. Dialogue and diplomacy\nshould be placed on the front burner.\nNext year the Non-Proliferation Treaty review and\nextension Conference will be held. Namibia is a\nsignatory to the Treaty. It goes without saying that the\nConference will provide a golden opportunity for review,\nassessment and extension of this vital Treaty, which has\nso far helped to prevent nuclear war. There is also a\nproposal by Zimbabwe, a proposal that we fully support,\nto seek an advisory opinion from the International Court\nof Justice on the legality of the use and threat of use of\nnuclear weapons.\n20\n\n\nOther critical issues, such as general and complete\ndisarmament, nuclear technology, nuclear-weapon-free\nzones and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, also need to\nbe discussed and resolved. Once there is consensus on\nthese and other related concerns, the extension of the\nTreaty, limited or unlimited, can be resolved to the\nsatisfaction of both nuclear and non-nuclear States parties.\nThe peace process in the Middle East continues to\ngain momentum and wider acceptance in the region and\nbeyond it. For us, the centre-piece of this peace process is\nand must remain full realization of the right of\nself-determination of the Palestinian people, led by the\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which must lead\nto complete nationhood.\nIn conclusion, as we approach the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations and are about to usher in a new\nmillennium, it is time for the world to take stock. The\nworld leadership of today comes largely from a generation\nthat saw violent conflicts, the untold devastation of societies\nand families and shattered hopes and dreams. We can, on\nthe whole, visualize peace, though it is not yet assured in\nall regions. However, the vision of peace prevails over the\nvision of conflicts, and we must be determined to defend it.\nIt is the vision of peace that we must bequeath to the next\ngeneration. That should be the gift of our time to the next\ncentury.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me pleasure to extend to you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of the State of Kuwait, our sincere congratulations on your well-deserved unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your qualities of leadership will ensure efficient and smooth deliberations. I take this opportunity to underline the good and friendly relations that exist between Kuwait and your country.\nI should like also to pay tribute to Mr. Samuel Insanally, the President of the last session of the Assembly, for the competence he demonstrated in guiding the Assembly's proceedings during his term of office. The delegation of Kuwait would like to place on record its appreciation for the achievements made under his leadership.\nI wish also to reiterate the appreciation of the Government and people of Kuwait and my own personal recognition of the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his consistent efforts to enhance the performance of the world body and the pursuit of its goals on behalf of mankind. Kuwait fully supports the Secretary-General's vision in carrying out his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\", in which he elaborated his concept of preventive diplomacy.\nNext year, the United Nations will commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of its creation as an Organization of sovereign States whose relations are governed by the principles and purposes embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. The overriding concern of this global institution is to secure world peace, the independence of nations and freedom, and to harness energies for construction and development. The United Nations system is also a framework within which we collectively seek to alleviate the misery and suffering of our deprived and disadvantaged fellow human beings. It is in this context that people would attain their freedom and independence, colonial rule would come to an end and the right to self- determination would become more entrenched than ever before. Thanks to the United Nations mandates, universal efforts are ever-growing to liberate humanity from the grip of suppression and fear and from the shackles of backwardness and ignorance, on the one hand, and to ensure global security and stability, on the other.\nThe results of these efforts over several decades have been reflected in major historic achievements despite all the challenges and odds faced by peoples in their steady endeavours to attain independence and reaffirm their identity. All those accomplishments turned out to be the salient features of our collective vision of the future. In all fairness, the admirable work of the United Nations and its accomplishments since its inception proved the relevance and importance of the tenets and objectives upon which it was conceived. In the early days, freedom from colonialism was the primary concern. The focus has now shifted to the improvement of general living conditions. In the past, the struggle was for independence, whereas the challenge now lies in the reaffirmation of and commitment to the rights of the human person to a decent life in freedom.\nIndeed, the world has recently undergone an enormous transformation in terms of ideology, systems of governance and international relations. The United Nations interacted with these changes. The era of confrontation between ideological blocs has now given way to genuine mutual and multilateral interdependence. A cursory glance at the recent and forthcoming United Nations major world conferences clearly proves this trend. There was the Earth Summit in\nRio de Janeiro in 1992, the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993 and the Conference on Population and Development which ended days ago in Cairo. The World Summit for Social Development and the World Conference on Women are to be held in Copenhagen and Beijing, respectively, next year.\nIn this regard, Kuwait supports the movement towards renewal and restructuring, away from the static stereotypes of the past. To our minds, international restructuring is a constant evolutionary process which should be responsive to the ever-changing global developments. Hence our active contribution to the efforts made by the General Assembly and its organs towards updating and reviving the mechanisms of the United Nations system. It is our hope that the current streamlining exercise will foster the capability of the United Nations to meet the increasing demand for its services and operations and will contribute to a better fulfilment of its mandates under the Charter.\nIn particular, we look forward to the development of the work, composition and effectiveness of the Security Council so that it may reflect the recent changes on the world scene, on the one hand, and satisfy the wishes and aspirations of the United Nations larger membership, on the other.\nIn the meantime, Kuwait believes that our collective efforts should at this stage focus on the formulation of more recognizable parameters of an international order which should be based on the following facts.\nFirstly, the rationale, essence and thrust of the new order should derive from logical facts. Dialogue, persuasion and non-use of force, the rejection of aggression, the condemnation of terrorism and respect for the rights of all Member States to pursue their own policies in such a way that ensures their own interests within an international framework structured along the lines of justice, equality, the rule of law and compliance with international treaties, especially the United Nations Charter, should all be key components of the new vision.\nSecondly, focus on human development in the context of economic and social development should represent a qualitative shift away from the futile, indeed harmful, stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction and the consequential squandering of national assets on disastrous aggressive adventures. In this regard, Kuwait has evolved a relevant vision through its painful experience of the brutal Iraqi occupation. One of the major lessons drawn is that the issue of human resources development should be accorded a higher priority on the international agenda.\nThirdly, the promotion of North-South dialogue with a view to narrowing the existing gaps in the living standards of the two groups. The ultimate aim is to ensure that the North should not continue to maintain an almost exclusive monopoly of wealth and affluence while the South continues to languish in the tight grip of endless poverty. Is it not high time for us all to recognize that the concept of collective security will remain seriously deficient and doubtful under the existing socio-economic equation, i.e. a minority living in luxurious comfort while the majority is striving to survive in appalling misery?\nFourthly, insistence on the elimination of all vestiges and forms of racial discrimination, including opposition to the neo-racist policies and practices that surfaced as a result of the collapse of the old order. Obviously, the neo-racists resort to the use of force in order to secure territorial gains and to acquire land by force under the smoke screen of ethnic cleansing. Within the practice of ethnic cleansing emerges an unmistakable pattern at work. Intensely bestial instincts of mass murder and destruction break loose, contrary to all norms of human discipline and civilized conduct. Therefore, we are all duty-bound to resist and suppress this criminal tendency in order to reassure all peoples of their sense of human community and common destiny.\nIn this context, I wish to pay tribute to the leaders of South Africa and to congratulate the people of South Africa on their triumph over the system of apartheid. We know too well the great sacrifices they made and the long hard path they forged to reach where they are now. I am confident that the emergence of a non-racial South Africa to the arena and the resumption of its role in the United Nations will in time contribute significantly to multilateralism in terms of consolidating the principles of justice and equality. There is no question but that the struggle of the people of South Africa to eliminate racism will probably remain for a long time to come a rich source of inspiration for all of us.\nIn the crucial area of peace-building on the basis of justice, the Middle East region has recently seen dramatic developments that could indeed prove to be historic turning- point, which may well be recorded in the annals of peace achievements despite the enormous problems arising from the many hotbeds of tension that jeopardize security and stability in different regions of the world. Following their agreement to end the state of war between them, Jordan and Israel signed an accord to serve as a basis for a just settlement.\nAlso, the Palestinian National Authority started to assume its responsibilities in the local administration of Gaza and Jericho in the Israeli-occupied territories as a first and important step towards the exercise by the people of Palestine of their inalienable right to self-determination.\nFurthermore, contacts are now under way to ensure the resumption of negotiations on both the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks, which would lead to a just peace that would address, as we hope, in a an equitable and responsible manner, the concerns of all parties directly involved. Kuwait has expressed its support for these endeavours. It also participated in the multilateral meetings, while fully convinced that this formula is doomed to failure unless concrete and significant progress is achieved on all bilateral tracks. The multilateral formula, as we must always bear in mind, is an arrangement to back up the bilateral tracks, and not a by-pass to skirt them. It was in this spirit that Kuwait participated in the regional meetings, and out of our conviction that endorsement of and support for the peace process in the Middle East was in the final analysis a collective responsibility to be shared by the international community inasmuch as the entire world, not just certain protagonists, stands to gain from its benefits. For the record only, let me recall that Kuwait had participated in the ad hoc meetings on economic development for the territories subject to self-government. We contributed $25 million towards building the institutions required for the creation of the Palestinian National Authority.\nThe People of Palestine have suffered over the past several decades unspeakable injustice and deprivation as a result of the loss of their land, the denial of their right to self-determination and from being prevented from establishing their national State. It is our hope now that this people, which is recognized for resourcefulness and a sense of purpose, will at long last be able to exercise its full rights like all other peoples, including the establishment of its State, whose capital would be Al-Quds Al-Shareef.\nLet me reiterate that the underpinnings of lasting stability and comprehensive peace as envisioned in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), together with the concept of land for peace, require a firm political commitment to ensure progress on all tracks - especially the Syrian track, which is the cornerstone of the peace-building process. Full withdrawal from occupied Syrian territory is therefore essential. Equally essential is the complete and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which requires a total Israeli pull out from southern Lebanon.\nIn today's world, which is characterized by interrelated and complex interests and civilized conduct on the basis of compliance with the rule of law and respect for international treaties; in today's world, when the winds of modernism have been blowing even to the most distant regions, the Iraqi regime continues to be a menace to security and stability in our region. It persists in defying the collective will of the international community as represented by the Security Council. This is demonstrated by its failure thus far to comply unconditionally with all the Council resolutions relating to its aggression against the State of Kuwait. Its reaction has invariably been characterized by subterfuge, procrastination, equivocation and selectivity.\nAlthough more than four years have now passed since the Iraqi regime was defeated and its forces evicted from Kuwait, and regardless of its acceptance of all Security Council resolutions, including Security Council resolution 687 (1991), which set forth cease-fire conditions and highlighted regional security arrangements, the regime continues to refuse to address the core issue of the whole problem, namely recognition of the State of Kuwait and of its sovereignty within the international borders as demarcated, approved and endorsed by the United Nations and guaranteed by Security Council resolution 833 (1993), adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nThe international community's firmness in the face of the Iraqi regime's manoeuvres, the Security Council unanimity in its insistence on seeing the Iraqi regime fulfil all its obligations under Council resolutions are the right and appropriate response to the defiant stand of the Iraqi regime.\nAt this juncture, let me outline Kuwait's policy regarding this fateful question. First, Iraq must unconditionally implement all Security Council resolutions relating to its aggression, especially resolution 687 (1991).\nSecondly, Iraq must accept Security Council resolution 833 (1993) regarding the demarcation of borders between Iraq and the State of Kuwait. Here, Kuwait insists that such acceptance should come in a clear and unequivocal manner. It should be formally documented by the Iraqi\nRevolutionary Command Council and the Iraqi National Council and published in the Iraqi Official Gazette. All the above should then be set out in a letter addressed to the Security Council and deposited as an official document in the records of the United Nations.\nThirdly, Iraq should cooperate in good faith and in a responsible manner with the International Committee of the Red Cross in accounting for all Kuwaiti and third- country prisoners and detainees. Serious efforts must be made to resolve this long-standing humanitarian issue, which has long been exploited by the Iraqi regime as a bargaining chip for securing narrow gains.\nFourthly, all provisions of Security Council resolutions relating to the return of Kuwaiti property and to compensation must be carried out. We would also like to see concrete implementation of the paragraphs relating to the Iraqi armament programme, the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and the export-import permanent control system.\nFifthly, Iraq's regional behaviour should not jeopardize security and stability in the region. Iraq should respect the norms of good neighbourliness by renouncing its greedy claims and its policy of blackmail; it should cease intervening in the internal affairs of neighbour countries and abstain from sponsoring and supporting terrorism, and it should renounce the aggressive tendencies which have been its hallmark for too long.\nOnce again, we would like to underline the fact that we in Kuwait are aware of the suffering of the people of Iraq and sympathize with the Iraqis who have had to endure hardship as a result of the policies pursued by a regime imposing itself by force on the Iraqi people. That is the very same regime which declines to utilize the mechanism offered to export oil under Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991). In the same vein, let me emphasize that we would like to see the territorial integrity of Iraq preserved and safeguarded. This too is an essential component of regional stability.\nThe whole set of Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq constitutes one indivisible political and legal whole. We cannot and should not tolerate the selective approach pursued by the Iraqi regime in implementing Council resolutions. Core issues must be addressed squarely by Iraq, otherwise it will remain under the illusion that it can dent the steadfast position of the Security Council. At this point, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Security Council, which demonstrated unanimity in its recent review of sanctions against Iraq on 14 September. The Council reaffirmed that the sovereignty and boundaries of the State of Kuwait under its resolution 833 (1993) are the essence of the matter and that this will form the basis of the Council's priorities in dealing with the sanctions regime.\nHigh among Kuwait's national priorities comes the issue of stability in the Gulf region. Accordingly, we have been working in close collaboration with other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to resolve all the outstanding problems between Iran and the United Arab Emirates in regard to the three islands - Abu Moussa, Greater Tumb and Smaller Tumb - through dialogue and on the basis of respect for national rights and international treaties. Hence, we have supported the recent initiative by the United Arab Emirates to have recourse to the International Court of Justice, which is the international judicial organ that has the competence to resolve disputes between States. In the meantime, we are confident that both parties to the conflict will demonstrate reason and prudence and that they are eager to reach a just and peaceful settlement of the litigation through legal channels and in such a way that would not compromise the rights of the United Arab Emirates.\nKuwait is following with deep concern the situation in Afghanistan. We appeal to all factions there to put the interests of the Afghani people ahead of all other considerations. We sincerely call upon them to put an end to the fighting and to help facilitate the current efforts of the United Nations to bring about national unity and channel energies towards reconstruction.\nWe are distressed also by the increasing deterioration of the situation in sisterly Somalia. Again, we appeal to all factions that are engaged in the conflict there to demonstrate wisdom by acting in accordance with the interests of all Somali people. We pray for national reconciliation that will preserve the unity and independence of Somalia.\nThe tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina is of great concern to the Government and people of Kuwait. Initially, we were optimistic that the efforts of the Contact Group would prove to be successful in reaching the comprehensive Peace Plan. The Bosnian Muslims and Croats gave the internationally supported peace plan their approval despite the fact that it did not satisfy all their legitimate demands. However, the Bosnian Serbs, in open defiance of the international will, rejected the Plan and, instead, relied on the use of force to impose a fait accompli and to exact territorial gains, at the expense of other parties.\nKuwait believes that the Security Council should, without any further delay, lift the embargo imposed on arms supplies to the Bosnian Muslim to enable them to exercise their legitimate right of self-defence in the face of blatant aggression.\nIn today's world it is totally unacceptable that we should all remain virtually passive witnesses to an exercise in which a minority, through the use of overwhelming military force, tramples the legitimate rights of the majority.\nIn the context of global realities on the ground, the international community should not underestimate the gravity of problems faced by the developing nations in their pursuit of economic development and progress. Economic readjustment and restructuring, foreign-debt burdens and pressures of inflation are but a few of these weighty problems. These obstacles to development were recognized by Kuwait at an early stage. Hence, Kuwait took the initiative to write off loans of developing countries whose repayment was overdue. Parallel to that action, we have expanded the operations of the Kuwait fund for economic development. We have also increased our contributions to the regional and international financial institutions.\nFor more than two decades now my country has been playing a leading role in the provision of aid to developing countries. The total assistance provided by Kuwait exceeds 4 per cent of its annual gross national product and is more than four times the suggested level of official development assistance. That being the case, we hope that developed countries will increase the level of their assistance with a view to reducing the current disparities in standards of living.\nAn effort to narrow the gaps between the living conditions of peoples around the world would make a powerful impact on world peace and stability. Equally, the creation of job opportunities and the maintenance of hope in the future are essential for a peaceful life at home and to harmonious relations between nations.\nIn this context, Kuwait welcomes the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreement that was achieved after long and arduous rounds of negotiations, and it looks forward to the entry into force of that agreement following the required endorsements.\nDialogue, understanding and rapprochement are valuable tools in international relations. They facilitate our cooperation and our collective endeavours, as a family of nations, to meet our needs and fulfil our aspirations. If the fruits of technology and science can be fully harnessed for this purpose we shall reap the benefits thereof. The whole planet has indeed become a global village, in which we can closely follow world events as they unfold, thanks to the great leaps forward in the areas of science, technology, transportation, communications and information technology.\nIf anything, this is a testimony to impressive human cooperation. Such cooperation, when anchored in dialogue and understanding, is perhaps the most viable option for bringing us closer to peace, stability and progress.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, at the outset, to\ncommend Mr. Samuel Insanally for the able manner in\nwhich he conducted the work of the forty-eighth session\nof the General Assembly.\nI would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of this, the forty-ninth session. I\nwish you success in pursuing this very important task.\nI thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak\non behalf of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at\nthis distinguished gathering.\nI come from Bosnia and Herzegovina, a far-away\ncountry that has currently been the subject of many\ndiscussions.\nUnfortunately, I have to begin my statement by\nrepeating facts that, for most of you, may be or should be\nwell known.\nAt the time - some three years ago - when\nYugoslavia experienced its dissolution, we were doing our\nbest to carry out the separation in a peaceful fashion and\nwithout any violence. For reasons already known, our\ninitiatives did not bear fruit.\n5\n\n\nWhen Slovenia and Croatia seceded, and the\ndissolution of Yugoslavia had become inevitable, we\norganized a referendum in order to decide, in a democratic\nmanner, the fate of Bosnia. By a two-thirds majority -\nexactly 64.4 per cent of the body of registered voters,\ncitizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, opted for the country\u2019s\nindependence in the referendum of 1 March 1992.\nInternational recognition of our country followed soon\nthereafter, and so did the aggression against it. The\ndecision on its recognition was made on 5 April 1992 and\nwas announced the following day, 6 April 1992. The\nSerbian and Montenegrin aggression against Bosnia and\nHerzegovina began on 5 April 1992, the very day when the\ndecision on recognition of the country was adopted.\nThe aggression has continued to this day with more or,\nat times, less intensity, and without any prospect of its\ncoming to an end in the near future.\nThe war that was forced upon Bosnia and Herzegovina\nand its peoples - and that has now entered its thirty-first month -\nis one of the bloodiest wars in the history of mankind. At\nthe very beginning, it was not a war but rather an attack by\na well-armed and equipped army, the former Yugoslav\narmy, against defenceless citizens.\nThe results of this uneven struggle are as follows:\n70 per cent of our country came under occupation in the\nfirst months of the war; more than 200,000 civilians have\nbeen killed; over 1 million - or one fourth - of our\ninhabitants have been expelled from their homes; hundreds\nof cities and villages have been destroyed and burned. This\ncannot be described as a classic example of warfare\nbetween two armies. This has been a war of an army\nagainst civilians, followed by genocide and, to date,\nunprecedented destruction of cultural and religious objects.\nThe world has not responded in an appropriate manner\nto such barbarity.\nWhether it was because of the brutality of the attack,\nor because it was morally and psychologically unprepared,\nor perhaps because of its entanglement in its conflicting\ninterests, the world seemed confused and hesitant.\nWhen the news and pictures of new concentration\ncamps in the heart of Europe came out, the public was\nastonished or shocked, but for the most part those\nresponsible kept silent. Tens of thousands have perished in\nthose camps and many thousands have disappeared without\na trace. The more brutal an attack, the more hesitant the\nworld became. The free world neither defended nor\nsupported freedom. Our people, facing the threat of\nextermination and a clearly pronounced death sentence,\ndecided to defend itself.\nBut then it encountered a new absurdity. It found its\nhands tied. In short, before the war broke out against\nBosnia and Herzegovina the United Nations imposed a\nnotorious resolution that banned any import of weapons\ninto the territory of former Yugoslavia. Everything\nchanged: the war began, the aggressor and the victim\nwere clearly discernable, but the arms embargo has\nremained in place as if nothing had happened in the\ninterim. Justice was turned into injustice because the\naggressor had weapons - weapons that had been\nstockpiled over the course of 40 years - while the victim\nwas unarmed and its hands were kept tied.\nThe resolution on the arms embargo became its own\ncontradiction. By maintaining the imbalance in\nweaponry, it has prolonged the war and turned the peace\nnegotiations into diktat by the better-armed aggressor.\nWe said to the world, \\\"You do not have to come to\ndefend us, but do at least untie our hands and allow us to\ndefend ourselves. While they kill our children, rape our\nwomen and destroy all our relics, do recognize our right\nto self-defence.\\\"\nSo far, however, the arms embargo has remained in\nplace. With only guns and rifles in their hands, our\ndefenders have faced artillery and tanks. We have lost\nmany people, and reports indicate that more than 90 per\ncent of them have been killed by grenades and artillery\nshells. Our cities and villages have been left at the mercy\nof the powerful military technology in the hands of the\nmurderers. In the capital city of Sarajevo alone, more\nthan 10,000 people have been killed and more than\n50,000 wounded. Not a single family is without\ncasualties, either killed or wounded.\nTo all this, the world has sent us one message:\nnegotiate. In the belief that the only right path was to\ncontinue to defend our land and that in this just struggle\nthe peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples of the world\nwould support us, we refused for a very long time to\nnegotiate with war criminals.\nFinally, faced with the unbearable plight of our\npeople and the world\u2019s indifference, without any choice\nwe accepted negotiations. It turned out that the aggressor\nhad only been using negotiations as a way to bargain for\ntime and to cover up its continuation of the aggression.\n6\n\n\nIn March 1993, after long and painful negotiations and with\nmany concessions from our side, we signed the so-called\nVance-Owen plan. The aggressor rejected it.\nThe next bloody round in the war ensued, to be\nfollowed by another round of negotiations that resulted, on\n5 July 1994, in a peace plan drawn up by the Contact\nGroup consisting of five great Powers: the United States of\nAmerica, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the\nRussian Federation. Again, we chose peace and the\nattackers, once again, opted for a continuation of the war.\nWe accepted the unjust peace offer in order to halt the\nwar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We did so in the hope\nthat the injustice of the peace plan could still be corrected\nin the years of peace. Knowing the Bosnian soul, we\nbelieved - and we still believe - that peace can save - but\nthat war will destroy - all that we call Bosnia.\nWhat we call \\\"Bosnia\\\" is not merely a small piece of\nland in the Balkans. For many of us, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is not only a homeland: it is an idea; it is a\nbelief that peoples of different religions, different\nnationalities and different cultural traditions can live\ntogether. Were this dream to be forever buried, were this\nidea of tolerance among the peoples of the area to be\nirretrievably lost, the guilt would lie not only with those\nwho have been relentlessly killing Bosnia with their mortars\nfor over 30 months now but also with many of the\npowerful elsewhere in the world who could have helped yet\nhave chosen to do otherwise.\nTwo days ago, I left Sarajevo. I did not leave by\nplane because the airport was closed. I had to take land\nroutes through woods that are constantly exposed to fire\nand where many people are killed daily. For days there is\nno electricity, water and gas in the city. The capital is\ncompletely blocked and is virtually dying.\nYesterday, after I had arrived at United Nations\nHeadquarters, I received a letter from Srebrenica, a small\ntown on the river Drina. The letter was supposed to be a\nreport, but it was also a cry from a real human hell. I\ncould not find the strength to read it a second time.\nOver three months ago \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" was\nreignited, and there is now a new wave. Thousands of\ncivilians whose only fault is that they are not Serbs have\nbeen expelled from their homes in Banja Luka, Bijeljina,\nJanja and other towns under the control of Karadzic\u2019s army.\nOnce again, nothing has been done. The world seems to\nhave grown gradually accustomed to unpunished violations\nof the basic norms of international law. This is a sorry\nsituation, and one that concerns every man and every\nwoman in the world, no matter how near or far from\nBosnia they may be.\nFor a very long time I rejected - indeed, I still\nreject - any so-called conspiracy theory, the theory that all\nthat has happened to Bosnia has happened because its\nmajority nation is Muslim and there are dark powers that\nconsciously impel the Serbs towards the extermination of\nBosnian Muslims.\nThose who support this theory have their arguments,\nand I believe they have been heard here before. They\nmaintain that overt aggression, followed by genocide,\nconcentration camps and other forms of the darkest\nfascism, is at work in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that\nthe world must be blind not to see it. Is the world blind?\nDoes it consciously condone all these evils? It cannot be\nblind, and there is thus only the other alternative. This is\nthe argument that has gained an increasing number of\nsupporters. It will not be a good thing if the world\u2019s\nbillion Muslims come to accept it.\nThe latest events surrounding the plan of the Contact\nGroup have given the supporters of the so-called\nconspiracy theory an additional argument, namely, that\nBosnia and Herzegovina has been offered a proposal\nbacked by five major Powers and, therefore, by the\nmajority of the international community, and it has been\nclearly stated that the side that rejected the plan would be\npunished while the side that accepted it would be\nprotected. Yet the opposite has happened. The Serbs\nrejected the plan, and they have been rewarded by the\nsuspension of sanctions. We have accepted the plan, and\nwe have been punished by a complete blockade of\nSarajevo. Both processes have occurred simultaneously,\nin parallel.\nToday, the highest civilian and military United\nNations authorities are warning us: If you demand and\nsucceed in achieving the lifting of the arms embargo, the\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) will pull\nout of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and so\non.\nI have certainly not undertaken this long and arduous\njourney from Bosnia to America solely to convey facts\nthat may be known to the majority of those here. We in\nBosnia believe that, despite the hardships, good and\njustice cannot be defeated. We do not abandon our faith\n7\n\n\nthat the world can be better and that we should all work\nand strive continually to make it better.\nIn this conviction, and despite all our disappointments\nand frustrations, I have come to speak here before the\nAssembly and to present some of our proposals. From the\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, we are asking\nthe following: first, that all resolutions on Bosnia and\nHerzegovina adopted by the Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly be implemented; secondly, that measures\nbe taken effectively to monitor the border between Serbia\nand Montenegro, on the one side, and Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, on the other, so that any transport of troops,\nweapons and military equipment across that border may be\nprevented or detected in timely fashion; thirdly, that should\nthis transport occur, the decision on the suspension of some\nof the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro - Security\nCouncil resolution 943 (1994) - be immediately revoked\nand that tightened sanction measures be imposed in\naccordance with the plan of the Contact Group of July\n1994; fourthly, that there be no further easing of the\nsanctions towards Serbia and Montenegro until they\nrecognize Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia within\ninternationally recognized borders; fifthly, that a resolution\nbe adopted, without delay, to strengthen the protection and\nmandate the extension of the safe areas provided for in\nSecurity Council resolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993),\nand in accordance with provisions of Article 6 of the\nContact Group plan; and, sixthly, that decisions be taken to\nensure an immediate end to the strangulation of Sarajevo\nand to prevent a recurrence of such a situation.\nThe last-mentioned of these measures should envisage,\nas an integral element, the opening of the city along the\nnorth communication route - road and highway - through\nthe creation of a demilitarized belt 2.5 kilometres wide on\nboth sides of the thoroughfares. In this demilitarized belt,\nonly United Nations troops and police might remain. The\npotential use of force against the strangulation of Sarajevo\nis envisaged under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization\u2019s decision of 9 February 1994.\nProvided that the above conditions were fulfilled, and\non condition that UNPROFOR continued to carry out its\nmission, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina would be willing to accept a new, modified\nformula to deal with the problem of the arms embargo.\nUnder this formula we would limit our demand for the\nlifting of the arms embargo to the adoption of a formal\ndecision, and the application or consequences of that\ndecision would be deferred for six months. In this case\nUNPROFOR troops could remain in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, the Contact Group would fulfil its promise,\nand a clear message would be conveyed to Karadzic\u2019s\nSerbs.\nI should like, in conclusion, to state our two\ncommitments.\nFirst, our irrevocable objective is a democratic\nBosnia and Herzegovina within internationally recognized\nborders, and with full ethnic, religious and political rights\nfor all its citizens. In such a Bosnia and Herzegovina the\nSerbs will have all rights, up to the highest level of\nautonomy, but they cannot have a state within a state.\nSecondly, we consider that, like all other nations, we\nhave an inalienable right to self-defence. Therefore, if\nour compromise proposal on the arms embargo is rejected\nfor any reason, we shall ask our friends to secure the\nimmediate, and even unilateral, lifting of the embargo.\nUnfortunately, I have to inform representatives that, just\ntoday, I learned that this compromise proposal is meeting\nresistance, and even rejection, from some Contact Group\ncountries.\nFinally, I take this opportunity to express our sincere\ngratitude to all friends of Bosnia and Herzegovina who\nhave supported its struggle for survival and freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a special pleasure for me\nto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign\nMinister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on his unanimous election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. We are confident that under his able leadership the\ndeliberations of this session will come to a fruitful\nconclusion. My delegation extends its full support to him\nin carrying out his important duties.\nI should also like to express my delegation\u2019s\nappreciation to His Excellency Ambassador Samuel R.\nInsanally, the Permanent Representative of the Republic\nof Guyana to the United Nations, for successfully\npresiding over the General Assembly during its forty-\neighth session. I also take this opportunity to express my\nadmiration to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for the dedication, commitment and insight\nwith which he has been serving the United Nations.\nSince the end of the cold war the world community\nhas faced many developments, both encouraging and\ndisturbing. As a Vice-Chairman of the Special\nCommittee against Apartheid \u2014 now dissolved \u2014 Nepal\nfeels particularly happy about the end of the apartheid\nregime in South Africa. As President Mandela said in his\nspeech earlier in this session, it was one of the ironies of\nour age that it was only so late in the twentieth century\nthat such a regime came to an end. The United Nations\nrole in the establishment of a united democratic and\nnon-racist South Africa has been gratifying to all of us.\nThe end of apartheid represents progress on the part of\nmankind in its history of civilization. The statesmanship\nof President Mandela can be a source of inspiration for\nthose who are in search of freedom, peace and justice\nelsewhere in the world.\nNepal also welcomes the progress in the Middle\nEast peace process and looks forward to the establishment\nof comprehensive peace in the region. We hope that such\nachievements will inspire peoples in conflict with each\nother elsewhere to end their hostilities, and to start similar\npeace processes.\nThere are also disturbing areas of conflict. The\nNepalese people are grieved at the enormous loss of life\nand the extensive material devastation in Rwanda. It is\nour hope that with the active support of the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) in conflict resolution, the United\nNations peace-keeping efforts will facilitate the process of\nrestoring normalcy and a peaceful civil society in\nRwanda.\nNepal also appreciates the role played by the OAU\nin Burundi in terms of conflict prevention, management\nand resolution. We hope that the OAU mechanism will\nbe applied effectively to other troubled parts of the region\nsuch as Somalia, Angola and Liberia, in order to restore\nnormalcy.\nNepal is also deeply distressed by the tragedy which,\ndespite the Security Council\u2019s resolutions, continues\n21\n\n\nunabated in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We would like to\nurge all the parties concerned to seek peace through\ndialogue and negotiation rather than through violence.\nNepal also looks forward to an early restoration of the\ndemocratically elected Government in Haiti, which alone\ncan ensure full respect for human rights in that country.\nWe are meeting on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations, which will be a time for us to reflect\non the past five decades and plan for the next 50 years.\nBorn as a result of the Second World War, the United\nNations has over the past five decades ceaselessly deployed\nefforts to prevent a third world war. Disarmament,\nespecially nuclear disarmament, has therefore been one of\nits major concerns. The United Nations also made constant\nefforts to bring peace to the Middle East and to put an end\nto apartheid in South Africa, and it remained engaged in\nmany other areas of conflict. However, the last five\ndecades, characterized by the cold war, almost paralysed\nthe United Nations.\nThe East-West divide seriously hampered the United\nNations efforts in most conflict situations. A number of\nimportant agreements were reached and many peace\nnegotiations were held outside the United Nations.\nNevertheless, those achievements were in conformity with\nthe spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, and the\nUnited Nations provided an important global forum for\ndiscussion, which helped defuse major global catastrophes.\nThus, in the ultimate analysis, the United Nations has\nundoubtedly made significant contributions to international\nrelations. Moreover, the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies and other related bodies, such as the United\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund, the World Health Organization, the United\nNations Population Fund, the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations and many others, have\nbeen engaged in improving social and economic conditions\naround the world.\nSince the cold war, whose enormous cost adversely\naffected the lives of billions of people, is now over, we at\nthe United Nations, standing \u2014 as it were \u2014 at the\ncrossroads of history, can now define the Organization\u2019s\nrole and work for the next 50 years.\nWith such rapid changes taking place in international\nrelations, particularly in recent years, the United Nations\nneeds to be restructured and revitalized. The restructuring\nof the Security Council has assumed a particular urgency.\nNepal strongly supports an increase in the membership of\nthe Council to reflect, not only the increase in the general\nmembership of the United Nations, but also the reality of\nthe present world. A review of the Council\u2019s membership\nhas also to take into account the contributions of Member\nStates to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. We attach a high priority to greater\ntransparency and openness in the Council\u2019s work, and\nalso attach great importance to the principle of equitable\nrepresentation, which would give all United Nations\nMembers \u2014 large or small, rich or poor, powerful or\nweak \u2014 a reasonable opportunity to contribute to the\nwork of the Council.\nWe hope that the work of the Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Security Council and related issues will be\nfruitful in due time. Our delegation considers that the\nreform and expansion of the Security Council should also\ninclude measures geared to reforming its working\nmethods and procedures. In addition, there is a need to\nenhance the relationship between the Security Council and\nthe General Assembly, in accordance with the relevant\nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe changed context of international relations and\nthe United Nations preoccupation with peace-keeping\noperations should not be allowed to deflect attention from\nefforts to achieve general and complete disarmament\nunder effective international control. Rather, the\npropitious climate now prevailing calls for strengthening\nthe role of the United Nations in arms control and\ndisarmament. In this context, I wish to recall the\nunanimous political support expressed by the General\nAssembly at its last session for the decision of the\nConference on Disarmament to give to its Ad Hoc\nCommittee on a Nuclear Test Ban a mandate to negotiate\nsuch a ban. To this end, the Non-Aligned Movement, of\nwhich Nepal is a founding member, has called for a\nspecial session of the United Nations General Assembly\non disarmament in order to undertake a comprehensive\nassessment of progress towards global disarmament.\nLike the rest of the international community, Nepal\nlooks forward to the early conclusion of a comprehensive\ntreaty prohibiting nuclear tests in all atmospheres. A non-\ndiscriminatory and effectively verifiable test-ban treaty\nwould have a positive impact on the success of the\nConference on the review and extension of the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is due\nto be held in 1995.\nIn addition to pursuing confidence-building\nmeasures, the United Nations role in arms control and\ndisarmament needs to be effectively strengthened. In this\n22\n\n\ncontext, the United Nations Regional Centres for Peace and\nDisarmament can play an important role, as they provide\nmuch-needed forums for the exchange of views. The United\nNations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in\nAsia and the Pacific has already held several meetings to\npromote such a process of dialogue and interaction.\nNepal is firm in its conviction that peace-keeping\noperations, though extremely important, especially in this\npost-cold-war period, are no substitute for the peaceful\nresolution of conflicts through political dialogue and\nmediation. Application of Chapter VII of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations in the restoration and maintenance of\ninternational peace and security should be invoked by the\nSecurity Council only as a last resort, fully respecting the\nprinciples of impartiality and non-selectivity. Nepal has\nsupported fully the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative in\nexpanding preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution.\nWe have consistently committed our troops to the peace-\nkeeping operations undertaken by the United Nations\nthrough the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and\nthe United Nations Protection Force.\nBesides serving in Cambodia during the critical stage\nof democratic elections there, Nepal has also sent civilian\npolice monitors for electoral assistance in Mozambique.\nNepal has also sent troops to Somalia, despite the heavy\nloss of life and casualties suffered by our young men. We\nwould like to pay tribute to those Nepalese soldiers and to\nthe others who gave their lives in the relentless pursuit of\ninternational peace and security. Prime Minister\nGiri ja Prasad Koirala, in a recent statement to the\nroundtable on United Nations peace-keeping operations in\nKathmandu, stated:\n\u201cWhile the Government (of Nepal) has raised its\nvoice at the United Nations and in appropriate\ninternational forums for more effective mechanisms\nfor the safety and protection of our personnel, the\nGovernment reaffirms its commitment to continue to\nparticipate in such operations with a sense of\nresponsibility and solemn obligation.\u201d\nSince peace-keeping operations have become more\ncomplicated and more expensive in recent years, there is\ngreater urgency to make those operations cost-effective and\nefficient. Peace-keeping contributions must be paid in full\nand on time so that the troop \u2014 contributing countries may\nbe in a better position to maintain the most critical element\nin peace-keeping operations \u2014 the troops. My Government\nholds the firm view that the death and disability\ncompensation to all troops should he based on equity. We\nhope to review the current guidelines on this matter in\norder to arrive at a standard compensation package\napplicable to all.\nEvery peace-keeping operation should be devised\nwith a clear mandate, a realistic time frame and a correct\nassessment of the situation. Furthermore, we would like\nto reiterate that timely consultations with troop-\ncontributing countries are essential elements for the\nenhancement of the peace-keeping capability of the\nUnited Nations. Nepal welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s\ninitiative on stand-by arrangements for peace-keeping.\nWe are studying the proposal seriously, especially in view\nof current events that highlight the need for the\nestablishment of such an arrangement.\nSince the threat to security lies, inter alia, in\nnon-military sources such as the lack of economic and\nsocial development, Nepal stresses the need for timely\nimplementation of Agenda 21 for ensuring the\nsustainability of the planet for present and future\ngenerations. The Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment has made a good start. It must not be\nallowed to falter or to be turned into a discussion forum\nonly. The Commission should build a bridge between the\nNorth and the South to enable the developing countries to\nfollow the path of sustainable development. By providing\nadditional financial resources and transferring\nenvironmentally sound technology to developing\ncountries, the international community can surely reach\nthe goals set in Agenda 21. In our view, the level of\nconsumption and wastage in most industrialized countries\nalso needs to be moderated if we are to achieve the goals\nof sustainable development.\nThe success of population and socio-economic\ndevelopment programmes hinges on the full\nempowerment of women. The focus given to the\nempowerment of women in decision-making, especially\nin planning the size of a family, at the recent International\nConference on Population and Development is a mater of\nsatisfaction to my delegation. However, the success of\nthe Plan of Action as adopted requires increased financial\nresources. The developing countries, despite their severe\nresource constraints, have been committing significant\namounts in population activities at the cost of other\nimportant areas that are required for economic growth and\ndevelopment.\nThat important conference will be followed by the\nWorld Summit for Social Development, the fourth World\nConference on Women and the 1996 United Nations\n23\n\n\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II). This year\nalone, we have participated in many important conferences:\non natural disaster reduction, on the sustainable\ndevelopment of small island States, on combating\ndesertification and drought, and on population and\ndevelopment. A question remains outstanding: that of the\navailability of the critical resources for the successful\nimplementation of the recommendations of these\nconferences. The developing countries find themselves in\nan exasperating situation, trying to cope with their\nresponsibilities, as outlined in previous agreements and\nresolutions, without the necessary actions from the\nindustrialized countries.\nNepal fully shares the Secretary-General\u2019s view that\nan alternative to the United Nations in the field of\ndevelopment simply does not exist, especially in the light\nof the new vision of development as inextricably linked\nwith peace and security. We reiterate our view that there\nmust be close cooperation and coordination between the\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. The\nmain objectives of the proposed agenda for development\nshould he directed towards ensuring successful\nimplementation of existing programmes for the alleviation\nof poverty. The agenda should be an instrument that looks\nafter the most vulnerable and the weakest nations of the\nworld.\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the signing\nof the agreements at Marrakesh undoubtedly constitute a\nhistoric breakthrough in the international trade regime. The\nwindow of opportunity is now open for many developing\ncountries to enhance their trade and development. Once\nagain, the least developed countries will be left out, in spite\nof this tremendous opportunity now available to many. The\nlack of basic physical infrastructure and the absence of a\nmanufacturing base will prevent the least developed\ncountries from taking advantage of this new opportunity.\nThe least developed countries, including my own country,\nhave suffered for decades. These handicaps, however, have\nnot deterred us from our determination to cooperate fully\nwith the international community by instituting structural\nadjustment programmes and economic liberalization\npolicies, including privatization.\nStructural adjustment programmes lacking due\nconsideration for social safety nets have pushed a large\nsector of the world\u2019s population towards more misery and\ndiscontent. Economic liberalization programmes without\nadequate institutional and organizational set-ups have not\nyielded the desired results in many countries. The major\npurpose of the privatization programmes undertaken by\nmany developing countries \u2014 the efficient and productive\nuse of resources \u2014 has yet to be fulfilled. At the same\ntime, it may be appreciated that these inadequate\nmeasures, resulting in higher inflation, a distorted market\nsystem and increasing unemployment, may result in\ngreater social tension.\nWe are happy to note that in the context of the\nfollow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action,\nan open-ended Working Group of the Third Committee\nhas been established; we hope it will review the mandates\nof existing human rights machinery, taking into account\nthe balanced emphasis between civil, political, cultural,\neconomic and social rights, as well as improving human\nrights on the basis of the principles of impartiality,\nobjectivity and non-selectivity.\nViolation or suppression of human rights within a\nnation\u2019s boundary have consequences outside its\nboundaries as well. People unable to live in conditions\nwhere human rights are suppressed are forced to flee their\nown homelands and take refuge elsewhere. United\nNations agencies such as the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food\nProgramme, and international and non-governmental\nhumanitarian organizations, are well aware of this. My\ndelegation would like to commend the work of these\nUnited Nations agencies. We also feel that the agencies\nmust be mandated to serve all the people in such difficult\nsituations.\nThe Constitution of Nepal enshrines the principle of\nuniversal human rights. We believe that the right to\ndevelopment is an integral part of human rights. Nepal\nis now party to 14 international human rights instruments,\nincluding all the major Conventions and Covenants. A\nnational action plan on human rights is being prepared in\nline with the final document of the Vienna Conference on\nHuman Rights.\nNepal is also consolidating the multi-party\ndemocratic system that was restored by the people\nthrough a popular movement in 1990. Nepal participated\nactively in the Second International Conference of New\nor Restored Democracies, at Managua, Nicaragua, in July\nthis year. The Conference provided us with an\nopportunity to share each other\u2019s experience of nascent\ndemocracy. In November this year the people of Nepal\nare participating in our second general elections on the\nbasis of adult franchise. We are confident that this\nexercise in democracy will give an impetus to the long-\nterm economic development of our country.\n24\n\n\nThe Charter of the United Nations captures the highest\nideals of mankind. However, much remains to be done to\nput those ideals into practice. We look forward to\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations as the\noccasion to work for instituting dynamism and efficiency\nin the United Nations. My delegation is fully confident\nthat our vision of the United Nations as a symbol of\npeace, security, human rights and development will be\nrealized if Member States demonstrate the political will\nand provide the necessary financial and material support\nto the Organization.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish to join\nothers who have spoken before me in congratulating you on\nyour election to guide the deliberations of the forty-ninth\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. As you\nundertake this solemn and challenging responsibility we\nassure you of the Liberian delegation\u2019s fullest cooperation\nand support.\nLet me also convey our gratitude to your erudite\npredecessor, Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for\nthe skilful manner in which he guided the deliberations of\nthe last session.\nOur able and distinguished Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, deserves special\ncommendation for his unwavering commitment to the\nprinciples of the United Nations and his untiring efforts\nin the promotion of world peace, international security\nand human dignity. We are particularly pleased at his\nkeen interest and involvement in the search for durable\npeace in Liberia.\nAs we approach the midpoint of the last decade in\nthis millennium we are encouraged that our world\ncontinues to make steady progress in the transition from\nyears of ideological confrontation to convergence on\nglobal interdependence.\nA manifestation of this changing situation is the\ngrowing utilization of a consensual approach to\naddressing such burning issues on the international agenda\nas human rights, population and the environment. In this\nregard we welcome the outcome of the International\nConference on Population and Development held at Cairo\nand look forward to the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, to be convened in Copenhagen, Denmark,\nin 1995, which will consider the core issues of alleviating\nand reducing poverty, expanding productive employment\nand enhancing social integration.\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nThe peaceful transition from apartheid to majority rule\nin South Africa has been of monumental significance to\nAfrica. We heartily welcome the new Republic of South\nAfrica into the fold of the world body and look forward to\nthe positive contributions it can and will surely make to the\nachievement of the noble goals of the United Nations.\nThese positive developments in the international\nsystem are, however, often overshadowed by flashpoints of\nethnic conflicts around the world. The situations in Bosnia,\nRwanda and Somalia, and in my own country, Liberia,\namong others, appear to be intractable. The brutality and\ndestruction unleashed by these conflicts often tend to\noverwhelm the international community and make peace-\nkeeping a major preoccupation of the United Nations and,\nto an increasing degree, of regional organizations as well.\nEconomic and human resources that could otherwise be\napplied to improving the human condition are being\nexpended on peace-keeping activities.\nSome of these intra-State conflicts are so complex that\npolicy makers are forced to debate the pros and cons of\npeace-keeping or peacemaking when the main issue should\nbe that of saving lives, especially in those situations where\na legitimate governing authority is absent.\nThe result is that the international community\nsometimes reacts with what may amount to short-cut\nsolutions. Often attempts at resolving some of these\nconflicts unwittingly overlook the intransigence and\nrecalcitrance of warlords who were the ones primarily\nresponsible for bringing untold suffering and deprivation to\ntheir own people. These conflicts also create lucrative\nopportunities for arms dealers and international supporters\nof warlords.\nA disturbing phenomenon associated with these\nconflicts is that of the child soldier. Children are recruited,\nindoctrinated and trained in the art of murder, mayhem and\ngenocide, thus depriving a country of an entire generation\nof its human resources. This is particularly true for my\nown country, Liberia, where the great majority of the\n60,000 combatants are children who have yet to complete\ntheir primary education. The forced conscription of our\nchildren \u2014 the building-blocks of our future \u2014 must be\nstopped, since it violates the Convention of the Rights of\nthe Child. Therefore we should not yield to any action that\nhas the effect of sanctioning the acquisition of power\nthrough the use of force or promoting solutions aimed at\nappeasing warlords at the expense of the larger unarmed\npopulation.\nThe world has witnessed the rise, during the last\nfour years, of a powerful movement for democracy and\ndemocratization. This movement has swept asunder some\nof the strongest totalitarian regimes in its wake, from\nEastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to Latin\nAmerica, Africa and Asia.\nThe international community must therefore\ndemonstrate its resolve to support this movement so that\nthe democratic aspirations of all peoples are realized\nthroughout the world. It would be an indictment of the\npresent world leadership for it to simply watch countries\nbecome involved in these conflicts, which may have been\nignited initially by the spark of democratization.\nIt is against this background that we wish to briefly\nreview the Liberian peace process.\nAt the outset, I should like to register the heartfelt\ngratitude of the Liberian people to the gallant men of\nECOMOG \u2014 the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) Military Observer Group \u2014 who\nfoiled the attempted coup on 15 September 1994. Since\n1990, their selfless sacrifice has provided a security\nblanket in parts of Liberia, thus enabling us to work\ntowards the attainment of peace in our country.\nIt will be recalled that in December 1989 the\nLiberian situation exploded into an armed conflict,\nostensibly to rid the country of military dictatorship. By\nmid-1990, however, the conflict had degenerated into a\nthree-way struggle for power. The State machinery had\ndisintegrated.\nNone of the armed factions engaged in the struggle\nappeared capable of winning a decisive victory and\nestablishing legitimate authority. In the wake of this\ndeadly stalemate, ECOWAS intervened with a two-\npronged peace plan: A peace-monitoring force would be\ndispatched to Liberia to provide security for the country,\nwhile the Liberians themselves would re-establish an\ninternal civil administration to prepare the country for\ndemocratic elections.\nThe ECOWAS peace-monitoring group, ECOMOG,\narrived in Liberia in August 1990. An All-Liberia\nConference was convened in Banjul, the Gambia, in the\nsame month, and elected the Interim Government of\nNational Unity (IGNU). Upon the insistence of the\nNational Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), a second, All-\nLiberia Conference was convened in Monrovia in 1991,\nwhich endorsed the Interim Government. Unfortunately,\n2\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nthe NPFL, which insisted on the Conference as a\nprecondition for peace, walked out during the deliberations.\nSeveral other meetings of the warring factions were\nheld in Banjul, Freetown, Dakar, Bamako, Lom\u00e9,\nYamoussoukro and Geneva, in search of peace with the\narmed factions. With remarkable success, the ECOWAS\npeace plan, with an interim civilian administration for\nLiberia and with ECOMOG, restored some degree of\nstability and provided a semblance of law and order in the\ncountry for a period of two years.\nOn 15 October 1992, the NPFL launched an\nunprovoked attack on ECOMOG and the people of\nMonrovia in what was termed \u201cOperation Octopus\u201d. The\nrefusal of the NPFL to fully comply with the\nYamoussoukro Accord gave rise to a new armed group, the\nUnited Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy\n(ULIMO), which claimed its sole purpose was to free the\nLiberian people from the NPFL.\nWith hostilities raging among the armed factions, the\nUnited Nations, in concert with ECOWAS and the OAU,\ndecided to convene a peace conference of the parties to the\nconflict in Geneva in June 1993. The meeting was attended\nby the NPFL, ULIMO and IGNU. The IGNU delegation\nincluded the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL).\nThe United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s Special\nRepresentative chaired the meeting, which was also\nattended by the OAU Eminent Person, the Executive\nSecretary of ECOWAS and the Field Commander of\nECOMOG.\nThe framework agreed upon in Geneva was formally\nconcluded and signed by the parties in Cotonou, Republic\nof Benin, on 25 July 1993. The overriding principle of the\nCotonou Agreement was to achieve disarmament and\ndemobilization of the warring factions, which agreed that\nthey would give up their arms in exchange for participating\nin the formation of a new government.\nThe Cotonou Agreement provided for the\nestablishment of the Liberian National Transitional\nGovernment, headed by a five-man Executive Council of\nState, a 35-member Transitional Legislative Assembly and\nthe reconstitution of the Supreme Court and the Ad Hoc\nElections Commission. Each of these organs was to be\ncomposed of nominees representing the parties to the\nAgreement. The Cabinet positions were apportioned in\nconsultation with the parties.\nThe Liberian National Transitional Government was\ngiven the mandate to extend its authority throughout the\ncountry, to repatriate and resettle refugees from abroad,\nand to conduct free and fair elections within six months.\nDisarmament was to be carried out concomitantly\nwith the seating of the Liberian National Transitional\nGovernment, and the armed factions agreed to cooperate\nwith the expanded ECOMOG to disarm under the\nsupervision of the United Nations Observer Mission in\nLiberia.\nThe Liberian National Transitional Government was\ninducted into office on 7 March 1994, and the Special\nRepresentative of the United Nations Secretary-General\ngave assurances that disarmament would commence\nsimultaneously. He also assured the Liberian people that\nthe armed factions would comply fully with the\nprovisions of the Cotonou Agreement. After the seating\nof the Liberian National Transitional Government the\nmilitary aspects of the peace process did not keep pace\nwith the political aspects as contemplated by the\nAgreement. Moreover, it took six months for the\nadditional troops from Tanzania and Uganda to arrive in\nLiberia. The expanded ECOMOG troops were never\ndeployed and the factions did not disarm. They continue\nto believe in the attainment of political power by force of\narms or, more precisely, through the barrel of the gun.\nConsequently, there has been a mushrooming of\narmed groups. There are now two factions of ULIMO\nand two factions of NPFL. There is also the Liberian\nPeace Council (LPC) and the Lofa Defence Force (LDF).\nEach of the breakaway factions of ULIMO and the NPFL,\ntogether with the LPC and LDF, have joined in a\ncoalition of forces to fight the branch of NPFL led by Mr.\nCharles Taylor. As I speak, the battle in central Liberia\nrages on. A consequence of this situation is the mass\nexodus of frightened citizens who have had to seek refuge\nand havens in neighbouring countries and a heightening\nof the humanitarian needs of the country.\nI come now to the Liberian National Conference.\nRealizing the current morass in the country and the\nuncooperative attitude of the warring factions towards the\nLiberian National Transitional Government, a citizens\u2019\nconsultative meeting was convened in Monrovia from 29\nto 30 July 1994. At that meeting the people of Liberia\ndetermined that for the last four years the destiny of the\ncountry had been largely dictated by the warring factions\nand that they, the citizens, were being marginalized.\nThey also concluded that the stalemate in the peace\n3\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nprocess was the result of the intransigence of the warring\nfactions with respect to disarmament and their failure to\ncooperate with the Liberian National Transitional\nGovernment, ECOMOG and UNOMIL in carrying out their\nrespective responsibilities and duties under the Cotonou\nAgreement.\nThe people of Liberia therefore decided that they\nmust, and would, become involved in breaking the\nstalemate in the peace process. They have therefore\nconvened since 24 August 1994 the Liberian National\nConference (LNC), with representatives coming from all\nwalks of life, including the 13 political subdivisions of the\ncountry, political parties, interest groups, professional\norganizations, social and religious organizations, trade and\nlabour unions, student and youth groups and women\u2019s\norganizations.\nThe Conference organizers endeavoured to involve and\nencourage the participation of the warring factions. The\nConference was addressed by the Special Representative of\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Trevor Gordon-\nSomers; the former United States President, Jimmy Carter;\nand the OAU Eminent Person, the Rev. Dr. Canaan\nBanana. General Arnold Quainoo, ECOMOG\u2019s first field\ncommander and Special Representative of the ECOWAS\nChairman, and the Executive Secretary of ECOWAS, Dr.\nEdouard Benjamin, also addressed the Conference and\nexpressed support for it.\nThe Conference agenda included disarmament and\ndemobilization, governance and elections. The consensus\nof the Conference was that the fundamental problem of the\nLiberian conflict is not governance, but, rather, the refusal\nof the armed groups to disarm and demobilize. The\nConference therefore called for strong and effective\nsanctions to be applied against armed groups and warring\nfactions which fail to cooperate in the disarmament process.\nWith respect to governance, the Conference indicated\nthat the mandate of the Liberian National Transitional\nGovernment should be extended and the Council of State\nstrengthened so as to take the country through to free and\nfair democratic elections. We also see the Liberian\nNational Conference as the embodiment of the democratic\naspirations of the Liberian people and their opposition to\nthe acquisition of power by force. Too much time, energy\nand resources and too many lives have been lost by\nLiberians and other West Africans to settle now for a less\nthan honourable, just and lasting solution.\nI turn next to the Akosombo Agreement. The\nLiberian National Conference had gained momentum and\nwas at the height of the debate on the fundamental\nproblems of disarmament, governance and elections, when\nHis Excellency, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana,\nChairman of ECOWAS, along with the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, undertook new\ninitiatives to resolve the impasse in the peace process. A\nmeeting of leaders of two warring factions, Mr. Charles\nTaylor of the NPFL and Lieutenant-General Alhaji S.G.\nKromah, of ULIMO, together with the Chief of Staff of\nthe Armed Forces of Liberia, Lieutenant-General\nJ. Hezekiah Bowen, was held at Akosombo, Ghana. The\nOAU Eminent Person, Dr. Canaan Banana, also attended\nthe meeting. Except for General Bowen, the Liberian\nNational Transitional Government delegation was\nexcluded from the deliberations at Akosombo.\nOn 12 September 1994, General Bowen, Chief of\nStaff of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), without\nauthority signed the Akosombo Accord, along with the\ntwo warring leaders: Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah.\nThe Agreement did not adequately address the issue of\ndisarmament but instead called for the restructuring of the\nCouncil of State of the Liberian National Transitional\nGovernment (LNTG). The two armed factions would\neach nominate a representative; General Bowen \u2014\nselected without consultation \u2014 would represent the AFL,\nthe constitutional army of Liberia; the ongoing Liberia\nNational Conference would nominate one civilian; and the\nNational Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and the United\nLiberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO)\nwould consult to nominate the fifth member of the\nCouncil. The restructured LNTG would have a life-span\nof 16 months, with general elections slated for October\n1995 and installation of the newly elected government in\nJanuary 1996. The LNTG delegation registered its\nreservations about the Agreement with the Ghanian\nGovernment before returning to Liberia.\nIn Liberia, the Akosombo Accord caused an outcry\nand widespread indignation. It was viewed as yet another\nattempt to appease the armed factional leaders whose\nuncompromising stance has been responsible for\nprolonging the conflict, causing the death of so many\nLiberians and bringing so much destruction and suffering\nupon the people.\nThe Government of Liberia has therefore rejected the\nAkosombo Accord for a number of reasons. First, the\nAccord endeavoured to reduce the armed forces of\nLiberia, the constitutional army, to a warring faction.\n4\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nSecondly, it failed to address adequately the political\nproblems \u2014 disarmament and demobilization of the\nwarring factions \u2014 that have been the single most\nimportant stumbling-block to the peace process. Thirdly,\nthe premises underpinning the Akosombo Accord were\nfundamentally flawed. It ascribed power and influence to\narmed leaders whose standing, credibility and control within\ntheir own respective factions are questionable. There was\nalso a failure to recognize the changing military positions\nof the factional leaders on the ground. For example, Mr.\nCharles Taylor of the NPFL has been unable to return to,\nor regain, his headquarters at Gbarnga since leaving the\nmeeting in Ghana, because his forces have been driven out\nby rival factions. A few days after General Hezekiah\nBowen returned from Ghana, there was an attempted coup\nand mutiny in his army ranks, and he had to seek refuge at\nthe headquarters of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) Military Observer Group\n(ECOMOG). General Alhaji Kromah\u2019s ULIMO remains\nsplit.\nWe are pleased to note that as an indication of his\nsincerity and commitment towards finding a just and lasting\nsolution to the Liberian crisis, the President of Ghana and\ncurrent Chairman of ECOWAS, His Excellency Jerry\nRawlings, was quick to respond to the concerns raised by\nthe Liberian people to the Akosombo Accord. Within days\nof its signing, he dispatched a delegation to Liberia to hold\nconsultations on the Agreement. He has since convened a\nbroader-based consultative meeting in Accra. Consultations\non the Agreement continue in this regard.\nThe Liberian peace process is now at a critical stage.\nThe reaction to the Akosombo Accord and the renewed\noutbreak of hostilities in central Liberia among the armed\nfactions may lead some to conclude that Liberians are\nsimply not ready for peace, but this is not so. We are\nready for peace. We believe peace could finally be within\neasy reach, given the right mix of initiatives. Recent events\nin the country, including the failed coup attempt by\ndissident elements of the Armed Forces of Liberia and\nrenewed hostilities among the warring factions, reinforce\nthe need for effective action towards disarmament and\ndemobilization.\nI would be amiss if I did not say how grateful the\npeople of Liberia are to the United Nations, ECOWAS, the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), non-governmental\norganizations, relief agencies and the entire international\ncommunity, who have made untold sacrifices and\ncontributed towards the search for peace in Liberia. In this\nlight, we wish to appeal to the world community to give\ngreater support to the work of ECOMOG by providing\nadditional logistics and resources to enable it effectively\nto execute its mandate under the Cotonou Agreement.\nHaiti provides a hopeful example of what can be\naccomplished when the international community stays the\ncourse in helping to find a peaceful solution to intra-State\nconflicts. Indeed, while the same set of variables that\ninfluenced tougher United Nations action in Haiti may not\nobtain in Liberia, the people of Liberia are crying out to\nthe world, especially to those countries that are better\nendowed and constantly hail the benefits of democracy,\nto take the high moral ground and lend their potent voices\nand wherewithal to ending the human misery and\nsuffering in Liberia.\nI am therefore confident that the United Nations,\nwhich has striven to implement the provisions of its\nCharter for about half a century, can still muster the\ncourage and will to respond to the requisites of peace,\ndemocracy and development for the truly global era that\nis dawning as we approach the twenty-first century.\n"

        "file_text": "Over and above the usual civilities, Sir, the very sincere\nand warm congratulations of the Cameroon delegation on\nyour election to preside over the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly are addressed to you both as an able\ndiplomat and as a worthy representative of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\na country that is a friend of ours and with which we are\nhonoured to have longstanding relations of fraternal\ncooperation. On behalf of the delegation of Cameroon, I\nwish you every success in the exercise of your important\nfunctions.\nAmbassador Insanally of Guyana, your predecessor,\nsuccessfully reflected and expressed our concerns when\npresiding over the forty-eighth session. We should like to\nexpress our deep appreciation to him.\nSince his election our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, has placed all his courage, energy and\ndetermination at the service of our Organization to promote\npeace, justice and progress in an increasingly difficult\nclimate. Cameroon would once again like to assure him of\nits firm and constant support.\nDespite the uncertainties, upheavals and crises we are\nexperiencing in the evolving international environment,\nseveral major events since the last session give grounds for\nsatisfaction and hope.\nThe emergence of a united, democratic and non-racial\nSouth Africa, under the leadership of President Nelson\nMandela, has sounded the death knell of the apartheid era,\nnow a thing of the past, while marking the advent of a new\nera on our continent. South Africa can now get down to its\neconomic and social development with increased vigour.\nCameroon, which was at the forefront of the struggle\nagainst the scourge of apartheid, once again solemnly\nwelcomes South Africa\u2019s return into the concert of nations.\nThe credit for this happy return goes to the United\nNations, the Organization of African Unity and the forces\nof progress in the world for their combined efforts, but\nmainly to the South African people and leaders\nthemselves, in particular Nelson Mandela and Frederik de\nKlerk, who have always distinguished themselves by the\nbreadth of their vision, their courage and their\ndetermination.\nEchoing the new era beginning in Pretoria, an\nimportant stage has just been reached in the long process\nleading to the normalization of relations between Israel\nand the Palestinians on the one hand, and between Israel\nand its other Arab neighbours on the other hand.\nThe advent of Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza\nStrip and Jericho, pursuant to the agreements concluded,\nand the significant progress in the negotiations between\nthe Jewish State and Jordan are significant advances\ntowards a just and lasting settlement of the question of\nthe Middle East, in accordance with the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General\nAssembly. We must encourage this promising, but still\nfragile, development and give it all the necessary attention\nand determination.\nThe judicial settlement of the conflict between Chad\nand Libya over the Aouzu Strip, which has finally come\ninto being following lengthy negotiations, deserves to be\nwelcomed with satisfaction, particularly since it\nconstitutes a model for others to follow.\nBy bringing the question of the border and territorial\ndispute between Nigeria and Cameroon over Bakassi to\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and its\nmachinery for the prevention, management and settlement\nof conflicts, to the Security Council, which is responsible\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\nand to the International Court of Justice, which is charged\nwith the peaceful and judicial settlement of conflicts, it\nwas the intention of Cameroon to subscribe fully to the\nvirtues of preventive diplomacy.\nIt is an established fact that, like non-aggression\npacts and mutual assistance pacts, preventive diplomacy\nis an interesting innovation and one that may well prevent\nnew conflicts and suffering, and even reverse the\ntendency towards confrontation and war which is so\ncharacteristic of our continent.\nFor this reason, preventive diplomacy should be\nencouraged and supported by the international community.\n13\n\n\nFor its part, my country would like to thank all those who\nhave supported it in regard to the Bakassi affair. The\nmeans of action and the machinery of diplomacy at the\ndisposal of the OAU and the United Nations should be\nfurther strengthened.\nThe positive developments in South Africa and the\nMiddle East coincide, unfortunately, with the persistence or\nthe eruption of hotbeds of tension throughout the world. In\nBosnia and Herzegovina, in Cyprus, in Afghanistan, as well\nas in Cambodia, peace is still threatened. It is threatened\neven further on our continent, a fact to which the tragedy\nof Rwanda bears witness.\nThis is an opportunity to renew an urgent appeal to\nour brothers in Liberia, Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Angola\nand Mozambique, as well as in other countries beset by\ntension, conflict and warfare, to rise above their various\ndifferences so that they may be able to make the necessary\nefforts to meet the challenge of peace.\nThe persistence of these conflicts and hotbeds of\ntension, so harmful in their consequences, compels us to\ninitiate and resolutely and vigorously pursue any action\nconducive to peace, security and the building of confidence,\nwhich are so necessary in the struggle against poverty and\ndestitution.\nWithin States we should, for instance, promote\ntolerance, respect for the rights of others, participation by\nall in the affairs of the country, and fair distribution of the\nfruits of growth.\nIn relations between States, the independence,\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States must be\nrespected, while at the same time this should not be an\nobstacle to mutual cooperation in the event of natural\ndisasters and calamities that require humanitarian\nintervention.\nThe creation by the African Heads of State of the\nOAU machinery to which I have referred, and the initialling\nby the States of central Africa of a non-aggression pact in\nSeptember 1994, are among the efforts we have been\nmaking to promote good-neighbourly relations based on\nconfidence and free from any threat of the use of force.\nAlthough at the outset this machinery has already\nachieved some excellent results, nevertheless, like the\nStanding Consultative Committee on Questions of Security\nin Central Africa that was created by the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations in the context of preventive\ndiplomacy, it needs the support of the international\ncommunity.\nIn the final analysis, these regional initiatives to\npromote confidence-building measures and progressive\ndisarmament should, on the global level, be encouraged\nin order to achieve the objectives of the international\ncommunity with respect to disarmament, peace and\nsecurity.\nThus, we welcome the respect being shown for the\nmoratorium on nuclear testing, as well as the progress\nachieved in negotiations between the United States and\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea over the\nNorth Korean nuclear programme. We encourage both\ncountries to find a peaceful solution to that dispute.\nRegarding the current negotiations at the Conference\non Disarmament to conclude a comprehensive nuclear-\ntest-ban treaty, Cameroon joins the Movement of Non-\nAligned Countries in expressing the hope that this\nconvention will be signed before the Amendment\nConference in 1995.\nFinally, whether we speak of nuclear weapons or\nother weapons of mass destruction, conventional weapons,\ntoxic waste, mine clearance or anti-personnel mines,\nCameroon also wishes to see the international community\nworking towards general and complete disarmament.\nIn his report entitled \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d\n(A/48/935), the Secretary-General noted very aptly that\npeace was the foundation of development; that the\neconomy was the engine of progress; that the environment\nwas the basis of sustainability; that justice was the pillar\nof society, and that democracy represented good\ngovernance.\nThese preliminary reflections deserve great attention,\nsince the \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d is a follow-up to the\n\u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d (A/47/277). It reaffirms,\nfurthermore, that economic, social and cultural\ndevelopment is a fundamental right of the human being.\nFurthermore, global talks on development, which\nwere held in New York in June 1994 on the initiative and\nunder the presidency of Ambassador Insanally, the high-\nlevel debate and the recent session of the Economic and\nSocial Council on the \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d, the\nMinisterial Declaration that followed the commemorative\nceremonies for the thirtieth anniversary of the Group of\n77 and the substantive session of Economic and Social\n14\n\n\nCouncil indicate that development is a complex\nphenomenon, requiring constant effort on the part of States\nand of the international community as a whole.\nIt is therefore our hope, that on the basis of the\npriorities identified during these meetings, the measures\nrequired to deal with these issues will be considered by the\nGeneral Assembly on the basis of a new report by the\nSecretary-General.\nThe urgent need to set in motion a new United\nNations programme for the development of Africa in the\n1990s should be stressed. The timeliness and relevance of\nsuch a step was reaffirmed by the international conference\non the development of Africa held in Tokyo. The African\neconomy, as we know, is essentially based on primary\ncommodities. Any strategy for the sustainable development\nof the continent must consequently take into account the\nneed for diversification. We would like to reiterate the\nappeal we made last year from this same rostrum for the\ncreation of a fund for diversification of commodities for\nAfrica.\nIn a different context \u2014 and this cannot be repeated\ntoo often \u2014 debt is a major obstacle to development. The\ndebt of developing countries has steadily increased, rising\nfrom $1.662 billion in 1992 to $1.770 billion in 1993. We\nwelcome the efforts made so far to relieve or reschedule\ndebt for developing countries. However, a great deal still\nremains to be done, as is emphasized in the 1994 edition of\nthe Human Development Report.\nDrought and desertification are another subject of\nmajor concern. We welcome the fact that negotiations were\nsuccessfully concluded last June in Paris to draw up an\ninternational convention on drought and desertification, a\nmatter of undoubted importance for the world ecosystem\nand, more specifically, for the implementation of Agenda\n21 in Africa.\nIf the conclusion of multilateral economic negotiations\nin the context of the Uruguay Round provides further\nprospects for a dynamic revitalization of international trade,\nit is important that steps be taken in parallel to reverse the\npronounced trend towards the marginalization and the\nimpoverishment of Africa, which could be promoted by the\nnew machinery established at Marrakesh.\nHuman rights are universal and indivisible, and we\nmust therefore attach equal importance to economic,\npolitical, cultural and social rights. Whether in terms of the\nrights of women, children, youth, the disabled, the aged or\nother vulnerable groups, the human being must remain the\ncentral focus of the international community\u2019s concerns.\nWe should welcome the Plan of Action adopted at the\nrecent International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, held at Cairo, for it takes account of that\nrequirement. The Plan of Action does not focus on\nmankind as an abstract entity, but on human beings rooted\nin their economic, social, cultural and religious diversities,\nall of which need to be kept in mind.\nThat is why the forthcoming Copenhagen World\nSummit on Social Development ought to result in specific\ncommitments to reduce poverty, to create productive jobs\nand to strengthen social integration, particularly among\nthe most vulnerable strata of society.\nThe same concerns are reflected in the importance\nwe attach to the Fourth World Conference on Women, to\nbe held at Beijing in 1995.\nIt is in the interest of us all to pursue collective,\nunified action to struggle against the harmful effects of\ndrugs, the spread of the AIDS pandemic, and natural\ncatastrophes, if necessary combining emergency\nhumanitarian assistance with measures for the\nrehabilitation and reconstruction of the stricken countries.\nIn another area, the entry into force next November\nof the Montego Bay convention \u2014 the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea \u2014 next November is\na particularly encouraging development setting the seal on\nthe universality of that important legal instrument. We\nhope that it will promote exploitation of the seas and\noceans for the benefit of all.\nAs we near the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, our wish is that the Organization will meet the\nchallenge of reform and renewal. Whether it be the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and its subsidiary\norgans, the enlargement and strengthening of the Security\nCouncil, the rationalization of activities and procedures or\nthe consolidation of the Organization\u2019s financial basis,\nMember States should strive to mould an institution\nworthy of the vision and the inspiration of its founding\nfathers.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great\nhonour for me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election\nto the distinguished and very important post of President\nof the General Assembly.\nI am confident that your knowledge, experience and\nconsummate personal skills, which you have demonstrated\nboth as Permanent Representative to the United Nations\nand as President of the Security Council, will allow the\nsuccessful resolution of the complex problems the\ninternational community is now facing on the eve of the\ncelebration of the United Nations half century.\nI would like also to express my appreciation to the\nPresident of the previous session of the General\nAssembly, Ambassador Insanally, whose wise guidance\nresulted in the adoption of an entire set of constructive\ndecisions to the benefit of all Member States of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe year that has elapsed since the previous session\nof the General Assembly has witnessed important\ninternational developments, in many of which the United\nNations was both a catalyst and a participant. They\nincluded the historic turn towards peace in the Middle\nEast and the elimination of the apartheid system in South\nAfrica. Positive developments are expected in Ulster and\nin other hot spots of the planet. The completion of the\nwithdrawal of Russian troops from Germany and the\nBaltic States has at last marked the end of the European\nhistory of the Second World War. In this context, the\nleaders of the Russian Federation should be given their\ndue for displaying political courage and foresight.\n17\n\n\nRadical changes have also taken place in the political,\nsocial and economic life of Ukraine, which recently\ncelebrated the third anniversary of its independence. The\nUkrainian people, of their own free will, in a truly\ndemocratic way, elected Leonid Kuchma as the new\nPresident, and has elected the Parliament of the country.\nNew leaders have come to executive power. Naturally, all\nof these developments are generating broad interest in, and\ncloser attention to, Ukraine.\nIn this connection, different - sometimes arbitrary -\npredictions have been made concerning the direction of our\ndomestic and foreign policies, and even regarding their\npossible reorientation. Many radical and even diametrically\nopposed views have been heard - for example, whether the\npolitical pendulum in Ukraine will swing to the East or\nWest, or whether Ukraine will remain an independent State\nand preserve its political sovereignty.\nIn taking the opportunity to speak from this rostrum,\nI should like to clarify these important issues.\nFirst, the State policy of Ukraine will be consistently\nbased on the authority established by the Ukrainian people\nwhen it confirmed, almost unanimously, its choice of\nindependent development during the national referendum\nheld in December 1991. This reality is decisive, and\nrumours that Ukraine will eventually lose its sovereignty\nare absolutely unfounded. We shall continue to follow the\npath of building an independent State, and a return to the\nsituation which prevailed in the former Soviet Union is\nimpossible.\nSecondly, what also seems to be an oversimplification\nis the question of where Ukraine will be, whether in the\nEast or the West, of where it will go. I think it is precisely\nhere in this Hall, which brings together representatives of\nall continents and regions of the world, that the artificial\ndivision into East, West, North and South is especially\nstrongly felt. Today the world is becoming more\nintegrated, and political indicators of geographical\naffiliation of countries are gradually disappearing. Ukraine,\nlike any other State, cannot simply \\\"go\\\" East or West. It\nis there, where it has been for ages, and where it will stay\nfor ever. Its main task as a historically ancient but\npolitically young State consists in gradual integration into\nthe European and world political, economic, humanitarian\nand other processes as a reliable link in a new global\nsystem of international relations.\nOf course, there will be corrections to our policy. The\nworld has changed considerably, even in comparison with\nthat period of time when Ukraine emerged on the political\nmap as an independent State. All of us, including\nUkraine, have to take into account new realities and\nrespond to them appropriately. This is particularly so\nwhen we deal with the question of the intensification of\nmutually beneficial and equitable cooperation with the\nRussian Federation and with the other countries of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS). But these\nrelations will by no means be developed at the expense of\nour contact with our other partners. Ukraine is equally\nconcerned with strengthening relations with the United\nStates; Germany; Canada; the countries of Central and\nEastern Europe; the States of Asia - above all, China and\nJapan; as well as other countries of the Asian-Pacific\nregion, Africa and Latin America. In other words, the\nrange of our foreign policy interests is very broad. I\nwould like to emphasize that at the international level\nUkraine will protect its national interests, including its\neconomic interests, with increasing dynamism and\npragmatism.\nThese are the corrections that will be made to\nUkraine\u2019s foreign policy, which, despite domestic political\nchanges, remains, as President Leonid Kuchma has stated,\npredictable, consistent and weighted. There can be no\ndoubt whatsoever in this respect: Ukraine has been\ncommitted, and will continue to be committed, to\nfulfilling its international obligations, consistently and in\ngood faith. This is a solid foundation of our foreign\npolicy.\nThe wave of political romanticism yielded to a time\nof severe trials in the political, social and economic lives\nof the newly independent States that emerged from the\nformer Soviet Union. Linking the titles of two well-\nknown novels, the overall tenor of the mood of society in\nthe post-communist world might be described as \\\"great\nexpectations gone with the wind\\\".\nTo speak frankly, those feelings were not spared\nUkraine, which immediately declared its readiness to\ncooperate honestly and openly with all interested partners.\nHowever, our State, after having made persistent efforts,\nhas felt that only recently has the world community come\nto understand its position. At the same time, the reality\nof the current situation of Ukraine is that we are still the\nsubject of pressure and suspicion from outside and that\nwe continue at times to encounter open reluctance to\nunderstand the essence of the problems we are facing.\nThis greatly aggravates the present and still difficult\neconomic situation in the country and hinders the process\nof market reforms.\n18\n\n\nToday, Ukraine is facing the difficult tasks of\novercoming an economic crisis, of normalizing its social\nand economic situation and of creating favourable domestic\nand international conditions for gradually raising the living\nstandard of its population. The President and the new\nGovernment are focusing their efforts on those tasks, but I\nmust note that Ukraine\u2019s problem in surmounting its\neconomic crisis has an international dimension as well\nsince, because of its geopolitical situation, the establishment\nof Ukraine as a sovereign and economically developed State\nis an important factor for peace and stability on the\ncontinent of Europe. There is therefore every reason to\nassert that support for Ukraine - both political and,\nespecially, economic - is a reliable investment in the\nstrengthening of international security. These facts are\ngradually being accepted, and the discussion of the\nUkrainian question at the Naples Summit Meeting of the\nGroup of 7 was evidence of this trend.\nThe existence of a group of countries undergoing\ntransition to a market economy has become a real factor in\ncurrent international relations. Ukraine is a part of that\ngroup. Our experience is showing that the transition period\nwill not be smooth, that it will be fairly lengthy and that it\nwill necessitate considerable effort, including international\neffort. There is, however, no alternative. Those very\naspects of statecraft will be the focus of President\nKuchma\u2019s attention in the policy statement he will soon\ndeliver to the Parliament. I should also like to note that the\ndifficult economic situation in our country can to a\nconsiderable extent be explained by the vast financial\nburden of nuclear disarmament and the eradication of the\naftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. Those problems are\nnot solely Ukrainian; they have a global dimension as well.\nIn this connection, one positive development is the fact that\nthe problems of countries undergoing the transition to a\nmarket economy are gradually coming to occupy a rightful\nplace in the varied activities of the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies.\nHowever, it seems that donor States, while declaring\ntheir support for the implementation of reforms in countries\nundergoing transition, are still being excessively cautious in\nproviding adequate support to specific projects in Eastern\nEurope and in the countries of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS). Today, that attitude is beginning\nto pose a serious problem.\nWe are also looking forward to target-oriented\nactivities by the international community designed to create\nfavourable conditions for free access to the world market\nfor exports from countries in this region, particularly\nUkraine. In this connection, Ukraine welcomes the\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nand firmly intends to accede to the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade (GATT)/WTO system. We hope that\nthat system will promote trade liberalization and facilitate\nthe creation of an open and transparent system of trade.\nAfter all, the intensification of international trade is an\nintegral part of economic development.\nAs a European country, we are primarily concerned\nwith the problem of security in Europe in the broadest\nsense of that term. I should like to express some views\nconcerning Ukraine\u2019s vision of ways to safeguard peace\nand stability on that continent.\nThe difficulties of making forecasts in the field of\ninternational relations can be explained by the number of\nnew risks and challenges to security that have been\ncreated by political, economic, inter-ethnic and other\ncontradictions. These have already generated a wave of\nconflicts to which Europe was not prepared to make an\nadequate response.\nThe anxiety on the continent of Europe is clearly\ndemonstrated by the ongoing search for new machinery to\nensure State security in Eastern and Central Europe, of\nwhich Ukraine is also a part. The point is not that\nappropriate structures to strengthen security in Europe do\nnot exist. There are the activities of the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Western\nEuropean Union (WEU) and the North Atlantic\nCooperation Council (NACC), and the countries of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States are also seeking\nways to achieve collective security. However, for various\nreasons none of those structures is able adequately to fill\nthe military and political vacuum created in the region\nfollowing the disintegration of the USSR and the Warsaw\nTreaty.\nThat is why Ukraine strongly supports initiatives\naimed at all-European cooperation in various fields,\nincluding the field of security.\nI should like to recall that Ukraine was the first of\nthe CIS countries to become a signatory of the NATO\nPartnership for Peace programme and the Agreement on\nPartnership and Cooperation with the European\nCommunity. The Ukraine became a party to the\nConference on the Pact on Stability in Europe and has put\nforward initiatives for the strengthening of security and\n19\n\n\ncooperation in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Black\nSea region.\nHowever, it should be acknowledged that,\nnotwithstanding all their positive features, neither the\nPartnership for Peace programme nor any other measures\nundertaken can yet ensure reliable security safeguards for\nthe States concerned.\nIn the existing situation it seems reasonable to focus\nattention on a detailed examination of the question of\ncreating an all-European security structure that would\ninvolve all the existing structures in this field - the CSCE,\nthe NACC, NATO, the WEU - and, of course, the States of\nthe former USSR should have an appropriate place in that\nstructure. Ukraine advocates just such an approach,\nnamely, the strengthening of partnership and cooperation in\nan all-European dimension rather than a search for new\ngeometrical schemas which would, in fact, solidify the\ndivision of the European continent, small as it is on the\nglobal scale.\nWe feel that the strengthening of stability and security\nin the all-European sphere can and must be supplemented\nby regional actions that could be organically integrated into\nthe overall process of confidence-building and constructive\ncooperation.\nIn the search for such steps, Ukraine put forward the\ninitiative on confidence-building measures in the region of\nthe Black Sea. This region is extremely important to us as\na crossroads between Europe and Asia and between North\nand South. The elaboration and implementation of specific\nconfidence-building measures in the military and political\nfields in the Black Sea region would promote good-\nneighbourly relations and political and economic\ncooperation between the Black Sea countries.\nMultilateral consultations on these issues have already\nbegun. Ukraine proceeds on the basis that all Black Sea\ncountries may participate in confidence-building measures.\nWe believe that the measures themselves should be\nidentified in a politically binding document, which would\nregulate naval activities on the Black Sea, establish a\nprocedure for the exchange of appropriate information and\npromote the development of contacts between the naval\nforces of States parties.\nThe principle of collective action aimed at the\nmaintenance of peace under appropriate international\ncontrol must be one of the important conditions for the\noperation of an all-Europe security system. At the\npresent stage, national and international security is\nthreatened not so much by the possibility of military\naggression from outside as by local and regional conflicts\nprovoked by domestic circumstances - economic, ethnic,\nreligious and others - and especially by the possibility of\ntheir spilling over and involving neighbouring countries.\nThis requires timely preventive action.\nAssessing recent developments in the world, we have\nto recognize that, on the whole, preventive diplomacy is\ncoming to the foreground of United Nations activities\naimed at securing, restoring and strengthening peace and\nof activities of the CSCE. In this context, I should like to\nexpress gratitude to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the\nUnited Nations Secretary-General, for his significant\npersonal contribution to the development of the\nfoundations in this extremely important field of\ninternational activity.\nWe greatly appreciate United Nations peace-keeping\nefforts aimed at settling regional conflicts. We realize\nthat such activities require intensive political, physical and\nfinancial support from Member States. Unfortunately, the\ndifficult economic situation of our State - not to mention\nthe unjustified excessively high contribution to the regular\nbudget - prevents Ukraine from meeting in full its\nfinancial obligation to the United Nations. However, we\nare trying to compensate, at least partially, through our\ncontribution to the peace-keeping forces.\nUkraine has already become one of the major\ncontributors to United Nations forces, and it remains\nready to cooperate in this field. We believe that\nappropriate protection and security for the peace-keeping\npersonnel are essential conditions for such cooperation.\nLet us consider the sad statistics. In the course of all\nUnited Nations operations more than 1,000 peace-keepers\nhave been killed. In the territory of the former\nYugoslavia nine Ukrainian servicemen gave their lives,\nand more than 30 persons were wounded. The problem\nof security for United Nations personnel becomes more\nacute every year. When sending its troops to Yugoslavia,\nUkraine took the initiative of developing an international\nconvention on the protection of United Nations peace-\nkeepers and of submitting a draft of the document. We\nnow await with hope the completion, during the current\nsession, of work on this question.\nDevelopments in the former Yugoslavia and in\nSomalia compel us to think about the problems of the\n20\n\n\neffectiveness of United Nations peace-keeping operations.\nThe fact that the United Nations, even using the potential\nof such a powerful organization as NATO, failed to\nextinguish the flames of bloody conflict in these countries\nobviously calls for a more thorough examination and a\ncloser definition of principles of United Nations peace-\nkeeping operations. First and foremost, there are such\nquestions as a precise mandate, a link with the negotiating\nprocess, the neutrality of the United Nations contingent, the\nreasons for coercive action and the concept of multinational\nforces.\nToday, with the transition to a multipolar world, it has\nbecome evident that no country, however great its potential\nfor military power, can any longer pretend to be an\neffective guarantor of peace by relying exclusively on its\nown strength. This would be incompatible with the rules\nand principles of behaviour that are recognized throughout\nthe world. Unfortunately, the United Nations proved not to\nbe completely ready to assume this important role.\nOperations have become increasingly expensive and\nunwieldy. During the last four years alone United Nations\nexpenditure for these purposes has increased from $350\nmillion to $2.8 billion, thus aggravating the chronic\nfinancial problems. In the opinion of the world community,\npeace-keeping operations have lost their element of the\nextraordinary and have become routine, and not always\nsuccessful, emergency actions. But the main reason for the\ncrisis in United Nations peace-keeping efforts has proved to\nbe changes in the conditions and circumstances of conflicts.\nClassic peace-keeping operations started after the end\nof the \\\"hot\\\" phase. That is why they were, in fact, quite\neffective means of conflict prevention. Now, in many\ncases, the United Nations intervenes when hostilities are at\ntheir height. This changes the principles of the use of\npeace-keeping forces. It is not always the case that the\n\\\"blue helmets\\\" are regarded by all the conflicting parties as\nwelcome guests. That is why the United Nations forces\u2019\nmandate is considerably wider than used to be the case. In\nsome cases they have been given the right to use all\navailable weapons - and not only in self-defence.\nThe parties to conflicts are often unable to provide\nadequate conditions for United Nations forces to accomplish\ntheir peace-making mission. A distinctive attribute of\ncurrent conflicts is the phenomenon of field commanders.\nThese people obey no one and, thus, compromise United\nNations decisions or agreements reached within the\nframework of efforts aimed at achieving an armistice.\nIt is high time to renew the principles and\nmechanisms of peace-keeping operations on the basis of\nthe United Nations Charter. We feel that it is necessary\nto accelerate the creation of United Nations rapid-\ndeployment forces, which would recruit volunteers and\nwould be extraterritorial in character. Ukraine has\nalready declared its readiness to take part in this process.\nAn extremely important issue is the enhancement of\nthe role of international law within the system of\ninternational relations and the creation of a climate\nbetween States that would completely exclude diktat,\ninterference in internal affairs, the proclamation of\nso-called zones of special interests, and so on. The\nUnited Nations is also making a valuable contribution to\nstrengthening the international rule of law. In this\ncontext, Ukraine advocates further enhancement of the\nrules and principles of international law - first and\nforemost, such basic principles as respect for the\nsovereignty of States; territorial integrity and the\ninviolability of borders; and the protection of individual\nhuman rights, including the rights of national minorities.\nOur State is committed to cooperating with other\ncountries in this field.\nUkraine is also ready to make its contribution to the\nsolution of other urgent problems. It is necessary that we\nshould examine thoroughly and comprehensively the\nquestion of the implementation of economic sanctions\nagainst those who threaten peace and security. Previous\nUnited Nations experience in this field provides grounds\nfor justified criticism of the effectiveness of such\nsanctions. It is time to give serious thought to the\ncreation of machinery for the implementation of Article\n50 of the United Nations Charter. This would protect the\neconomic interests of third countries, which are suffering\ncolossal losses as a result of the strict implementation of\nsanctions.\nUkraine has already lost more than $4 billion as a\nresult of the implementation of sanctions against\nYugoslavia. Unfortunately, the international structures\ndid not extend appropriate assistance to enable our State\nto overcome the economic difficulties caused by the\nembargo. Obviously, collective action aimed at\nimplementing coercive measures cannot be taken on such\nan unfair basis, as this increases the danger of a loss of\nconfidence in the device of sanctions.\nGenerally, the necessity of substantively reforming\nthe United Nations, with a view to enhancing the\neffectiveness of the Organization while reducing at the\n21\n\n\nsame time the expenditures for its functioning, is a very\nserious problem. I am confident that this problem has\nceased to be merely an administrative and budgetary one\nand is moving to the foreground as one of the major\npolitical problems. Many countries, including Ukraine, are\ncurrently encountering great difficulties in convincing their\ncitizens that it is necessary to make excessively large\ncontributions to the budget of international organizations.\nThere are still many outstanding problems in the field\nof arms control and disarmament, which traditionally\noccupy an important place in the foreign policy of Ukraine.\nWe support efforts aimed at putting into force the chemical\nweapons Convention. We are taking an active part in the\nelaboration of effective mechanisms of international control\nregarding the implementation of the inhumane weapons\nConvention, the Convention on the prohibition of biological\nweapons, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in\nEurope, and other international instruments to which\nUkraine is a party. We attach great importance to the\npreparation of the comprehensive test-ban treaty, which is\nnow under way within the framework of the Conference on\nDisarmament. These activities prove that Ukraine is\npursuing a consistent policy in the field of the prohibition\nof weapons of mass destruction, and they demonstrate its\nopenness and readiness to cooperate, its commitment to\nrespect the obligations assumed. Ukraine stands for the\nequality of all States parties to international treaties and\nsupports the universality and non-discriminatory nature of\nthese treaties.\nIt is precisely from such a position that Ukraine\napproaches nuclear disarmament, which, at the present\nstage, is its most complicated problem. It should be\nemphasized that Ukraine is the first State in the world that\nhas voluntarily and unilaterally assumed the obligation of\neliminating nuclear weapons located in its territory - the\nthird nuclear potential in the world - and that intends to\nachieve the status of a non-nuclear Power.\nThe decision on non-nuclear status was approved by\nthe Parliament of Ukraine for the benefit both of the\nhighest interests of our State and of mankind as a whole.\nThis decision was based on the profound belief of our\npeople in the morality of the non-nuclear option and was\nnot the result of any external pressure.\nAt the same time, Ukraine, as a State that of its own\nfree will is giving up nuclear weapons - this most effective\nmeans of deterrence - obviously has the right to obtain\nreliable security guarantees from other nuclear States and\nadequate economic and technical assistance from the\ninternational community for the elimination of these\nweapons.\nUnfortunately, our partners did not immediately\ncomprehend these just demands, and we lost a lot of time.\nThe Ukraine Parliament\u2019s conditions for revoking its\nreservations at the time of the ratification of the START\nTreaty and the Lisbon Protocol, and for proceeding with\nthe practical withdrawal of nuclear warheads from\nUkraine with the view to their further elimination, were\ncreated only after the Trilateral Statement by the\nPresidents of Ukraine, the United States and the Russian\nFederation was signed and the relevant implementation\nagreements were concluded.\nVery soon the Parliament of Ukraine intends to\nconsider the accession of our State to the non-\nproliferation Treaty. Today, the settlement of this issue\ndepends mainly on the finalization of an acceptable text\nof the document concerning the provision of guarantees\nfor Ukraine\u2019s national security by the nuclear States.\nUkraine stands for corresponding guarantees to be\nmultilateral and to be addressed directly to Ukraine as\nthat State which for the first time in history, on its own,\nis getting rid of nuclear weapons; these guarantees should\nprovide a mechanism of consultations, which could\nbecome involved should the security of Ukraine be\nthreatened. In this process, we attach great importance to\nthe role of the United Nations as the most authoritative\ninternational organization.\nIn conclusion, I would like to express optimism\nconcerning the future development of the United Nations\nand international co-operation. Current international life\nis highly complicated and contradictory: there are\nalarming moments and there are frustrations, but there are\nalso truly historical shifts which have led to the end of\nthe cold war and to the transition to constructive\nco-operation. It is highly symbolic that this is happening\non the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization,\nwhich emerged from the ruins of the Second World War.\nOn behalf of Ukraine, which suffered very heavy losses\nin that war, I would like to support the proposal to\nproclaim 1995 the universal year of commemoration of\nthe victims of this, the bloodiest of wars.\nPresent-day realities are laying a sound foundation\nfor global cooperation, stability and peace. Let us\ntherefore make every effort not to lose this historic\nopportunity.\n"

        "file_text": "irst, I am very pleased to convey to the President my warmest congratulations on his election to preside over the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His wide experience and knowledge of international affairs, his well-known wisdom and patience are guarantees of success in the many difficult tasks of this session.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary- General of our Organization, for the praiseworthy efforts he has made in the service of world peace and development. Aware how heavy is his burden in this complex, fast-changing time, we wish him every possible success in the discharge of his lofty duties.\nThe present session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the world situation is still undergoing very complex changes. While the end of the bipolar era opened the door to dialog and cooperation between States, it did not usher in an era of peace, which the world so badly needs if it is to construct a sound world economy. In some regions of Europe, Africa and Asia, religious, ethnic, tribal and border conflicts, often of tragic proportions, are still raging, thus making the international situation unstable and fragile. It therefore seems clear that it will be difficult to achieve a new world order in which true peace prevails and in which peoples and nations, large and small, powerful and weak, rich and poor, benefit. The international community should give more thought to this\nmatter and join together to build a new era of peace and justice, to which the peoples of the world have so long aspired.\nIn Europe, the situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is still tense. The risk of new military clashes between the various parties remains. It is our view that the parties to this painful conflict should demonstrate wisdom and above all realism by concluding a just and equitable political settlement as soon as possible, and thus contribute to the restoration of peace in that country and in the entire region.\nIn Africa, after so many years of efforts, both within and outside the United Nations, the Republic of South Africa is free at last. In a spirit of national reconciliation, the parties concerned have managed to reach an understanding and to cooperate in the building of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa. We continue to believe that the people of South Africa, under the wise leadership of President Nelson Mandela, will prove equal to the task of overcoming the obstacles that face them and begin the economic development of their beloved land.\nStill in Africa, in Rwanda, we have seen unprecedented bloodshed. The Government and people of Laos strongly condemn the abominable carnage, which has been described as genocide of an innocent population, and we call upon the parties to the conflict to take the necessary steps to prevent such unacceptable crimes from ever happening again.\nThe world is following closely the disturbing humanitarian situation in the Caribbean. In our view, there should be a political solution to this complex situation, through sincere dialog between the parties directly concerned. The signing of the joint communique of 9 September 1994 by the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America to resolve the problem of the exodus of Cubans - the consequence of more than 30 years of externally imposed economic constraints - is clear proof of this. That agreement, the fruit of long and difficult negotiations between the two parties, constitutes an important first step in the settlement of their differences, which should contribute to strengthening peace, stability and cooperation in the region.\nIn Haiti, due to the animosities still keenly felt by the partisans of the military regime and President Aristide's sympathizers, the political situation continues to be fragile and complex. We believe that, in the best \ninterests of the Haitian nation, it is time for the parties to show great wisdom and begin the economic reconstruction of their beloved land.\nIn the Middle East, the autonomous interim Palestinian Authority, established in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region, pursuant to the Declaration of Principles on interim autonomy arrangements, signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, marked a new phase in the search for a just and lasting comprehensive settlement of the Arab- Israeli conflict. We welcome this new, crucial step, and hope that the parties to the conflict will do everything possible to achieve a comprehensive settlement, just and honorable for all, within the framework of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other relevant United Nations resolutions.\nIn Western Asia, despite countless efforts exerted towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict, Afghanistan remains the theater of a bloody civil war. In conformity with the recent statement of the President of the Security Council on 11 August 1994, we address an appeal to the parties concerned immediately to put an end to their hostilities, achieve national reconciliation and begin the difficult reconstruction of their ravaged homeland.\nIn the Korean peninsula, after months of uncertainty, dialog between the parties concerned has finally resumed. We warmly encourage that dialog and the Lao delegation welcomes the conclusion of the Agreement signed in Geneva on 12 August 1994 between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States of America. Because of its importance everything should be done to ensure that this sensitive region of the world becomes a nuclear-weapon-free zone. In the interests of peace, stability and cooperation in that region as well as in the world, it is essential that all the parties concerned show understanding and mutual trust in order to find a peaceful solution to the issues between them.\nIn South-East Asia a new era of cooperation in areas of common interest between countries of the region has grown ever stronger. The inauguration in April of the Lao- Thai friendship bridge across the Mekong, built with financial assistance and cooperation from the Government and the people of Australia, is an especially salient event for Laos, Thailand and Australia, as well as other countries of the region, in our efforts further to strengthen regional cooperation in different areas. In addition, the Heads of State or Government of our respective countries have regularly been exchanging visits with a view to expanding and deepening their friendship and cooperation in an\nextensive and fruitful field of cooperation. The participation of my country, once again, in the ministerial meeting of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in July in Bangkok, Thailand, once again demonstrates our sincere desire to cooperate in all possible areas with the countries of ASEAN, thus responding to the desires and deep aspirations of the peoples of the region and the world.\nThe present situation in the Kingdom of Cambodia remains the subject of major world attention. As an immediate neighbor, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, ardently wishes that the Cambodian people will be able to live their lives in peace, in an atmosphere of national reconciliation, and to work for the reconstruction of their homeland, which will thus contribute to the strengthening of peace and cooperation in the region. To that end we fully support the various measures that have been taken by the Cambodian Government, under the leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and His Excellency Mr. Hun Sen.\nIn Myanmar a new, important event has taken place. Efforts towards national reconciliation and the start of economic cooperation with the outside world have been bearing their initial fruits, thus consolidating the stability of the country.\nIn the Lao People's Democratic Republic we note, fortunately, that on the whole our economic performance has been good. On the average, annual economic growth for the past three years has been of the order of 6 per cent to 7 per cent in real terms. The inflation rate has not exceeded 10 per cent a year and exchange rates generally remain stable. No less importantly, foreign investment has considerably increased. At the present time the Lao Government is exerting major efforts to achieve the goals set in its socio-economic development strategy from now to the year 2000.\nThat strategy presented to the fifth round-table meeting organized expressly for the Lao People's Democratic Republic in Geneva last June, under the sponsorship of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), was conceived as a realistic and trustworthy document and has received broad support from participants. On behalf of the Lao Government and people I wish to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the friendly countries, international organizations and non-governmental organizations for the assistance they have afforded us in the past in our efforts\ntowards national development and we hope to be able to continue to benefit from that assistance in various fields.\nThe world economy, far from improving, still faces an uncertain future. Marked by recession and imbalances, it also suffers from grave structural problems. Developed countries do not hesitate to take certain measures that run counter to the legitimate interests of developing countries. Because of the world economy's interdependence it is important that developed countries undertake to cooperate with the developing countries in order to restore the economy and to promote development in the interests of all. In that respect it is essential fully to honor commitments undertaken in support of international cooperation as they have been set forth in resolutions of the General Assembly, in particular, the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation, in particular the Revitalization of Economic Growth and Development of the Developing Countries, the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and the resolutions of the conferences that have followed it.\nThe question relating to drug abuse and illicit trafficking remains an issue of world concern. Aware of the disastrous consequences that can result from this, the Lao Government has taken vigorous measures to encourage the population gradually to give up the poppy crop and to choose other substitute crops, created a special unit against drug abuse, and established cooperation with neighboring countries in order to make its contribution to the international fight against this scourge. As part of these efforts and with the assistance of the United Nations International Drug Control Program (UNIDCP) this year we have developed a comprehensive program for drug control. That program, the cost of which is $35 million, consists of setting up 16 projects, including the strengthening of drug control administration, reduction of supply through eradication of the poppy crop, a strategy for treatment and rehabilitation, and the establishment of a special investigation unit. With assistance and cooperation from the international community we hope to be able to achieve the goal we pursue.\nThe advancement and defense of human rights is an important and sensitive question. Unanimously seen as universal, these rights, often having historical, cultural and religious implications, are inseparable and interdependent. On that note we welcome the creation of the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights and it is our hope that the High Commissioner will effectively discharge the very responsible functions that have been assigned to him.\nThe world exists in an uncertain international political environment. In that context the United Nations, the only universal multilateral forum, should have a crucial role to play. Strengthened by the purposes and principles of its Charter, it is in a position to provide the necessary framework for cooperation, dialog among States and the maintenance of international peace and security.\nIn order to carry out its noble task effectively in this new era, the United Nations must restructure and democratize itself. It is also most important that the United Nations give top priority to a program of action on development that could serve as a framework for promoting growth and economic development throughout the world. We feel that, to be effective, any program of action on development must be action-oriented and based on a spirit of true international cooperation and interdependence; above all, it must take into account the basic legitimate interests of developing countries, especially the least developed among them.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It\nis my pleasure, Sir, to congratulate you on your election\nto the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. We are certain that your experience and your\n19\n\n\ndiplomatic skill will lead to a very positive outcome for the\nwork of this session.\nMay I at the same time convey to the Secretary-\nGeneral our profound appreciation of his tireless efforts to\nadapt the United Nations to the increasingly complex\nrequirements of a changing world.\nThe structure of the international system, at the end of\nthis century, is experiencing radical changes, particularly\nthe end of the post-war bipolarity, the fall of the Iron\nCurtain and the end of the cold war. Many new peoples\nhave gained their right to self-determination and democratic\ndevelopment, long repressed by totalitarian regimes. Some\nsucceeded in accomplishing this by peaceful means; others\nhave had to go through tragedies and major conflicts, such\nas those in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the territory of the\nformer Yugoslavia and the Trans-Dnestr, the Caucasus and\nCentral Asia, former territories of the Soviet Union. Today\nthey are all sources of concern to the international\ncommunity because of their implications for regional and\ninternational peace and security.\nThe revolutions in Central Europe, whose essential\npurpose was the restoration of freedom and dignity to the\npeople in that part of the world and their return to\ntraditional democratic values, with respect for fundamental\nhuman rights and political pluralism, have inter alia, made\nmore politically homogeneous a part of the continent long\nmarked by ideological and political barriers and\nconfrontation between opposing military blocs.\nEurope is undergoing an apparently contradictory\nevolution. On the one hand, there is a tendency towards\nthe fragmentation of States and a reaffirmation of the\nnational identities and personalities of the central part of the\ncontinent and the former Soviet territories. On the other\nhand, in the West there is a process of integration which is\ntending to draw in new European States.\nOther continents are also undergoing historically\nimportant changes.\nThe Middle East, thanks to the actions of a number of\npoliticians who were bold enough to take the great\nresponsibility of rising out of the inertia there, and running\nthe risks of peace, has entered a process of historic\nreconciliation which once seemed impossible.\nIn Latin America, as well as in Asia and the Pacific,\ndynamic economic zones have been created, thus destroying\nfalse assumptions about the inevitability of\nunderdevelopment in two-thirds of the world.\nIn Africa, the abolition of the policy of apartheid,\nthe reorganization of the Republic of South Africa on\ndemocratic lines and the defeat of reactionary racial\nconcepts open up new prospects for cooperation and\ndevelopment for the entire continent.\nThe dynamics of the world have changed. This\ncreates many questions for the international community,\nGovernments, politicians and political forces. So far the\nanswers have been few and inadequate. But life does not\nwait. States and people have concrete needs as well as\nhopes and ideals. Their natural tendency is to act in\norder to fulfil them, whether or not there exists an\norganized international framework for harmonizing\ndivergent interests.\nThis is where international organizations and the\nUnited Nations in particular have a role to play. In the\neffort to decode and evaluate the significance of the\nhighly dynamic and complex developments in the\ninternational political arena, several scenarios have\nappeared in which these developments are viewed as\npreludes to a new era of confrontation between\ncivilizations. But freeing international relations from\nideology does not and must not necessarily lead to\nconfrontation between civilizations. By definition,\nconfrontation is alien to civilization. Civilization is\ncharacterized, rather, by tolerance and open-mindedness.\nOf course, this does not exclude competition between\ncivilizations, between the values they promote, between\ntheir capacities to guarantee the free enjoyment of basic\nhuman rights and the development of initiative and the\nhuman personality. But to establish the conditions of\nsuch coexistence between civilizations a restructuring of\ninternational relations is required if an optimal framework\nfor the affirmation and development of each people\u2019s\nindividuality, as well as prosperity, are to be ensured.\nFrom this perspective, the role of the United Nations is\nessential.\nNext year we will be celebrating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the end of the Second World War and, at\nthe same time, the establishment of the United Nations.\nLike other States in the region, Romania, against its will,\nwas dragged into a conflict that claimed millions of\nvictims and wrought enormous destruction. However,\nthrough the determination of all its internal democratic\nforces - the embodiment of our nation\u2019s aspirations -\nRomania managed to break away from Hitler\u2019s war\n20\n\n\nmachine and join the coalition of the united nations on 23\nAugust 1944. The great human, material and logistical\nefforts made by the Romanian people between 23 August\n1944 and the final victory of the united nations forces are\nengraved in the Golden Book of our national history. Even\nthough the status of co-belligerent was not granted to\nRomania, no one has ever contested the strategic value and\npolitical importance of these sacrifices.\nWe support proposals that in 1995 - the year which\nmarks half a century since the end of the war - the\ninternational community should concentrate its efforts on\nbuilding a climate of peace and giving a decisive impetus\nto the peaceful settlement of conflicts existing in various\nregions of the world, thus making next year a true\ninternational year of peace.\nIn this framework, we believe that there is a need to\nrethink the entire machinery and to adapt the structures of\nthe United Nations to contemporary requirements. Indeed,\nthis rethinking process has already started, and this is to be\nwelcomed. The Secretary-General\u2019s \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\"\noffers excellent material for reflection and action.\nIn this context, we support the proposals, in our view\njustified, aimed at reviewing the composition of the\nSecurity Council in order to adapt it to today\u2019s realities and\nensure a better representation of the great geographical\nregions. In our view, such a limited increase in\nmembership would have to include Germany and Japan\namong the permanent members of that the Council, taking\ninto account their potential, role and contribution to the\nactivities of the Organization. Certainly, this should not\nmean the establishment of a \\\"condominium\\\" of the\npermanent members over the rest of the world. Rather, we\nsee it as a deeper commitment to their responsibility for\nmaintaining international peace and security, which is the\nmain task of the Security Council. In this way, a balance\ncould be achieved between the Council and the General\nAssembly and the other main bodies within a context of\ndemocratic decision-making procedures that would allow all\ncountries to act on a democratic and equal basis in\nprotecting their legitimate interests.\nAny rethinking of the structures of the United Nations\nmust take into account the phenomenon of the globalization\nof international problems, one of the features of today\u2019s\nworld. Objective factors of development are increasing the\ninterdependence of States and regions of the world. In one\nway or another, we are all affected by the tragedies that\nhave unfolded in, for example, the former Yugoslavia, the\nTrans-Dnestr region, the Caucasus, Rwanda and Haiti. The\nworld economy shows clear trends towards integration on\na global scale, a development which affects the interests\nof all States. The ecological equilibrium of the planet is\nbecoming of vital interest to all regions and summons all\nStates to bear their share of responsibility.\nAll these phenomena, typical of the late twentieth\ncentury, require us to develop an awareness of our planet\nas a veritable spaceship if our Governments\u2019 actions at\nthe international level are to be both effective and\nconvergent. The United Nations system is best placed to\nencourage and sustain the development of such an\nawareness.\nToday, there is no greater threat to international\npeace and security and no greater source of tension and\nconflict among nations than the widening gap between\nrich and poor States. The corrections already attempted\nby the international community, including the Decades for\nDevelopment and various assistance programmes, have\nnot managed to put a halt to these negative trends. This\nposes a grave threat to the global balance, particularly\nthrough the inevitable phenomenon of massive population\nmigration, which is impossible to control, from the\nunderdeveloped areas of the planet to much smaller zones\nof prosperity in Europe and North America.\nIt is in mankind\u2019s general interest to prevent such a\nprospect and to preserve its diversity. This can be\nachieved solely through a determined and enlightened\neffort on the part of the international community to\neradicate underdevelopment and promote the economic\ngrowth of the developing countries, thus turning them into\nthe truly equal partners of the developed countries, as is\nrightly emphasized in the Secretary-General\u2019s Agenda for\nDevelopment. The United Nations system is the most\nappropriate framework for launching on a global scale a\npartnership for development, the necessity of which is\ngrowing more apparent by the day.\nClearly, such a development must first address the\nneeds and aspirations to progress of the developing\ncountries. At the same time, it should coincide with the\ninterests of the developed countries, which are facing\nmany difficulties today - not on the same scale, of\ncourse - by offering them new opportunities to overcome\nrecession and chronic unemployment. The experience of\nthe developed countries themselves demonstrates that\neconomic development inherently leads to an increase in\nthe absorption capacity of national markets and in the\ndegree of economic interaction.\n21\n\n\nFrom this viewpoint the European continent is in a\nposition to engage in an experiment that has great relevance\nfor the world economy. Without coordinated action by\nEuropean States and institutions, the ideological and\npolitical barriers characteristic of the period when Europe\nwas divided into opposing military blocs may well be\nreplaced by a new iron curtain, economic in nature,\nbetween developed countries and those in transition,\nbecause of the gaps between them. Such risks could be\neliminated by the ever-growing trend towards integration at\nthe continental level; the construction of a system of\neconomic relations based on equality between the countries\nof the East and West on the continent, which will help to\npromote reforms in the Central and Eastern European\ncountries; and the realization of the necessary standards of\nintegration. Those developments could also make a vital\ncontribution to the achievement, in a similar manner, of a\npartnership for development.\nIn this connection, international efforts to promote the\neconomic growth of a particular area must not be viewed in\nterms of competition or rivalry with other areas. Any\neconomic progress in an area that is lagging represents a\ngain for other areas. In this context, the United Nations\nsystem can play a moderating and balancing role in\nmanaging, as rationally and effectively as possible, a\npartnership for development at the global level.\nI have referred to some of the major challenges\ncontemporary international developments present to the\ninternational community, and to the United Nations in\nparticular, developments with regard to which the latter is\nparticularly called upon to assume the role of organizing\ncooperation between States to harmonize and safeguard\ntheir common interests.\nAs a democratic State aware of its responsibilities to\nits people as well as to international peace, security and\ncooperation, Romania intends to be part of the universal\neffort to face these challenges. My country\u2019s principal\ncontribution to this joint effort consists of consolidating the\ndemocratic process and domestic stability. Over the nearly\nfive years since the Revolution of December 1989, the\ncountry\u2019s face has radically changed. A new Constitution,\nmodern and democratic in nature, has come into force; the\ntotalitarian regime has been abolished and the foundations\nof a State of law have been laid; the free exercise of\nfundamental human rights, including the rights of\nindividuals belonging to national minorities, is guaranteed.\nOn that basis, we have created step by step an ever greater\ndegree of domestic stability, which today makes Romania\na stabilizing factor in the region. This is an especially\nremarkable achievement in that it was obtained under\ndifficult international conditions - in particular, the\nsituations of conflict in our immediate neighbourhood and\nabove all the extremely heavy burden which the embargo\nagainst Yugoslavia has imposed upon the Romanian\neconomy, with no compensation whatsoever.\nTo the extent that it can, Romania participates in the\nefforts of the international community to resolve regional\nconflicts, primarily those in our own geographical area.\nWe are ready to assume all our responsibilities and make\nour contribution to peacefully settling those conflicts and\nensuring security and calm in a region traumatized by\nmilitary confrontations and with interests at stake that are\nnot necessarily the same as those of the parties engaged\nin combat.\nIn that spirit Romania has fully associated itself with\nthe Partnership for Peace offered by the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) to the countries of Central\nEurope and of the former Soviet Union. We believe this\nnew form of interconnection with an institution that\nconstituted a guarantee for the maintenance of peace\nthroughout the European continent will give a better\nopportunity for peace in Europe and, implicitly, for\ninternational peace and security.\nSimilarly, in a broader context, Romania supports\nthe process of integration at the continental level. It is\nendeavouring to contribute to this by pursuing a policy of\ngood-neighbourliness and by implementing regional\ncooperation projects, particularly in the area of Central\nEurope, the Black Sea and the Danube basin, all of which\nshould accelerate the integration of the countries of\nCentral and Eastern Europe into the structures of the\nEuropean Union, NATO, the Western European Union\nand the Council of Europe.\nThe priority Romania attaches to the European and\nEuro-Atlantic options, resulting from its history and from\ngeopolitical factors, does not exclude traditional\nrelationships established over the years with countries and\nareas outside the European continent. On the contrary, as\nthe country\u2019s domestic political and social life has\nbecome more stable and as its economy has begun to\nimprove, those relations have been renewed and\nexpanded. They are certainly valuable at the bilateral\nlevel, but they are also valuable multilaterally, since they\nstrengthen international confidence and trust and develop\na global awareness of the fact that the world is shrinking\nall the time, in terms of both time and space, and that\n22\n\n\neach State shares responsibility for the tranquillity, peace\nand prosperity of other States.\nThe extremely complex situations in various parts of\nthe world and the contradictory currents that exist, with all\ntheir attendant risks and uncertainties for overall peace and\nsecurity, demand a democratic vision of the new\ninternational order, which must be built, and abandonment\nof prejudices in relations between States inherited from the\ncold-war period. But that is not all. I believe that today\nwe need a vision of the management of international\nrelations in which realism and pragmatism predominate.\nUnfortunately, the after-effects of ideological outlooks still\nlinger in political thinking, distancing us from reality and\ninevitably influencing policy making. In certain conditions,\nthis can have extremely serious consequences for States and\npeoples by marginalizing them or even by isolating them\nfrom international cooperation. In the medium and long\nterm, such political decisions can only have harmful\nconsequences for international peace and security.\nBecause of its vocation and its Charter principles, the\nUnited Nations is the ideal forum for determining an\napproach to international problems free from stereotypes\nand prejudices. To the extent that the United Nations\nsucceeds, all Member States stand to gain - each\nindividually and the international community as a whole.\nRomania is prepared to participate in this joint effort to\nbuild a world of international peace and cooperation, free\nfrom conflicts and prejudices.\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation is pleased to\nconvey warmest greetings from the Government and people\nof Grenada to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. We also wish to extend sincere congratulations to\nYour Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign Minister of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, on your election to the presidency of this session.\nThe Government of Grenada takes this opportunity to\ncommend Ambassador Samuel Insanally, the first\nrepresentative from the Caribbean ever to hold the high\noffice of President of the General Assembly, for his\nexemplary conduct of the proceedings of the forty-eighth\nsession. We are indeed proud of his performance.\nGrenada also wishes to express profound appreciation\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\nrelentless efforts in the pursuit of the purposes of this\nOrganization.\nGrenada is pleased to welcome the new South Africa\nto the United Nations, and we pay special tribute to His\nExcellency President Nelson Mandela for his resolute will\nand firm determination in the fight against apartheid, which\neventually resulted in this new, democratic and non-racial\nSouth Africa.\nGrenada is pleased that in recent efforts to bring an\nend to the illegal seizure of power by the military in Haiti\nand to halt the ensuing human rights abuses there\ndiplomacy prevailed and further bloodshed was averted.\nWe now eagerly await the reinstatement of the duly\nelected Government and its President, Father Jean-\nBertrand Aristide, and the return of democracy to Haiti.\nWe support the actions taken by the United States of\nAmerica and other multinational forces in implementation\nof United Nations resolutions on Haiti, and we join\nlike-minded nations as they move to establish the\nstructures in which development and democracy can be\nsustained.\nGrenada is prepared to do its part to ensure a more\nfertile ground for the growth of democracy in Haiti, our\nsister Caribbean country. We are proud that, within the\nlimits of our resources, personnel from Grenada\u2019s law\nenforcement services are among the multinational\ncontingent to help in \\\"Operation Uphold Democracy\\\".\nAfter all, it was 11 years ago this month that Grenada\nitself profited from a similar multinational operation,\naffording us the historic opportunity to restore democratic\nprinciples to our way of life. It is therefore only natural\nthat Grenada should wish Haiti well and should be\nprepared to support democracy in that country as fully as\nwe do.\nOver the last several years many of the small\ndeveloping countries within this Organization have been\nexperiencing growing economic problems. The forced\nresponse has been to take stringent corrective measures\naimed at stabilizing their economies and creating the\nconditions for sustainable development. Speaking\nspecifically of my own country, Grenada, I can inform the\nAssembly that in 1992 we embarked on a voluntary three-\nyear structural adjustment programme in an effort to\ncorrect serious fiscal imbalances and to put the country on\na path of sustained growth.\nThis year marks the end of the programme, and I am\nhappy to report that some success has been achieved.\nThe Government has significantly reduced the fiscal\ndeficits from 25 per cent of gross domestic product in\n1992 to 11 per cent in 1993 and 9 per cent to date.\nMoreover, Grenada\u2019s credit rating has improved notably,\nwith its creditworthiness restored by the World Bank in\nJune of this year after having been forfeited in 1988.\nWhatever success has been recorded by that programme\nis a credit to regionalism, since the programme was\ninstituted with enormous regional inputs. Grenada wishes\npublicly to thank the regional Governments and\n11\n\n\ninstitutions which contributed to the effort. This particular\ndevelopment means that Grenada is now viewed more\nfavourably by the multilateral and specialized donor\nagencies and friendly Governments in terms of external\nfinancial assistance for its development programmes.\nDespite the good fiscal performance, the structural-\nadjustment programme has not been able to achieve its\ntargets in terms of the growth rate of the gross domestic\nproduct. Thus, over the next two years much emphasis will\nbe placed on achieving a reasonable rate of economic\ngrowth. In addition, efforts to reduce the fiscal deficits\nfurther will continue to be vigorously pursued.\nYou, Mr. President, are well aware that a topic of\nparticular currency in the area of international economic\nrelations is the issue of trade and investment. Of course,\nover the past months new trading blocs have been created,\nwith the result that in the Western Hemisphere we now\nhave several such arrangements, which include the very\nimportant North American Free Trade Agreement\n(NAFTA). While all the implications of NAFTA are not\nyet known, we must nevertheless now seek to position our\neconomies to interface with the realities of this new\neconomic environment.\nIn that context, the conclusion of the latest round of\nthe negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT) has very far-reaching consequences for\ntrade. The requirements of trade liberalization and\nreciprocity mean that small island developing States like\nGrenada must now interact on the same playing field as the\nmore developed countries, which, in effect, signals a rapid\nerosion of the preferential treatment that some of us have\nenjoyed over the past two decades. The removal of access\nto market arrangements traditionally favourable to fledgling\nindustries in our societies - the banana industry, for\nexample - compounds our difficulties and presents a major\nthreat to the overall well-being of our small economies.\nFurthermore, the creation of the World Trade Organization\nwould most definitely change the face of international trade,\nand while every independent nation has the opportunity to\nbecome a party to that Organization and thus attempt to\ninfluence its operations, it is evident that, on that score,\nequality will not necessarily ensure equity. We are\ncognizant of the fact that we must now seek to enhance our\nproductivity and competitiveness in carefully selected areas\nif we are to survive in this era of trade liberalization. But,\nmore often than not, we cannot do it alone, and this is why\nmy delegation appeals to the developed countries to be\nconsiderate of our fragile economies and the need to adapt\nto this seemingly hostile economic environment.\nThe recent success of the United Nations Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small\nIsland Developing States, held in Barbados, and the\nadoption of its Programme of Action underscore the\nurgent need for international co-operation and assistance,\nnot only in the form of financial resources for the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action, but also in\naccess to markets, acquisition of new technologies and\ninstitutional and human-resource development, so as to\nenable us to respond more capably to the challenges of\nfinding new paths to sustainable development.\nThe advances made since the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development must be\nbuilt upon, and in this regard the importance of forging\nnew global partnerships between developed and\ndeveloping countries ought to be given priority. The\nprotection of the global climate and biological diversity,\nthe sustainable use and conservation of all marine\nresources and the protection of our oceans and high seas\nrequire urgent international assistance and cooperation.\nMy delegation therefore looks forward to the\nfulfilment of the obligations of the developed countries\nthat have pledged their commitment to assist developing\ncountries and, in particular, small island developing\nStates, in the implementation of the decisions and\nrecommendations of Agenda 21, the conventions on\nclimate change and biodiversity and all the follow-up\nconferences of the Rio Conference.\nFor several years Grenada has expressed its concern\nat the apparent unbalanced resource commitment to\nsecurity issues versus development. Consequently, my\ndelegation commends recently expanded efforts aimed at\ngiving greater prominence to the development needs\nconfronting the world, particularly in the developing\ncountries. We applaud the Secretary-General\u2019s report \\\"An\nAgenda for Development\\\" and we applaud the former\nPresident of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr.\nSamuel Insanally, for his visionary initiative in organizing\nthe World Hearings on Development in June of this year.\nWe urge that the momentum gained therefrom be\nmaintained, and we wish to place on record our support\nfor Brazil\u2019s call for a global conference on development\nin the year 1996.\nThe question of population and development is a\nvery sensitive issue, one that demands continuous\nconscientious global effort. Grenada is encouraged by the\nconsensus which emerged from the recently concluded\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\n12\n\n\nat Cairo, and we are hopeful that increasingly balanced\ndevelopment will be viewed as the essential basis on which\nto treat the issue of population.\nWe are also confident that the Conference on Women\nto be held at Beijing in 1995 will address one of the long-\nstanding issues critical to development, that is, the issue of\nwomen in development.\nIn March of 1995 world leaders will gather in\nCopenhagen to address one of the most pressing questions\nof our time, the question of social development. We will\nbe asked to rule on the debilitating issues of poverty,\nmeaningful employment and social inclusion. We will be\nasked to rule particularly in the interest of youth, the aged,\nthe disabled and all those outside the mainstream of social\nintegration.\nGrenada is confident that the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment and all the other follow-ups to the Rio\nConference are replacing despair with hope worldwide. At\nthe same time, we are concerned about the different spins\nthat may be put on the interpretation of those agreements.\nFor example, we are concerned that environmental causes\nshould not be used as barriers to access for goods produced\nin developing countries to the markets of those with more\nprosperous economies. We hope that, on the contrary, the\ndeveloped countries will appreciate the need to assist the\npoorer countries to gain access to the technologies and\ntechnological know-how necessary to the promotion of\nmore-balanced development on a global scale.\nStability within and between States is a prerequisite\nfor international peace and security. Grenada is encouraged\nby certain developments, beginning almost a year ago with\nthe signing of the historic peace treaty between Israel and\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization. We believe that the\nemergence of self-rule in Jericho and Gaza is of great\nsignificance. We look forward to further positive\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process and wish all\nthe countries in that region the peace and stability upon\nwhich lasting prosperity will be built.\nGrenada is encouraged by the diplomatic efforts in the\nsearch for a permanent solution to the crisis in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. We commend the United Nations for its\nresolve and determination in this regard. We fully support\nthe establishment of the International Tribunal to try\nallegations of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. By the\nsame token, Grenada fully supports similar initiatives in\nresponse to situations in other parts of the world, where\nthese are deemed appropriate.\nIn the light of the unfortunate circumstances in\nRwanda that resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands\nof lives, and bearing in mind other situations of human\ndevastation, Grenada wishes to express its satisfaction\nwith the responses from those members of the\ninternational community that have gone to the aid of\npeople in various sorry situations. We also wish to\nconvey our appreciation to the relief agencies and others\nwhose tireless efforts have saved lives, restored health to\nthe sick and hungry and brought comfort to countless\nvictims - particularly women and children.\nMy delegation wishes to underscore the importance\nof human rights, freedom and good governance as vital\npreconditions to domestic quietude, international harmony\nand the creation of the climate necessary for the\nachievement of progress within societies. In this regard,\nthe promotion and protection of the rights of children is\nan issue that cries out for greater attention. The\nwell-being of children cannot wait for the unprompted\nevolution of societies. Deliberate efforts must be\nexpedited at various levels, global and national, to ensure\nthe promotion and protection of children\u2019s rights.\nLikewise, in this the International Year of the Family and\nbeyond, emphasis should continue to be placed on the\npivotal role of the family in national and global\ndevelopment.\nThe end of the cold-war era presents opportunities\nfor a shift from political and ideological divide to\ncooperation in the areas of economic and social\ndevelopment. New economic Powers on the world scene\nseek to occupy positions that were once the prerogative of\nthe traditional super-Powers. Grenada believes that the\nstructure of the organs of the United Nations should\nreflect these new developments and, at the same time,\nmake provision for geographical representation that is\nconsistent with today\u2019s global, political and economic\nrealities. Reforms currently being undertaken in the\nUnited Nations system provide an opportunity to examine\nthe question of expanding the Security Council and the\nquestion of the veto power in the light of these new\nrealities.\nGrenada supports the principle of universality and\nencourages the General Assembly to give renewed\nconsideration to the wish of the Republic of China - a\nfounding Member of the United Nations - to participate\nin the Organization and its specialized agencies as a full\nMember. We believe that this appeal from the 21 million\npeople of the Republic of China in Taiwan for a voice\nand proper representation in the international community\n13\n\n\nis both moral and legitimate. The inclusion of the Republic\nof China in Taiwan in the United Nations would further\ncontribute to global cooperation in trade, economic\ndevelopment and environmental and ecological protection.\nIn addition, it would assist in the promotion of international\ndevelopment assistance to developing countries. Grenada\nbelieves that a committee should be set up to examine the\nexceptional nature of the situation of the Republic of China\nin the present international context.\nSo long as drug traffickers and international arms\ndealers continue to ply their trade, and so long as\nmercenaries, terrorists and other adventurists exist, the\nprotection and security of small States will remain\nparticularly vulnerable to acts of aggression, from without\nas well as from within.\nWhile the United Nations Charter recognizes the right\nof States to take measures in self-defence, the reality is that\noften small States faced with serious threats lack the means\nto do so. Small States invariably look to the provisions of\nthe United Nations Charter to secure respect for and\npreservation of their sovereignty. It is therefore necessary\nthat the protection and security of small States remain a\nvery pertinent issue among the concerns of the United\nNations.\nThe tasks of the organs and bodies of the United\nNations are by no means easy. Old tensions have given\nway to new tensions and concerns, which demand\nimaginative approaches if solutions are to be found. As we\nembark upon preparations for the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations in 1995, let us train our sights on the\nfactors that brought the United Nations into being in the\nfirst instance and on what gives the Organization its special\nworthiness.\nThe challenge is to attain and maintain long-term\nglobal peace and stability and to enhance the prospects for\nsolving global problems of an economic, social, cultural or\nhumanitarian nature. To this end, we as a community of\nnations must rededicate ourselves to working ever\nrelentlessly and concertedly towards the goal of making our\nplanet a safer, better and happier place in which to live.\n"

        "file_text": "I\nshould like first of all, Mr. President, to tell you how\npleased the Benin delegation is to see you presiding over\nthis session of the General Assembly. This is an honour\nfor all of Africa, and especially your country, with which\nBenin has age-old ties of friendship and, still more, of\nfraternity.\nAt a time when, more than ever before, the United\nNations is called upon to act in the interests of peace and\nthe well-being of mankind, this election is\nacknowledgement by the international community not only\nof the dedication of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to the cause of peace and\nprosperity but also of your personal qualities as a seasoned\ndiplomat.\nBenin is proud to see a distinguished representative of\na country from the subregion of West Africa assume this\nimportant responsibility, and can assure you, Sir, of the\ncooperation and support of its delegation - and here we\nwish also to congratulate the other members of the General\nCommittee.\nI would be remiss if I did not align myself, with great\nemotion and pleasure, with what His Excellency Mr. Konan\nB\u00e9di\u00e9, President of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire said, that\nin your election we can already see that Africa is resisting\nmarginalization.\nI should also like to pay tribute to your eminent\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of\nGuyana, who assumed with such great competence and skill\nthe presidency of our Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nHe has left an indelible mark on this world Organization\nthrough his personal contribution to our efforts at\nrevitalizing the General Assembly, restructuring the\nSecurity Council and resuming development.\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of Benin,\nI should like to pay a most deserved tribute to the United\nNations and its Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, for the intensive activities they have been carrying\nout for peace and development for all peoples, especially at\nthis time when armed conflict, ethnic clashes and tribal\nwarfare distort the basic values of mankind.\nI should also like to welcome the granting to the\nSovereign Military Order of Malta of Observer status at the\nUnited Nations.\nSince our last session, positive developments have\ntaken place in the settlement of internal, local and regional\nconflicts that have caused upheavals in the international\narena. I would mention, among others, the emergence of\na new South Africa, one that is united, democratic and\nnon-racial, where each person can at last enjoy full\ncitizenship.\nBenin hails once again the courage and\ndetermination of the South African people - courage and\ndetermination that have enabled all humanity to win this\nhistoric victory, one of dialogue over confrontation and of\npeace over violence.\nOur Organization, which is proud of its contribution,\nmust see to it the consolidation of the policy of unity and\nnational reconciliation and reconstruction pursued by\nPresident Nelson Mandela, whose wisdom and clear-\nsightedness are equalled only by the historic dimensions\nof the man himself.\nIn Mozambique, our most cherished wish is for a\ncontinuation of the process of reconciliation currently\nunder way until the final holding in October of free and\ndemocratic elections in that country, stricken by so many\nyears of civil war.\nSimilarly, we express the hope that in Angola the\nnegotiations under way between the Angolan Government\nand UNITA might lead to an effective cease-fire and to\nthe establishment of a lasting peace, which are absolute\nprerequisites for reconciliation and national reconstruction.\nWith regard to the question of Palestine, we\nwelcome the positive and irreversible developments\ntowards a just and lasting settlement since the historic\nsigning, between the Palestine Liberation Organization\nand Israel, of the Declaration of Principles on Palestinian\nautonomy in Gaza and Jericho. In the same context, the\nBenin delegation would encourage Israel and the Arab\nStates to continue to improve their relations through\ncooperation and mutual understanding for the\nestablishment of lasting peace in the Middle East.\nAs regards the situation between Kuwait and Iraq, it\nis important, in the interest of security and stability in the\nGulf, that Iraq confirm clearly, and without ambiguity, its\nrecognition of the sovereignty, independence, territorial\nintegrity and the international borders of Kuwait by\nagreeing, among other things, to Security Council\nresolution 833 (1993).\nOther conflicts are now in the process of being\nsettled elsewhere, for example in Cambodia and Central\n31\n\n\nAmerica, where praiseworthy efforts are under way with a\nview to the gradual and definitive normalization of the\npolitical situation.\nIn spite of these encouraging facts, we regret to note\nthat the persistent activities of forces for fragmentation and\ndisintegration are hindering the achievement of peace in\ncertain parts of the world.\nIn this context, we should point out, inter alia, the\nvery alarming situation in Somalia, where military\nintransigence and political intolerance are to no avail\nprolonging human suffering, jeopardizing the lives of the\nstaff of United Nations peace-keeping and peacemaking\noperations, and provoking some irritation within the\ninternational community, whose valuable contribution to a\npeaceful and lasting settlement is absolutely necessary. It\nis time for the protagonists, on whom an acceptable\nsolution to their conflicts depends, to show good will and\nflexibility.\nWe deplore the fact that in Liberia, in spite of the\nconsiderable efforts made by the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS), supported by the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and by the United\nNations, the implementation of the Cotonou agreement has\nbeen carried out only begrudgingly. Six months after\ntaking office on 7 March 1994, the National Transitional\nGovernment has not yet managed effectively to extend its\nauthority to the entire country, whereas the disarmament\nand demobilization process is practically suspended.\nSince a return to normalcy in Liberia is absolutely\nnecessary for the continuation of the programme of\neconomic integration of the subregion of West Africa, my\ncountry urges the Liberian parties to abide by the Cotonou\nagreement so as to speed the return of the country to\nnormalcy. Once again Benin encourages the international\ncommunity to maintain and increase financial assistance so\nas to enable the ECOWAS Military Observer Group,\nexpanded by troops from Uganda and Tanzania, to fully\ndischarge its mandate.\nWith regard to Rwanda, ravaged by a war reminiscent\nof another age, Benin joins in the indignation expressed by\nthe international community by condemning most\nvigorously the massive and systematic violations of human\nrights and of international humanitarian law. We welcome\nthe humanitarian activities and good offices of the United\nNations, of the OAU, of France, of the United States of\nAmerica, of the African countries, and particularly those of\nthe subregion, as well as those of non-governmental\norganizations in coming to the assistance of refugees and\nhelping to initiate a dialogue among Rwandans. The\ndelegation of Benin is convinced that any lasting national\nreconciliation in Rwanda must be based on the Arusha\nagreement of 4 August 1993 in order to maximize the\nopportunities to rebuild the country.\nBut in order to avoid a repetition of the Rwandan\nholocaust elsewhere, we should support efforts to identify\nthose guilty of abuses, whoever they may be, so that they\nmight answer for their crimes against humanity.\nIn neighbouring Burundi, most recently torn by\narmed clashes, the return to a precarious calm and the\nagreement for a government that was recently signed by\nthe parties to the conflict bear witness to a new awareness\non the part of that fraternal people, the fate of whom had\nbeen of great concern to all peace- and freedom-loving\nmen and women throughout the world. We urge them\nmost earnestly to continue along this path so as to\nconsolidate their unity and cohesion.\nFurthermore, the international community has\nfollowed very closely recent developments in the situation\nin Haiti. In fact, on the basis of Security Council 940\n(1994), the United States Government showed firmness\nand intelligence by forcing the Port-au-Prince dictators to\nagree to give up the power they seized three years ago.\nBenin exhorts the United Nations, the Organization\nof American States and the United States of America to\nunite their efforts to bring about the effective\nreinstatement of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the\npeaceful restoration of democracy in Haiti. The Republic\nof Benin is prepared, within its modest resources, to make\nits contribution to the triumph of peace and democracy in\nHaiti.\nIn Europe - specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina -\nit is to be regretted that the Serbs have rejected the latest\npeace plan of the Contact Group, which offered them\n49 per cent of the Bosnian territory. We will welcome\nthe agreement by the Belgrade authorities to deploy\nUnited Nations forces along their country\u2019s borders and\nto enforce the international arms embargo.\nFaced with the intransigence of the Bosnian Serbs,\nthe international community should take over the\nprotection and defence of the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of Bosnia, so as to avoid any spread of this\ninterminable conflict, which has already been exacerbated\nby the hateful practice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\".\n32\n\n\nFollowing the collapse of ideologies, the role of the\nUnited Nations in world affairs is and remains essential.\nWe should avoid any weakening of its ability effectively\nand efficiently to promote peace, as this would do great\nharm to its credibility. The revitalization, restructuring and\ndemocratization of the United Nations must continue in\norder to increase its efficiency in carrying out the work it\nhas undertaken.\nThis, for example, should be the case for the Security\nCouncil, which has the responsibility of acting on behalf of\nMember States for the maintenance of international peace\nand security. Its legitimacy, its credibility and its\neffectiveness will be strengthened if we are able to take\nsteps to enlarge it and change the composition of its\nmembership so as to reflect the increase in the number of\nStates Members of this world Organization.\nAware of the fact that, in this new context, the\nSecurity Council cannot remain as it was designed and\ncreated a half-century ago, the delegation of Benin is in\nfavour of a patient search for consensus on all issues\npertaining to its reform.\nThe production, international transfer and\naccumulation of arms are a threat to peace and stability the\nworld over. This is why the international community\u2019s\ncommitment to peace requires the firm determination to\nmake real progress in the process of general and complete\ndisarmament under international control.\nIn the area of conflict prevention and crisis\nmanagement, we must strengthen the capabilities of the\nUnited Nations and support the idea of good offices and of\npreventive diplomacy as advocated by the Secretary-General\nin the Agenda for Peace.\nRespect for the principle of the sovereignty of States\ncould hinder the implementation of this approach. Indeed,\ncrises or conflicts today are for the most part internal in\nnature - civil wars, territorial partitions, ethnic clashes,\nreligious or tribal struggles, and so forth. But these crises\nand conflicts can also threaten international peace and\nsecurity. Hence there is a balance to be struck between\nintervention and respect for the sovereignty of States.\nIn this context, we shall continue to encourage close\ncooperation with regional organizations, pursuant to Chapter\nVIII of the United Nations Charter. Within Africa, there is\nalready in place a mechanism for preventing, managing and\nsettling conflicts which makes the development and\nstrengthening of such cooperation possible.\nI would also mention, as part of regional\ncontributions to global efforts for peace, the conclusions\nreached by the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Zone of\nPeace and Cooperation in the South Atlantic, held in\nBrasilia on 21 and 22 September 1994.\nWe can never emphasize enough the close\nrelationship between peace, democracy, human rights and\nsustainable development. And we should be pleased that\nour Organization offers a proper framework for the\nachievement of consensus on this relationship. The\nDeclaration and Programme of Action of the important\nWorld Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in\n1993 prove that the international community is\ndetermined to face up to these non-military threats to\npeace and security the world over.\nEconomic and social issues are of concern today to\nthe entire world and raise moral issues among politicians,\nGovernments and representatives of civilian society. The\nend of the cold war, far from ironing out difficulties, has\nfurther widened the gap between the developed and the\ndeveloping countries. The developed and the developing\ncountries must work together and understand one another\nif there is to be progress and, especially, peace for all.\nThere are many social and economic problems\nfacing the world, and we must attack these ills at their\nvery roots. The preparations for the commemoration of\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the United\nNations, and the major conferences it has organized since\n1994, provide us with an opportunity to better deal with\nthe major problems that are undermining and marring\ntoday\u2019s world.\nAbove and beyond general political declarations,\npromises unkept and wishes unfulfilled, all the actors in\nthe international community must by common agreement\ndraw up concrete, effective and immediate solutions that\nwill allow us to avoid chaos in the developing countries,\nin particular in Africa and in the least developed\ncountries. Otherwise, our expectations for the beginning\nof the twenty-first century will not be met.\nNone the less, there is room for hope when we\nremember that the Assembly, in resolution 47/181 of 22\nDecember 1992, asked the Secretary-General to submit to\nit a report on an agenda for development, after consulting\nwith Member States. The drafting of this agenda, to be\nadopted during the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, will be a clear\ndeclaration of the right to development and a reorientation\n33\n\n\nof the objectives and priorities of the United Nations system\ntowards socio-economic activities and programmes designed\nfirst and foremost to eliminate poverty and then to develop\nhuman resources through education, training, the creation of\nproductive employment, and social integration.\nIt is thus possible to change the current situation and\nto reverse the process of impoverishment, aggravated by\neconomic stagnation. The agenda for development will\nusefully complement Agenda 21 and the Agenda for Peace\nin the quest for sustainable development.\nOur vision of the twenty-first century and our\nprospects for the future should be illuminated and\nstrengthened by the effective implementation of the various\nprogrammes and plans of action adopted since the\nbeginning of this decade within the framework of the\nUnited Nations system. I would like to cite, as examples,\nthe Plan of Action for children, the Programme of Action\nfor the least developed countries in the 1990s, and the\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\nin the 1990s (UN-NADAF). While the implementation of\nthe first two programmes has already begun and we will\nalready be able to take stock of them a mid-term review in\n1995, UN-NADAF is still in its infancy. Indeed, there has\nbeen no concrete action, no funding for projects and no\ncommitment of financial resources since the adoption of the\nnew programme in December 1991 by the General\nAssembly.\nFurthermore, the planned resumed session to continue\nand complete negotiations on the draft resolution to create\na diversification fund for African commodities has\nremained wishful thinking - for want, we are told, of a\npresident to lead the debates and to conclude the work -\nand all this, in spite of the efforts made by the President of\nlast year\u2019s General Assembly session.\nNone the less, we welcome the conclusions and\nrecommendations of the second part of the thirty-fourth\nsession of the Committee for Programme and Coordination\non a revised, system-wide plan of action for economic\nrecovery and development in Africa.\nBut we need not limit ourselves to establishing a\ncloser relationship between a system-wide plan and UN-\nNADAF or to determining the priority sectors to be the\nfocal points of action carried out thanks to the cooperation\nof United Nations bodies for the remaining period of the\nplan\u2019s implementation. In addition to the present resources,\nwe must mobilize supplementary resources for the effective\nimplementation of the activities and programmes involved.\nThe economic and social crises that today are\ncausing upheaval in Africa have highlighted the\nchallenges to be taken up by that continent in order to\nmake progress along the path of development. To cope\nwith these crises, most of our countries have undertaken\nfar-reaching political and economic reforms.\nIn Benin, we are continuing our march forward to\nmake sure that our democratic process - begun almost\nfive years ago - takes root and that our national economy\nis consolidated. In spite of substantial efforts and\nsacrifices, our political and economic structures remain\nfragile and vulnerable.\nFurthermore, taking up the challenges of the 1990s\nin Africa necessarily means finding rapid and lasting\nsolutions to problems linked to foreign indebtedness,\nseeking an inflow of new financial and other resources to\nmeet the growing development needs, ensuring the\ntransfer of new and appropriate technology; and\npromoting a truly open and equitable system of\ninternational trade, as well as encouraging the\ndiversification and modernization of African economies.\nAs regards external debt, the developed countries\nwill have to exert clear and resolute political\ndetermination by pursuing a policy of cancelling outright\nthe official debt of the African and least developed\ncountries; by deciding, in the managing boards of the\nmultilateral financial institutions, to reduce by 50 per cent\nthe multilateral debt of the developing countries,\nparticularly of the African and least developed countries;\nand by negotiating with the banking institutions a\nrescheduling of commercial debt. We remain convinced\nthat these initiatives are within the scope of the\nGovernments of the developed countries and can be\nimplemented in a demonstration that the world is\nchanging.\nWith regard to international trade, the mixed results\nfor Africa of the negotiations of the Uruguay Round give\nus little hope that, within the framework of international\ntrade, our countries will soon emerge from the\nmarginalization in which they have existed since the late\n1980s. As in all previous rounds of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Uruguay Round led\nto the elimination of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.\nBut the common estimates of the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\nshow that the overall result of this eighth round of\nnegotiations will only benefit the industrial countries. For\n34\n\n\nAfrica, for example, the OECD studies predict losses of\nover $2 billion by the year 2002, not to mention the fact\nthat the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific\nthat are linked to the European Union by the Lom\u00e9\nConvention risk losing certain advantages they have\nenjoyed until now.\nFurthermore, the results of the negotiations of the\nUruguay Round are making the developing countries,\nparticularly those of Africa, dependent on food products\nimported from developed countries, whereas the objective\nof the current strategies is to ensure food security in Africa.\nIn such circumstances, Benin earnestly hopes that the first\naction taken by the World Trade Organization will be to\nclose the loopholes of the negotiated text by making bold\ndecisions and recommendations on behalf of Africa and\nthereby correcting drawbacks foreseen from the outset.\nThe decisions and recommendations of the Earth\nSummit will, as they are implemented, gradually become\nsolid landmarks for current and future generations in the\nbuilding of a society that, thanks to the achievement of\nsustainable development, will not run the risk of self-\ndestruction.\nIn this framework, Benin welcomes the adoption on 6\nMay 1994 in Barbados of the Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates. Benin also welcomes the conclusion in Paris on 17\nJune of the International Convention to Combat\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious\nDrought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa. We\nhope that this Convention and the regional Annex for\nimplementation in Africa will serve as a basis for a new\ncontract between Governments, donors and local\npopulations in their efforts to combat desertification and\nmitigate the effects of drought. This new contract must be\nreflected in firm and precise commitments of financial\nresources and the transfer of ecologically sound technology.\nIf it is not, we will find ourselves in the same unfortunate\nsituation that led, because of a lack of sufficient resources\nand the poor management of those allocated, to the\nnon-implementation of the results of the United Nations\nConference on Desertification held in Nairobi in 1977.\nBenin therefore appeals to all States to attend the signing\nceremony for the Convention on 14 and 15 October in\nParis.\nThe curtain has barely dropped on the Cairo\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\nwhich marks the birth of a new process for population and\ndevelopment strategies. The intensity of debate during the\nConference was commensurate with the importance of the\nissue. In order to meet the challenge of the development\nto which countries throughout the world aspire, we must\nset our children and women, who represent the majority\nof the populations of our countries, along the road to\nprogress, which requires information, education and\ntraining.\nThe work of the preparatory committees for\nimportant United Nations conferences being organized at\nthe moment - especially the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, the Fourth World Conference on Women,\nthe second United Nations Conference on Human\nSettlements (Habitat II) and the entry into force on 16\nNovember 1994 of the United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea, completed last July with the agreement\non Part XI - will strengthen the positive trend clearly\nexpressed during earlier negotiations. Nevertheless, the\nlife-giving flame fed by the spirit of Rio de Janeiro might\ngo out if intellectual efforts are not complemented by a\nmobilization of new and addition financial resources to\ncarry out all the activities planned.\nThe World Summit for Social Development will\nbring together for the first time Heads of State or\nGovernment in order to take decisions on social\ndevelopment. Benin believes that the declaration and\nprogramme of action to be adopted in Copenhagen in\nMarch 1995 should not be limited to acknowledging and\naccepting the fact that Africa is the continent facing the\ngreatest number of social problems. These two\ndocuments should be a reference point that clearly defines\nconcrete measures, an implementation schedule and the\nestimated costs of activities aimed at eliminating poverty\nand creating productive employment and social\nintegration.\nBenin suggests that the Copenhagen Summit\nrecommend the proclamation of an international decade\nfor the eradication of poverty, which would be the\ncontinuation of the International Year for the Eradication\nof Poverty adopted under General Assembly resolution\n48/183.\nThe new international situation calls for\nstrengthening, democratizing and rationalizing the\nactivities of the United Nations, and it is up to us the\nMember States to make an outstanding contribution in the\npursuit of the noble objectives of peace, justice and\ndevelopment. We feel that this is possible if all Member\nStates respect the obligations incumbent upon them under\nthe Charter.\n35\n\n\nThe delegation of Benin is convinced that our current\ndeliberations will be guided by a common determination to\ntake concerted and concrete steps best suited to the\nnecessity of maintaining peace and promoting prosperity\nthroughout the world. In particular, this will require a\nrejection of indecisiveness and self-absorption.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me, Sir, to extend\nto you the congratulations of my country and of my\ndelegation on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. You bring\nwith you to the office of the presidency experience which\nis both wide and varied. Added to this is your\nwell-known commitment to the ideals and principles that\ngovern this Organization. These qualities together serve\nto provide us with every confidence that under your\ndistinguished guidance our deliberations cannot but be\nproductive in the furtherance of the objectives of this\nworld body.\nI want also to take this opportunity to applaud\nAmbassador Insanally of Guyana for the distinguished\nmanner in which he led the Assembly during its forty-\neighth session.\nAs the international community gathers once again\nto bring its collective wisdom to bear on solutions for\ndealing with problems which continue to threaten the\nwelfare of the world and its people, we cannot but, with\n7\n\n\na sense of mixed emotions, reflect on what we as a body\nhave been able to accomplish to date. Those emotions\nrange from the satisfaction experienced at the success of\nour collective efforts to bring about a climate of\ncoexistence and harmony in South Africa and the Middle\nEast - with the prospects now provided for human\nadvancement in those regions - to the sense of deep regret\nthat, even as we record such major successes, the suffering\nand the waste of human life caused by territorial conflict\nand the injustice of decisions based on ethnic considerations\ncontinue to place serious obstacles in the path of universal\nprogress.\nMy delegation salutes both President Mandela and\nVice President de Klerk for their courage and determination\nin working together to consolidate their strong beginnings\nin the direction of a multiracial democracy. My delegation\nwill continue to support the international community in its\nefforts to assist the millions of deprived South Africans\nattain a better quality of life.\nHowever, my delegation is still deeply concerned\nabout some other countries in Africa, which continue to\nwage a hopeless battle against poverty, disease, debt\nsettlement and political strife. It is important that more\nattention be given to the economic welfare of Africa to\nprevent other unfortunate massacres similar to those\nwitnessed in Rwanda and Somalia.\nIn keeping with the spirit of universality that prevails\ntoday, Saint Lucia had hoped that the question of full\nmembership of the United Nations for the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan would be favourably considered as a\nsupplementary item on the agenda. Saint Lucia continues\nto lend its support to the Republic of China on Taiwan in\nits efforts to achieve full membership of the United\nNations, and urges the inclusion of this item on the agenda\nof the fiftieth session. It is indeed anomalous that a\ncountry already making a valuable contribution on the\ninternational stage should continue to find itself debarred\nfrom participation in the family of nations.\nSaint Lucia is heartened by the progress towards peace\nin the Middle East that has been achieved between Israel\nand Palestine and between Israel and Jordan. However, my\ndelegation notes with some concern the renewed potential\nfor conflict between Iraq and Kuwait, and again calls upon\nthe Government of Iraq to recognize and respect the\nterritorial integrity of the State of Kuwait.\nThe devastating conflict in the former Yugoslavia,\nwhich the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nhas lamented has spared no one in its violence, remains,\nlike several other conflicts around the world, a major\nfocus of peace-keeping and humanitarian efforts by the\nUnited Nations.\nThese conflicts not only challenge the capacity of\nthe United Nations to deal with those problems in a way\nthat would lead to their resolution, but also engender new\nand frightening dimensions of human suffering, resulting\nfrom the large-scale displacement of populations and the\nconcomitant disabilities to which they become exposed.\nThe net effect of such calamities goes beyond the\nurgent call for a global response, in that it creates new\nstresses in the developing world, through the diversion of\nscarce resources away from peaceful development, into\nattenuating human suffering.\nMy delegation therefore wholeheartedly supports\nefforts by the Secretary-General to foster greater regional\ninvolvement in conflict-resolution and in the creation of\nappropriate humanitarian support structures.\nWith rising unemployment, poverty and drug abuse,\nour societies face an almost insurmountable challenge\nwhich threatens the ability of our youth to achieve their\ntrue potential. The response to this mounting threat\nresides in a universal blueprint aimed at reversing the\neconomic and social ills from which it springs. In this\nregard my delegation supports the Secretary-General\u2019s\nAgenda for Development.\nThe International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, held in Cairo this year, was a powerful\ninitiative, however contentious some of the issues may\nhave been. The forthcoming World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, to be held in Copenhagen and the World\nConference on Women, to be held in Beijing, offer\nprospects of great promise in identifying new approaches\nto the attainment of productive employment and the\nrelease of innate capacities as well as the empowerment\nand participation of all sectors of the population in the\nalleviation of their conditions. My country will\nparticipate in and support those processes.\nSaint Lucia is of the view that the issues leading to\nthe isolation of Cuba from the mainstream of economic\nand social development within our hemisphere are\noverdue for re-examination. My delegation calls for the\nspeedy removal of all impediments to Cuba\u2019s ability to\nparticipate within the commonwealth of nations in the\nmanner permitted by the Charter of the United Nations.\n8\n\n\nThe recently concluded agreement between the\nGovernment of the United States of America and the\nGovernment of Cuba on immigration is timely and\nwelcome. My delegation expresses the hope that this\nagreement will open new vistas for further dialogue and\ngreater understanding between the two countries.\nLike other countries of the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM), Saint Lucia shares the vision of hope for\nHaiti. We are proud to be a participant in the United\nNations Mission in Haiti, as we have participated in former\nmeans of assistance to Haiti, and, along with our\nCARICOM counterparts, assisted by the wider international\ncommunity, will work tirelessly for the successful\nimplantation of true democracy in Haiti. The unfolding\nevents of the past few days give added impetus to the\nefforts of the regional and international community to bring\nHaiti towards self-fulfilment within the community of\ndemocratic nations.\nIt has been made clear that the holding of democratic\nelections and the installation of a legitimate Government\ncannot by themselves guarantee democracy, especially in a\ncountry devoid of democratic traditions. To sustain such\ndemocratic beginnings, appropriate structures must be put\nin place, adequately resourced in both human and material\nterms, and suitable support mechanisms must be designed\nand firmly rooted. Above all, there must be the\ninternational will to encourage, facilitate and enrich this\ndemocratic process, as would be exemplified through\nmassive development assistance over a sustained period.\nThe global economic situation is at present at a critical\ncrossroads, reflecting a speedily moving trend towards trade\nliberalization and the need for national economies to\nimprove their own efficiency and competitiveness.\nThe constraints of smallness have continually\nconspired against States like Saint Lucia in terms of its\nability meaningfully to raise its gross domestic product.\nWhile the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\nand its successor organization the World Trade\nOrganization, seem to offer medium- and long-term benefits\nat least to some developed countries, there remains a\nnagging concern among developing countries that certain\nbarriers may still remain, or be created, that would\neffectively militate against the products of developing\ncountries entering the markets of developed countries.\nMy delegation joins with the rest of the developing\nworld in calling upon the developed world, and the major\ninternational institutions, to re-examine their policies and\nemphases, with a view to adopting measures that can\nrealistically assist small developing economies in their\nattempts to keep pace with the dictates of contemporary\neconomic trends.\nOf particular concern must be the consequences of\nthese new developments for small island States such as\nours, whose exposed economies make them vulnerable\nand sensitive to changes that take place elsewhere. Saint\nLucia\u2019s economy, for instance, has already experienced\nthe shock resulting from changes brought about by the\nadvent of the European Union.\nSaint Lucia\u2019s economy is highly dependent on its\nexport of bananas to the European Union and despite new\narrangements put in place to provide limited access\nguarantees for fruit from African, Caribbean and Pacific\nStates (ACP) - and Saint Lucia expresses its appreciation\nto those European States that have been instrumental in\nsecuring these arrangements - the industry in Saint Lucia\nhas experienced a devastating downturn in prices, which\nin turn has been directly responsible for the economic\ndisruption, and its allied social instability, that occurred\nduring the latter part of 1993 and this year, 1994.\nIt is to be regretted that even the limited concessions\nprovided by Europe in discharge of its treaty obligations,\nhave been subjected to a withering attack by forces which\nseem fully prepared to see the economies of small island\nStates, already possessing so little room for flexibility,\nplaced in total jeopardy.\nThat is the experience that urges this delegation\nagain to call the attention of the international community\nto the special circumstances of small island developing\nStates and the need for particular measures to deal with\ntheir peculiar circumstances.\nThe Government of Saint Lucia has been observing\nwith some concern the development of the North\nAmerican Free Trade Association (NAFTA), given the\nserious adverse consequences it will have in the medium\nterm and long term for relatively nascent industries and\nthe micro-economies of our small States. My\nGovernment regrets that United States legislation on\nNAFTA contains no expressed arrangement which takes\ninto account the limits of our industrial base.\nConsequently, the fragility of our economies will only\nworsen, resulting in economic and social discontent.\nIn this regard we appeal to the international\ncommunity for special trade considerations while\n9\n\n\nadjustments are made to meet the international challenges\nthat the world economic environment engenders.\nThe countries of the Caribbean Community, cognizant\nof the rapidly changing economic environment, and the\nurgent need for cooperative effort to adjust, and in some\ncases, survive the challenges ensuing from this change,\nhave undertaken measures to deepen their relations with\ntheir Caribbean neighbours by formally creating the\nAssociation of Caribbean States (ACS), membership of\nwhich encompasses all countries washed by the Caribbean\nSea. We hope the international community will be helpful\nin encouraging this self-help initiative to achieve its full\npotential.\nLast year, at the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, the issue\nof sustainable development was accepted as a major\ncomponent to be included in the development agendas of\ncountries the world over. Arising out of the universal\nblueprint emerging from that Conference is the recognition,\nat last, of the peculiar circumstances of small island\ndeveloping States in their pursuit of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nDesigning development policies and implementing\nprogrammes for small island States such as Saint Lucia\nrequire considerable imagination and ingenuity, as was\nshown by the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held in\nBarbados earlier this year.\nA successful follow-up to that Conference would rely\nheavily on financial resources for the implementation of its\nfindings. My delegation calls upon the international\ncommunity to provide active support to the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, which has been charged with the\nresponsibility for the coordination and implementation of\nthe programme of action.\nOur small island State, Saint Lucia, seems to oscillate\nbetween triumph and disaster. Last year we highlighted our\ntriumphs in the recognition of our two Nobel laureates.\nThis year the disastrous hand of nature in the form of\ntropical storm \\\"Debbie\\\" struck Saint Lucia, dramatically\nemphasizing the vulnerability of small island developing\nStates. Over an 11-hour period, this small 660-square-\nkilometre territory, historically dependent on agriculture,\nmainly bananas, tourism and small-scale manufacturing,\nwas battered by nearly 15 inches of rain, resulting in four\ndeaths by drowning, numerous landslides, and massive\nflooding that destroyed bridges, roads, houses, and 60 per\ncent of the banana crop. Even our international airport\nlay buried temporarily beneath two feet of water and\nmud.\nWith over 50 per cent of the working population of\nSaint Lucia engaged in banana-associated enterprises, and\nwith more than 50 per cent of export earnings derived\nfrom banana exports, destruction of 60 per cent of the\nbanana crop cannot but create serious economic and\nsocial consequences for us. This again underscores the\nvulnerability of small States like ours, and the need for\nthe international community to recognize their special\npeculiarities and needs and to make appropriate provisions\nto facilitate their survival.\nPermit me, on behalf of my Prime Minister, and the\nGovernment and people of Saint Lucia, to express\nprofound thanks and appreciation to the several members\nand agencies of our Organization for their expressions of\nsympathy, concern and support, and, in several cases,\noffers or tangible manifestations of assistance in our time\nof need.\nAs we focus on the milestone of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations and its Charter, we\nshould perceive the ideas that subtend this body as a\ncementing balm that would bring the disparate pieces of\nour shattered globe together in peace, harmony, creativity\nand beauty. The United Nations has over the years been\nparty to the achievement of many political strides towards\ndemocratization and unprecedented levels of cooperation\nbetween nation States.\nThe global situation that necessitated the creation of\nthe United Nations has undergone tremendous changes\nover the last 50 years. Our membership has more than\ndoubled, and, as we continue to witness the emergence of\nnew States, social and economic demands increase,\ncoupled with new, pressing concerns, such as the\nenvironment, women\u2019s rights, children\u2019s rights and good\ngovernance, to name a few. My delegation supports the\ndemand for enhancing the resources of the United Nations\nto enable it to cope with its expanded responsibilities. It\nis also necessary that this Assembly be made more\neffective and efficient in the execution of its functions, so\nthat it can become more responsive to the needs\nparticularly of developing countries, and can assist those\ncountries in their development processes.\nSaint Lucia joins scores of other delegates in calling\nfor an increase in the membership of the Security Council\nto reflect the increase in membership of this Organization\n10\n\n\nand the concept of universality that the Charter advocates.\nIt is also necessary that the Security Council allow for more\nconsultation with the General Assembly in its deliberations\nso that its perspectives may become even more reflective of\nthe world community.\nIn his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 1993, entitled\n\\\"The Antilles, Fragments of an Epic Memory,\\\" Saint\nLucia\u2019s Poet Laureate, Derek Walcott, said:\n\\\"Break a vase and the love that reassembles the\nfragments is stronger than that love which took its\nsymmetry for granted when it was whole.\\\"\nWe see in this idea the touchstone for the United\nNations and the international community as this\nOrganization approaches its anniversary year. We can\nextend this perception to embrace the cracked vases of our\nglobe, in which the horrors of Somalia, the demoralization\nand brutality of Haiti, the carnage of the Anglo-Irish\nconflict and the racial bigotry in other parts of the world\nare all seen as products of the accident of history and the\npoverty of the human spirit. It is hoped that through the\nefforts of the United Nations a renewed humanitarianism\nwill be engendered and bound with a strength that\nguarantees peace and the well-being of the world and its\npeople.\n"

Mr. Insanally fulfilled his mandate very well\nindeed, despite the many difficult tasks the United Nations\nhad to carry out during the past year. My delegation\nwishes Ambassador Insanally well in his future endeavours.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nhas once again demonstrated that he is the right man to\nlead our Organization as it continues to assume greater\nresponsibilities, particularly in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. The Secretary-General\nhas ably led the Organization in responding most\npositively to the many conflict situations that beset the\nworld today. My Government lends its support to his\nconsiderable efforts aimed at assuring international peace\nand security and at promoting economic and social\ndevelopment around the world. We wish him all the best\nin carrying out his arduous tasks.\nAs I address the Assembly today, 30 years after the\nonly time my predecessor did so, I bring with me a\nmessage of renewed hope and friendship from the people\nof a newly democratic Republic of Malawi to all the\npeoples of all the States represented here this morning.\nFreed from fears of itself, Malawi courageously embraces\nthe rest of the family of nations; freed from self-imposed\nisolation, Malawi stands ready to engage actively in\nefforts to find international solutions to the problems of\nour times.\nEveryone here today will be fully aware of the\npolitical changes that have taken place in my country\nduring the past two years. The one-party dictatorship that\nhad ruled Malawi for 30 years came to an ignoble end by\nthe will of the people. In the historic elections held on 17\nMay this year, the people of Malawi threw out an\noppressive Government that had for so long trampled\nupon their human rights and fundamental freedoms with\n\n\nimpunity, through arbitrary arrests, detentions without trial,\nand torture, a Government that brutally suppressed all\npolitical dissent and denied its people any form of freedom\nof expression and association. In so doing, it sought to rob\nits people of the very essence of a human being: the ability\nto think. The people of Malawi rejoin the family of nations\ntoday as a free people.\nLet me assure the Assembly that the Malawian people\nshall never allow any form of dictatorship to rear its ugly\nhead on their soil again.\nThe national referendum held in June 1993 and the\npresidential and parliamentary elections held in May this\nyear took place in a peaceful manner, and have both been\ndeclared by the international community to have been free\nand fair. This outcome was a clear manifestation of the\nardent desire of the people of Malawi to see change\nbrought about in their country: positive change, where\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms are enjoyed and\nrespected by all, individually and collectively.\nThe changes in Malawi resulted also from the\nconcerted efforts and assistance of the international\ncommunity. On behalf of the Government and the people\nof Malawi, I wish particularly to thank the United Nations\nfor its special role in the process of reform and\ndemocratization in Malawi. The Electoral Assistance\nDivision of the Secretariat here in New York, the Centre\nfor Human Rights in Geneva and the office of the United\nNations Development Programme in Malawi all worked\ntirelessly to help us set up the necessary institutional\nframework for bringing about the desired political change.\nLet me also thank the Commonwealth Secretariat, the\nOrganization of African Unity, the friendly Governments\nand the non-governmental organizations that were involved\nin our transition process for the invaluable assistance they\ntoo rendered to Malawi during this very critical and delicate\nstage of our nation\u2019s evolution. It is my sincere hope that\nour partners in the democratic transition will consider ways\nin which they can continue to work with the Malawian\npeople as they confront the many serious problems arising\nfrom the excesses and vagaries of the discredited order they\nrecently overturned.\nMy Government is committed to consolidating peace,\ndemocracy and the rule of law in Malawi. We have\nemphasized that our struggle was not about personalities or\nindividual leaders, but rather about changing the political\nway of life. It has always been the desire of the\nGovernment to work constructively, together with other\nparties, for the benefit of the nation. It is therefore\npleasing that recently the Government and one of the\nopposition parties, the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD),\nreached an agreement that facilitated the appointment to\nthe Cabinet of some AFORD members, including\nMr. Chakufwa Chihana, President of AFORD.\nMy Government has refrained from any form of\nwitch-hunting or revenge against members of the former\nregime. No one in Malawi need ever fear for his life or\nliberty simply because he holds differing political views\nor beliefs. In this context, my Government will guarantee\nall persons accused of wrongdoing the opportunity to be\nheard in an open court of law.\nWe have at the same time expressed our desire to\nsee established in Malawi a culture of respect for human\nrights. In this regard, my Government has, among other\nthings, recently signed with the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Ayala Lasso, who\nvisited us in August, a Joint Declaration on the Mutual\nDesire to Cooperate in the Development of Programmes\nfor the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in\nMalawi. Education in Human Rights has thus a\nprominent place in the programmes that are envisaged.\nThis is because my Government firmly believes that the\nrule of law in Malawi can be consolidated if the people\nknow and understand what their rights are.\nBasic human rights and fundamental freedoms\ncannot however be meaningfully enjoyed where people\nare living in conditions of economic desperation. The\nmajority of the people of Malawi live in extreme poverty.\nIt is for this reason, therefore, that poverty alleviation has\nbeen given top priority on my Government\u2019s agenda. The\nfocus on the alleviation of poverty is intended to help\nconsolidate the freedom and democracy that Malawians\ncurrently enjoy.\nIt is common knowledge that, out of a total in 1994\nof 173 countries, Malawi is number 15 from the bottom\non the scale of United Nations Development Programme\nhuman development indicators. This reflects our\nextremely low ratings in socio-economic indicators,\ncovering areas such as health, social welfare, education,\nhousing, food and nutrition. Malawi\u2019s external debt is\nalso quite high. At the end of June 1994, the external\ndebt stock stood at $1.9 billion. Malawi\u2019s balance of\npayments position is precarious. Its commodity terms of\ntrade are deteriorating and are currently estimated at\n72.3 per cent.\n2\n\n\nMeanwhile, Malawi continues to suffer from the\neffects of the severe drought of 1992-1993, which afflicted\nthe whole of southern Africa. The country is once again\nexperiencing serious food shortages, owing primarily to\nvery poor rains in the 1993-1994 season. The country\nurgently needs nearly 400,000 metric tons of grain, mainly\nmaize, if it is to avert mass starvation and death among the\npeople.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has also adversely affected\nmy country. The ones hardest hit by this scourge are the\nyoung and most productive segment of the population. The\nresources which my Government is able to allocate, in its\nnational budget, for dealing with this problem are far from\nadequate: it wishes it could do more.\nMalawi continues to suffer also from the after-effects\nof the influx of refugees of recent years. The number of\nrefugees from neighboring Mozambique, which once\ntotalled over a million people, has now been reduced to\nnearly a quarter of a million. But it will take years,\nprobably decades, to deal with the full impact of such large\nnumbers. Many sectors of the economy, such as health,\neducation, the basic infrastructure and the environment,\nhave been adversely affected, with grave implications for\nthe already serious poverty in the country.\nIt is thus quite clear that fulfillment of the\nGovernment\u2019s policy for the alleviation of poverty will be\na major challenge indeed. The task ahead is enormous.\nMany sacrifices will have to be made. My Government is,\nhowever, determined to meet the challenges head-on. We\nhave to try in order to succeed. In this context, my\nGovernment is working out a programme of poverty\nalleviation that will be flexible and implementable, and\nwhich can benefit from tangible and active assistance from\nthe donor community. A Presidential Council on Poverty\nAlleviation, under my chairmanship, has been established\nto advise the Government on the actual implementation of\nthe programmes envisaged. It is the Government\u2019s\nintention that people in the rural areas should be the main\nbeneficiaries of the poverty alleviation programmes.\nThe programmes will also give special attention to the\nsituation of children. Malawi is a party to the Convention\non the Rights of the Child. It is the intention of the new\ngovernment to translate the provisions of the Convention\ninto reality for every child. The first step was the\nintroduction, last month, of free primary education. To\ndate, there are 3.2 million children in school \u2014 an increase\nof 1.3 million from last year. This truly is a children\u2019s\neducational revolution.\nMy Government is conscious of the need to\nempower women so that they can become active in all\nsectors of the economy and so that discrimination against\nwomen and girls may become a thing of the past. Efforts\nare under way to close the gender gap in primary and\nhigher education and to ensure the participation of women\nin decision-making. We look forward to participating in\nthe United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women\nin Beijing in 1995.\nAllow me at this juncture, on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Malawi, to thank, most\nsincerely, the United Nations system, donor Governments\nand agencies, and our many other partners in development\nfor the invaluable assistance that they have given to\nMalawi since it attained independence. I have broadly\noutlined the problems and challenges that Malawi faces.\nI am very confident that our partners in development will\ncontinue to assist us as we forge ahead in our efforts to\nimprove the standard of living of our people. I wish to\nappeal specifically for donor sympathy to write off\nexisting loans made to the Malawi Government.\nI wish to assure you, Mr. President, that any\nassistance that is given to Malawi will be used for the\npurpose and target groups intended. The democratically\nelected Government should be given the chance to make\ndemocracy work. I also invite the private and public\nsectors to come and invest in Malawi. The investment\nclimate in Malawi is very favourable, and opportunities\nexist in such areas as tourism, mining, finance and\nbanking, and distribution.\nMalawi welcomes the efforts to redefine the role of\nthe United Nations in matters pertaining to development.\nIn this context, the report (A/48/935) of the Secretary-\nGeneral, \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d, is, in our view,\nvery timely indeed. The priority areas for development\noutlined in the report deserve the political commitment,\nactive support and tangible assistance of the international\nfinancial and donor community. The key and persistent\nproblem areas of concern \u2014 external debt and debt\nservicing, poor access to science and technology for\ndevelopment, inadequate financial flows, rapid population\ngrowth, and problems relating to women and to social\ndevelopment \u2014 need to be tackled head-on. Africa is\nparticularly afflicted by these problems and deserves\nfocused attention.\nThe crisis situation facing Africa calls for urgent and\nimportant measures, such as those outlined in the United\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\n3\n\n\nthe 1990s, which has yet to be implemented. These\nmeasures, as augmented by the conclusion of the Tokyo\nConference on African Development, should be given\nactive support. Malawi regards the recommended priorities\nfor development in the Agenda for Development and the\nProgramme of Action outlined in the New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa as being complementary and critical\nto the development of Africa. Malawi is all the more\ninterested in these developments because they are exactly\nin line with the poverty-alleviation strategies that it has set\nfor itself.\nMany positive political developments have taken place\nin Africa in recent times. The current wave of\ndemocratization has reached many parts of the continent,\nincluding the southern Africa region, and apartheid has\nbeen buried. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate\nthe people of South Africa on their first truly democratic\ngeneral elections, held in April this year, which ushered in\nthe multiracial Government led by His Excellency Mr.\nNelson Mandela. The present Malawi Government is\npleased that South Africa has finally and proudly resumed\nits seat in the General Assembly and in all the other bodies\nof the United Nations, as a free country.\nThe people of Malawi have close social, cultural,\neconomic and other relations with the people of\nMozambique; thus their joy is our joy and their sorrow is\nour sorrow. We are one people. We therefore welcome\nwholeheartedly the fact that the General Peace Agreement\nis so far being implemented satisfactorily. And as\nMozambique moves closer to its first multi-party general\nelections later this month, it is our firm belief that the\nsuccessful installation of a newly elected Government in\nthat country will be a major accomplishment for the\ninternational community and southern Africa, in general,\nand for the Mozambican people, in particular. Such an\noutcome will give the people of Mozambique the\nopportunity to rebuild their country and truly embark on\ndevelopment after many years of vicious civil war. We\nwish the people of Mozambique every success as they draw\nnearer to the election date.\nThe success of the peace process in Angola would be\ncause for great jubilation and satisfaction for my\nGovernment and the people of Malawi. For too long the\npeople of Angola have been denied peace. They deserve to\nlive in honour and dignity. They have a right to a peaceful\npresent and a hopeful future. Peace in Angola would also\nbe of benefit to the entire southern African region.\nSouthern Africa requires peace, security and political\nstability to enable it to harness and direct its vast human\nand natural resources towards economic growth and\nsustainable development.\nWe are thus encouraged by the indications of some\nprogress in the peace talks that have been going on in\nLusaka, Zambia, under the auspices of the United\nNations. We fervently look forward to the conclusion of\na mutually agreed final resolution to the longstanding\npolitical deadlock and armed conflict in Angola.\nThe peaceful resolution of conflicts in other parts of\nAfrica would give us in Malawi equal joy and comfort.\nThus, for example, the situation in Rwanda has been a\nsource of great concern to my country. We are, however,\ngratified that the horrible carnage we saw in Rwanda\nrecently has since come to an end and that the cholera\nepidemic and the outbreak of dysentery in the refugee\ncamps in eastern Zaire have now been brought under\ncontrol. My Government is pleased to have made a\nmodest troop contribution to the United Nations\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). In this\nconnection, let me most sincerely thank the Belgian\nGovernment for providing the Malawi troop contingent in\nUNAMIR with logistical and other support.\nThe task of the international community in Rwanda\ngoes beyond humanitarian assistance. The world must, in\nthe short term, undertake to assist Rwanda in the process\nof political settlement based on national reconciliation. In\nthe long term, however, the major challenge for the\ninternational community and the people of Rwanda\nthemselves is to find ways and means to resolve\npermanently the issues that breed and nurture the kind of\nintense ethnic fears and suspicion that have resulted\nduring the past quarter of a century alone in over four\nwaves of blood-letting, which seem to grow more\nhorrendous on each successive occasion.\nMy Government wishes to record here its support for\nthe courageous efforts exerted by the people of Burundi\nto avert a similar situation to that which has consumed\nneighbouring Rwanda. It has been slow and painfully\nfrustrating, but we believe that by having resorted to the\nnegotiating table, and not to arms, the people of Burundi\nhave taken the first step towards finding a lasting solution\nthat will ultimately secure permanent peace for their\ncountry. We wish them well in this noble endeavour.\nMy Government is greatly concerned at the apparent\nlack of a decisive response from the international\ncommunity to the pitiful situations in Liberia and\nSomalia. We are also saddened by the fact that\n4\n\n\ninflexibility and dogmatism seem once again to have\nbrought to naught months of painstaking effort in the search\nfor a solution to the problems of Sudan. Our sincere hope\nis that the latest set-back will not lead to abandonment of\nthe Sudan situation by the international community.\nMy Government has followed closely the situation in\nWestern Sahara. While the General Assembly has been\nseized of the situation in that Territory, we note with much\nconcern that real interest in this issue appears to diminish\nevery year. It seems that the Assembly has begun routinely\nto adopt resolutions that, in fact, are leading directly to\ninternational acquiescence in the status quo. We therefore\ncall upon the international community, and in particular the\nUnited Nations, to live up to its responsibilities and fulfil\nits promise to the Sahouri people by acting without any\nfurther delay to hold the long-awaited referendum on that\nTerritory\u2019s political future.\nMy Government has followed with equally keen\ninterest developments in other regions of the world. We\nhave been encouraged by the quickened tempo of the peace\nprocess in the Middle East, as well as by the flame of hope,\nalbeit flickering, kindled by the first serious dialogue\nbetween the parties to the political deadlock over the\nKorean Peninsula. It is my Government\u2019s hope that the\ndialogue that has been going on between the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan\nwill lead to a solution that is mutually satisfactory to the\nparties concerned.\nAt the same time, we have been deeply grieved by the\nsituation in the former Yugoslavia, where some, with a\nseemingly perverted sense of fair play, would have us\nbelieve that if the victimized are prevented from defending\nthemselves against the aggressors the conflict there can\nmore quickly be brought to an end.\nRecently delegations from the United States and Cuba\nmet in this historic city and, through negotiations unfettered\nby preconditions, were able to reach a mutually agreeable\nsolution to a dispute that had heightened tension between\nthe two countries. We believe that, through a similar\napproach, these two neighbouring countries could also\nresolve such differences as have divided them for nearly\n40 years. Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and\nafter the cold war was declared over, we can see no reason\nwhy these two great nations should not sheathe their cold-\nwar sabres and embrace each other for the sake of peace\nand progress in their region. My Government therefore\neagerly looks forward to the day when it can join the world\nin applauding the resumption of normal and friendly\nrelations between Cuba and the United States.\nThe founders of the United Nations set forth\nprinciples that have stood the test of time. The validity\nof the purposes of the Organization cannot be denied,\neven today. Malawi believes in the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations. In our view, this\nOrganization, with all its shortcomings, still represents a\nviable option for addressing the many political,\nsocio-economic and other issues that confront our world\ntoday. Working through the United Nations, we can all\nmake our world a better place.\nThe year 2000 is just six years away. Let us all\nwork together to make the twenty-first century one in\nwhich respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\nand respect for the rule of law are the rule and not the\nexception. Let us work together to emancipate our people\nfrom the socio-economic and other ills that hold them in\nbondage to misery in their daily lives. Let us work\ntogether to avert the escalation of conflict situations. The\npeaceful settlement of disputes remains one of the\ncardinal principles of this Organization and of\ninternational law. Let us make mediation a priority \u2014\nmediation at any stage of a conflict. But, better still, let\nus use this Organization to find ways to reduce, if not to\neliminate, the causes of conflict situations; to reduce, if\nnot to eliminate, the means by which conflicts are fuelled\nand perpetrated. In making these humble suggestions, we\nare inspired by the preamble to the Charter.\nOn the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption\nof the United Nations Charter, let us resolve to make the\nOrganization even more relevant for the next 50 years.\nLet us work to strengthen the United Nations. Let us\nmake the organs of the Organization more effective,\ntransparent and accountable. In this regard, we support\nthe current efforts to reform the Security Council,\nprovided that such reform is not at the expense of\neffectiveness.\nLet us all work together to rationalize the work\nprogrammes of the United Nations. Let the agenda of our\nOrganization reflect the priorities of our time.\nThe people of Malawi have embraced democracy\nand the rule of law, and they look forward to\nconsolidating their recovered freedom. At a time when\nglobal interdependence has become a reality, the people\nof Malawi look optimistically towards a reform of this\nOrganization that will ensure that it can more effectively\n5\n\n\nplay its role in international efforts to achieve security and\neconomic prosperity for all the peoples of the world.\n"

        "file_name": "GAB_49_1994.txt",
        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by conveying to the President, on my own behalf and on that of the Gabonese delegation, warm and brotherly congratulations on his noteworthy election to the presidency of the Assembly. His great experience in international affairs, along with his outstanding intellectual and moral qualities, are for us a guarantee that his presidency will stamp the work of the General Assembly with renewed dynamism.\nWe wish to express to his predecessor, Mr. Samuel Rudolph Insanally of Guyana, our satisfaction at his decisive actions in the course of the forty-eighth session.\nI would also like to reiterate our appreciation and support for Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose competence, rigour and effectiveness in the service of the Organization are well established.\nThe end of East-West antagonism foreshadowed unexpected horizons of peace and a bright tomorrow. Very quickly, however, the emergence of all kinds of extremism radically changed this picture of the future.\nToday the international community is divided between the hope of settling age-old conflicts, concern over the persistence of contemporary conflicts, and preoccupation over the emergence in some places of civil wars born of ethnic or religious tensions. While the risks, directly or indirectly linked to the cold war, of world-wide conflict have faded, armed conflicts continue to sow death and destruction.\nThe resolution of the Cambodian conflict, the continuation of the Middle East peace process, the favourable progress of the conflict pitting Israel against its neighbours, the settlement of the border conflict between Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and, above all, the abolition of apartheid in South Africa - to cite only a few examples - give us good reason to be pleased.\nGabon has followed most attentively the current positive developments in the situation in the Middle East. We encourage the parties concerned to hold on to their gains and to pursue the peace process under way until the agreements reached are fully implemented.\nWith regard to Cambodia, we appeal to all the parties involved to work for the consolidation of national unity and democratic institutions.\nFinally, for the first time in several decades, apartheid is not to be found on our agenda. This historic turn of events is the result, first and foremost, of the sacrifices of the South African people themselves and, then again, of the efforts of the international community as a whole. Gabon hails the return of a united, democratic and non-racial South Africa to the concert of free nations.\nFor the settlement of these conflicts we are indebted primarily to our world Organization, which, free of the burdens of the cold war, seems to have recovered the dynamism that inspired the San Francisco Charter.\nIn this context, the end of the border conflict that for years turned Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya against each other is an outstanding example of the merits of settling disputes peacefully. The parties to that conflict have abided on all counts by the opinion of the International Court of Justice.\nMy satisfaction is even greater because of President Omar Bongo's assumption of the chairmanship of the Ad Hoc Committee that was established in 1977 by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its fourteenth summit meeting and that is intended to provide a political settlement of that conflict. May this example serve to inspire the many States involved in conflicts to come into harmony with the spirit of the Charter of our Organization.\nThese reasons for hope notwithstanding, in Africa and in Eastern Europe there are real reasons for concern with regard to the prospects for peace and stability in the world.\nWith regard to Africa, partial and contradictory analyses aside, we must recognize that the peace and security of our continent are seriously threatened by civil wars and inter-ethnic conflicts.\nIn Somalia there is no event or initiative that allows us to look to the future with optimism. Quite the contrary: thanks to the ruthlessness of the belligerents, the international community is becoming discouraged and the conflict is becoming entrenched. This is why the Gabonese Government urges the various factions to speed up the process of national reconciliation on the basis of the Addis Ababa Agreements.\nThe conflict that has been tearing Liberia apart for so many years is still continuing relentlessly, showing hopes for peace to be illusory, hopes that were nurtured by the Agreements signed in Cotonou in July 1993 under the aegis of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). We would venture to hope that the recent Akossombo agreement, signed in Ghana, the eleventh of its kind, will lead to a lasting settlement of the conflict.\nThoughts of these zones of conflict lead me now to pay a tribute, on behalf of my country, to the Angolan Government for its determination to pursue negotiation. Gabon encourages the efforts to restore peace in Angola, in accordance with the peace Agreements concluded to date and with Security Council resolutions 864 (1993) and 932 (1994). Here we appeal to UNITA to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the Lusaka talks to put an end to this war that has been casting a pall over Angola for almost 20 years now.\nOn Rwanda, I reiterate the appeal of the Government of Gabon to all the sons and daughters of that country to adopt a spirit of tolerance, harmony and renewed peace and begin at last to work towards the same goal: the reconstruction of their battered, devastated country. In that context, Gabon has not failed to express its support for the humanitarian activities undertaken by the United Nations through the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), by France through its Operation Turquoise, and by many non-governmental organizations. My country has also called for more effective and persistent participation by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations in the peace process aimed at putting an end to the tragedy.\nHaving hailed the welcome initiatives of non-governmental organizations and of Gabonese citizens to ease the suffering of our brethren in Rwanda, my Government has decided, first, to make a voluntary contribution - the funds for which have been released - to the United Nations Special Fund for Rwanda. Secondly, it will provide assistance to the afflicted populations, principally in the form of food products, clothing and medicine, which my Government is committed to sending to Kigali by its own means. The \\\"air-bridge\\\" for that purpose opened on 18 September 1994, when we delivered the initial portion of this aid to the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Rwanda. Thirdly, if the need arises, we shall take in Rwandese orphans, in collaboration with international organizations such as the United Nations Children's Fund and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nIn eastern Europe, the horror continues in Bosnia and Herzegovina; the negative result of the recent referendum is not likely to allow the speedy settlement of this conflict, which has gone on far too long. Here again, Gabon appeals to the parties to the conflict to bring peace to their region.\nThese tragedies have put the Organization to a harsh test. But, despite the uncertainty of the post-cold-war period, the United Nations remains a priority forum for creating and nurturing the collective search for peace. To do this, the passivity displayed by nearly all participants in international life must be replaced by a determination to take preventive action. In that connection, the Agenda for\nPeace outlines the action that needs to be taken to avert, as quickly as possible, situations that could give rise to conflicts, particularly action in the framework of preventive diplomacy.\nFor its part, Africa has not been idle in this sphere. Indeed, our major concern is reflected in the creation by the OAU of machinery for the prevention, management and settlement of conflicts. In the same spirit, the States of central Africa have established a permanent mechanism dealing with questions of security in central Africa, with a mandate to promote confidence-building measures among member States in line with the principles of the Charter.\nThe agreement on a non-aggression pact at the September 1993 Libreville meeting, the signing ceremony for which has just taken place in Yaounde, Cameroon, attests eloquently to the dedication of our States to the values of peace and solidarity. But to be more effective operationally, and to play an active role in the decentralization of peace-keeping operations, this machinery should benefit from logistical and technical assistance from the United Nations.\nTo take due account of the new international political landscape I have described, the desired developments must be multidimensional, dealing not only with the structure of the United Nations, but also with its activities. I am pleased to note that there have been various initiatives to that end, including the vast process of restructuring the principal organs, which was begun two years ago. This has been reflected in such things as the beginnings of a debate on the reform of the Security Council, with a view to enlarging its membership and ensuring equitable representation of Member States. Gabon is in favour of such reform.\nIt is agreed today that international peace and security are no longer limited to political and military considerations, but that they encompass such diverse areas as the economic, social, humanitarian and environmental spheres. We think the time has come for this vision, which accords with the Charter, to be reflected in reality. To be sure, since the founding of the United Nations mankind has made major economic, scientific and technological progress. But, despite these notable advances, some parts of the world continue to live in poverty and destitution.\nFor Africa, the United Nations has set up two successive programmes: the United Nations Programme for African Economic Recovery and Development, and the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. Both were intended to contribute to the continent's sustained economic growth.\nWhile the African States have fulfilled their obligations under these programmes, we have to say that the industrialized countries have failed to honour their commitments. It is also regrettable that the Rio Summit on environment and development, which had given rise to new hope and which for the first time had incorporated the concept of sustainable development, is suffering from a glaring lack of international support. Our expectations are not being met with respect to the financing needed to implement Agenda 21.\nThe Agenda for Development proposed by the Secretary-General should fill these gaps once the international community realizes the interdependence of our interests. I want to reaffirm Gabon's commitment to the major principles in that Agenda: peace, the foundation of development; the economy, the engine of progress; the environment, a basis for sustainability; social justice, a pillar of society; and democracy, the model of good governance. Yet beyond those principles we must study ways and means to implement the Agenda for Development, scrupulously taking into account the major concerns of the African continent.\nIn any event, for the countries of the South, the success of existing or future machinery for cooperation will depend on the role reserved for development activities and for the reduction of inequity. Here, the new World Trade Organization, which from January 1995 will replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will have to respond to the needs arising from differences in the level of development of the rich countries and of the less-well-off countries.\nAfter 30 years of independence, we must observe that African States do not always have the means to satisfy their peoples' health, educational and cultural concerns. Numerous factors contribute to keeping our countries in the spiral of underdevelopment. The first is that our countries are unable to process the commodities they produce or set their prices. This leads to a drastic deterioration of the terms of trade, because the prices of raw materials are not indexed to those of the finished products.\nMoreover, the external debt and the cost of servicing it are a serious obstacle to the development of African countries, as is clear from the ratio of debt to exports of goods and services for Africa as a whole. Gabon, too, is affected by this situation, and for several years has been engaging in structural adjustment programmes. These programmes have not always yielded the expected results, especially since our economy is marked by, inter alia, excessive dependence on the outside world and by growing public and private debt.\nIn this context, on 12 January 1994, there was a 50 per cent devaluation of the parity of the currency of the African States of the franc zone compared to that of the French franc. At the time of the devaluation all the African countries of the franc zone were given equal treatment, but today discrimination between those States is being exercised. Gabon thus remains the only country which, because of its intermediate revenues, is refused access to the loan windows in flexible conditions, on the pretext that its per capita gross national product is too high.\nIt is true that devaluation could have some positive aspects, including a relaunching of investment, more competitive exports, a revitalization of the agricultural sector and a reduction of imports. But we believe that it is necessary, indeed urgent, to receive assistance in order to establish new machinery to help the most disadvantaged and the most vulnerable persons.\nOur common destiny and international solidarity should prompt us to transcend our differences and give priority only to meeting the needs and ensuring the well- being of mankind. The interdependence that flows from this dictates that the industrialized countries, with their technological know-how and financial resources, should support the efforts of the weakest and most disadvantaged to participate in the establishment of this new global economy.\nThese days, States are confronted with trans-border scourges which individually they are incapable of stemming. That is true of the phenomenon of increasing flows of refugees and illegal immigrants, the illegal drug trade, malaria and the AIDS pandemic. Joint and coordinated international action is required to attack the roots of these evils.\nIt is the custom today for everyone to emphasize the importance of the trilogy of democracy, development and human rights. In that respect - and specifically concerning democracy - Gabon, which was one of the very first African countries to return to political pluralism, has been making an effort for several years now to establish new institutions adapted to democratic rules and to promote the emergence of a genuine state of law. But we are aware that time is needed to achieve this.\nIn this framework, recently, in the presence of international observers, negotiations were held between representatives of the Opposition and representatives of the Government to seek ways and means to establish democracy by consensus - the sole guarantee of peace and social cohesion.\nUnquestionably, the founding fathers of the United Nations wished it above all to respond positively to the questions the peoples were asking about the best way to organize international life. The statement of purposes and principles within the very first provisions of the Charter eloquently attests to this. Hence it is up to the United Nations system and Member States to ensure that at each session the General Assembly takes a decisive step towards the attainment of these purposes and principles that we hold so dear. I hope that this will be done at the forty-ninth session.\n"

        "file_text": "Your election,\nSir, to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the\nAssembly marks an important moment for your country,\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and for the entire African continent. I have\nthe honour to convey to you the warmest wishes of the\npeople and Government of Andorra. I also take this\nopportunity to express appreciation of the great\naccomplishments of your predecessor, Ambassador\nInsanally.\n7\n\n\nI am speaking before you here only a few hours\nbefore the official opening of the Permanent Mission of the\nPrincipality of Andorra to the United Nations, the first\ndiplomatic Mission of Andorra anywhere in the world.\nThis Permanent Mission is the embodiment of the will of\nthe Andorran people to participate actively in the\nimplementation of the ideals of the United Nations Charter.\nOn the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding\nof this Organization, our Mission will work towards the\nachievement of important goals. For one thing, it will\nmake careful preparation for the World Summit on Social\nDevelopment to be held in Copenhagen. The objectives of\nthat Summit - namely, to find ways to reduce poverty,\nenhance employment opportunities and strengthen social\nintegration - are particularly important in relation to the\nnew possibilities for development under consideration by\nthe Secretary-General in his \\\"Agenda for Development\\\".\nFor another thing, Andorra will take part, with the greatest\ninterest, in the work of the Third Committee, whose\nactivities support our historic devotion to respect for human\nrights. I wish also to take this opportunity to acknowledge\nthe commendable work of the new United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Ambassador Ayala Lasso.\nAs president of the United States, John Fitzgerald\nKennedy stood before the Berlin Wall and pronounced that\nfamous phrase, \\\"Ich bin ein Berliner\\\" (\\\"I am a Berliner\\\").\nAnd for people everywhere in the world who listened to\nhim on that historic occasion, the word \\\"Berliner\\\" was\nunderstood to mean \\\"a defender of freedom\\\".\nFor those countries whose culture expresses itself in\nthe Catalan language, a similar moment has become equally\nhistoric. I speak of the day when the distinguished\nmusician and universally recognized artist Paul \\\"Pablo\\\"\nCasals boldly affirmed, here at the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations, before Secretary-General U Thant: \\\"I am\nCatalan\\\". Everyone understood immediately that, with\nthese words, he was beginning a song of liberty and\ndeclaring himself to be the son of a people filled with\nrespect for others, a people who had created one of the\noldest parliamentary and democratic systems in the world,\nas he stated in his dedication to the cause of peace. Let us\nremember that the hymn of the United Nations, the Hymn\nto Peace, is his work, and that it was played for the first\ntime, with lyrics by the poet W. H. Auden, on\n27 October 1971.\nAllow me today to humbly join two such important\nand respected figures and proclaim, in the same spirit and\nwith the same passion, \\\"I am an Andorran\\\". And I hope\nthat this expression will have the same meaning for you\nas the earlier assertions, and not seem to be a childish and\nself-centred show of pride, for throughout the centuries\nour ancient and small State has always demonstrated its\nlove of freedom, its will to contribute to balance and\nharmony, and its concern to maintain peace.\nIt has been a little more than a year since Andorra\nbecame a Member of the United Nations, following the\napproval of our Constitution and the full adaptation of our\nmodel of statehood to that befitting a State under modern\nlaw. Because of this, and because of the fact that we are\nthe last of the four small, historically independent\nEuropean States - the others being Liechtenstein, San\nMarino and Monaco - to have become Members of the\nUnited Nations, it seems that this is an appropriate\noccasion on which to reflect on the possible contributions\nof micro-States to the family of nations.\nIt is evident that in a world in which great\noperations must be performed on a grand scale, the\nsimple fact of our existence might appear anachronistic or\nirrelevant. Indeed, at a time when the establishment of\nthe World Trade Organization points towards the end of\nprotectionism, and the North American Free Trade\nAgreement, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\nCouncil, and the European Union herald the creation of\nlarge areas in which there is free circulation of goods and\nservices, one might well question the need for the\ncontinued existence of a number of small States which\noften find themselves surrounded, as in our case, by large\nsupranational entities such as the European Union.\nYet I believe that as we move towards integration,\nit becomes more than ever necessary to respect and\npreserve the identities of micro-States. It is clear that\nthese identities are not measured in terms of size, nor do\nthey allow for the subordination of a minority within a\nmajority, of a smaller collective identity within another\nthat is demographically larger.\nAs democracy consists of government by the\nmajority and the respect of minorities, on the international\nstage the politics of large blocs and of great Powers must\nbe compatible with the recognition of groups which,\nthough smaller, must not be relegated in any way to a\nstatus that is discriminatory nor must they be considered\nless than what they are.\nIt is evident that all small States - and probably a\nquarter of those represented here are small States in one\nway or another - have clear limitations. It is evident also\n8\n\n\nthat the contribution of great Powers to the establishment\nand the preservation of world order is, and must be,\ndecisive. But it is also true that, beyond their limitations,\nsmall States have qualities that humanity cannot do without,\nespecially at the present time when many peace and\nreconciliation processes have not been resolved and remain\nin need of great generosity, comprehension, tolerance and\na will to compromise.\nBy their very nature, micro-States must, in an intrinsic\nand essential way, have respect for diversity and mutual\nharmony. Precisely because of their small size, they have\nlearned in the long course of history that durable solutions\ncannot be imposed, and that the core of the differences\ncannot be eliminated. More powerful States can gain useful\nknowledge from their experience, built upon a wisdom that\nonly centuries can provide. This is even more pertinent\ntoday, when the great Powers have begun to show a certain\nself-restraint, having discovered that while the use of force\nmight postpone a conflict, it cannot be the basis for a\nlasting solution. May the great Powers of the world be\nguided by the rules of conduct that micro-States have been\ncompelled to adopt, and may the necessity of the small be\nthe virtue of the large. To propose rather than impose, to\nnegotiate rather than to compel, to discuss rather than\ndictate, to reconcile rather than radicalize, to respect rather\nthan humiliate, to cooperate rather than exploit, and to\nrefrain rather than abuse: those are the rules of conduct\ndear to the small States, characteristics which appear to be\nincreasingly necessary in many regions of our planet, if\nwhat we want is for the people of the world to live together\nin dignity and fight together against hunger, poverty,\ndisease and the negative effects of the demographic\nexplosion.\nIt is for this reason, that I venture to call the attention\nof the members of the Assembly to the virtues of the\nmicro-States and to ask them to consider whether they\nmight not make them their own. It is simply a question of\nthe great nations making an imaginative effort to put\nthemselves in the place of those who possess neither\nmilitary power nor human and economic resources to\nimpose on others, and consequently to realize that problems\nmay be approached in another way, with probably better\nguarantees for a successful outcome.\nThis approach finds its origin in the strictest respect\nfor the identity of others, of their collective personality and\nall the features that contribute to it, as well as their culture;\nfor culture is always an element of integration. And it is\nprecisely the balance of cultures and their interaction which\nis the basis for peaceful coexistence, which is in itself\nconsiderable, and even more for a cordial and fraternal\nlife together. Let us therefore forget the worries of\nassimilation and the belief in the superiority of the\nmajority, and let us try to organize life together with\nmutual respect, something that becomes increasingly\nimportant in a world under great pressure from\ndemographic change and immigration.\nAllow me to refer to my country, the Principality of\nAndorra, which with a population of only 61,000\ninhabitants has three different educational systems -\nAndorran, French, and Spanish - three quarters of its\npopulation being immigrants, and a small territory stuck\nlike an island in the middle of the European Union. And\nI believe that a study of some of the balances that exist in\nAndorra might be useful to efforts in southern Africa, in\nthe Middle East, or in other parts of Europe and the\nworld where people are struggling to bring about peace.\nThink, likewise, of the great worries of our times,\nwhere the drug trafficking and organized crime have led\nto a dramatic deterioration in urban safety. Members\nmight agree with me that the affirmation \\\"small is\nbeautiful\\\" might appear excessive, but it nevertheless\nguarantees a level of security far greater than that which\nexists in the enormous urban conurbations of more\ndeveloped countries.\nI should like further to call the Assembly\u2019s attention\nto the urgency of the task of protecting the environment,\nand the defence of nature. Members might agree with me\nthat a smaller territory is much easier to manage,\naccording to environmental criteria, and consequently that\nthere is less chance of environmental abuse. In the same\nway, the scarcity of human resources probably makes us\nmore inclined to consider the problems that we shall\ndiscuss at the World Summit on Social Development in\nCopenhagen, namely, individual problems of marginalized\npeople, of those that cannot follow the competitive\nmajority in the apparent flow of progress, of the disabled,\nthe sick, and, in general, all those in need of solidarity.\nI know that in a forum such as this Christian\nindividualism is just a partial approach to these questions,\nbut I am convinced that, with a translation into other\ncultures or religions, on a small scale it is much easier to\ngive a personal answer to the problems of the many. And\nalso, in general terms, I think that this philosophy is the\none that often inspires solidarity movements, as is the\ncase today in Rwanda, where, for example, the spirit of\ncollective life common to small communities might have\nprevented conflict.\n9\n\n\nIn a world that is increasingly interdependent, and\nincreasingly globalized, I sincerely believe that the\nmicro-States, although indeed small, are not superfluous.\nAnd we can even make useful contributions and be points\nof reference in many cases. Sovereign States are\nincreasingly affected by the sovereignty of others and by\nnecessary international agreements; but freedom, and the\nspirit of solidarity are more important than sovereignties or\nborders.\nI ask the Assembly therefore to consider the possibility\nthat we all make an effort to act like micro-States: we who\nare micro-States, and therefore have no alternative, and\nthose who are not, because they have come to the\nconclusion that this is the way we will all be able, together,\nto contribute more positively to peace, progress and\ncoexistence. And as from the sum of small streams of\nwater the big rivers are born, perhaps from the sum of\nsmall identities and from respect for others and minorities,\nwe may be able to build together a more equitable, a more\nsecure and a more livable world for us, for our children,\nand for generations to come.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure at the outset to extend to you\nas President of the Assembly at its forty-ninth session,\nSir, and to your fraternal country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, my\nsincere congratulations on your election to preside over\nthis momentous international assembly. I should like to\nassure you of the cooperation of my delegation. We are\nconfident that your experience in the affairs of this\nOrganization will enable you to conduct the work of this\nsession with competence and efficiency.\nI should also like to express our appreciation to\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, who conducted the\nproceedings of the last session with great skill.\nIt is also my pleasure to take this opportunity to\nconvey our sincere congratulations to the Republic of\nSouth Africa on regaining its full membership in the\nUnited Nations after its liberation from apartheid, trusting\nthat it will resume its role as active member of the\ninternational community.\nI avail myself of this opportunity as well to mention\nwith appreciation the persistent efforts and tireless drive\nof His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, to enhance the role of the\nUnited Nations in international affairs and to further the\nOrganization\u2019s noble objectives. We also note with\nappreciation his sincere and continuous endeavours in the\nfield of development and international economic\ncooperation, to which the content of his report \u201cAn\nAgenda for Development\u201d bears witness.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s report \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment\u201d prompts us to reflect anew, as we approach\nthe twenty-first century, upon the future of international\n3\n\n\ncooperation in all its aspects. The need for such\nquestioning undoubtedly gains an air of urgency at a time\nwhen the features of the international post-cold war order\nhave yet to take a clearly identifiable shape. As the\ninternational community witnessed profound changes in the\nwake of the 1815 Vienna Conference, the big powers and\nothers met to establish patterns for relationships amongst\nStates within the framework of a global order, to be\nbuttressed by an international consensus. Yet the current\ninternational period, fraught with a host of interlocked\nvariables, is noted for the absence of a similar consensus\nwhereby the features of the new world order could be\nidentified.\nChange is a law of nature. However, the accelerating\npace of change that we witness nowadays is unprecedented;\nit has sent tremors into the otherwise monotonous\nprogression of events and has made the present era a\nhistoric one. It is only by virtue of our understanding of\nhistory as the link between past and present that we are\nable to fathom for even a little while what goes on around\nus.\nWatching the dramatic changes that took place over\nthe past few years, one could detect two dominant yet\ncontradictory trends in the course of those changes. One is\nthe fragmentation that has occurred in certain regions of the\nworld, causing the emergence on the political map of new\nStates on ethnic and cultural bases. The other trend is the\ninclination towards globalization, especially as the new\ntechnology and current communications revolution have\nnarrowed the distances between various parts of the world.\nThe amazing pace and speed of these changes call for new\nvisions so that the present can be managed and the future\u2019s\ndimensions charted.\nThe desirable structure of the global world order\nshould, in our view, rest on the following basic principles.\nFirst, the creation of a new vision for all aspects of\ndevelopment. Second, the development of an\ninternationally agreed-upon mechanism for the maintenance\nof world peace and security. Third, cultural and\ncivilizational interaction among nations.\nComprehensive development is a cornerstone of world\npeace. As the Secretary-General has said in his report,\ndevelopment is a fundamental human right. It is the safety\nvalve for peace. We understand that the concept of\ndevelopment means, basically, the achievement and\nsustaining of socio-economic progress. While some\ndeveloping countries have been able to overcome some of\nthe obstacles to their economic and social development,\nmost of them are still caught in the vicious circle of\neconomic problems. If we look back 25 years to consider\na 1969 study entitled \u201cA Study of the Capacity of the\nUnited Nations Development System\u201d, we are likely to\nrealize how optimistic that study was and, in contrast,\nhow frustrating is the present condition of development in\ndeveloping countries. Hence our conviction that the\nSecretary-General\u2019s \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d and\nhis call for a new vision are an attempt to cast the\ndevelopment process, with all its human and material\ncomplications, in a new form that would meet the basic\nneeds of developing countries.\nWe would like in this connection to welcome the\nforthcoming World Summit for Social Development, to be\nheld in Copenhagen next March. We attach great\nimportance to that summit, as it should have the potential\nto fulfil expectations in the field of social development in\naccordance with the provisions of Article 55 of the\nCharter. The significance of the summit is underlined by\nits programme of work, which addresses three important\nissues: the alleviation of poverty and eradication of need,\nthe creation of employment opportunities and the\npromotion of social integration.\nEconomic growth is a central element of\ncomprehensive development. Although the world\neconomy\u2019s performance has improved, relatively\nspeaking, its growth rate still falls short of the rates of the\n1970s and 1980s. During 1993, the growth of the world\neconomy has not exceeded one percent, nor is it expected\nto grow more than two-and-a-half percent during this\nyear, according to economic projections.\nEconomic problems that plague the world economy\ncontinue to have adverse effects on the economies of\ndeveloping countries \u2014 in particular, on their\ndevelopment process. Those countries are beset by\neconomic problems that are primarily external and are\nmanifested mainly in indebtedness, the decline in the\nprices of commodities including oil, high interest rates,\nthe decline in investments, fluctuation of the rate of\nexchange, scarcity of cash flows and international trade\nbarriers.\nThe world is now in need of an equitable\ninternational economic order that would enable all States,\nsmall and large, to reap the benefits of experience and\ngreat accomplishments in the economic field. In spite of\neconomic disagreements between States, the economic\nsituation will improve with firm political will and the\n4\n\n\ngenuine desire on the part of all States to solve the\neconomic problems of the world today.\nEncouraging signs of change appeared on the horizon\nearly this year with the signing of the final document of the\nUruguay Round in Marrakesh and the establishment of the\nWorld Trade Organization. We hope that the objectives of\nthe said Organization will be translated into concrete reality\nfor the benefit of all humanity. We believe that the terms\nand framework of the Uruguay Round should translate into\naccess to markets and expansion of international trade to\ncover all States. In addition, the World Trade Organization\nshould contribute effectively to the establishment of a non-\ndiscriminatory trade system. Meanwhile, we voice our\nconcern that multilateral conventions concerning the\nliberalization of trade could be thwarted by the use of\nenvironmental issues as a means to raise protectionist taxes\non international trade, with a view to reducing the use of\ncertain commodities in world markets.\nThe second fundamental principle for the world order,\nin our opinion, is the achievement of peace and security\nthroughout the world. It should be based on three basic\nelements: the establishment of a feasible collective-security\nsystem, the peaceful settlement of regional and international\ndisputes and disarmament.\nThe history and experience of the United Nations in\nthe field of international peace and security, which was\noverburdened by the feverish political polarization which\nprevailed during the cold war era, should serve as an\nincentive for the international community to build on the\ncontent of the Charter with a view to developing a globally\nacceptable and supportable mechanism that would be able\nto take firm action, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter\nVII of the Charter, with respect to threats to the peace,\nbreaches of the peace and acts of aggression. It is possible,\nin this respect, to develop a pattern of cooperation between\nthe Security Council and regional organizations in matters\nrelating to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIII\nof the Charter.\nWith regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes, the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposals, as set out in his report \u201cAn\nAgenda for Peace\u201d, should be employed by the international\ncommunity to maintain international peace and security and\nto develop the means whereby the capability of the United\nNations to engage in preventive diplomacy, peacemaking\nand peace-keeping may be strengthened and made more\nefficacious. Preventive diplomacy is undoubtedly an\neffective instrument for preventing the outbreak and\nescalation of hostilities between States that would use or\nthreaten to use force.\nDisarmament is an important requirement for the\nmaintenance of world peace and security. The nightmares\ngenerated by stockpiles of weapons, especially nuclear\nweapons, continue to haunt humanity and to cause great\nanxiety throughout the world in view of the threat that\nsuch weapons pose to the human race and its security. In\nthe wake of the bipolar era, and as an inevitable result of\nthe cold war, the international community has turned its\nattention to the question of disarmament. There is an\nurgent and growing need to put an end to nuclear terror\nand to weapons of mass destruction.\nDuring the past few years many people, in both the\ndeveloping and the developed countries, have demanded\nthat an end be put to the race to acquire nuclear weapons\nand other weapons of mass destruction. Although an\nunderstanding to curb the increase in nuclear stockpiles\nhas been reached as a result of certain concerted efforts,\nthose stockpiles have yet to be adequately reduced.\nIt is regrettable that the world has become\ncapriciously involved in another dilemma of a different\ntype. I refer to the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and related technology through their\nacquisition by illegitimate means. Such arsenals and the\nphenomenon of proliferation must be eliminated if the\ninternational community is to ensure that international\npeace and security may be maintained.\nThe third requirement for the establishment of a new\nworld order is fulfilment of the need of peoples to come\ncloser to each other, to be better acquainted with each\nother through cultural and social interaction with a view\nto reinforcing the noble human values and ideals ordained\nin monotheistic religions. The world is experiencing an\nimportant epochal transformation as communities shift\ntheir focus from individual States to regional groupings,\nsuch as the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of\nthe Gulf and the European Union. This phase is expected\nto lead to another, in which interaction and cohesion\nbetween States and regional groups, with their diverse\ncultures, is enhanced, with the ultimate goal of creating a\nworld that is economically, culturally and intellectually\ninterrelated.\nThe profound apprehension, in terms of history and\ncivilization, of man\u2019s crisis in modern times leads to the\nconviction that enlightened dialogue sows the seeds of\ncooperation and association between the various nations\n5\n\n\nand races that yearn for security, tranquillity and stability,\neven if they are at variance in their cultures and in their\noutlook in respect of the human being, life and the\nuniverse. The polemics to which the final document of the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development in\nCairo have given rise are evidence of that variance. This\nreality underlines the need for dialogue, especially since we\nare at the threshold of the twenty-first century.\nThe significance of the Cairo Conference was due to\nthe crucial human-life-related issues that it addressed, such\nas the family and family planning, productive health, the\nrelationship between the environment and inhabitants and\nother issues that concern countries, both rich and poor.\nBahrain, which participated in that Conference, has\nendorsed such provisions of the Final Document as are\nconsonant with the magnanimous Islamic law, our social\nvalues and our national legislation.\nThe Middle East is one of the regions that have\nexperienced particularly severe and bloody wars and\nhostilities. The longest of these was the Arab-Israeli\nconflict, which repeatedly threatened regional and\ninternational security. This fact underlines the need to\nestablish the order of relations between the States of the\nregion on a basis of co-equal security.\nI should like to reaffirm here our full support for the\npolicy of freeing the Middle East region from nuclear and\nother weapons of mass destruction and, accordingly \u2014\nbearing in mind its capability in this field \u2014 we call upon\non Israel to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons. We are confident that the elimination\nof such destructive weapons will be of benefit not only in\nthe area of peace and security but also in the areas of\ndevelopment as the resources saved as a result of reduced\nexpenditure on armaments could be diverted to economic\nand social areas, thus enabling the peoples of the region to\nraise their living standards and secure a better life for future\ngenerations.\nBahrain welcomed the signing of the Declaration of\nPrinciples between the Palestine Liberation Organization\nand Israel on 13 September 1993 and regarded it as the first\nstep toward a comprehensive peaceful and just settlement\nin the Middle East. Since that historic event there have\nbeen other developments in the peace process. Among\nthese was the signing, in Cairo on 4 May, of the self-rule\nAgreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization\nand Israel. This was followed by the Palestinian self-rule\nauthority\u2019s arrival in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The\nJordanian and Israeli sides also were able to sign the\nWashington Declaration on 25 July this year.\nWe welcome these developments and hope that they\nwill constitute a first positive move towards a\ncomprehensive and just peace on the basis of Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the\nother resolutions of international legality and the land-for-\npeace principle. We view these steps as a breakthrough\nin the attempts to achieve peace, and we hope that they\nare the beginning of the solution to the question of\nPalestine and of the process of enabling the Palestinian\npeople to secure their legitimate national rights, including\nthe right to their own independent State.\nIt is our hope that, in the context of the peace\nprocess in the region, efforts on the other tracks will yield\npositive results so that the process may be concluded\nsuccessfully. It is hoped that the negotiations will lead to\ncomplete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab\nterritories, including Holy Al-Quds, the Syrian Arab\nGolan and southern Lebanon.\nWhile we affirm our deep interest in the\nachievement of peace and development in the Middle East\nregion, the State of Bahrain, as expressed by His\nHighness Sheikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa at the\nopening of the third session of the Consultative Council\nlast week,\n\u201cdeems it incumbent upon it to stress that the\nensuing peace should be comprehensive, the security\nmutual and the development common.\u201d\nHis Highness continued:\n\u201cAll peoples and countries of the region should reap\nthe tangible results.\u201d\nIt is our conviction that the peace process should be\ncomprehensive and integrated, for it would be futile to\nfocus on achieving peace and development in one part of\nthe region while leaving unresolved problems of others.\nMutual security and vital interests should involve all\nparties that are called upon to take part in peacemaking\nand mutual development. In this context, all steps by all\nparties should be taken in a measured, balanced and\nequitable manner.\nMy delegation wishes to express its support for the\nSyrian Arab Republic in insisting on its right to regain\nsovereignty over its territories in the Golan that have been\n6\n\n\noccupied since 1967. We also call on Israel to withdraw\ncompletely and unconditionally from southern Lebanon,\npursuant to Security Council resolution 425 (1978). The\npast has taught us that inequitable peace is the shortest way\nto more crises. This must be realized by all those who are\ninterested in the future well-being and stability of the\nregion.\nSecurity, stability and political balance in sensitive\nregions are important. Territorial and boundary claims\naimed at changing the present boundaries of States are\nmatters of concern to my country. It is our conviction that\nthe ideal means of dealing with such issues is to respect the\nexisting and generally recognized borders between States,\nand to settle all differences that may rise by peaceful means\nacceptable to both sides.\nAccordingly, we stress that Iraq should implement\nSecurity Council resolutions relating to Kuwait and should\nofficially recognize Kuwait\u2019s sovereignty and release all\nKuwaiti and other prisoners of war and detainees. As we\ncall on Iraq to comply with the requirements of\ninternational legitimacy, we express at the same time our\ninsistence on Iraq\u2019s unity, sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity and our sympathy with the brotherly people of\nIraq, who are beset by difficult economic and living\nconditions. It is our hope that these conditions will change\nonce the causes for them have been removed.\nIt is regrettable that the dispute between the United\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran in relation\nto the question of sovereignty over the islands of Abu\nMoussa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb has not abated,\nbecause it adversely affects the security and stability of the\nGulf region. With that in mind, the State of Bahrain calls\non the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond to the invitation\nby the United Arab Emirates to seek a settlement of the\ndispute over those islands through serious bilateral talks and\nthrough other peaceful means available for the settlement of\ndisputes between States by mutual consent.\nThe situation in Somalia is still precarious despite all\nthe good offices and sincere efforts of the United Nations,\nthe League of Arab States and the international community\nat large. While we voice our concern over the situation in\nthat sister nation, we maintain that it is the Somali parties\nthemselves that have the primary responsibility for the\nachievement of peace, the protection of Somali national\ninterests and the rebuilding of the institutions of a unified\nSomalia. Bahrain also supports the recent League of Arab\nStates resolution calling for the establishment of a\nministerial committee to follow, along with the Secretary-\nGeneral of the Arab League, the situation in Somalia and\ndevelopments there, and to maintain appropriate contacts\nwith a view to finding a suitable solution to the dangerous\nstate of affairs and to achieving national reconciliation, in\nthe interest of Somali unity and the well-being of the\nSomali people.\nThe plight that has afflicted the Republic of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina for the last two and a half years persists\nwith full intensity. This year, the Serb aggressors have\ncontinued relentlessly to commit appalling massacres,\nkillings, torture and rape against unarmed Bosnians, in\nflagrant disregard of the rules of international\nhumanitarian law that outlaw such practices. In\npursuance of their policy of fait accompli through the\nseizure of more territory, the aggressors persist in\npreventing delivery of humanitarian relief supplies,\nviolating the sanctity of and destroying places of worship\nand carrying out \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d.\nThe unabated aggression against the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a clear test of the effectiveness\nof the United Nations and its role in providing protection\nto populations. The Serb aggression against Sarajevo and\nGorazde has shown the extent to which the Security\nCouncil is intentionally avoiding ensuring that its own\nresolutions are implemented against the Serbs. Although\nin all its relevant resolutions, including resolutions 900\n(1994) and 913 (1994), the Council has affirmed the\nsovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and political\nindependence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nnone of these resolutions have yet been enforced. The\nSecurity Council is now in a dilemma, since\ndevelopments have shown the great difference between\nadopting resolutions and taking action to implement them.\nThe adoption by Security Council of resolution 943\n(1994) which relaxed the sanctions against Serbia and\nMontenegro was, in our view, tantamount to rewarding an\naggressor whose credibility has not been demonstrated.\nWe believe rather that the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is the one that deserves reparations and\nshould be rewarded for accepting the peace plan advanced\nrecently by the five-party Contact Group \u2014 a plan\nrejected by the Serbs. Through its President, Mr. Alija\nIzetbegovic, the Republic of Bosnia Herzegovina also\naccepted the proposed postponement of the lifting of the\narms embargo against it for another six months, a position\nthat indeed warrants appreciation by the international\ncommunity and all peace-loving nations.\n7\n\n\nWith regard to the situation in Afghanistan, we are\ndeeply concerned over the escalation of fighting between\nthe parties to the dispute. We appeal to all Afghan factions\nto put the national interests of the Afghan people above all\nother considerations by putting an end to the fighting\namong them, pursuant to the provisions of the Mecca\nagreement of 1993.\nAmong the appalling developments in Rwanda this\nyear were the dreadful massive massacres committed in\ntribal strife within the nation. For our part, we support the\nefforts exerted by the international community with a view\nto repatriating the refugees and displaced persons and to\nputting an end to the tragedy resulting from the civil war.\nAs far as the Cyprus question is concerned, we are\ninterested in seeing the obstacles to settlement removed.\nWe are deeply encouraged by the good offices of the\nSecretary-General and hope they will lead to a solution that\nmay be satisfactory to both communities, especially now\nthat both sides have declared that they accept, in principle,\na set of confidence-building measures.\nIn a few months, we shall see the dawn of 1995. In\nthat year we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations. Although the Organization coexisted with\npolitical polarization during the cold-war era, the peoples\nand Governments of the world continued to be loyal to it\nfor five decades. They are now counting on the\nOrganization to contribute to the formulation of a new\nworld order for the future. To that end, it behooves us as\nMember States to make available to the Organization the\ncapability and the necessary means which would enable it\nto face all the challenges ahead. The Organization should\ndevelop itself into an effective instrument capable of coping\nwith global changes. A number of important steps should\ntherefore be taken, including above all gaining the support\nof the Security Council for the desired reforms. The\ngrowing number of Member States and the emergence in\nthe international arena of new influential Powers justify\nsuch reforms.\nIt should be noted in this respect that a growing\nnumber of Member States have begun in recent years to\nassume effective roles in the work of the Organization and\nto contribute to the maintenance of world peace and\nsecurity. Proceeding from this, Bahrain looks forward to\ncontributing to such efforts should it be elected to a term\non the Security Council.\nThe ability of the United Nations to prevent disputes\nand to maintain world peace depends greatly on the\ncredibility of the principles of the Charter, which should,\nas a basic rule, guide the discussions and decisions of the\nUnited Nations, and particularly of the Security Council.\nIf it is perceived that application is selective, credibility\nwill suffer and the moral authority which is a basic\nfeature of the Charter will be weakened.\nNotwithstanding certain failures, the many great\nsuccesses the Organization has achieved in many parts of\nthe world deepen our conviction that the United Nations\nan indispensable guarantee for a future in which our\nhopes for international peace and security will be fulfilled.\nAs it approaches the end of the twentieth century,\nmankind longs for a world in which international relations\nwill be governed by the principles of equality, justice and\nthe renunciation of the use or threat of force. Mankind\nlongs for stability and peace based on solid foundations\nof understanding, good-neighbourliness and non-\ninterference in internal affairs as a means of consolidating\nthe ideals of justice, security and peace amongst all\nnations.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I should like to extend my sincere\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly, and to the newly elected members of the\nBureau. Your outstanding personal and professional\nqualities are, I am sure, a guarantee of the success of our\nwork.\nI also take this occasion to pay a tribute to your\npredecessor on the podium, Mr. Samuel Insanally, who,\noften in difficult circumstances, fulfilled his mandate\nexpertly and efficiently. For instance, the opportunity he\ngave us freely to express our opinions and ideas on\nseveral important problems of our time, such as that of\ndevelopment, was a significant initiative that will certainly\n5\n\n\nhave a positive impact on all our further thinking and work\non these questions.\nI turn now to our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, to thank him warmly for his efforts in\nundertaking the very complex and sensitive missions\nentrusted to him by the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil over the past months. Given that, in many\nrespects, the state of the world continues to deteriorate,\nthese efforts have been all the more worthy. While some\nconflicts were born or rekindled, others - often long-\nstanding, but no less virulent - have become worse or have\nexpanded. Brutality and violence, sometimes interethnic,\nhave all too often exploded, and no real means have existed\nor been available to redress their effects or the harm they\nhave caused.\nWhile we have been heartened by certain encouraging\ndevelopments in South Africa - which we welcome back to\ndemocratic life - or in the Middle East, many potential\nconflicts remain and others have already erupted or are\nabout to do so. Entire peoples are still under the yoke of\ndictatorship. The suffering and barbarity entailed are all the\nmore vicious and painful because the methods of repression\nhave kept pace with scientific and technical advances. The\ncrimes of the highest civilization go hand in hand with the\ncrimes of the highest barbarity. More than ever before,\nwomen, children, the elderly and the weakest and most\nvulnerable are threatened and victimized. When peace\ncollapses - and the more fragile it is the more violent is its\ncollapse - war quickly becomes total, and civilian\npopulations, especially the poorest, are rarely spared.\nThe international community, pained and\noverwhelmed, can only resort, in desperation, to\nhumanitarian assistance. Bosnia and Herzegovina and\nRwanda are the most striking examples of this. Most often,\nthis humanitarian assistance comes in response to tragic\nsituations and complex political circumstances that make it\ndifficult to deliver and, despite all the haste and the efforts\nmade, render its benefits uncertain.\nBearing in mind the decisions taken by the Security\nCouncil in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a view\nto protecting the civilian populations, and inspired by the\ncourageous and generous initiative recently undertaken by\nFrance in Rwanda with the support of Africa and the\nUnited Nations, should not the international community\nadopt a convention-based instrument that would meet this\nchallenge? For such challenges could face it again in the\nfuture.\nThrough such an instrument, States parties would\nundertake in advance to authorize in case of a conflict the\nestablishment of protection and security areas reserved for\ndefenceless children, women and the elderly. The\nboundaries of these zones would, of course, need to be\nclearly established, with the agreement of the State or\nStates concerned. Special access routes to such areas -\nneutralized airports, roads and railroads - would be\nprovided for in this treaty in order to ensure the delivery\nof humanitarian assistance. The protection and\nfunctioning of these areas would have to be guaranteed by\nunarmed agents, preferably volunteers, under the auspices\nand responsibility of the United Nations, and they would\nwear white helmets or have some other distinctive\ninsignia, as has already been suggested.\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the\nProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12\nAugust 1949 - which envisaged cordons sanitaires and\nsecurity zones, without however making them mandatory\n- could serve as a model to a great extent when we\nconsider this matter. Does not protection for the most\nvulnerable sectors of the non-combatant population -\nchildren, women and the elderly - deserve true\ninternational commitment? It would be particularly\nsignificant and symbolic if, on the occasion of its fiftieth\nanniversary, after considering a desirability study drafted\nby the Secretary-General, our Organization equipped itself\nwith such an instrument, open for signature by all States,\nproviding for the establishment of humanitarian zones in\ntime of conflict.\nIn this way, the High Commissioner for Refugees,\nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and international\ncharitable institutions such as the International Committee\nof the Red Cross or certain non-governmental\norganizations recognized for their humanitarian activities\nwould be in a better position rapidly to provide\nprotection, relief and assistance to the civilian populations\nafflicted by destructive conflicts and deprived of their\nmost fundamental rights.\nWhile it is more important than ever for our\nOrganization to secure for itself effective means of\nprotecting innocent civilian populations, we must none the\nless not neglect future generations. By depleting the\nnatural resources of our Earth and damaging our\nenvironment, often out of simple negligence, we are\njeopardizing the future and the happiness of our children.\nThe Principality of Monaco is fully aware of this and is\nstriving to assist to the extent within its power in\n6\n\n\nprotecting the environment as well as in combating\npollution in the oceans and seas.\nBy virtue of its maritime traditions, Monaco has\nprimarily throughout its history stressed the protection of\nthe resources of the marine environment. A large number\nof initiatives have been taken in this respect on the local,\nregional and even international levels. The Principality is\nalways ready to step up its efforts and to strengthen\ninternational cooperation in these areas.\nIndeed, in this respect a cooperative undertaking with\nthe United Nations has existed since 1961. Pursuant to an\nagreement concluded between the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency and the Government of Monaco, an\ninternational marine radioactivity laboratory has been\noperating in the Principality. This laboratory has garnered\nimportant and interesting experience in the realm of the\nmeasurement of levels of radioactivity in the seas and\noceans. With the assistance of the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme, it has developed various methods\nof monitoring the marine environment on a worldwide\nscale.\nThe proclamation of 1998 as the International Year of\nthe Ocean, as proposed by the Economic and Social\nCouncil, would, I am convinced, provide an opportunity to\nbolster this international cooperation and to once again take\nstock of the marine environment, after the assessment\ndrawn up in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 at the Earth Summit.\nIn this spirit, we have paid particular attention to\ncertain conclusions of the Fourth United Nations\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\nFish Stocks whose migrations take place both within and\noutside exclusive economic zones, which took place here in\nAugust. The alarm that was sounded as a result in\nparticular of the report drawn up by the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations with respect\nto the overexploitation of the seas and oceans cannot leave\nus indifferent. The careful husbandry and use of such\nprecious marine resources and the stepped up struggle to\ncombat marine pollution should continue to be the subject\nof the most energetic and attentive concern on the part of\nthis Organization.\nThe agreement recently adopted in the context of the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - and we\nvery much welcome the felicitous conclusion of that\nagreement - demonstrates that with goodwill, the\ninternational community can find the right formulae to\naccommodate the interests of all by preserving the general\ninterest, that is, thinking globally but also acting locally.\nOnly world cooperation can make it possible to\nsolve the grave problems associated with safeguarding our\nenvironment and as a result respond to the tremendous\nchallenges that we face now and will increasingly face in\nthe future. With future generations in mind, I feel\nimpelled to speak of the future of our Organization,\nwhich next year will celebrate a landmark event: its\nfiftieth anniversary.\nImportant world conferences - the one on population\nand development which has just concluded in Cairo, the\none on social development scheduled for Copenhagen in\nMarch next year, or the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, which will take place in September 1995 in\nBeijing - have been and will be opportunities to intensify\nour thinking and build up our means of intervention in\nkey areas for the future.\nThe work in progress to improve the functioning of\nthe Organization and its structures is encouraging. The\nGovernment of the Principality is following these\ndevelopments with interest.\nI should be remiss if I concluded my statement\nwithout thanking the members of the Security Council\nand the States that have contributed to peace-keeping\noperations and without stating that the Principality fully\nappreciates the sacrifices made. Men and women serving\nthe Organization have lost their lives. We salute them\nand pay tribute to their memory. We must be watchful -\nand this is a major responsibility - in order to ensure\nbetter protection for these soldiers of peace while\nremembering their wives, their children and their families.\nOur action is and should always be designed first\nand foremost to serve mankind, to alleviate its sufferings\nand remedy the evils of its plight. Is it not time at last to\nsay, as Andr\u00e9 Breton wrote, \\\"for man to go over to the\nside of man, lock, stock and barrel\\\".\nI wish, as I conclude my statement, to express my\nfervent and sincere wishes for the success of the work of\nthis forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\nI venture to hope that thanks to general goodwill and\nmutual understanding we may be able to find practical\nand effective solutions, in keeping with the spirit and\nletter of the Charter of the United Nations, to the key\nissues before us for our consideration.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Thailand, I extend warmest\ncongratulations to Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session. I am confident that he will provide\nthe General Assembly with the leadership to guide the\nsession to a successful conclusion.\nI should also like to pay tribute to Ambassador\nInsanally, the General Assembly\u2019s President at its\nforty-eighth session. My delegation very much\nappreciates his untiring and effective leadership and his\ndedication to the work of this body. Under his\npresidency, the General Assembly had an eventful year,\nand its role was enhanced in ways which were beneficial\nto the Organization.\nThailand joins the rest of the international\ncommunity in congratulating the Government and people\nof South Africa on having established a united,\ndemocratic and non-racial country. They have shown us\nthat compromise is possible and that even the most\nlong-standing and bitter of conflicts can be resolved\npeacefully. This achievement is due entirely to the\nexceptional vision, courage and pragmatism of the\ncountry\u2019s leaders - in particular, President Nelson\nMandela and Executive Deputy President F.W. de Klerk.\nTribute must also be paid to the United Nations, and in\nparticular to the Special Committee against Apartheid, for\nits contributions to the positive changes in South Africa.\nThere is another bright spot giving all of us hope for\na more peaceful world. Since the Thai Government has\nlong supported the Middle East peace process, the\n18\n\n\ntermination of the state of war between Jordan and Israel,\nannounced in Washington in July this year, following last\nyear\u2019s historic agreement between Israel and the PLO, gives\nall of us reason to rejoice. We hope that it will lead to\nfurther agreements on \\\"other tracks\\\" acceptable to all\nparties concerned, so that a durable peace in the Middle\nEast may finally be achieved.\nWe also welcome the positive developments\nconcerning the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and\nhope that dialogue and negotiation between the parties\nconcerned will eventually result in that part of the world\nenjoying lasting peace and stability.\nHowever, in spite of the promising outlook for\ninternational peace and security, there remain political and\nmilitary conflicts of both global and regional magnitude.\nIt is therefore imperative that countries continue unfailing\nefforts to secure a stable and peaceful international\nenvironment. As a first step in this direction, the\ninternational community could support and cooperate in\nefforts towards comprehensive reform and total\nrevitalization of the United Nations to enable the\nOrganization to meet the new challenges of today\u2019s world\nand to assist Members efficiently in their peaceful\nendeavours.\nThailand pledges its continued support for the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposals in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\".\nThese constitute an innovative and practical framework for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\ndeserve serious consideration by all Member States.\nIn South-East Asia, realizing the need to ensure a\nsecure and peaceful international environment, the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) took the\nlead in promoting political and security dialogues and\nconsultations in the Asia-Pacific region by initiating the\nestablishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).\nDesigned to be a high-level consultative forum on political\nand security matters, the ARF held its first meeting in\nBangkok on 25 July 1994, after the twenty-seventh ASEAN\nministerial meeting. Nineteen ministers from countries in\nthe Asia-Pacific region and from the European Union\nattended this historic meeting to discuss political and\nsecurity cooperation issues, such as the latest developments\non regional situations, and decided to carry out some\npractical confidence-building measures applicable to the\nAsia-Pacific region.\nAs Chairman of the first ARF meeting, Thailand is\npleased with the results of the meeting and its\nachievements. In particular, Thailand is grateful for the\nkind cooperation it received from all countries concerned.\nSince the success of this first meeting, the ARF has\nbecome a viable forum for the promotion of trust as well\nas political and security cooperation within the\nAsia-Pacific region. The ARF has also demonstrated its\npotential to make substantive contributions towards the\nUnited Nations efforts at preventive diplomacy and at\nmaintaining international peace and security.\nIn other words, the ARF got off to a good start.\nThailand is fully aware that the first meeting of the ARF\nin Bangkok was only the beginning. For this reason,\nThailand views the inter-sessional activities at various\nlevels among officials from ARF countries as necessary\nfor the ARF\u2019s continued success. These activities could\nhelp the ARF find its future direction and enable it to\nbecome more efficient and productive.\nPolitical and military security are but one aspect of\nthe bigger picture facing us. As we search for a new\ninternational order based on a common set of principles\nand values, we need to change our way of thinking. We\nalso need a new culture of development cooperation and\nnew definitions of the notions of security and\ndevelopment.\nThe winds of change have begun to sweep across the\nglobe. We are now witnessing the creation of major\nlandmarks of international consensus-building. In 1992,\nthe Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit set a new stage for\nglobal partnership on the environment and sustainable\ndevelopment. Last year (in Vienna), the World\nConference on Human Rights was held, producing a\nworld programme of action. Last month in Cairo we\nwitnessed the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment. Next year in Copenhagen, the World\nSummit for Social Development will be held. This\nSummit will serve as a bridge between this year\u2019s\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo and\nnext year\u2019s Fourth World Conference on Women in\nBeijing. It also presents a unique opportunity for the\ninternational community to respond, on a global level, to\nurgent human and social concerns that place people at the\ncentre of the development process.\nThe Thai Government accords special importance to\nsocial development. In light of this, we have established\na social cabinet dedicated to formulating policies and\nfinding solutions to a number of pressing social problems.\nWe have also organized a joint committee comprising\nmembers of the private sector and of Government and\n19\n\n\nchaired by the Prime Minister. Its mandate is to oversee\nefforts to alleviate the social problems that beset a growing\neconomy, such as those being experienced by my country\nand others in the region.\nThailand has participated and will continue to\nparticipate actively in all global deliberations. These\nconferences create new paradigms of international conduct\nwhich give rise to the various comprehensive global plans\nof action. They have also started the new process of\nredefining the notions of security and development.\nSecurity in this final decade of the twentieth century\ngoes well beyond the familiar concepts of old. It must\ninvolve people - how they live and how they exercise their\nchoices. It should be security with a human face, because\nit must deal directly with political, economic, environmental\nand social aspects of our lives in a comprehensive manner.\nDevelopment, as pointed out by the Secretary-General,\nmust be seen in its five interlinked dimensions: with peace\nas the foundation; the economy as the engine of progress;\nthe environment as a basis for sustainability; justice as a\npillar of society; and democracy as good governance. My\ncountry shares these perceptions and supports their premises\nas envisioned by the Secretary-General.\nIt is with this awareness that Thailand approaches its\nwork on the international agenda for development. Such an\nagenda should reflect and indeed promote self-reliance as\nwell as interdependence among Member States. There is\nno doubt that development is primarily a national\nresponsibility. Yet, it is also a shared responsibility of the\ninternational community. It is our firm belief that the\ndevelopment effort of any State in today\u2019s world must be\nsupported by a conducive international environment, based\non free and fair trading practices. The completion of the\nUruguay Round and the creation of the World Trade\nOrganization now hold out the prospect of providing\nsignificant benefits to the world economy.\nA United Nations agenda for development should not\nbe given any less importance than the agenda for peace.\nThese two intertwined issues must be the core of any effort\nto strengthen the role and activities of the United Nations\nas we approach the next century.\nTogether with the \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", \\\"An agenda\nfor development\\\" should serve as an instrument for the\ncoordination of activities within the United Nations, as well\nas between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, and other non-governmental organizations. It\nshould be an instrument to create unity of purpose, at\nboth the policy and operational levels, within the\nOrganization. The United Nations cannot be a strong\nforce for peace unless it is also a strong force for\ndevelopment.\nThe United Nations remains humanity\u2019s best hope\nfor creating a more desirable world - a world with a\nconscience, a world which recognizes that humans\neverywhere, young or old, strong or weak, are at the\ncentre of our communal and individual efforts. To this\nend, I should like to reaffirm Thailand\u2019s commitment to\nthis vision, which cannot be fulfilled without the active\nparticipation of Member States. Thailand will do its part\nin contributing to this end. We hope that other countries\nwill also chip in with their fair share of contributions. A\nworld united by this vision and this unity of purpose will\nsurely be a better place for us all and, more important, for\nour children and grandchildren.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish cordially to greet you, Mr. Amara Essy of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I pledge the fullest cooperation of the delegation of Paraguay.\nNor can I fail to echo the congratulations offered to Ambassador Samuel Insanally on the way he guided the work of the last session of the General Assembly.\nIt is my pleasure also to hail the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and convey to him well- deserved congratulations on the excellent manner in which he has carried out his tasks. On behalf of the Government and the people of Paraguay, a founding Member of the United Nations, I pledge to him our full support for the Organization. It is our hope that he will visit our country as soon as he can; this would be further testament to our support for the United Nations and to our expectations as to what the United Nations can do to assist Paraguay in its current process of full democratization. That democratization has been under way in Paraguay since February 1989; it is now being consolidated under the Administration of Mr. Juan Carlos Wasmosy, President of the Republic.\nIn this Hall one year ago, the President of Paraguay committed himself to consolidating the democratic process, with the support of the vast majority of Paraguayans from the different political parties and organizations that demonstrate the pluralism of our society, which is irrevocably determined to defend freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. Today, the name of Paraguay does not appear in the dossiers of human rights violations. Not a single United Nations or other agency of the international community has failed to note the undeniable progress in our country in every area connected with dignifying the human person, and the efforts we have made in the social sector.\nHence, as I pledge on behalf of my Government and my entire society that we shall never, under any circumstances, diverge from the democratic ideal, I cannot fail to observe that problems remain in achieving a level of development with social justice; we shall keep trying to solve them resolutely, and in many cases with international cooperation.\nWe shall not be satisfied until we secure for our inhabitants - Paraguayans and foreigners whom we have welcomed into our land - living standards considered adequate according to United Nations indexes. In view of the magnitude of the task, we again stress that the burden cannot be borne by one people alone. For us to be competitive, conditions in the international system must change: markets must be more open; credit must be more readily available, and at lower interest rates; and technology must be more accessible. We therefore believe in global solidarity, especially of the developed nations.\nThe people of the developing countries cannot be asked to make greater sacrifices than they are already making unless they see a similar trend towards the transformation of the international community. If democracy and freedom are to exist and endure, peoples must enjoy development and better living conditions.\nI should like briefly to refer to our economic recovery, which began in 1989 and has produced very\nfavorable results, even during a period of transition and major structural changes.\nParaguay has been pursuing a policy of free trade and floating exchange rates, coupled with total freedom of movement for financial services and capital. The external debt has been reduced to $1.26 billion, almost the same as our current reserves of $1 billion. Paraguay offers a variety of tax incentives to both its own and outside investors for investment in production activities. These incentives place our country among those offering the best and most attractive terms in Latin America.\nOur privatization policy, which started with money-losing national industries, is already enshrined in our legal code. Furthermore, we project a growth in gross domestic product of 4.5 per cent this year.\nEducation and training are a major priority of our Government, because it feels that accelerated development depends on well-trained people.\nAs regards economic integration, the Treaty of Asuncion was signed in the capital of Paraguay in 1991, establishing the Common Market of the Southern Cone (MERCOSUR). At the recent meeting of the Presidents of the MERCOSUR countries, held in Buenos Aires on 5 August, they took a decisive step forward by agreeing by consensus to establish a common external tariff.\nIn connection with this economic integration, we are pleased to confirm that Paraguay firmly and enthusiastically supports the negotiations on the entry into MERCOSUR of the fraternal Republics of Bolivia and Chile. Paraguay has suggested to its MERCOSUR partners the establishment of essential supranational machinery, such as the office of secretary-general and a court of justice. That would allow us to hold joint negotiations with the European Union, as has seemed feasible since its Council's Corfu meeting, and with the signatories of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nThe summit of American nations convened in Miami by President Clinton will be an event of great significance for relations in this hemisphere in our common search for ever greater understanding among countries of this continent on political, economic and trade matters.\nAt the subregional level, only a few weeks ago we were able to set in motion the first of 20 turbines of the huge Yacyreta hydroelectric dam, built jointly by Paraguay and Argentina.\n \n\nThe Government of Paraguay has worked hard to develop ties with the outside world in order to break out of the isolation arising from its landlocked condition and, until 1989, its deliberate marginalization by an authoritarian Government.\nIn bilateral terms, though it may seem redundant to say this, it is appropriate to recall that Paraguay benefits from a vast hydroelectric capacity already in place: the Itaipu station, shared with Brazil, with an output of 12.6 million kilowatts; and that at Yacyreta, shared with Argentina, with an output of some 4 million kilowatts. There is therefore no question but that Paraguay is now, and will remain, an ideal place for major foreign and domestic investment and for implementing a policy of industrialization, based on our abundant, low-cost energy.\nIt must be remembered, however, that Paraguay suffers a structural limitation that would appear to limit its development potential: its lack of a seaboard. We wish to turn this handicap, which has had a very negative impact on Paraguay in the past, into an advantage. I refer to the fact that Paraguay, being at the center of MERCOSUR, can act as a hinge or pivot par excellence, together with Bolivia, between MERCOSUR and the Andean Common Market.\nAt the regional, Latin American level, I wish to refer first to Paraguay's involvement in the Fourth Ibero- American Summit of Pleads of State and Government. The presence of our entire Ibero-American community, together with Spain and Portugal, strengthened us all, because of the cultural, historical, political and other ties that bind us closely. I should like to stress that Paraguay regards this conference as an essential link in its ties with the European Union and as a major forum with great potential.\nAnother important event this year, again at the regional level, was the Eighth Conference of Presidents and Heads of Government of the Rio Group, which ended a few weeks ago. Paraguay fully endorsed the Declaration of the Rio Group, particularly with regard to the situations in Haiti and Cuba and the problem of drug-trafficking.\nParaguay actively participated in producing the declaration in regard to the fraternal Republic of Cuba, which expresses the strong hope that it will introduce significant political and economic reforms in accordance with the people's will, and stating that we respect the self-determination of peoples and the principle of non-intervention. Paraguay lent its fullest support to the Rio Group's decisions, including its declaration on lifting the embargo against Cuba.\nWith regard to the new post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Paraguay wishes to state that his great efforts with regard to individual rights must be complemented by the promotion of social and collective human rights.\nWe have throughout fully endorsed the principle of the peaceful resolution of international conflicts, including the case of Haiti. In this, Paraguay is strengthened by its traditional commitment to peace. In 1923 we contributed to international law for the Americas with the Gondra Treaty of conciliation and arbitration, which has become one of the pillars of Latin America's juridical system.\nAlong these lines of thought and practice, Paraguay enthusiastically welcomes the recent progress in connection with the United Nations Decade of International Law. Paraguay supports the codification of this branch of law; it will be one of the greatest achievements of the United Nations. In this connection, Paraguay has signed and ratified the main agreements that constitute the legal structure created through the United Nations.\nParaguay is keenly following and promoting mankind's urgent demand for international cooperation for development. For it is just as important to build peace through development as to maintain it through law. Here I want once more publicly to express our deep thanks to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), whose timely and effective work we have seen at first hand. We also acknowledge the fundamental importance of the development work of the World Bank, the Inter-American Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\nWe hail the Secretary-General's recent decision to seek better coordination within the United Nations system on technical cooperation and to make the Administrator of UNDP fully responsible for coordination system wide, including with the regional commissions and all other program. From this decision the United Nations will gain in efficiency and in the impact of its world-wide activities.\nParaguay also backs the entire process for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and the opening of negotiations on international economic cooperation for development, which appears on the agenda of the General Assembly.\n \n\nYet, in a spirit of honor and fraternity, I wish to repeat what I said here in New York at the June 1994 session of the Economic and Social Council - namely, that:\n\\\"We feel that the distribution of funds for United Nations programs and projects world wide is imbalanced; as Latin Americans, we believe that the proportion allocated to our region, by UNDP for example, is unfair: only 8.66 per cent is allocated for programs in Latin American countries, while other regions are allocated 50.42 per cent and 40.67 per cent respectively\\\".\nUNDP contributes only 17 per cent to Paraguay's program; Paraguay pays the rest. But we appreciate and wish to continue to count on UNDP\u2019s support.\nParaguay looks forward with keen interest and commitment to the World Summit for Social Development, to be held at Copenhagen. We are preparing to participate in that conference and have high expectations about the positive results it can achieve. We have promised that the President of the Republic of Paraguay will attend that great event. Paraguay is so enthusiastic about the conference because the three basic items on its agenda are very closely connected with today's social problems: social integration, particularly of the most marginalized and disadvantaged groups; relief and reduction of poverty; and an increase in productive employment. As the draft agenda points out, all of this must be in the context of a propitious economic environment - and, we would add, with international cooperation. Here, Paraguay cannot fail to note that a characteristic of our times is economic growth without job-creation, a situation that must be corrected, since one of today's problems is indeed unemployment.\nParaguay earnestly supports ongoing efforts, will support future efforts, developed by the United Nations in all areas of disarmament: nuclear, chemical and others.\nThe Assembly should know that in the area of social development Paraguay has established a special commission to prepare for the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held at Beijing. The commission brings together State and private bodies, which are drafting a final report on the situation of women in Paraguay.\nAs a full member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Paraguay hopes that the results of the Uruguay Round will have beneficial effects for us. We are convinced that the Uruguay Round is the beginning of a process of downscaling policies of subsidy and protectionism. Paraguay confidently looks forward to the follow-up to GATT and to the work of its complementary successor body, the World Trade Organization.\nParaguay fully shares in the entire international community's anguish at drug trafficking, and at the evil effects of that phenomenon. Notwithstanding our meager resources, we are doing whatever is necessary to root it out wherever it is hiding, and to fight it head on. But, with the strength derived from reason, Paraguay affirms that the consumer countries, transit countries and producer countries alike must undertake an equal commitment to adopting vigorous measures. Unilateral efforts, however vigorous, to combat drug production and trafficking can never be successful without gradual shrinkage of the markets that give rise to production and trafficking in the first place.\nLinked with this universal scourge, which we condemn with all our strength and conviction, is the phenomenon of corruption, a human failing that is seen in varying degrees in all four comers of the Earth. Corruption spreads its tentacles as a reflection of a civilization that is prodigious in economic, financial, scientific, technical and industrial terms but is, we must admit, often found wanting in the firm ethical underpinnings and the genuine human values that strengthen and give vitality to a culture.\nParaguay is following with great attention all United Nations efforts with respect to agenda item 142, \\\"Measures to eliminate international terrorism\\\". Recent grave events in certain parts of the world, indeed on our own continent, clearly show that the international community needs a new approach, through well-coordinated action, to overcoming this serious problem, which, as we know, sometimes links drug-trafficking mafias with terrorism.\nOn the question of equitable representation on and an increase in the membership of the Security Council, Paraguay believes that in today's changing world we must attune the Organization to the requirements of the times and current circumstances. Hence, my country believes it just to democratize the representation of States on the Security Council, and for the Council's decision-making to be transparent. The world situation has changed, and the United Nations must adapt to those changes. We repeat what we said at the last meeting of the Rio Group - namely, that\n\\\"because of its legal tradition and its contribution to\nthe cause of peace, the Latin American and\nCaribbean region must be considered in any\nexpansion of the Security Council\\\".\nParaguay also firmly supports parallel efforts to revitalize the functioning of the General Assembly.\nI want to mention and to highlight our great satisfaction at the obvious, sustained advance of democracy in Latin America, and at the consolidation of the various processes that are under way.\nWe should like to reaffirm that the United Nations must continue to apply the principle of universality, making room within its ranks for all peace-loving States that meet the requirements as set forth in the Charter and that are prepared to honor its principles and purposes. We believe that the entry of the Republic of China as an independent country should be considered, along with the case of any other State that meets the conditions I have just mentioned.\nI should like officially to declare that, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, Paraguay pledges even now to have its President take part personally in the session of the Assembly. The President of our Republic will make the voice of my homeland heard on that most welcome occasion.\nMeanwhile, my country has established an ad hoc commission on the commemoration of that major event.\nThe environment, the subject of the magnificent 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is a matter of the greatest concern to Paraguay, which is prepared to support any and all initiatives aimed at preserving the environment through sustainable development, as well as to enact any appropriate measures that do not undermine economic growth.\nBy the same token, Paraguay declares its deep concern at the situation affecting the Pilcomayo River, which is an international waterway inasmuch as its source is in Bolivia and it forms the border between Argentina and Paraguay.\nWe are now facing a major environmental problem since that international river springs from the mountains and is now growing shallower in its course because of sedimentation build-up. Moreover, the Pilcomayo, owing to works undertaken on Argentine territory, has had some \n\n70 per cent of its volume absorbed in the territory of our neighbor. These facilities are doing a great deal of damage to the Chaco region of Paraguay, especially to its livestock and to the population.\nParaguay hopes that matters will return to normal, that is, that the course of the Pilcomayo River will resume its balance, irrigating both border areas in an equitable way. We fully trust that we will manage to reach complete agreement with the Republic of Argentina to restore this balance at the earliest possible time.\nTo that end, we will have to go to the very source of the Pilcomayo to seek a rational and comprehensive solution which, inevitably, will require a trilateral agreement in the form of a law governing the confluence of interests of Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay in respect of the river's course.\nAs Paraguay is a land-locked country, it has an especially keen interest in the Convention on the Law of the Sea, which our country ratified as early as 1986. The provisions of the Convention allow for the mitigation of disadvantages for those States that have no direct access to the sea and, for Paraguay, this will open up the possibility of sharing in the wealth of the deep seabed, or \\\"Zone\\\", which the Convention calls the common heritage of mankind. We view with optimism the entry into force of that Convention on 16 November this year. In the same context, Paraguay has signed the Agreement amending the Convention.\nAll developing countries aspire to sharing in the scientific and technological progress of the modem world. It seems to me that, together with the other measures the United Nations has already taken or is preparing to take, serious thought should be given to creating a global fund for scientific and technological development that would deepen the relationship between the major research centers in developed countries and the universities and research centers in developing countries.\nI should like to express Paraguay's deep satisfaction at the demise of the apartheid regime in the Republic of South Africa and at the observance of human rights for all the ethnic communities of the country. Paraguay has not forgotten the sister nations in Africa, which are striving to overcome immense difficulties in their quest for sustainable development and which deserve wide international support.\nParaguay is similarly disposed towards the sister Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with which we enjoy\nfraternal ties. We wish its people peace and brotherhood, and will strive to commit the United Nations towards that end.\nWe are very pleased to congratulate the State of Israel, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Kingdom of Jordan on their having strengthened the foundations of fraternal and constructive coexistence in the region, initiated in the agreements between Israel and Egypt. We trust that, given the help of the United Nations and of other major actors, the peace and security process in that part of the world will make steady progress, with the cooperation of other major countries in the region itself.\nI should like to voice a few thoughts with regard to the recent Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. Paraguay joined in the Conference Declaration and Program of Action, while clearly and explicitly placing on record its demand for the defense of life and agreeing, in broad terms, with consensual and voluntary family planning. For that reason, Paraguay lodged two reservations similar to those expressed by other countries that share our view.\nAs I bring my statement to a close, allow me to voice a personal reflection that arises from my many years in international life. I have been active in diplomacy since 1936. Apart from some time spent in academia, I have served my country or the United Nations. I lived through the beginning and the end of the Second World War. My generation was indeed moved when the United Nations Charter was signed. We were filled with hope, and the world seemed to be on the right path in reordering its affairs. We have traveled a long way since then, but we remain all the more convinced of the crucial need for this world Organization.\nI have personally known each one of the Secretaries- General of our Organization. I have worked closely with a number of them and shared their problems, their fears and their concerns as we struggled for a more just world.\nIt has been a privilege to be both a United Nations official and a diplomat accredited to this Organization. Now, in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I feel I have been granted an opportunity to renew the commitment of my nation and my own personal commitment. That commitment is genuine and unadulterated support for the effort to keep the peace through law and to build it through development.\nThe United Nations ideal today compels us to adopt a new way of thinking and living. Indeed, we are not merely representatives of sovereign States or members of a world Organization. We are protagonists and agents who share the same planet, which is in many respects both very similar and very different.\nWe have to show greater solidarity and regain our universal vision.\nAs human beings, we all have an interest in whatever makes us more human, in all senses of the term. The vital force that springs from this vision helps us in our mission of saving our common home, the Earth.\nMankind and the Earth:\ttherein\tlies\tthe\tkey\nmotivation for our commitment and for our endeavors, beneath the majestic gaze of the Creator.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is my\nparticular privilege and pleasure to address the General\n4\n\n\nAssembly of the United Nations at the beginning of its\nforty-ninth session.\nI believe we all agree that the appearance of any\nstatesman before the General Assembly is a great moment\nfor moral and political reconsideration of one\u2019s own\nreflections and responsibilities towards the international\npublic. This applies equally to the representatives of the\nesteemed founder States and to us who represent young\ndemocracies. This is an opportunity to present our views\non the problems affecting our countries, but also on all\nother issues of importance for the global Organization.\nThis is also an opportunity to compare, with the utmost\nseriousness, the lofty ideals incorporated in the United\nNations Charter with the difficulties and intricacies of daily\nachieving political agreement for their realization.\nThe noble fundamental principles of the United\nNations governing the rights and obligations of individuals,\nnations and States generally agree with the basic principles\nunderlying all world religions and philosophies, as well as\nthe fundamental laws of individual States. Yet we are still\npainstakingly seeking a consensus on a new and just\ninternational order that would unite and harmonize the lofty\ngoals of the United Nations Charter and the humanistic\nWelt\u00e4nschauung with the visions of the new global order\nand with the specific ideals and interests of individual\nStates. Unfortunately, many countries, such as my own,\nCroatia, which labours under difficulties owing to the\ndisintegration of one regional international order and the\nestablishment of another new order, are paying the highest\nhuman, material and political price for the imperfection of\nthe world in which we live.\nIn addressing the General Assembly as Head of the\nCroatian State and the highest representative of the Croatian\npeople, I can note with satisfaction that the international\nposition of Croatia has been strengthened and furthered in\nspite of all the problems affecting the actions of the\ninternational community. In only a few years since its\nindependence and international recognition, Croatia has\nbecome a fully fledged and equal international citizen,\nhaving reinforced its position in the international\ncommunity and expanded its network of bilateral relations\nwith almost all States and international agencies.\nMoreover, Croatia has become a key factor in the\nestablishment of the new regional order in South-eastern\nEurope and a recognized and important partner of the\nsuper-Powers and of the international community as a\nwhole in the resolution of the intricate crisis, currently the\nmost severe international crisis in this part of the world, in\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe adverse experience of the Croatian people\nthroughout their history, and particularly over the past few\nyears of the renewal of Croatian statehood, has taught us\nthat no sublime principle recorded in the United Nations\nCharter and in international law is automatically\nattainable - even less is it guaranteed - if the people\nconcerned are not determined to attain it; if they are not\nprepared to offer to make a high degree of sacrifice in the\nachievement of their right to life and freedom; and if they\ndo not succeed, by virtue of their strength and decisions,\nin bringing their national interests into line with the\nessential interests of the international community.\nDespite the inalienable right of the Croatian people -\none of the oldest European peoples - to self--\ndetermination and to the renewal of their own State,\ndespite the blatant barbaric aggression aimed at territorial\nconquest, the genocidal expulsion of the population and\nthe destruction of the most precious cultural heritage of\nthe Croatian people, such as Vukovar and Dubrovnik, the\nCroats would never have won the right to\nself-determination, to their State, to freedom and\nindependence, had they not been prepared to make human\nand material sacrifices, had they not shown a firm\nnation-building will, with which they have resolutely\nasserted themselves as a member of the international\ncommunity, while manifesting their readiness to be a\nconstructive force in the development of the new\ninternational order to replace the unviable and failed old\nsystem.\nIt is the duty of all of us - and especially of this, the\nhighest global authority - to take more determined and\nmore effective steps in the quest for means to break this\nvicious circle of suffering by individuals and peoples\nwrought by war. As the highest representatives of our\nStates and peoples, we are morally and politically obliged\nto create an international order, with appropriate\nmechanisms, capable of efficiently defending the rights of\neach nation or group, and especially of small and young\nStates. What we need are such mechanisms of the\nhighest global Organization that can resolutely prevent or\npunish any violation of the fundamental principles of\ninternational law.\nObviously, this also implies safeguarding the\nachievement of such rights and of generally accepted\nprinciples in a democratic way, so that each and every\nright does not have to be won the hardest way, with the\nblood of innocent lives, because such a way burdens the\ncollective memory with covert hatreds, bias and\n5\n\n\nvengefulness, stirring up new divisions and even more\ndestructive internal and regional crises.\nThis applies to crises in the areas of the former\nYugoslavia, just as it does to those in Rwanda, Somalia, the\nCaucasus, the Middle East, South Asia, Africa or America.\nIt is precisely the crisis in the former Yugoslavia that has\nshown the immense evil that can be done by petty political\nexploitation of historical myths about collective guilt or\nhistorical injustice, about a conspiracy of the whole world\nagainst a single people, and by the emphasizing of the\nmessianic role of a people to justify their conquest-minded\npolicy, causing a great deal of harm not only to those\nthreatened by such imperialistic policies, but also to the\npeople themselves, who fall victim to their own fallacies\nand motives, which are unacceptable and detrimental to the\ninternational community.\nAfter the collapse of the bloc division of the world\nand the disintegration of many multinational States, we are\nfaced with the task of building a new international order.\nAll past experience suggests that the task is very difficult.\nTo be successful, we need first and foremost a mechanism\nfor diplomatic and political negotiation, for building\nconfidence and for patiently overcoming real problems\nstemming from objectively differing interests. In cases\nwhere political efforts are obviously futile, the United\nNations must have a more efficient mechanism to achieve\nand even impose solutions serving the interests of\ninternational peace and stability. However, for reasons of\nrealpolitik and of the balance of interests and forces, in\nneither case should this contradict the fundamental\nprinciples of this Organization. It should be borne in mind\nthat the mechanism for establishing and defending the new\ninternational order should not merely serve the coordination\nof the interests of the super-Powers, but must reflect their\nhighest responsibility in dealing with regional crises, while\nbeing designed and structured to strengthen the security and\nprogress of small or jeopardized members of the\ninternational community, which account for the greater part\nof mankind. The United Nations must be qualified to\nguarantee, within the international order, equal conditions\nin terms of freedom, progress and equality for all the\nmembers of the international community.\nThe collapse of communism and of the bipolar\ndivision of the world has increased hopes for a world of\ngreater justice and security for all. However, we must be\naware of the fact that the collapse of the communist bloc\nand of multinational States has inevitably produced\ntemporarily destabilizing effects in the international order.\nIn this context, it should be noted that the proclamation of\nsovereign national States has mainly created positive\nconditions for the new international order, although in\nsome cases, where nationalism has degenerated into\nchauvinist-extremist trends, or even into conquest-minded\naggression, the effect has been negative. However, the\nessential point of these historical vicissitudes is the\nawareness of the fact that the endeavour of small peoples\nto attain statehood - meaning their political, cultural and\neconomic identity and their personality within the\ninternational order - has made the greatest contribution to\nthe collapse of communist totalitarianism and to the\ndemocratization of many countries. The full\ndemocratization of international relations is not possible\nwithout such democratization of internal political systems.\nThe security of new small States has become today\nthe key to stability in every region and it should provide\nthe groundwork for new collective security systems.\nOnly their complete security and equality can make them\nequal factors of civilizational and functional integration in\nspecific areas and within the global order as a whole.\nThe peoples of small countries will eagerly accept\ncivilizational integration if it is not to the detriment of the\nindividual quality of their State, culture and economy.\nOnly such safeguarding of national individuality within\ncivilizational integration can produce sound foundations\nfor functional multilateralism in the new international\norder. Otherwise, the myths and prejudices of the past\nwill continue to provide grounds for new conflicts and\neven clashes between civilizations. The disturbing scale\nwhich differences between civilizations can assume is\nclearly manifested in the former Yugoslavia, where local\naggression threatens to expand even into a conflict\ninvolving three civilizational religious blocs unless the\ncrisis, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is resolutely\nbrought to an end. Croatia has always supported a\npolitical solution by accepting the normalization of\nrelations with all neighbours, even those of whose\naggression we were victims, in order not only to create,\non an equal footing, the prerequisites for a new\ninternational order but also to bring about a productive\nblending of the different civilizations facing one another\nin this part of the world.\nIn view of the current state of affairs worldwide, we\nsupport a thorough organizational reform of the United\nNations in order to improve both its responsibility and its\nefficiency in dealing with the pressing problems of\nhumankind. Problems such as uneven development,\npopulation growth, the ecological balance of the planet,\nhuman and collective rights, functional global integration,\nand particularly crisis points and military hot spots, call\n6\n\n\nfor a more effective organization of the highest\ninternational agency. We need an Organization which\ncould have a more efficient bearing on establishing equal\nstandards and obligations for all countries, and which would\nbe entitled, in crises or on key issues affecting the\ndevelopment of humankind and life on our planet, \\\"to\nencroach\\\", on behalf of the global community, upon\ninternal affairs of States. The international community\nshould have, within the United Nations, multilateral\nmechanisms capable of dealing more efficiently with\npressing crises, and developmental, environmental and\ntechnological challenges now facing humankind.\nIn this context careful consideration is required of the\nrole of the General Assembly. Its activity must be credible,\nbut it nevertheless cannot assume the role of a global\nparliament to the detriment of the sovereignty of Member\nStates. Experience suggests that a clearer division of\nresponsibility among the General Assembly, the Security\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council is required.\nRegional conflicts have become the chief problem now\nconfronting the international community - not only because\nof the threat posed to international peace but also because\nthey can cause terrible human disasters such as those in\nRwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Somalia.\nAnd, of course, they also block regional developmental\nprocesses, and result in scarcely reparable ecological\ndamage and destruction of the natural and cultural heritage\nof entire areas.\nSuch a state of affairs requires first a reform of the\nSecurity Council.\nThe new global order can no longer be based only on\nthe coalition of the victors in the Second World War, or on\nthe nuclear club of the great Powers. It must reflect new\ndemocratic, economic and regional realities which\nnecessarily lead to permanent Security Council membership\nand enhanced regional responsibility for countries such as\nGermany or Japan, and also some regional representatives\nof the so-called third world. On the other hand, the reform\nof the Security Council ought to avoid solutions which\nwould, because of the increased number of members, make\ndecision-making more difficult and the Council inefficient.\nThe efficiency and credibility of the Security Council\nshould be substantially strengthened in order to resolve the\nmain problems related to international security, especially\nin conflicts causing military conflagration, first of all by\nreducing the gap between the content of the enacted\nresolutions and the possibility of their enforcement. All\nStates of the world, and particularly the great Powers which\nhave an enhanced responsibility within such a system,\nshould in good faith make adequate economic and\nmilitary instruments continuously available to the Security\nCouncil so that its decisions can be implemented. The\npeacemaking mediation of the global Organization must\nevolve from a static freezing of the conflict and curbing\nits expansion, into a mechanism capable of preventing the\ndevelopment of the crisis in a timely manner and of\neliminating the consequences that are already present.\nIn some cases the very decisions of the Security\nCouncil will suffice to stop and resolve the crisis, but\nsometimes a demonstration of firmness will be required.\nThe international community must develop more\nsystematic mechanisms to punish those States that do not\naccept or that violate Security Council decisions. The\nenforcement of international political or economic\nisolation of the aggressor, with concurrent compensation\nfor neighbouring States which are indirect victims of such\nisolation, should be made even more effective. Sanctions\nare becoming an instrument used at an ever increasing\nrate when there is no political consensus, or will to resort\nto more energetic means, but they can produce the wanted\neffect only if implemented consistently within the scope\nof systematic pressure.\nThe democratization of the international order entails\na greater focus on the protection of human rights,\nincluding also punishment for violations of humanitarian\nlaw and the law of war. Croatia has endorsed the\nestablishment of the War Crimes Tribunal in the area of\nthe former Yugoslavia. Croatia likewise supports the\nestablishment of a permanent international institution\nwhich would deal with the most severe violations of\nhumanitarian law, whether in Rwanda, Somalia, Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, Croatia or Haiti. However, the\ninternational community should also devise ways and\nmeans to prosecute the perpetrators of crimes from those\naggressor countries which refuse to cooperate with the\nTribunal.\nCroatia proposes the provision of a permanent peace-\nkeeping task force for the intervention requirements of the\nSecurity Council, involving special military units made\navailable, through agreement with a specific number of\ncountries for Security Council requirements. We believe\nthat this could forestall the flaring up of many regional\ncrises, or contribute to their rapid prevention. Such\ninternational forces should have a broader mandate in\nterms of the use of force, not only for their own\nprotection but also for the energetic implementation of all\n7\n\n\nSecurity Council resolutions - from humanitarian\nobjectives to disarmament and demilitarization. The peace-\nkeeping force should be set up so that the national\ncontingents within it implement the decisions of the\nSecurity Council and not the specific policies of their\ncountries.\nThe proliferation of regional crises confronts the\nUnited Nations with ever-increasing tasks which the\nSecurity Council cannot fulfil successfully with its limited\nresources. This suggests the need for the Security Council\nto assign the implementation of its decisions to regional\norganizations as well. This in turn requires the redefinition\nand strengthening of the role of regional organizations\nwithin the collective security system. Each crisis point\nshould be dealt with by appreciating all specific features\nand by realistically evaluating the possible scope of regional\nsystems in the implementation of Security Council\ndecisions.\nThe solutions at which we aim in the regional crisis\naffecting the area of the former Yugoslavia, as well as\nelsewhere, must proceed from the fundamental tenets of\ninternational law in order to arrive at a just and lasting\nsolution which, in order to be acceptable, also implies\ncompromise in terms of detail, but not in terms of the\nessential issues.\nCroatia is very encouraged by the increasingly\nsuccessful peace developments in the Middle East, which\ndemonstrate the patience and wisdom of both the Israeli\nand the Arab sides. We firmly believe that similar positive\nendeavours are also possible in South-Eastern Europe and\nthe Balkans if they win the necessary united support and\ndetermination of the great Powers.\nCroatia welcomes the peaceful transfer of power to the\nmajority people in South Africa after decades of internal\nand regional instability. South Africa is the best proof that\nthere is no alternative to the equality of all citizens of a\nState.\nWe also welcome the involvement of the international\ncommunity in Rwanda, which, although it has not,\nunfortunately, prevented a human disaster on a scale\nbeyond description, has at least stopped the spiral of death\nand lawlessness. We continue to support the current efforts\nto stabilize Rwanda and to prevent the revival and\nexpansion of the conflict.\nThe agreement of the international community to\nfinally stop the agony of Haiti and establish a democratic\norder there is also encouraging. We similarly welcome\nthe successful processes of democratization and\nstabilization throughout Latin and Central America. We\nhave been following attentively the development of\nfunctional regional integration in North America, and the\nstronger integration trends in Europe, differences\nnotwithstanding, as well as the rapprochement between\nthe two largest countries in the European and Asian\nregions: Russia and China. We also welcome the\nconstructive role of Japan in the Pacific area and the Far\nEast.\nWithin the scope of such global developments, with\nthe major world Powers aiming not at reciprocal\ndestruction but at positive competition and cooperation,\nCroatia, as a small country, sees its place, first of all, in\nWest European civilization and in its economic and\nsecurity system in order to have a guarantee for its\nindependence, security and progress. Croatia sees its\nwelfare and stability in the achievement of full\nmembership in European integrative organizations.\nCroatia is prepared to responsibly assume its share of the\nburden in the development of the new international order\nand to constitute a strong link in the integration chain of\na new Europe.\nIn the very short time since it gained independence,\nCroatia has become a mature and responsible member of\nthe international community. It is already a pillar of\nfuture stability and cooperation in that part of\nsouthwestern Europe which is linked to the traditionally\nagitated Balkans. Croatia has in good faith accepted\ninternational mediation and United Nations peace-keeping\nforces in its territory in order to stop the war and reach a\npolitical solution that will simultaneously safeguard its\nterritorial integrity and the rights of national minorities\nwithin its borders. Croatia has accepted the\nwell-intentioned advice given it concerning the\nconstitutional position of the Serbian ethnic community in\nline with the highest standards of international\nconventions on the rights of national minorities, and has\nincorporated them into its constitutional law.\nCroatia has borne the heaviest brunt of the Bosnian\ncrisis and of the human catastrophe wrought by war in\nthat country. Croatia has provided a home or provisional\naccommodation to hundreds of thousands of refugees\nfrom Bosnia and Herzegovina. We sustained this effort\neven during the Croatian-Muslim conflicts that occurred\nas a result of Serbian aggression, as the victims of that\naggression sought space for their survival. We have\nprompted proposals on a mutual agreement on a\n8\n\n\nfederation between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, and their confederal alliance with Croatia,\nwhich eventually resulted in the signing of the Washington\nAgreements. We have spared no effort to end the senseless\nwar and renew cooperation between the Muslims and the\nCroats, who, owing to the indecision of the international\ncommunity, have been brought to the point of a desperate\nfight for the remnants of Bosnian living space left after the\nbarbarous Serbian aggression.\nIn circumstances affected by its intricate ethnic and\nhistorical heritage, Croatia has shown the highest degree of\ncooperation in the search for a peaceful political solution to\nthe crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia, believing,\nin spite of all of its negative experiences, in the final\nvictory of the principles of international law and in the\nnecessity to normalize relations between the newly emerged\nStates.\nHowever, this readiness to cooperate and this patience\nhave certain limits. Split into two parts by the occupation\nof one-fourth of its territory, threatened continuously by\noutlaw terrorism, burdened by the social pressure posed by\ndisplaced persons and the war-exhausted economy, Croatia\ncannot endlessly agree to fruitless compromise, because the\ncontinuation of the crisis threatens the existence of the State\nand the lives of its citizens, and prevents the reconstruction\nof the economy destroyed by war. We believe that it\nwould also be in the interest of the international community\nto give Croatia more determined and more consistent\nassistance so that it can successfully play its constructive\npart in the solution of the crisis.\nCroatia already is, and wants to remain, a mainstay of\nthe new international order and a bridge of cooperation\nbetween the newly emerged States on the basis of mutual\nrecognition. The indecision and aimless manoeuvring of\nthe international community in circumstances distinguished\nby the presence of militancy in certain circles of the parties\nin conflict threaten to push Croatia into a new military\nconflict which could be even worse than the previous one\nin terms of scope, depth and consequences. The\ninternational community should not leave Croatia without\na choice, in a position where it would be forced to resort on\nits own to all means necessary to defend its sovereignty,\nterritorial integrity and the right of its citizens - displaced\npersons - to return to the occupied areas.\nWe have always been aware that no crisis, particularly\none as intricate as this, can be solved without consensus by\nthe international community without a division of\nresponsibility and an agreed approach of the great Powers.\nAccordingly, we are the first, as with previous peace\nendeavours, to welcome the efforts of the Contact Group\nto find an acceptable solution.\nCroatia is prepared to continue its high degree of\ncooperation and partnership with the international\ncommunity if solutions for Bosnia and Herzegovina and\nfor the occupied Croatian areas are not sought at its\nexpense. Both crises - the one in Croatia and the other in\nBosnia and Herzegovina - have the same source: Serbian\naggression. Because of this, and in view of the\nincreasingly stronger cooperation between Croatia and\nBosnia and Herzegovina, a package solution should be\nsought. Since the sanctions imposed by the international\ncommunity have forced Belgrade to accept the proposal\nto end the war and the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs,\nwho oppose it, Belgrade should also be made to desist\nfrom supporting the Croatian Serbs, who refuse to agree\nto the reintegration of occupied Croatian areas and\nbrazenly oppose the implementation of all Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nIn terms of its actual consequences, the 1991 arms\nembargo was aimed first and foremost at the victims of\nSerbian aggression. It was accepted at a time when those\nwho formulated global policy mistakenly deceived\nthemselves into thinking that that policy could save\nYugoslavia, failing to see that the post-Tito crisis had\ndeveloped because of the attempt to impose Serbian\nhegemony over all non-Serbian peoples in that artificial\nand Communist State formation. Our conditional restraint\nwith regard to the lifting of the embargo is motivated at\npresent exclusively by an endeavour focused on\nachieving, after all, a peaceful solution over the next few\nweeks or months. Croatia does not want to be drawn into\na new war against its will, but it will be forced to accept\nit, in cooperation with the other victims of Serbian\naggression, if the international community fails to achieve\na peaceful solution that would not only put an end to the\nwar in Bosnia and Herzegovina but also bring about the\nreintegration of occupied Croatian areas.\nCroatia welcomes Belgrade\u2019s announced readiness to\nisolate the Bosnian Serbs, with their suicidal war option,\nbut expects Belgrade to do the same with regard to the\ninsurgent Serbs in Croatia. Croatia demands that the\nlifting of sanctions against Serbia (Yugoslavia) be linked\nalso to the cessation of the occupation of Croatian areas,\nthat is, to their reintegration into Croatia\u2019s constitutional\nand legal system. Moreover, the lifting of sanctions can\nbe considered only after we have seen whether the\n9\n\n\nannounced isolation is truly enforced and after this has been\nverified by credible control mechanisms.\nIn order to promote positive trends, we also\nunderstand up to a point the partial symbolic suspension of\nsanctions in order to encourage in Serbia those currently\nexpressing their commitment to peace. Nevertheless,\nCroatia will continue to insist that the lifting of certain\nsanctions against Belgrade, particularly those related to its\nbeing fully released from international economic and all\nother isolation, be linked to the solution of the problem of\nthe occupied Croatian areas.\nCroatia has shown a great deal of patience in its\ndialogue with insurgent Serbs, but now, after three years of\noccupation, it demands from the international community a\nredefinition of the UNPROFOR mandate that will provide\nfor the implementation of Security Council resolutions 769\n(1992) and 871 (1993), and force the Croatian Serbs to\naccept gradual normalization and reintegration pursuant to\nthe adopted peace plan.\nWe realize that both sides, after any conflict, have to\ninvest much time and effort into restoring and strengthening\nmutual confidence. We are also quite aware that no\nlong-term stability and progress is possible in Croatia\nwithout guaranteed human and ethnic rights to the Serbian\nand other minority groups. We have indeed guaranteed\nsuch rights by a special constitutional law enacted three\nyears ago, but we urge the international community to\ncreate conditions for the implementation of this law in\naccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nWe have also recently taken the decision to speed up the\nestablishment of the human rights tribunal, and are prepared\nto accept international supervision of compliance with\nhuman and ethnic rights. However, the leaders of the\nSerbian insurgents, and their patrons in Belgrade, should\nforget their idea of a Greater Serbia and accept the\nreintegration of occupied Croatian areas on such\nfoundations, to their own benefit and to the benefit of the\nentire community. We are prepared to accept gradual\nreintegration through the opening of communications, the\nreturn of populations, the reconstruction of destroyed towns\nand villages, and provisions for social welfare and legal\nprotection. The democratic Government of Croatia is\nprepared - while urging the resolution of the fundamental\npolitical issue: the restoration of the sovereignty of the\nCroatian State over occupied areas - to genuinely comply\nwith all guarantees related to the rights of the Serbian\nethnic community.\nIn keeping with its peaceful policy, Croatia is also\nprepared to normalize relations between Belgrade and\nZagreb. To this end we shall accept any meeting leading\nto the recognition of the Republic of Croatia by Belgrade,\nwithin its internationally recognized borders, which would\nmake the message to the insurgent Serbs regarding the\nnecessity of gradual reintegration quite unambiguous.\nFor this reason we have also raised the problem\nregarding the parts of the Republic of Croatia occupied by\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before the General\nAssembly, because there is indisputable evidence as to the\ncomprehensive integration - in military, judicial, customs\nand monetary terms - of occupied Croatian areas into the\neconomic and legal system of Serbia, or the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. We would like to thank the vast\nmajority of States in the General Assembly that have\nalready given us their support in this matter. If Belgrade\nshould express its readiness to recognize the Croatian\nState in the meantime, and to genuinely support\nreintegration and normalization, we would be pleased to\nspare the General Assembly the task of dealing with this\nproblem any further.\nWe would also like to thank the General Assembly\nfor its support for the post-war rebuilding of Croatia, and\nwe expect members\u2019 continued understanding in this\nmatter.\nIn particular, we would like to emphasize that any\nnormalization of relations - diplomatic, political or\neconomic - on equal footing between the Republic of\nCroatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will not\naffect partnership and cooperation between the Croats and\nthe Muslims in the realization of the Washington\nAgreements on the Croat-Muslim Federation in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, and its confederation with Croatia.\nNo peace in the Balkans is possible without the\nestablishment of a balance of forces, nor does the future\nof any people lie in endless reciprocal military exhaustion\nor in blocking development throughout the region. We\ntherefore genuinely endorse the normalization of\nCroat-Serbian relations, but also the implementation of\nthe Washington Agreements, which are in our view not\nonly a tactical manoeuvre by the victims of Serbian\naggression but also a development creating the\npreconditions for ensuring full equality to the Croats as a\nnumerically smaller constituent people in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. We see in this a pledge of future regional\nstability and balance of forces. The confederal link\nbetween the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\n10\n\n\nthe Republic of Croatia provides the foundations for\nsustaining the sound political and economic relations\nsuggested by history, the geographical link and geopolitical\nrealities. By agreeing to a confederal relationship, Croatia\nis also prepared, with the assistance of primarily Western\ncountries, to assume its share of the responsibility for\ncurbing the smoldering, extreme national and religious\ntrends on all sides, the spread of which could jeopardize\nstability not only in this part of South-Eastern Europe but\nalso in the greater area.\nCroatia also attaches importance to the strengthening\nand realization of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nand its confederation with Croatia, the progress of which\ndepends both on mutual relations and on the action taken\nby the international community in the coming months, for\nthis establishes a political and economic bridge with the\nIslamic world. Along these lines we have already\nestablished close cooperation with Islamic countries\nfostering identical aspirations, such as Turkey, Jordan and\nothers.\nDecisive weeks and months, in which we must\nstruggle for a peaceful resolution to the grave crisis in the\narea of the former Yugoslavia, lie ahead of us. Not only\nthe parties in conflict, but first and foremost the principal\nactors of the international community, bear a huge\nresponsibility at this moment. This involves not only the\ndecision on the fate of the United Nations Protection Force\nmandate in Bosnia and Herzegovina but also whether the\nContact Group will succeed in sustaining a united\noperational basis for a solution or allow the situation to\nfounder into a new military nightmare. The efforts of the\ninternational community focused on building a new\ninternational order are now being put to the test, more\nstrikingly than anywhere else, on reversing the\nconsequences of the aggression against Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and Croatia. We can ultimately resolve this\ncrisis if each of us assumes his share of the responsibility.\nHatred must give way to happy children\u2019s faces in\nreconstructed Croatian Vukovar, to the restored splendour\nof medieval Dubrovnik, to peaceful coexistence in long--\nsuffering and destroyed Sarajevo and Mostar.\nIn order to achieve this, we must overcome the\ndisastrous war and political crisis by joint efforts and by a\nwell-devised vision of a new international order in this part\nof the world, in the interest of the entire global order and\nof the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "More than anyone else, Sir, you are aware of\nwhat excellent and solid relations of cooperation,\nfriendship and fraternity have existed for many years now\nbetween your country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Togo. It is thus\nwith great joy and enormous pride that my country\nwelcomes your unanimous election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.\n5\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nI therefore wish, on behalf of the Government of\nTogo, in the name of my delegation, and in my own\ncapacity, to congratulate you most sincerely on this tribute\nto you and to your fraternal country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nThe Togolese delegation and I myself assure you of\nour support. We are convinced that your competence and\nyour long experience in international affairs augur well for\nthe success of our work.\nI should like to take this occasion to congratulate your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, the\nPermanent Representative of Guyana, who, with\neffectiveness and tact, guided the proceedings of the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. We extend\nour congratulations as well to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, who has dedicated himself to the\nnoble ideals of this Organization to which we all belong.\nWe reiterate to him the total support of the delegation of\nTogo.\nSouth Africa has returned from a long voyage. We\nhave at last seen the death of apartheid. My country is\nproud to have contributed to reversing that odious system.\nTogo has always supported the legitimate aspirations of\npeoples oppressed the world over, but in particular the\naspirations of the black majority of South Africa, whose\nfundamental rights, even the most elementary among them,\nwere long trampled.\nIt is therefore with great joy that my country,\nrecognizing the courage, dedication and sacrifice of the\nSouth African nation, welcomes the return to the United\nNations of that fraternal country, which is now free and\ncommitted to waging \u2014 together with all the States\nMembers of this Organization \u2014 the necessary fight for\ndemocracy and for the total independence of other peoples.\nIn 1995, our Organization will celebrate its fiftieth\nanniversary. A new era of hope lies ahead for our nations.\nUnfortunately that era of hope also contains concerns,\ndisquiet at the increasing impoverishment of the poorest\ncountries, concern too about a world constantly devastated\nby conflicts and difficulties of all types. The period of\nupheaval in which we live presents our Organization with\na challenge \u2014 that of understanding all the major changes\nthat are under way and of finding rapid solutions to the\nmany problems confronting our planet.\nIt is therefore urgent to redefine the broad guidelines\nof the Organization on the basis of greater humanism on\nthe global level, so that man can again regain the strength\nto better exercise his freedom, to enjoy it fully, to respect\nthe laws of nature, and to break away from egoism and\nhard-heartedness. We must also lay new foundations for\ncooperation to help the United Nations not only to\neliminate the consequences of the cold war, but also to\nsolve the problems of today and those of tomorrow. This\nis the only way to respond to the expectations of our\npeoples and to respect the spirit of those who, 50 years\nago, created our world Organization, with the purpose,\namong other things, of preventing conflicts for the peace\nof nations and the well-being of peoples. The\nimplementation of the relevant recommendations\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General, an\nAgenda for Peace, should, to this end, prompt us to focus\nour action, urgently, on preventive measures, to establish\nstable foundations for the harmonious development of\nsociety and to resolve its problems by developing flexible\nand appropriate mechanisms within the framework of the\nreforms now under way.\nThere are clear grounds for optimism when we see\nthat the adversaries of yesterday have become the allies\nof today, seeking together peaceful and mutually\nadvantageous solutions to the international problems of\nthe day. We therefore have all the more reason to have\nfaith in the future of our Organization. Planning for the\nfuture rather than waiting to be overtaken by events\nshould be the watchword of our nations.\nOn the internal level, my country has undertaken to\nembark on the path of democracy based on a complete\nand responsible multiparty system in order to establish a\nState based on law and on respect for the individual.\nFollowing the adoption of a new constitution in\nSeptember 1992, presidential and legislative elections\nwere held in August 1993 and in February 1994\nrespectively, leading to the establishment on 25 May last\nof a Government of national union whose programme of\naction aims basically at building a new Togo, democratic\nand free, at shaping national unity, at reconciling the\npeople with itself, at rallying this people around its\nnation, its values and its flag, in peace and regained\nharmony, and at rebuilding an economy damaged under\nthe combined effects of a range of factors both national\nand international.\nOf course, all of this cannot be accomplished in just\na few months; it takes time to overcome resentment, to\nreconcile the adversaries of the past, to establish the state\n6\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nof law to which all aspire, to rebuild confidence and to lay\nthe foundations of a solid and prosperous economy.\nIn spite of the end of the cold war, we see disorder\nconstantly blurring the geopolitical landscape. The situation\nnow prevailing in Africa is hardly encouraging. The\ncontinent, marginalized, awakens only the minds of the\nmost attentive observers, when, across mountains and\nvalleys, they hear the cries of anguish and death. The cases\nof Rwanda, Angola, Liberia, Somalia and Mozambique\nsuffice to illustrate this bitter fact.\n\nThe defeat of the system of apartheid in South Africa\nand the tragic events in Rwanda illustrate the two extremes\nin the evolution of the African continent, characterized by\nthe contrast between hope and despair, progress and\ndestruction. While, at the present time, South Africa seems\nto represent hope, Rwanda, on the contrary, symbolizes the\nface of an Africa mutilated and ravaged.\nTogo appeals to the Government of Angola and to\nUNITA to show goodwill and the flexibility that is\nnecessary if a speedy and comprehensive settlement of the\nquestion is to be achieved in the framework of the Lusaka\ntalks.\nIn Liberia, despite a number of agreements, the\ndisarmament of the factions has not yet occurred, and the\ngeneral elections that it was hoped would take place seem\nto be becoming a mirage. Let us hope that good faith will\nfind its way into the hearts of the parties concerned so that\nthis fraternal country may regain the advantages of\nreconciliation and find again the path of development.\nAs for Somalia, Togo appeals to the international\ncommunity not to grow weary and leave that country. We\ntherefore invite the parties to the conflict to refrain from\ncontributing to discouragement and to resume real dialogue\naimed at the rapid establishment of reliable national\ninstitutions.\nIn respect of Western Sahara, my delegation supports\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s report on the question and urges all\nthe parties to cooperate fully with the United Nations to\nensure that the referendum on self-determination, to be held\nin February 1995 for the purpose of deciding the future of\nthe territory and its people, is organized effectively.\nThe Togolese Government is gratified at the recent\npositive development in the socio-political situation in\nBurundi and invites the new leaders to do all in their\npower to secure the definitive restoration of peace in that\ncountry.\nTogo supports unreservedly the efforts of the\nSecretary-General and of the Security Council to bring\npeace to Mozambique. It invites the parties to commit\nthemselves totally to accepting and respecting the results\nof the forthcoming general elections.\nFaced with this situation of armed conflict, tension\nand insecurity, Africa must shoulder its responsibilities.\nIt is through its own efforts that the African continent will\nbe able to overcome the difficulties it faces today. This\nis the sense of the proposal that General Gnassinmgb\u00e9\nEyadema, President of the Republic of Togo, made to the\nTunis Summit of the Organization of African Unity in\nJune 1994, when he advocated the creation of an African\npeace force whose mission would be to ensure peace\nwhere it is threatened by acting as a buffer between the\nbelligerents and making possible a negotiated solution to\nconflicts. The delegation of Togo is delighted that this\nidea aroused a great deal of interest on the part of certain\nlarge Powers that are prepared to provide logistical\nsupport for such a buffer force.\nThe unprecedented positive development of the\npeace process in the Middle East, reflected over the past\n12 months in the Israeli-Palestinian accord of September\n1993 and in the historic Washington D.C. meeting of\n25 July 1994 between His Majesty King Hussein of the\nHashimite Kingdom of Jordan and Prime Minister\nYitzhak Rabin of Israel, opens up before us a horizon of\nhope. These encouraging developments are important\nsteps in the direction of peace. They demonstrate clearly\nthat disputes can be settled effectively only through\npeaceful means and that only resolute political will can\nhelp to build a peaceful society.\nIn total agreement with the initiators of and the\nprotagonists at these gatherings, my country asks the\nUnited Nations, all Governments of the region and\nespecially the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to continue\nthe negotiations with a view to the establishment of a\nglobal, definitive and lasting peace in that part of the\nworld to enable all States concerned with the Arab-Israeli\nconflict to live henceforth within secure borders\nrecognized by all, on the basis of mutual respect for the\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence\nof States.\n7\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nAs regards the future of the Palestinian people, the\ntransition period, which is just beginning, must be\nsustained, not only politically but also, and above all,\nthrough financial, economic and technical assistance from\nthe international community. The United Nations will\ntherefore have to assume its responsibilities fully until the\nPalestinian question is definitively and satisfactorily\nresolved in all its aspects.\nIn the eastern part of Europe the situation is still\nconstantly characterized by violence and by an explosion of\nnationalism. States have been dislocated, borders have\nbeen called into question, and dreams of annexation and of\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d inspire and haunt both minds and hearts.\nDrawing lessons, as is imperative, from all these\ntragedies and conflicts, the United Nations must promote\nand encourage further the use by States of the principle of\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. Of course, the\nOrganization has in recent years clearly demonstrated its\nusefulness, especially in the fields of humanitarian affairs\nand the maintenance of peace. But sometimes lack of will\nto act promptly paralyses its action. This paralysis reveals\nprofound shortcomings in the system of collective security\nprovided for in the Charter and is due, above all, to the\nrefusal of many Member States to commit themselves to\npeace, despite the special responsibilities entrusted to them\nby the Charter.\nThis being the case, it is clear that, as it makes\ndecisions about the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, the Security Council should be broadened and,\nthereby, adapted to the changes in the world of today.\nTogo believes that the United Nations is the most\nappropriate forum for the creation of a new international\norder and the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, as well as for the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nThat is why we support its actions. We demonstrated this,\ninter alia, in the framework of peace-keeping operations by\nsending military contingents and police officers to Rwanda,\nWestern Sahara and Mozambique to serve under the flag of\nthe United Nations.\nProfoundly committed to peace and to the principle of\ngeneral and complete disarmament, Togo rejoices in the\nmany positive developments that have taken place in this\nfield over recent months. But we remain concerned at the\nconstantly increasing proliferation of conventional weapons.\nThe massive international transfers of such weapons\ndangerously compromise the success of effective general\ndisarmament. It has become urgent to strengthen the role\nand the capacity for action of the United Nations regional\ncentres for peace and disarmament, which are at present\npoorly structured and lack both the material and the\nhuman resources they need to function properly and\nproduce the results the international community expects\nof them.\nThe particularly alarming case of the United Nations\nRegional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, of\nwhich my country is honoured to be the headquarters, is\nquite illustrative, and should be examined with care. For,\nparadoxically, while the African continent is prey to\nviolent and constant civil wars, which endanger regional\nand international peace and security, the Centre, which\nthe United Nations could well have used to contribute to\nthe quest for appropriate solutions to these conflicts, is,\neither by design or by circumstance, left out and its\nexistence is almost ignored.\nAs regards the nuclear problem on the Korean\npeninsula, my delegation welcomes the agreement\nrecently reached between the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea and the United States of America. It\nalso welcomes the readiness expressed by the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea to comply with the provisions\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons. Togo views this courageous position adopted\nby the North Korean party as edifying testimony of its\ndetermination to maintain peace in the region.\nThe world economy continues to be characterized by\ntrends toward stagnation and the growing disparity\nbetween North and South.\nAs we prepare to enter the third millennium, the\nelimination of poverty should be one of the main\nobjectives of our Organization. In this context, the World\nSummit for Social Development, which the Government\nof Denmark has offered to host in March 1995 in\nCopenhagen, assumes its full importance. Togo fervently\nhopes that Member States will demonstrate political will\nand, in a surge of collective responsibility, give this\nSummit the attention necessary to obtain concrete results\nand practical decisions whose implementation should lead\nto the true elimination of poverty, the creation of\ngenuinely productive jobs and the complete integration of\nmarginalized or excluded sectors of society.\nDuring the last 15 years, there have been many\nobstacles to growth in our countries, including the decline\nin foreign capital, the debt crisis, and the constant decline\nin public development assistance, whose level is clearly\nshort of the target 0.7 per cent of gross national product\n8\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nthat was set and strongly recommended by the United\nNations. All of this leads to widespread poverty,\naggravated by structural adjustment programmes that have\ninsupportable social effects.\nThere has been constant regression in Africa\u2019s share\nof world trade. The recent Marrakesh agreements that\nresulted from long and difficult international negotiations in\nthe Uruguay Round, far from meeting the expectations of\nthe developing countries in general and of Africa in\nparticular, are likely to lead to new imbalances in\ninternational trade which may require more than a decade\nto redress.\nIn this respect, my delegation views the Agenda for\nDevelopment proposed to us by the Secretary-General as a\ntimely initiative, offering as it does an opportunity to begin\na process of constructive dialogue and political mobilization\nto create a true and just partnership that can engage in\nbetter consideration of development issues.\nTogether with the Group of 77 and China, Togo\nstrongly supports the idea that this Agenda should build an\ninternational consensus for the global liberalization of trade,\non the one hand as an effective means for international\ncooperation for development, and on the other to give new\nimpetus to the efforts made over the last decade to avoid\nprotectionist policies.\nIf the transition of the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade into the World Trade Organization is to be\nsmooth, there must be a mechanism that can compensate\nthe developing countries affected by the new system.\nAlong these lines, the implementation of the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s,\nadopted by the General Assembly in 1991, and the\nimplementation of the Paris Declaration and the Programme\nof Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s,\nadopted in 1990, should, in our opinion, be geared to an\nincrease in the volume of official development assistance,\nthe promotion of respect for commitments that have been\nundertaken for new and additional resources\nfor international cooperation, and a greater lightening of the\ndebt burden, or even its cancellation. It would be desirable\nto adopt policies that ensured an adequate flow\nof concessional financing to the developing countries, in\nparticular to the least developed among them; stimulated\nother flows of capital, including direct investment; reversed\nthe negative trend in financial\nflows, and created mechanisms and allocated resources\nrelated to development.\nIt can never be overemphasized that sustainable\ndevelopment is a prerequisite to lasting peace. The right\nto development must be considered, henceforth, as a\nfundamental human right, and thus be given priority\nattention by the international community. Along these\nlines, my Government hopes that, in addition to the\nresults of the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, held in Cairo from 5 to 13 September last,\nthe work of the World Summit for Social Development,\nof the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in\nBeijing in September 1995, and of the Second United\nNations Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT\nII), to be held in Istanbul from 3 to 14 June 1996, will\nhelp produce at the international level a spirit of shared\nresponsibility and the necessary political will to mobilize\nthe resources that are indispensable if our developing\ncountries are to thrive.\nAgenda 21 and the Rio Declaration are an important\nbridge on the road to sustainable development and to the\nprotection of the Earth from the dangers facing it. That\nis why, two years ago, all the participants in the\nConference showed such enthusiasm and sincerity.\nRegrettably, the results of that historic summit have still\nnot been reflected in concrete facts. No notable progress\nhas yet been observed in the implementation of the\nrecommendations contained, in particular, in the\nProgramme of Action. It is high time that States and the\ninternational community did everything in their power, at\nthe national, regional and international levels, to put into\neffect the commitments to sustainable development\nundertaken in Rio.\nThe Togolese Government welcomes the entry into\nforce of the Framework Convention on Climate Change\nand is particularly delighted at the conclusion of another\nlegal instrument of global scope: the International\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Countries\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\nParticularly in Africa. The Convention was adopted by\nthe intergovernmental negotiating Committee in Paris in\nJune 1994. Togo was pleased to take part in the\nnegotiating process and will soon take up the procedures\nfor signature and ratification. We invite all States\nMembers of the United Nations to do likewise in order\nthat the Convention and related instruments may enter\ninto force as soon as possible.\n9\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nConsidering the uncertain future of mankind and the\nnumerous and formidable challenges confronting the human\nrace, it is imperative that we become clearly aware of our\nmoral obligations. As of this moment it is essential to\nidentify and correct the weaknesses and failings of our\nOrganization. The reforms under way are indispensable,\nbut they must not become a means of conferring even\ngreater influence than in the past on the large countries and\nrichest Powers in the world. Our new awareness must also\nhelp define ways of establishing relations among nations in\nthe future, and in dealing with our present-day concerns we\nmust take into account the causes of the disparities in\nstandards of living between North and South. There is no\neffect without a cause, and to deny the principle of\ncausality amounts to deferring our problems and never\nsolving them.\nOnly an attitude based on action, justice and\ninternational solidarity can spare the world a conflict that\nwould otherwise, sooner or later, be inevitable. Thus,\ntackling the deep-rooted causes of today\u2019s problems means\nseeking together the solutions that will make it possible for\nmen, women and children to live decently and in complete\nfreedom, without fear of being crushed by unemployment,\npoverty and hunger. This would also make it possible to\nprotect the dignity of the human person and to safeguard\nhuman security.\nTomorrow we should have a world in which all\nnations and all citizens refuse to listen to the voice of their\nown personal interests when they run counter to the\ncommon weal, a world in which nations and peoples find\nsatisfaction not only in that which is to their own advantage\nbut also in that which is to everyone\u2019s advantage.\nAt its forty-ninth session, may the General Assembly,\nunder the leadership of its President, contribute to dispelling\nour concerns and to defining the ways and means of\nhelping us blaze the way into the future. This is my\ndelegation\u2019s most fervent hope.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of Myanmar\nwould like to congratulate you most warmly, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\nninth session and to assure you of our fullest cooperation\nin the discharge of your responsibilities. We are\nconfident that the wealth of experience and wisdom that\nyou bring with you will prove invaluable in guiding us\nsuccessfully through the present session.\nWe also wish to express our appreciation to the\noutgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Rudolph\nInsanally, for his sagacious and outstanding stewardship\nof the previous session of the General Assembly.\nIn South Africa, four decades of the despicable\nsystem of apartheid have finally been laid to rest. The\nelection of President Nelson Mandela by the country's\nfirst multiracial Parliament has given birth to a united,\ndemocratic and non-racial South Africa. A nation that\nhas so courageously overcome such adversity and\noverwhelming pressure deserves our support and acclaim\nas it faces its future with optimism. I am pleased to see\nthe delegation of South Africa rejoining us in this\nAssembly. Its presence here reflects the momentous\nchanges taking place in the world today. The concerted\neffort to abolish apartheid in South Africa has finally\nsucceeded. We welcome our brothers from South Africa,\nwish them every success in rebuilding their nation and\nlook forward to working closely with their Government\nand people.\nThe importance of adhering to the five principles of\npeace coexistence that form the basic tenets of Myanmar's\nforeign policy bears reiteration. Myanmar, together with\nthe People's Republic of China and India, enunciated\nthose principles nearly five decades ago. These time-\ntested principles have crystallized as the universally\naccepted legal norms of inter-State relations. In strict\nobservance of these principles, Myanmar has never\nallowed, and will never allow, its territory to be used as\na springboard for action or threats against another State.\nBy the same token, Myanmar expects that other nations\nwill likewise abide by these principles in their conduct of\npolicy towards Myanmar.\nAt this time of dramatic and profound changes, the\nUnited Nations represents the best hope for mankind in\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and in\nthe promotion of international cooperation in other areas\nof human endeavour. Whatever character and shape the\nemerging new international order may eventually assume,\nwe have no doubt that the United Nations will constitute\n6\n\n\na vital element in that new order and will continue to play\nan increasingly important role in international relations. As\nwe approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\nit is the appropriate time for us to rededicate ourselves to\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter and to redouble\nour efforts to further strengthen the role of the world\nOrganization. In order to mark this auspicious anniversary\nin a fitting manner, we have formed a high-level National\nCommittee in my country to carry out necessary\npreparatory work and to coordinate commemorative\nactivities at the national level.\nMyanmar firmly believes that the United Nations plays\na pivotal role in promoting international cooperation for\ndevelopment and for the maintenance of peace and security.\nThere is a close link between peace and development; it is\ntherefore the view of my delegation that the Agenda for\nPeace and the Agenda for Development must go hand in\nhand. Now that the cold war is over and the avenues for\npeace and development are more pronounced, we would\nlike to call upon the international community to create a\nfavourable environment that ensures sustainable\ndevelopment.\nMy delegation shares the view that at the present time\nthe search for security and peace in the world lies in\ndevelopment, not in armaments. For most people\nthroughout the world, and particularly in developing\ncountries, any feeling of insecurity arises more out of\nanxieties about daily subsistence than out of the dread of a\ncataclysmic global conflict. Underdevelopment creates\npoverty, hunger, malnutrition, environmental degradation\nand so on, collectively leading to civil strife, ethnic\nconflicts and, eventually, the collapse of peace and security.\nThese problems may in some instances be confined within\nnational borders; however, some will definitely have\ninternational and even global ramifications and\nconsequences.\nBoth \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d and \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment\u201d are top-priority tasks facing the United\nNations, and they deserve equal attention and equal\nallocation of resources. United Nations peace-keeping\nmissions are stretched out across the globe, and United\nNations agencies for development and humanitarian affairs\nfan out over an even wider area. Myanmar shares the view\nthat economic and social developments are prerequisites for\nlasting peace and security. We would therefore like to see\na strengthening of the Economic and Social Council in\ntandem with the call for a restructuring of the Security\nCouncil to respond adequately to the new challenges of\ninternational peace and security that have emerged in the\nwake of the cold war. Fifty years ago, against a political\nbackground that was very different from today's, the\nUnited Nations was born with the purposes of maintaining\ninternational peace and security, promoting development\nand safeguarding human rights. Now that the cold war is\nover and the international community is free from the\nsuper-Power rivalry that so crippled the United Nations in\nthe past, the Organization should be restructured to meet\nthe needs and challenges of the present-day world.\nPeace-keeping is an area in which the United\nNations is being called to take on increasing\nresponsibilities. These operations constitute an important\ninstrument of the world Organization in the prevention\nand containment of conflicts and in keeping peace where\nit is most needed. Peace-keeping operations have a\nmixed record of successes and some set-backs.\nExperience and lessons from past operations should be\ncarefully reviewed and re-evaluated to ensure the more\neffective and proper conduct of such operations. It is\nimperative that United Nations peace-keeping operations\nbe carried out only with the consent and willing\ncooperation of the parties concerned and that all aspects\nof such operations strictly conform to the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations Charter. There is also a\nneed for such operations to be rationalized, streamlined\nand made more cost effective.\nIn the field of disarmament we are encouraged by\nthe positive developments of last year. Intensive\nnegotiations are now under way in the Geneva-based\nConference on Disarmament to achieve a comprehensive\nnuclear-test-ban treaty. The steadily increasing trust and\nconfidence between nuclear- and non-nuclear-weapon\nStates has provided an opportunity for the international\ncommunity to come to grips with the prevention of the\nvertical and horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nThis opportunity should be seized by bringing the\nnegotiations on the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty\nto a successful conclusion in the most expeditious way.\nThe United States has announced its decision to extend\nthe moratorium for one year until September 1995. We\nbelieve that such a moratorium, if also observed by other\nnuclear-weapon States, would create conditions conducive\nto the ongoing process of negotiating a comprehensive\nnuclear-test-ban treaty.\nThe review and extension Conference of the States\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) is less than a year away. We are of the\nview that substantive progress in crucial areas, namely the\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, negative security\n7\n\n\nassurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and a ban on the\nproduction of nuclear fissile material in all its aspects, will\ncontribute to a successful outcome of the review\nConference. A careful evaluation of the progress achieved\nin these crucial areas should be made before taking a\ndecision at the review Conference on the further extension\nof the Treaty. Myanmar looks forward to working and\ncooperating with other delegations for the successful\noutcome of the 1995 review and extension Conference.\nWhile I am on the subject of the NPT, may I take this\nopportunity to inform the Assembly that, as a State Party to\nthe Treaty, the Myanmar Government has decided to sign\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards\nAgreement and Protocol. The signing of the Agreement\nand Protocol will take place in the near future.\nMyanmar is also actively taking part in the preparatory\nprocess for the implementation of the chemical weapons\nConvention since becoming an original signatory to it.\nLike other signatories to the Convention, the ratification\nprocess is currently under way in Myanmar.\nThe signature on 4 May 1994 of the agreement to\nimplement the Israel-Palestine Declaration of Principles\nmarks an important milestone towards a lasting peace in the\nMiddle East. The recent approval by the Israeli Cabinet of\nthe transfer of civilian powers to the Palestinians in the\nareas of culture, youth and sports, international cooperation,\neducation, health, social welfare, tourism and finance is\nanother positive step that will further pave the way to self-\nrule by the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. We\ncongratulate the parties concerned for their courage and\nmutual accommodation. We are also heartened to note that\nboth Israel and Jordan are implementing the Washington\nDeclaration signed by both parties in July. It is hoped that\nthese initiatives, in the context of both bilateral and\nmultilateral negotiations, will facilitate and brighten the\nchances of lasting peace in the Middle East.\nAfter years of recession and stagnation the world\neconomy has resumed a modest growth. However, the\nrecovery remains fragile and uneven, and it is in the\ninterests of both developing and developed countries to\nstrive for accelerated growth and sustainable development.\nWhile a number of developing countries have acted as the\nmain engines of world economic growth, most of them are\nbeset by a deteriorating economic and social situation.\nDeveloped countries are also facing slow growth and high\nunemployment. In this era of growing globalization and\ninterdependence, concerted efforts by the world community\nare urgently needed to resolve the acute economic and\nsocial problems.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General's report, \u201cAn\nAgenda for Development\u201d, as most timely and\nappropriate. The report has highlighted economic growth\nas a crucial dimension of development and has singled\nout a supportive and favourable international economic\nenvironment for sustained growth. We fully share the\nview that the advancement of developing countries is\nbeing hindered by such obstacles as external-debt\nproblems, declining external resource flows, sharply\ndeteriorating terms of trade and mounting barriers to\nmarket access. We hope that the programme of action on\nthe implementation of the agenda will be agreed upon at\nthis session.\nOur aspirations for a new world economic order\nwhich is equitable and non-discriminatory have not yet\nbeen realized. The major challenges of these decades \u2014\nacceleration of development, alleviation of poverty,\nnarrowing the widening gap among countries \u2014 need to\nbe addressed on an urgent basis. We fully support the\ncall by the Group of 77, the Non-Aligned Movement and\nthe Assembly for the resumption of the stalled North-\nSouth dialogue. A constructive dialogue based on\ncommon interests and mutual benefits should enhance\ninternational economic cooperation for development.\nWe also welcome the successful conclusion of the\nUruguay Round, although our aspirations were not fully\nrealized. We had hoped for an open, equitable and\ntransparent multilateral trading system which would\nbenefit all countries. We are most concerned with new\nforms of protectionism, particularly the attempts to\nimpose social and environmental conditions that\ndiscriminate against exports from developing countries.\nThese protectionist measures will adversely affect world\ntrade and growth.\nWe are heartened by the Communiqu\u00e9 issued\nfollowing the Naples Summit of the Group of Seven,\nwhich states that the Seven will continue efforts to\nenhance development assistance, trade and investment in\ndeveloping countries. It states also that the Seven favour\na reduction in the stock of debt and an increase in\nconcessionality for those countries facing special\ndifficulties.\nMy delegation notes with appreciation the report of\nthe Secretary-General on the status and role of\ncooperatives in the light of new economic and social\n8\n\n\ntrends and welcomes the recommendations contained\ntherein. Today, cooperative societies constitute significant\ncomponents of the economies of developed and developing\ncountries alike and play a crucial role in their economic\ndevelopment.\nIn my country, we attach great importance to the\ncooperative sector as one of the main pillars of our\neconomy and as an effective means of accelerating\nsocio-economic development. It is an important part of the\neconomic strategy of the Myanmar Government to promote\nand expand the cooperative sector in our national economy.\nAs we shall next year be celebrating the centenary of the\nestablishment of the International Cooperative Alliance, it\nis most fitting that the Assembly should proclaim the first\nSaturday of July 1995 the International Day of Cooperatives\nand that Member States should observe this day in future\nyears as an annual event.\nThe Earth Summit held in Rio two years ago firmly\nplaced environmental issues on the global agenda, and since\nthen hardly any international meeting has taken place\nwithout calls for common action to save our planet. The\nprotection and promotion of the environment has emerged\nas one of the most pressing issues facing the world. No\nlonger is the natural world perceived as a vast and\ninexhaustible frontier to be explored and exploited. Today\nthere is growing recognition that the environment is not to\nbe subjugated, but is to be treated with respect and care.\nAn increasing number of countries now recognize that\nenvironmental issues warrant as much attention and effort\nas issues such as disarmament, narcotics and human rights.\nMyanmar is pleased to note that, in all of this, the\nregion of Asia and the Pacific has not been left behind. A\nregional meeting to prepare for the 1995 report on the state\nof the environment was held in Yangon in July this year.\nThis meeting provided senior Government officials with an\nopportunity to discuss, in an integrated manner, issues\nrelated to the assessment of the state of the environment at\nthe national and regional levels.\nThe region of Asia and the Pacific comprises a large\nnumber of nations differing in size, resource endowment\nand stage of economic development. It is a region facing\nall the conceivable environmental problems of the world -\ndeforestation, desertification, climate change, and so on.\nWhile several countries of the region, particularly those in\nSouth-East and North-East Asia, have registered remarkable\neconomic growth in the last few decades; others have yet\nto achieve their objectives.\nIn many of our countries the eradication of poverty\nand greater equity in income distribution remain major\nchallenges. Poverty and environmental degradation are\nclosely related. Therefore, the alleviation of poverty is no\nlonger simply a moral issue; it is a practical imperative.\nAt the same time, achieving sustainable development will\nrequire that all countries, particularly the developed\ncountries, change their consumption patterns.\nIn the past we have tended to focus more on\nremedial measures than on the causes of environmental\ndegradation. But if we are to overcome the challenges\nthat we face we must deal with the underlying causes.\nAs in the case of health care, prevention is just as\nimportant as, if not more important than, cure. We must\ntherefore formulate strategies that will set out to alleviate\npoverty and provide the basic needs \u2014 food, water,\nclothing, shelter, energy and health care \u2014 of our\npeoples, while protecting the environment.\nAware of the fact that poverty is the fundamental\ncause of environmental degradation, we in Myanmar are\nconcentrating on breaking the vicious circle of poverty\nand environmental degradation. With a view to\nremedying the situation, the Government launched in\n1989 a programme for the development of border areas\nand national races. This integrated approach is expected\nto generate higher incomes and productivity by providing\nemployment opportunities and increased welfare.\nThe border areas, which are inhabited by the national\nraces, have lagged far behind in all aspects of\ndevelopment, owing mainly to the difficult terrain and the\nlack of an adequate infrastructure. However, the situation\nis being improved rapidly. There is extensive building of\nroads, bridges, schools, hospitals and reservoirs. The\nGovernment\u2019s support for the development of mini-plants\nto generate hydroelectric power will result in the\nprovision of alternative sources of energy, which will\nenable towns and villages to promote rural industries and,\nat the same time, lessen their dependence on fuel wood.\nThis integrated rural-area-development programme\nwill not only have positive effects on the socio-economic\nenvironment but also drastically reduce the area under\nshifting cultivation. The result will be conservation and\nthe regeneration of forest resources in the fragile\nmountain ecosystem.\nThe sustainable management and conservation of\nforests has long occupied a place of pride in Myanmar\u2019s\nenvironmental efforts. Sustainable production from forest\n9\n\n\nresources and the conservation of biodiversity are assured\nby a forest working plan and a time-tested selective felling\nsystem. About 50 per cent of Myanmar\u2019s total land surface\nis still covered by natural forests. Even though the forest\narea is about 33 million hectares, the prescribed allowable\nannual cut is less than 3 million cubic metres for teak and\nother hardwoods. This volume of commercial extraction is\nsignificantly less than the volume harvested by other\ncountries in the region.\nThe Government\u2019s current development activities in\nthe forest sector include the special project for greening the\nnine driest districts of the country; extension of the area\nunder reserved forests; the establishment of new\nplantations; overall reforestation of the dry zone to provide\nmuch-needed timber and fuel wood for rural communities;\nand measures to improve the watersheds.\nMyanmar attaches high importance to population\nissues and recognizes the close link between population and\nsustainable development. We participated in the Cairo\nConference, and we heartily welcome the adoption by\nconsensus of a non-binding 20-year Programme of Action.\nOur population-policy focus is on voluntary birth-spacing\nto promote the health of mother and child. The Myanmar\nMaternal and Child Welfare Association \u2014 a non--\ngovernmental organization \u2014 is actively carrying out its\nassigned task in this field.\nMuch has been accomplished by the United Nations in\nthe field of human rights. The Organization\u2019s most recent\naccomplishment in this area is the appointment by\nconsensus, at the General Assembly\u2019s last session, of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nThe appointment of such an important personage by\nconsensus testifies to the fact that both the developed and\nthe developing countries attach importance to the promotion\nand protection of human rights, in accordance with the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. My\ndelegation wishes the High Commissioner every success in\ncarrying out his mandate.\nAs a responsible Member of the United Nations and\nas an unwavering advocate of the values that the\nOrganization represents, the Union of Myanmar has always\nupheld and adhered to the basic norms of human rights, as\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. As is confirmed\nby the Bangkok Declaration, the principles of national\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in\ninternal affairs should be respected by all nations, and\nattempts to use human rights to encroach on the\nessentially domestic jurisdiction of States should be\navoided.\nIn saying this we do not mean that human rights\nmay be systematically violated behind the barrier of\nnon-interference. We wish to see human rights promoted\nthrough cooperation and consensus-building, and not\nthrough the imposition of values that we do not share.\nWe believe that, even as we seek universality of\nhuman rights, we must never minimize or forget diversity\nin historical, cultural and religious backgrounds. We are\nalso against double standards and the temptation to use\nhuman rights as a means of achieving political ends.\nThe right to sufficient food, clothing and shelter, the\nright to a decent quality of life and the right to live\npeacefully and in security are often neglected in the\nclamour for individual rights. At this delicate juncture in\nour history, when Myanmar is in the midst of\ntransforming itself to a multi-party democracy with a\nmarket economy, the interests of its 45 million people as\na whole must take precedence over the interests of any\nindividual. Confrontation and incitement to unrest and\ninstability have no place when the nation is in the process\nof reconciliation and reconsolidation.\nIn keeping with the aspirations of all the national\nraces, Myanmar is also at present at the critical stage of\ndrafting a firm constitution. My Government would\ncertainly not like to see the present momentum of the\nconstitutional process and the efforts for national\nreconciliation impeded in any way, nor can it allow a\nreturn to the chaos and anarchy of the incidents of 1988.\nThe Myanmar Government does not condone human\nrights abuses. In fact, it is totally against them. We have\ncooperated fully with the United Nations in every field\nand, in this regard, with the Commission on Human\nRights by providing information in connection with\ncommunications and queries concerning the situation in\nMyanmar. Not only have we provided information sought\nby the Commission, but we have also received the\nIndependent Experts and the Special Rapporteur appointed\nby the Commission on Human Rights. The Special\nRapporteur, Mr. Yozo Yokota, was received in 1992 and\nin 1993. In deference to the United Nations and as a\ngesture of our goodwill and cooperation, we will receive\nhim again this year.\n10\n\n\nThe Memorandum of Understanding between\nMyanmar and the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) signed on\n5 November 1993, setting out UNHCR\u2019s role in Myanmar\u2019s\nborder development projects, is an illustration of our steady\ncooperation with the United Nations and its subsidiary\nbodies. It is normal that some issues should arise from\ntime to time between neighbouring States. In such cases,\nwe always seek peaceful solutions based on mutual\ngoodwill, respect and understanding. A case in point is the\nmatter of transport and movement of people between\nMyanmar and Bangladesh across our common border.\nAlthough some quarters tried to exaggerate the situation by\ninvoking potential regional destabilization, our two\ncountries were able to resolve the situation in a spirit of\nmutual friendship and understanding resulting in the\nrepatriation so far of nearly 70,000 returnees to their\nhearths and homes.\nAt the initiative of the Secretary-General, Myanmar\ndecided to establish a dialogue with the United Nations to\nexchange views on various issues of common concern. I\nshould like briefly to apprise the Assembly of the\ndevelopments leading to this decision.\nDuring his visit to Myanmar in March this year,\nUnder-Secretary-General Mr. Rafeeudin Ahmed, Executive\nSecretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia\nand the Pacific (ESCAP), delivered a letter and a verbal\nmessage from the Secretary-General to Secretary I of the\nState Law and Order Restoration Council. The Secretary-\nGeneral, in his letter, made constructive remarks in regard\nto the measures taken by the Myanmar Government and\nshowed keen interest in the developments in Myanmar,\nparticularly the process of national reconciliation and steps\ntaken in drafting a firm constitution through the National\nConvention. The Secretary-General also expressed his\ndesire to establish a dialogue with the Government of the\nUnion of Myanmar to exchange views on the various issues\nwith a view to considering how the United Nations could\nassist in facilitating continued progress towards the\nresolution of these issues. Secretary I, in his\nacknowledgment, informed the Secretary-General that a\ncommunication would be made on this subject in the near\nfuture.\nWhile attending the Ministerial Meeting of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations in Bangkok, I\ntransmitted, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nThailand, on 21 July 1994, our initial response to the\nSecretary-General. Further to this response, the Myanmar\nGovernment informed the Executive Secretary of ESCAP\nthat the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Myanmar had\nbeen designated to initiate the dialogue proposed by the\nSecretary-General at a mutually agreeable date and, in\nthis regard, sought his advice on the modalities of\ncarrying out such a dialogue more fruitfully. I am happy\nto apprise the Assembly through you, Sir, that I had two\nmeetings earlier this month with Mr. Marrack Goulding,\nUnder-Secretary-General for Political Affairs of the\nUnited Nations, and that the dialogue between the\nMyanmar Government and the United Nations is now\nwell under way.\nThe global spread of drug abuse has become a major\ninternational concern in recent years. The evil\nconsequences of illicit drugs transcend borders and the\nthreat of illicit drugs can be overcome only with effective\ninternational cooperation. We share the view that\nconcerted action is needed at the national, subregional,\nregional and global levels.\nMyanmar has always treated anti-narcotics measures\nas a national responsibility. At the national level, the\nGovernment has adopted comprehensive plans for the\neffective implementation of drug-suppression measures.\nA new law against narcotic drugs and psychotropic\nsubstances was enacted in 1993, encompassing effective\nmeasures against the widening scope of the drug menace.\nIn our national strategies against drugs, a new approach\nwas launched in 1988, the key concept of which was to\nalleviate the poverty of the peoples of the border areas by\nproviding them with a means of alternative income, while\nat the same time working to raise their awareness of the\nmagnitude of human misery resulting from drugs. This\napproach is being carried out as one of the main\nobjectives of our master plan for the development of the\nborder areas and national races. It is evident that the\nmost effective approach to the eradication of poppy\ncultivation would be to implement a comprehensive\nprogramme for the social and economic development of\nthe national races in the border areas. We have now\nestablished a mechanism for coordinating action against\nillicit drugs in all their aspects.\nWe have also been coordinating our national efforts\nwith those of our neighbours to ensure a maximum\nimpact in drug eradication in the region. The Myanmar\nGovernment has signed agreements with the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China and the United Nations International\nDrug Control Programme (UNDCP), as well as with\nThailand and the UNDCP. Bilateral narcotics-suppression\nagreements have been signed with Laos and India, and we\naim to work out a similar agreement with Bangladesh. In\n11\n\n\nOctober 1993, in New York, Myanmar, the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, Laos, Thailand and the UNDCP signed\na Memorandum of Understanding which would further\nharmonize collective activities aimed at reducing drug\ntrafficking and production, eliminating poppy cultivation\nand reducing drug demand and consumption. There have\nbeen two ministerial conferences at the subregional level in\nwhich Myanmar has actively participated. Myanmar is a\nState party to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic\nDrugs and to the 1988 United Nations Convention against\nIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\nSubstances. Moreover, on 7 June this year Myanmar\ndeposited the instrument of accession to the United Nations\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances. We are also\ncarrying out a series of measures in implementation of the\nrecommendations contained in the Global Programme of\nAction adopted at the seventeenth special session of the\nGeneral Assembly in February 1990.\nMembers of the Myanmar security forces are engaged\nin a relentless war against drug trafficking. They may not\nbe wearing blue helmets like the men and women from\ndifferent lands serving as guardians of peace under the\nUnited Nations banner, but the cause for which hundreds of\nthem have sacrificed life and limb is no less internationalist\nand no less worthy. There are those who express doubt\nabout our commitment to the eradication of narcotics, and\nI would ask them: \u201cWhich country in the world has\nsacrificed the lives of over 190 soldiers, with an additional\n350 wounded, in the combat against drug traffickers in a\nmatter of only four weeks?\u201d With this serious dedication\nand commitment in the fight against illicit drugs, we in\nMyanmar are ready and willing to cooperate fully with all\nour neighbours and the international community for\nsustained efforts against this scourge.\nMyanmar is a union of over 100 different national\nraces residing there. Unity among the different national\nraces is essential for the preservation of our independence\nand sovereignty as well as for the economic and social\nprogress of our country. Since regaining independence in\n1948, Myanmar unfortunately has had to face internal strife\nstarted by various armed groups. Because of this, the\ncountry has suffered immensely and lagged behind in\neconomic development in comparison with other nations of\nthe region. In these dire circumstances, it is only natural\nthat the State Law and Order Restoration Council should\nattach the utmost importance to the preservation of\nindependence and the strengthening of unity and national\nsolidarity among all the national races of Myanmar. Since\nit assumed the responsibilities of the State, the State Law\nand Order Restoration Council has given priority to the\nachievement of national reconciliation.\nBeginning in 1989, less than one year after it\nassumed responsibility, the Government made overtures\nto the armed groups to return to the legal fold. Since\nApril 1992, the armed forces have suspended military\noffensives against the armed groups in the interest of\nnational reconciliation. Over four decades of internal\nstrife has not benefited anyone, but has only caused death\nand destruction and untold suffering for the people.\nNo one appreciates peace more than a soldier. It is\ntherefore most gratifying that a total of 12 groups having\ntrust in the sincerity of the Government\u2019s offer have\nreturned to the legal fold and are working together with\nthe Government for the development of their regions.\nThese groups are also being provided with the opportunity\nto participate in the national political process \u2014 the\nNational Convention \u2014 to shape the country\u2019s future.\nWith the Shan State Nationalities Peoples\u2019 Liberation\nOrganization, which returned to the legal fold on 9\nOctober 1994, the armed groups in the reconciliation\nprocess now number 13. They will be integrated in the\nsame manner as previous groups that are participating in\nthe National Convention.\nTo the remaining groups that have yet to return to\nthe legal fold, the Myanmar Government reiterates its call\nnot to miss this golden opportunity but to join hands in\nbuilding a peaceful, democratic and modern union. Guns\nhave fallen silent in the country as never before in the\nhistory of modern Myanmar, and these groups should\nlook at the greater interest of the country and work for\nthe benefit of all the national races, in accordance with\nthe proclamations they themselves have been making for\nso long.\nAt this juncture, let me turn to another aspect of the\nGovernment\u2019s objectives: the drafting of a firm and\nenduring constitution. Towards this end, a National\nConvention has been meeting since the beginning of last\nyear to draft a new constitution. Consensus has already\nbeen reached on the 15 chapter headings for the 104\nfundamental principles of the State and for the chapters\non State, State structure and Head of State.\nAt the resumed session of the National Convention,\nwhich commenced on 2 September 1994, the Chairman of\nthe National Convention Convening Work Committee\nelucidated the points relative to the matter of self-\nadministered divisions or self-administered zones in the\n12\n\n\nUnion, and to constituting the legislative, executive and\njudicial branches for detailed discussions and deliberations\namong the delegates. As for those who allege that the\nprocess is moving too slowly, let me ask: Is the world\ntoday not full of examples where too much haste has led to\nchaos and confusion, even to armed conflict and the\ndisintegration of nations?\nAt the same time, let me assure the Assembly that the\nState Law and Order Restoration Council has no intention\nof unnecessarily prolonging the process or causing delays.\nHowever, a balance must be struck between the need to\nreach consensus among the nearly 700 delegates on very\nurgent and vital issues, such as the national races, and the\ndesire for the process to be completed in timely fashion.\nAnyone following these deliberations closely will realize\nthat they lucidly give the lie to the allegations that the\ndeliberations in the National Convention were orchestrated\nby the Government.\nAt the same time, I wish to indicate to certain\nobservers that in our society reaching consensus is more\nimportant than debating who is right or wrong or who won\nthe debate. We would like the constitution to reflect as\nmuch as possible the wishes of the national races, while at\nthe same time we would be most happy if consensus on the\nremaining chapters could be reached as soon as possible.\nWhat the Government has done, and is doing at the\nmoment, is to ensure peace, stability, law and order while\nstriving for the economic development of the entire nation\nso that the transition to democracy will be smooth and\ntranquil.\nToday the National Convention is in full session for\nfurther discussions on the fundamental principles to be\nenshrined in the new constitution. The very fact that the\nnew State structure will be a union system is a\nmanifestation of the consensus that has been reached by the\nConvention. The new Union of Myanmar that is envisaged\nby the National Convention will be a genuine multi-party,\ndemocratic State in order to bring the nation modernity,\nunity, stability, peace and harmony. The new constitution\nwill have safeguards to guarantee non-disintegration of the\nUnion, non-disintegration of national solidarity and\nperpetuation of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nAs in the case of other modern Constitutions, the three\norgans of government - the legislative, executive and\njudicial \u2014 will be properly constituted and separated as\nmuch as possible and will be able to exert reciprocal\ncontrol with checks and balances among themselves.\nAmong the fundamental principles already laid down,\nindependent administration of justice in accordance with\nthe law, administration of justice in public except where\nrestricted by law, the right to defence and the right of\nappeal will be guaranteed. Furthermore, there will be\nconstitutional remedies, and the Supreme Court will have\nthe power to issue writs.\nCitizens will be able to enjoy the rule of law, which\nis the fundamental legal safeguard necessary for a\ndemocratic State. Because of the separation of powers\nenvisaged in the new constitution, the judiciary will be\nthe ultimate guardian of fundamental rights. Freedom of\nthought, freedom of expression, freedom of belief,\nfreedom of worship, freedom to seek a livelihood and\nfreedom of organization will be guaranteed. There will\nbe equality of status, equality of opportunity and equality\nbefore the law.\nThe entire Myanmar nation is currently engaged in\nour national endeavour to establish a truly democratic and\nmodern society in accordance with the aspirations of our\npeople. We the people of the Union of Myanmar are\ndoing our utmost to advance the ongoing political and\nconstitutional process and the current programme of\nnational economic development in the interest of all our\nnational brethren.\nWe have a popular saying in Myanmar:\n\u201cAs we sow in our deeds, so shall we surely\nreap in our future destiny.\u201d\nWe are therefore fully confident that, with continued\ndedication, determination and diligence in our national\nendeavour, we will surely be able to successfully establish\na democratic society based on the universal values of\njustice, liberty and equality.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I\nshould like to extend congratulations to the President on\nhis election.\nMy colleague Foreign Minister Kinkel, on behalf of\nthe European Union, has just given a broad overview of\nour approach to the United Nations. The great challenges\nwhich the United Nations faces today are well\nsummarized in his statement.\nThe idea that the world is divided into a North and\na South with greatly diverging interests is being replaced\nby a growing awareness that the fundamental problems\nwe face are common, global problems - to ensure\nsustainable development, to protect our environment, to\nsolve the population problem, to prevent social\n20\n\n\ndisintegration, to uphold justice and to protect the dignity\nof the human person.\nThe United Nations will have to play a central role in\nour common efforts to find answers to these global\nproblems. There is a need for coherent, integrated policies\nfor problems which have so far been treated largely as\nseparate questions - problems of peace and security,\ndevelopment, trade, democracy and human rights, the\nenvironment. The United Nations \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" and\nits agenda for development are closely connected.\nBy building on its comparative advantages the United\nNations can play its role as the primary institution for\nglobal international cooperation which is envisaged in its\nCharter. We, the Member States, will have to enable the\nUnited Nations to do so.\nAre we really providing this body with the necessary\nmeans to live up to expectations? It has become\nfashionable, when expectations are not met, to blame\nshortcomings on the United Nations itself. I tend to take a\ndifferent view. Member States are to be blamed at least as\nmuch as the Organization which struggles as our faithful\nservant. Rather than making the United Nations our\nscapegoat, Member States have first of all to make an\nhonest and serious effort, through timely and full payment\nof financial contributions, to provide it with the means to\nplay the role we expect it to play.\nBut we need a change in attitude as well. As\ninhabitants of the global village, we can no longer remain\nindifferent to the fate of our fellow human beings, even if\nthey live on a different continent. CNN brings their\nproblems right into our living rooms, visible, immediate,\ninescapable. Rwanda, Haiti and former Yugoslavia, Goma\nand Vukovar - tragedies such as these touch the conscience\nof citizens in all parts of the globe.\nHow do we respond to this? The prerequisites for\nsuccessful action by the United Nations are credibility and\nlegitimacy. To put it differently: the United Nations must\nbecome an institution in which all peoples of the world are\nfairly represented and have a fair say in decision-making.\nThere must be a balance between burdens and benefits for\nall and, most importantly, there must be an awareness at the\nlevel of both Governments and individuals that the United\nNations can make a difference.\nThe paradox is that the distance between decision-\nmakers and those represented seems to grow, in spite of the\nincrease in the speed and volume of communications. This\ndoes not affect solely the credibility - and therefore the legitimacy -\nof the United Nations. The credibility of State structures\nat the national level is equally at stake.\nEverywhere in the world, including in what used to\nbe called the first, the second and the third worlds, we see\na profound cynicism about government and Governments.\nThis is partly due to the fact that certain expectations\ncannot any longer be met. The power of Governments\nhas been diminished because many important activities,\nespecially in the economic sphere, have moved from\nGovernment into private or corporate hands. They are\nnot quite outside the sphere of direct action of\nGovernments and, for that matter, of the United Nations.\nHowever, a substantial part of this widespread\ncynicism stems from the perception of a lack of common\ndecency, from the feeling that Governments and\ninstitutions work for their own good in the first place and\nthat the interest of the people whom they are supposed to\nserve comes second.\nIn this respect I think we can take heart from the\nsuccess of the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment held recently at Cairo. That success was\nbuilt on a formula that essentially amounted to common\ndecency, namely, to face the population problem not\nthrough coercion and discrimination but by giving people\nthe means to follow, freely and responsibly, the path of\ntheir own choice. This should serve as an example for us\nas Governments with regard to other matters as well.\nIf we apply the criteria of fairness and decency to\nthe United Nations, then it is clear that major adjustments\nare needed. In some fields work on this task has started\nand a number of preliminary steps have been taken - for\ninstance, the appointment of an inspector general. We\nshould not deceive ourselves, however, into believing that\neverything is therefore well. Good bookkeeping is\nessential, but fraud never constituted the core of the\nUnited Nations problem. Even good management,\nimmensely important though it is, is only a necessary\ntool.\nLet me mention some of my priorities for an agenda\nfor a revitalized United Nations. The tremendous\nincrease in peace-keeping operations clearly signals a\nchange in the role of the Security Council. The emphasis\nis more and more on cooperative crisis management,\nresolution and prevention in various regional conflicts.\nThe permanent members of the Council are expected to\ntake a leading role when countries are requested to\n21\n\n\ncontribute the means needed to implement the Council\u2019s\ndecisions. In this new era the yardstick for great-Power\nstatus is no longer the number of nuclear bombs but now\nthe concrete contribution that a country is prepared and able\nto make to the cooperative effort to stem the tide of war,\nmisery and poverty in the world.\nFor this reason the Netherlands is in favour of the\nadmission of Germany and Japan to the Security Council as\npermanent members. Both countries have an impeccable\nrecord as Members of the United Nations. They have\nexpressed their willingness to shoulder a larger part of the\ncommon burden, and they have the power and the means to\ndo so. Their permanent presence on the Security Council\nwould therefore significantly strengthen the authority and\ncapabilities of the United Nations as a whole. The question\nof equitable representation of various geographical regions\nwill also have to be addressed for the sake of the Council\u2019s\nlegitimacy in the eyes of the world at large. All in all, we\nbelieve that it is possible to achieve consensus on an\nexpansion to a total number of seats somewhere in the low\ntwenties. This would indeed be a most significant step\ntowards improving the credibility and legitimacy of the\nUnited Nations.\nAt least as important however is enhanced\ntransparency and closer coordination between the Security\nCouncil and the United Nations membership at large. My\nown country\u2019s position may illustrate this point. The\nKingdom of the Netherlands is de facto the eleventh highest\ncontributor to the budget of the United Nations. We are in\ntenth position in terms of the numbers of military personnel\ncontributed to peace-keeping operations, yet we are not\ninvolved in the Council\u2019s decisions in which the mandates\nand modalities of these operations are laid down.\nAs in government, there should be no taxation without\nrepresentation. The members of the Security Council have\nto remember that they exercise their authority on behalf of\nthe entire membership of the Organization. For that\npurpose they need the confidence of the General Assembly.\nThe Council can no longer operate as an exclusive club.\nTherefore the Netherlands is in favour of the creation of a\nsubsidiary organ of the Council, where all aspects of peace-\nkeeping operations could be discussed with major troop\ncontributors.\nMoreover, we join those who call for systematic and\nindependent reporting and evaluation of peace-keeping\noperations. The reports should not end up, labelled\n\\\"Confidential\\\", in the desks of the United Nations\nbureaucracy. Those who contribute and the people whom\nthey represent have a rightful claim to this information.\nOn this score as well, the principle of accountability must\nurgently be introduced in the interest of the overall\ncredibility of the United Nations.\nAnother area with important potential for improving\nthe working of the United Nations system is that of the\nregional organizations. Together with Germany, the\nNetherlands has argued for a more active role for the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(CSCE) as the regional United Nations arrangement for\nEurope. I strongly believe that the United Nations should\napply what the European Union calls subsidiarity. This\nprinciple means that the higher level should not deal with\nmatters that can be dealt with satisfactorily at the lower\nand more specialized level. Responsibility should be\nexercised as close as possible to the grass roots.\nEuropean countries should try to solve their own\nproblems in the framework of the CSCE before dropping\nthem into the lap of the United Nations. This, however,\nremains a matter for voluntary regional cooperation, and\nin no way detracts from the primary responsibility of the\nSecurity Council.\nIn Africa, we see encouraging signs of a\ndevelopment in the same direction. In the framework of\nthe Organization of African Unity, as well as at regional\nand subregional levels, efforts are being made to develop\na regional peace-keeping capacity. These initiatives\ndeserve our wholehearted support. On the other hand, the\nNetherlands shares the concern of these countries that\nself-reliance in this domain should not cut them off from\nassistance and active involvement by the international\ncommunity through the United Nations.\nIn Rwanda, for instance, African countries are\ncontributing most of the personnel for the operation of the\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda\n(UNAMIR). Other United Nations Members have\nprovided equipment, logistical and financial support and\ntransportation. The Netherlands has made a contribution\nin mat\u00e9riel to match the deployment of a peace-keeping\ncontingent by Zambia. This may provide a model for\nmore permanent, structural means of practical cooperation\nbetween countries in the region and those outside - a kind\nof mutual adoption arrangement.\nMuch has been said about the need for an enhanced\nearly-warning capacity. In fact, in most cases the\ninformation was available before crises erupted into\nviolence. But, as the former Yugoslavia has\ndemonstrated, early warning is not sufficient if States are\n22\n\n\nnot willing and ready to undertake early action once a\npotential crisis has been identified.\nA similar remark can be made about the United\nNations system of stand-by forces. This is an excellent\nidea, and the system may serve as a useful database for the\nUnited Nations. But it is no guarantee of greater efficiency\nin all circumstances. In connection with Rwanda, the\nsystem was put to the test for the first time. The results of\nthat test were extremely discouraging. None of the\ncountries that had indicated possible contributions were\nwilling to provide troops for rapid deployment. What is the\nuse of an instrument if the political will to use it is lacking?\nRegrettably, lessons are drawn mostly when it is too\nlate. The human tragedy in Rwanda will always remain a\nshame for the international community. Collectively, we\nmust acknowledge that we had ample warning of impending\ndisaster and that we could have done more to prevent the\ngenocide. In this context I have been struck by the words\nof a high-ranking United Nations official:\n\\\"A mechanized brigade deployed in Kigali within 7 to\n14 days might have stabilized the situation.\\\"\nIf this is true, then the moral dimension of our failure to\nprovide the United Nations with the necessary means\nbecomes all too apparent. If deploying a brigade could\nhave prevented the indiscriminate slaughter of many\nhundreds of thousands, what prevented us from doing so?\nLet us face it: the reason for our inaction was neither\nlack of means nor lack of time. The reason was that, under\nthe circumstances, no Government was prepared to risk the\nlives of its citizens. The physical danger was considered\ntoo high.\nHow can we resolve this dilemma? Hand-wringing\nwill not absolve us from our responsibility in a situation of\ngenocide. Either we act upon our feeling of horror and\nindignation, or we stop moralizing. If Member States are\nnot in a position to provide the necessary military\npersonnel, will it then not become unavoidable for us to\nconsider the establishment of a full-time, professional, at all\ntimes available and rapidly deployable United Nations\nbrigade for this purpose - a \\\"United Nations Legion\\\" at the\ndisposal of the Security Council? Such a relatively small,\ninternational, all-volunteer \\\"fire brigade\\\" may enable the\nUnited Nations to save lives in situations such as Rwanda.\nIts establishment could help to solve the dilemmas that we,\nGovernments, face when trying to come to grips with the\nphenomenon of the failed State.\nOf course, the preferable way to deal with conflicts\nis by preventing them. In Europe, the discreet activities\nof the High Commissioner for National Minorities\nappointed by the Conference on Security and Cooperation\nin Europe, and those of other actors, have undoubtedly\nplayed a crucial role in defusing potential crises in the\nBaltic and other regions. It is a fact of life in politics that\nsolutions and happy endings quietly achieved do not\nattract the same attention as failures and disasters.\nTrusted and respected personalities could play a similar\nrole in other regions. As Minister Hurd said last year:\nfor the expense involved in the deployment of one\nbattalion of peace-keepers, the Secretary-General can send\na great many personal representatives.\nI also wish to say a few words about the aftermath\nof conflicts that could not be prevented: the punishment\nof those responsible for crimes against humanity. It is of\nthe utmost importance not only that these terrible crimes\nbe condemned by the international community but also\nthat those responsible for these crimes, as well as the\nactual perpetrators, be prosecuted. Strangely enough, this\nwas done only at the end of the Second World War. But\nnow at last we see the establishment of an international\ntribunal for crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia\nand the start of a broad discussion on a future tribunal for\nRwanda.\nPunishment of war criminals and ethnic cleansers is\nnot a matter of revenge. It is a matter of justice and also\na matter of deterrence. Impunity encourages future\ncrimes against humanity. We therefore strongly support\nboth tribunals; as well as the early establishment of an\ninternational criminal court that will exercise jurisdiction\nwith regard to serious crimes of international concern.\nWith the introduction of a draft statute for such an\ninternational criminal court, a major step forward has\nbeen made.\nIn closing, let me emphasize my fundamental point:\nthe credibility of the authority exercised by Governments\nand by the United Nations. In the former Yugoslavia and\nelsewhere, the world community has failed to stop the\nbreakdown of civil society and the descent into barbarity.\nSuch failures undermine people\u2019s belief in the authority\nof the United Nations, in the authority of regional\norganizations, in the authority of Governments, and\nindeed in public authority as such. The authority of a\nnational Government does not depend only on its own\ncredibility; it also depends on the credibility of the wider\ninternational authority in which it participates. Therefore,\nit is in our own national interest to uphold that wider\n23\n\n\nauthority. We can only do this if we provide the United\nNations with the tools it needs to face its daunting task.\n"

        "file_name": "AUS_49_1994.txt",
        "file_text": "I warmly congratulate you, Your Excellency Minister Essy, on your election as President of the General Assembly at this forty-ninth session. Australia is very pleased to serve in the Assembly under your presidency and looks forward to relying on your wisdom and your experience as you preside over our deliberations.\nThe last year has provided its full measure of challenges for the United Nations. The hopes for a new era of peace, after the decades of sterile confrontation between the super-Powers, seem not much closer to being realized. In Southern Africa and the Middle East, there have been remarkable advances in solving some of the world's most intractable problems, but they stand in contrast to the nightmarish conflicts of Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda. These are only the latest, and most prominent, of a long string of deadly conflicts within State borders, tearing existing States apart and far exceeding the threats to peace posed by conflict between States. These intra-State conflicts have been marked by extreme savagery, each day offering new evidence of how cruel and dangerous a place the world remains for so many of its people.\nThe combined impact of a number of these conflicts has had a corrosive effect on the standing of the United Nations. Pictures of Blue Helmets standing by, unable to prevent conflict and impotent to save life, have become a media cliche. The role that the United Nations system has continued to play in its economic, social and humanitarian work, in responding to the \\\"silent emergencies\\\" of poverty and deprivation, has been overshadowed by the public image of an organization failing to meet its responsibilities and unequal to the challenges. Some of this imagery is deeply unfair, failing to take account of the innumerable constraints under which the United Nations operates - and in particular failing to acknowledge that, at the end of the day, the United Nations can do no more than what its Member States allow it to do, or give it the resources to do.\nBut the underlying reality is that the United Nations, and we Member States that make it up, have not yet developed a clear and confident sense of the United Nations own role in the new environment with which we are confronted - where the most common source of conflict is no longer disputes between States, but explosive conflict within States, more often than not expressed in the form of competing ethno-nationalist or religious claims.\nOf course ethnic or religious difference is not, by itself, a recipe for conflict within States. Australia is just one example, among many, of a highly successful multi-ethnic, multicultural society in which tolerance and peace prevail. For ethnic or religious differences or competing nationalist aspirations to deteriorate into deadly conflict, something more is necessary. And almost invariably that something has been a failure of Governments to deliver basic needs and to satisfy the most basic aspirations of their citizens. In almost every case of major intra-State conflict of recent times, from the former\nSoviet republics to Rwanda, ethnic and religious conflict has been associated with declining per capita gross national product, the rise of demagogic politics, and the collapse of effective, responsible government.\nAll this means that it is no longer possible, in the post-cold-war era, for the international community simply to ignore, as it largely did in the past, conflict occurring within State borders which does not significantly impact on other States. The compartmentalization which existed through the cold war years - in which peace and security issues, development issues, and human rights and justice issues were treated as being in completely different conceptual and institutional boxes - no longer seems adequate to deal with the real world distress that so many people are suffering. Basic economic needs, let alone the needs of individuals and groups for dignity and liberty, cannot begin to be met in environments where nobody's personal security can be guaranteed. And that means, in turn, that the international community cannot simply turn away from being involved in protecting human security in many of those situations which might previously have been regarded as wholly internal in character.\nThis truth has, of course, already been recognized to the extent that the United Nations has become involved in essentially intra-State conflicts in Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda and Haiti. But for the most part that involvement has been hesitant, half-hearted, lacking in confidence, worried about its rationale, too little, and too late. We have now to reach out boldly and try to recapture some of the original vision built into the stated aims of the Charter. We have to reintegrate the relationship among the three basic objectives of peace, meeting the need for security; development, meeting economic needs; and human rights and justice, meeting the needs for individual and group dignity and liberty.\nThe distinction between peace and security on the one hand and development on the other has too often been a matter for sterile and unhelpful debate, with attempts to trade off one for the other as key goals for the United Nations. Any viable modern concept of international peace, let alone peace within States, must recognize that the two are indissolubly bound up with each other: there can be no sustainable peace without development, and no development without peace.\nIn this context, Australia warmly welcomes the Secretary-General's efforts in producing An Agenda for Development which, following on as it does from An Agenda for Peace, fully recognizes the relationship between peace and development, acknowledging that equitable development eradicates many of the socio-political conditions in which threats to peace breed. It places an entirely appropriate emphasis on individual human beings as the end object and beneficiaries of our developmental efforts. This concept of course, in various guises, lies behind most of the international community's key ideas about development in recent years, including \\\"adjustment with a human face\\\", \\\"human development\\\" and, most recently, \\\"human security\\\". I must also applaud the focus which the Secretary-General has placed on practical international cooperation for global human security, for example in the areas of emergency humanitarian assistance, effective governance and all the social issues which form the agenda of the world social summit.\nA more integrated effort will clearly be required of the United Nations system if the objectives set out in An Agenda for Development are to be achieved. It is imperative that we improve the system's ability to develop and implement social and economic development programmes in a more coordinated and coherent manner, including by finding ways to allow the Bretton Woods institutions and United Nations bodies to work in closer harmony. An example of a more systematic approach that the United Nations system might be able to adopt is the recent package of reforms undertaken by the Economic and Social Council. The new approach to operational activities, and the joint programme which the Economic and Social Council agreed to earlier this year to tackle the health and development impacts of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, demonstrate the achievements that are possible through such reform.\nBut more will be required than this, including changes in the senior decision-making structure of the United\nNations Secretariat. Considerable reform in the intergovernmental elements of the United Nations system has been achieved and is being worked out, but the same is not true of the Secretariat itself. Notwithstanding some welcome recent changes, including in particular the designation by the Secretary-General of a special adviser on operational activities, I believe that there continues to be a strong case for creating a new working collegiate executive of four Deputy Secretary-Generals to work with the Secretary-General - responsible respectively for economic and social affairs, peace and security affairs, humanitarian affairs and administration and management.\nA key source of threats to national and international security lies in unsustainable patterns of consumption and exploitation of resources. High population growth and competition for resources have been contributing factors in several of the recent crises involving the United Nations, including Rwanda and Somalia, and competition over scarce water resources is a potential cause of conflict in a number of regions. Such threats demonstrate how important it is, in security terms, for the United Nations to strengthen its ability to deal with development issues. The international community has developed a significant body of international laws, norms, agreements and arrangements for the rational and cooperative management of scarce resources. The United Nations system needs to ensure that it takes timely, effective and coordinated action to help implement this framework and the programmes for action agreed on at recent global conferences. The outcome of last month's Cairo Conference has provided a blueprint to address problems of population and development, acknowledging the central role of women in the development process.\nFor its part, the Commission on Sustainable Development must develop a genuine capacity to monitor the implementation of Agenda 21, using its political influence to bring about an observable difference in approaches to environment and development. We also attach particular importance to early implementation of the Programme of Action adopted at the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States in Barbados in May this year. No less important has been the entry into force of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. The adoption in June 1994 of the new Agreement implementing Part XI of the Convention secures a widely accepted legal order for the world's oceans, and provides, in effect, a common language for interaction between States on matters affecting two thirds of the world's surface.\nFrom the outset of the establishment of the United Nations, the international community has acknowledged human rights as a central and legitimate subject of international attention. For many years, however, and notwithstanding the system of international human rights treaties, this attention carried with it the ideological baggage of the cold war and was too often marked by confrontation and recrimination. In recent years the international community has begun to develop more cooperative and potentially more effective ways of promoting better observance of human rights standards.\nThese include the creation of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the promotion of national and regional human rights bodies and improved technical assistance. They also include a welcome reaffirmation in Vienna last year of the indivisibility of all human rights - economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights - in developing a base for positive change. And they include the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal to try violations of humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia. A further important specific step that Australia believes should be taken in this direction is the creation of a permanent international criminal court, to deal with gross violations of international criminal law wherever they might occur.\nHuman rights observance has its own profound significance for peace and security. The drafters of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognized this connection. The international community has clear obligations under the Charter to protect basic human rights, and the most basic freedom of all - the right to life - is directly dependent on the maintenance of peace. We must be prepared to accept a wider application of the notion of security as it appears in the Charter, recognizing that security in the post-cold-war era has as much to do with the protection of individuals - guaranteeing human security - as it has to do with State security - the defence of national borders.\nHuman security, in this view, is as much if not more threatened by intra-State conflict as it is by conflict between States, and intra-State conflict is as much a concern of the United Nations as is international conflict. The experience of the last few years underlines the lesson that a State whose Government systematically disregards human rights, ignores the rule of law and fails to strive for equitable development and distributive justice is a State showing clear signs of heading towards breakdown and civil strife. To try to anticipate with appropriate preventive strategies that breakdown and conflict is, for the United Nations system, not to go beyond its Charter mandate, but to fully realize it.\nThe international community has traditionally talked about security in almost wholly military terms. In a United Nations context, collective security has meant Member States renouncing the use of force against each other and agreeing to come to the aid of a Member when it is attacked. Even the more recent, and very welcome, focus on the concept of common security has been premised on the idea that States will be more secure militarily with defence strategies that are aimed at building security with others rather than against others.\nIf the international community is to respond fully and effectively to the new challenges of the post-cold-war era, this perspective has to be broadened. One way to do that is to talk, as many are now doing, in terms of comprehensive security, which conveys the important idea that security is multidimensional in character, demanding attention not only to political and diplomatic disputes but to economic underdevelopment, trade disputes, human- rights abuses and the like.\nBut Australia's preference - as I spelled out last year in addressing this Assembly, when I launched the so- called Blue Book, Cooperating for Peace - is to describe our shared objective as cooperative security. The term cooperative security is designed to embrace and capture the essence of all those three other ideas: collective, common and comprehensive security. It is designed to shift the focus away from traditional, defensive, State-centred thinking, and at the same time to convey the flavour of consultation rather than confrontation, reassurance rather than deterrence, transparency rather than secrecy, prevention rather than correction, and interdependence rather than unilateralism.\nCooperative security in practice means a whole range of different strategies designed both to prevent and to resolve conflict, certainly including the traditional United Nations roles of peace-keeping and peace enforcement. But the strategies that I want particularly to emphasize today are those at the preventive end of the response spectrum, in particular peace-building and preventive diplomacy.\nAs the idea of peace building has been developed by the Secretary General in An Agenda for Peace and in An Agenda for Development, it has largely been restricted to the situations of post-conflict economic and institutional restoration within countries. Australia's view is that while that is a very important element of the idea it is unduly restrictive, and that the concept of peace-building should assume a much more prominent place in our thinking about the international community's role and responsibilities.\nWe see peace-building as describing the whole range of strategies designed to address basic and underlying causes of disputes and conflicts: strategies aimed at ensuring that they do not arise in the first place, or that if they do arise, they do not subsequently recur. Those strategies are applicable at both intra-State and international levels. At the international level we are talking essentially about various regimes and arrangements designed to minimize threats to security, to promote confidence and trust and to create frameworks for dialogue and cooperation, especially through arms control and disarmament treaties; legal regimes such as those on maritime passage and the status of refugees; dispute- resolution mechanisms such as the International Court of Justice; and multilateral dialogue forums, such as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) or the new regional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). At the in-country level, peace- building essentially involves strategies to encourage economic development, ensure the observance of human rights, broadly defined, and to facilitate good governance.\nSo perceived, peace-building lies right at the interface between the United Nations agendas for peace and for development. Peace-building activity is already occurring in a great many ways and in a great many places. The attention being given to environment, resource and population issues, the higher profile being accorded to human-rights protection and the significant progress being made on many disarmament issues are all manifestations of this at the general international level. And more attention is being given to democratization and institution-building strategies, as well as economic ones, for particular countries where effective governance has broken down, or seems about to.\nWhat is really necessary is that more of this activity be integrated and coordinated within the United Nations system, that activities now being pursued in isolation and without any overriding sense of common purpose be better linked together. If we are to get peace, development and human rights objectives better synchronized, then some institutional changes are necessary. A good start may be to vest responsibility for developing and coordinating peace- building strategies in the position of deputy secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, a position which I suggested earlier should be created.\nWhatever the achievability of peace-building international regimes in other areas, the end of the cold war has certainly opened up for the international community exciting new possibilities to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and destabilizing conventional-arms races. There is now, for example, an historic opportunity to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The decision by most of the nuclear-weapon States to maintain moratoriums on testing has made a major contribution to an improved negotiating atmosphere in the Conference on Disarmament. Australia very much hopes that the People's Republic of China will play its part in bringing those negotiations to a conclusion by likewise abstaining from further tests. Agreement on a comprehensive test ban will also have a significant impact on the achievement of nuclear disarmament, and especially nuclear non-proliferation, objectives. Australia urges all members of the Conference on Disarmament to seize this opportunity, which may not present itself again, to conclude the test-ban treaty as soon as possible.\nA further vital contribution to nuclear disarmament would be made by the negotiation of a cut-off convention. Australia hopes that all members of the Conference on Disarmament will support the efforts of the Canadian coordinator and agree to a negotiating mandate by the beginning of the 1995 session.\nUnderlying all the efforts by the international community over the past 25 years to stem the spread of nuclear weapons has been the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The NPT remains the cornerstone of international efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. Its success is reflected in this phenomenon: the general expectation in the 1960s was that the world would have as many as 25 nuclear-weapon States by the 1980s, but instead, 160 countries have now acceded to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States, leaving only a handful outside the Treaty framework. The peaceful-use assurances derived from the Treaty and from the safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency have laid the foundation for very valuable international cooperation in fields such as nuclear power generation, nuclear medicine and agricultural and scientific applications of nuclear energy. In addition, the NPT incorporates the only commitment from the five nuclear-weapon States to complete nuclear disarmament. The cause of complete nuclear disarmament, which\nAustralia fully supports, is moving in the right direction, but it is clear that more needs to be done by the nuclear- weapon States if the pace is to be maintained.\nA decision to be made on extending the Treaty at the NPT Review Conference next year will allow us to secure its benefits in perpetuity. This is an opportunity we must grasp to shape a world in which our collective commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, and to a world free of nuclear weapons, can be realized. Indefinite extension of the Treaty will create an environment in which the pressures for continued nuclear disarmament will be maximized, in which nuclear proliferation will best be prevented, in which trade and cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can best be maintained, and in which the goal of universal membership of the Treaty can best be reached.\nThe pace of chemical- and biological-weapons disarmament continues to be encouraging. Progress is being made in preparing for implementation of the chemical-weapons Convention, and the recent Special Conference's decision to develop verification measures to strengthen the biological-weapons Convention is also very welcome. All members of the global community will benefit, in both security and trade and development terms, from the bans on these entire categories of weapons of mass destruction which will be put in place by the effective operation of both these Treaties.\nIn our efforts to prevent the further spread of weapons of mass destruction, we should not lose sight of the need to control conventional weaponry. Conventional weapons continue to be responsible for the overwhelming majority of the fatalities and casualties in contemporary armed conflict. In this area, the United Nations has taken an important first step in creating the Register of Conventional Arms, although I must note Australia's disappointment at the failure of its Expert Group to agree to expand the Register beyond transfers to cover productions and holdings. It is, however, most important that all States support this initial international exercise in the transparency of conventional weaponry by providing as much information as possible in their returns.\nThere is also a compelling need to strengthen the inhumane weapons Convention and, in particular, to extend further control over the use of, and trade in, land-mines, given the appalling and indiscriminate injuries caused to civilian populations often long after conflicts cease.\nOne of the most crucial elements in any functioning system of cooperative security is an effective capacity for preventive diplomacy. Australia is convinced that the United Nations can and should do more in this respect to prevent disputes escalating into armed conflict, and to this effect we propose to introduce a draft resolution on enhancing preventive diplomacy at the current session of the General Assembly.\nWe believe that there is widespread support for the United Nations to build stronger preventive diplomacy machinery and to develop the capacity foreseen by its founders and articulated in Article 33 to operate as an active agent in the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Organization would be able to operate more effectively in this area if it gave its staff additional skills in dispute resolution and conflict management. We commend its efforts to do so through the fellowship course of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research and we will continue to provide our backing for that training. We propose that the United Nations develop a dispute resolution service within its Secretariat. We advocate strengthening the Department of Political Affairs and increasing coordination, information-sharing and early- warning capacity among and between the various elements of the United Nations system. Greater use should also be made of the resources of Member States and stronger linkages forged with regional security arrangements.\nSuch regional organizations and arrangements themselves can play a most useful role. We should not have unrealistic expectations of them because most cannot match the capacity of global bodies to marshal resources for peace-building or, at the other end of the scale, for military responses to crises. They nevertheless offer a way of bringing together the parties to disputes in a constructive and non-confrontational framework. We welcome recent developments to strengthen regional approaches, in particular the recent inaugural meeting of the Regional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, with its evident willingness to develop preventive diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region. We hope that others will share our interest in exploring the scope for establishing regional peace and security resource centres - to advance these objectives under the banner of regional organizations or the United Nations itself, or both.\nWe welcome the steps taken by the United Nations Secretary-General to strengthen the United Nations links with regional organizations. In relation to one such important organization in Australia's own part of the world, we welcome the strong support given by Member\nStates for the application made by the South Pacific Forum for Observer status in the General Assembly, itself a response to the Secretary-General's invitation to consider ways of further improving the coordination of the efforts of regional bodies with those of the United Nations. Australia also welcomes the regional peace-keeping exercise under way to assist Papua New Guinea achieve a peaceful resolution of the situation in Bougainville, and the Secretary-General's expression of support for that exercise.\nThere is no use talking about reintegrating the United Nations or reshaping its responsibilities unless the resources are there to carry out these responsibilities. The central responsibility of Member States in this respect is to set to rights the Organization's current financial problems. Australia urges, in the strongest terms we can, all Member States to pay their assessed contributions in full and on time as a matter of obligation under the Charter.\nWe believe that the United Nations should look carefully at strengthening measures to encourage the prompt payment of contributions. We could, for example, explore the possibility of charging interest on overdue payments or applying Article 19 of the Charter to provide for only a 24- month grace period before voting rights are lost. We believe also that present budgetary systems could well be improved, in particular those involved with the financing of peace-keeping operations. We hope that, at a minimum, this General Assembly will be able to agree on some practical steps to move towards a sounder basis for such funding. Modern management practices, including a personnel policy more clearly based on merit, need to be adopted.\nMeasures such as these, while valuable, are unlikely to be sufficient in themselves to meet the financial demands which will be placed on the United Nations by its new agenda. The time has come to look at more innovative approaches to raising funds. One possibility which should be examined more seriously than hitherto, notwithstanding the complexities and sensitivities involved, is the application of levies on certain kinds of international transactions, such as air travel or foreign exchange, the capacity to carry on which depends on the existence of stability between States, to which the United Nations in turn makes a major contribution. An international levy on such transactions would be an equitable way of putting a price on an important public good. And the amounts involved are very large. The total value of global foreign exchange turnover, for example, is expected to amount to over $300 trillion next year. A levy on these transactions of only 0.01 per cent, if it could be collected, would yield over $30 billion. A flat-rate $10 added to the price of air tickets for each international sector travelled would yield $3 billion, nearly enough to cover all United Nations peace-keeping activities last year.\nWhatever the funding strategy adopted, the financial burden on the United Nations system and the international community could be greatly reduced by putting a greater emphasis on preventive approaches to problem solving. It is very clear that prevention is far more cost-effective in the longer term than our current pattern of responding to problems, if at all, only after crisis points have been reached.\nIf the United Nations decision-making bodies are to have legitimacy and guaranteed international support in responding to the range of new and difficult situations with which the international community is now being confronted - particularly deadly conflicts and massive human rights violations occurring within States - they must be representative of the broad range of interests and perspectives of United Nations Member States. This is a key reason why enlargement of the Security Council's membership is a pressing concern for this General Assembly. It should be said, at the same time, that the Security Council's legitimacy will ultimately depend, not just on its representativeness, but upon the quality of its performance, and in that context it will be very important that the Assembly apply very rigorously the criteria and qualifications for Security Council membership elaborated in Article 23 of the Charter.\nThe model that would most simply meet the legitimate aspirations of the largest States excluded at present from permanent membership of the Security Council - including Japan and Germany, whose claims we support - would involve the creation of five new permanent membership seats. Assuming the continuation of the existing regional groups, three new permanent members would come from Africa and Asia, one from the Western European and Other States Group, and one from Latin America and the Caribbean. Australia would prefer not to extend the veto to any new permanent member. At the same time, we believe it would be appropriate slightly to dilute the veto power of the existing five permanent members by requiring two from their number to concur in its exercise.\nIf - as seems not impossible - agreement on a simple model of this kind proves not easily reachable, it may be worth giving consideration to a more complex alternative model. We have in mind one which would no doubt in practice guarantee effective permanency for the largest States currently excluded from the Council, including Japan and Germany. But it would at the same time give a greater degree of flexibility to the Council's structure and greater opportunities for the recognition of several other countries which have made a major contribution to the Organization. It might, for those reasons, be a model capable of commanding more widespread support.\nThis alternative model would involve, in addition to the five existing permanent members - whose veto power would again be slightly diluted, as already outlined - the creation of eight quasi-permanent seats allocated among regional groups for which consecutive re-election would be possible, together with 10 rotating non-permanent seats as at present. It would make abundant sense, in our view, for the existing regional groups to be at the same time modified to reflect post-cold-war realities. A suggested way in which these 23 seats might be distributed among such a new set of regional groups is set out in the table attached to the circulated text of this statement; that table also sets out the way in which the seats might be distributed among the existing groups. On this model, the question which States became quasi-permanent members and how long they remained on the Council in that capacity would be a matter for determination by the regional group in question.\nConsequential amendments would be required to Article 23 and Article 108 of the Charter, and the opportunity should, of course, be taken at the same time to remove the anachronistic enemy States clauses. An accompanying General Assembly resolution could elaborate any new regional-group arrangements.\nIt is, of course, the case that any change to Security Council membership is fraught with complexity and difficulty. But if we are ever to move from the stage of generalized discussion to concrete negotiations, it is necessary to put some quite specific and comprehensive proposals on the table. I certainly do not suggest that the models I have just advanced are the only possible approaches, but I do strongly suggest that the time is now ripe for us to commence such negotiation. I believe that others share our determination to move in a spirit of good will and conscientiousness to see to it that the United Nations of the next 50 years is soundly built; and an expanded, newly legitimized Security Council is a crucial foundation in this respect.\nAustralia wants the United Nations, over the next 50 years, to be an active and effective agent for the peaceful settlement of disputes. We want it to be a catalyst for international peace-building, working to strengthen international law, control and reverse arms races, promote confidence and dialogue between States and address underlying causes of instability, including internal conflict. We want the United Nations to promote, in more effective coordination with the major international economic and financial institutions, equitable and sustainable development and to coordinate responses to humanitarian crises. We want it to emerge even more strongly as a promoter of universal standards of human rights and their respect by Governments. We want the United Nations to pursue its objectives of peace, development and human rights in an integrated, coordinated way, with these objectives complementing, rather than being in competition with, each other. And we want it to be an Organization assured of the wholehearted backing of its Member States and provided by them with all the financial resources it requires to meet its obligations.\nIn short, we want the United Nations to become the Organization which was envisaged in its Charter. One of the priority objectives of our candidacy for election to the Security Council for 1997-1998 is to help in the building of such a United Nations. We believe we have valuable contributions to bring to this task, and we look forward to working closely with all our fellow Members in the shaping of a United Nations fully capable of meeting the needs and expectations of all of us in the international community over the next 50 years.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate the President on his\nappointment to this highly responsible and important post.\nMy delegation will work constructively with him during the\ncourse of this, the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations.\nSince the end of the Second World War, the fiftieth\nanniversary of which we shall be celebrating next year, the\nworld has been engaged in peace-building. It has been a\nlong road, and it has not been without its dramatic\nmoments. Over the past half century the world has come\nto the brink of nuclear war many times. Now, with the end\nof the cold war, with the dissolution of the bipolar world,\na new challenge has arisen in the shape of a series of wars\nand conflicts based on ethnic and religious intolerance that\nhave exploded in many different areas of the world.\nIn his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" the Secretary\nGeneral spoke of the concentration of efforts towards\npreventive diplomacy, of steps for increasing international\nconfidence-building and achieving early recognition of\nconflict situations. Such measures have taken on special\nimportance in our countries with the fall of\ntotalitarianism, because we have inherited many long-\nstanding issues of conflict that had previously been\nhidden and suppressed by a regime of terror in the\nconditions of that time.\nThe United Nations, in our view, could play a\nleadership role in the study of typical conflict situations.\nIt could systematize the approaches, principles and paths\nfor the resolution of traditional issues of dispute such as\nborder issues, the sharing or allocation of water and other\nnatural resources, the self-determination of nations and\nterritorial integrity, and the protection of minorities on the\nbasis of ethnic, religious, linguistic and other differences.\nThis would allow the United Nations to establish a legal\nbasis for decisions that would help decrease the potential\nfor new conflicts and aid in the resolution of existing\nproblems. Only by following the highest authority of\nlaw, and only on the basis of international law, can we\nweave a solid fabric of peace throughout the planet, in all\nof its smallest corners, no matter how remote or\nprovincial.\nViolence and intolerance among people have led to\nunending war and bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia.\nThe tragedy of Bosnia poses a challenge to all\nhumankind. Fifty years ago the nations of this world,\nhaving united, put an end to nazism and genocide. Why\nthen are we now moving so slowly in the face of the\nviolence that is obviously based on ethnic and religious\ndiscrimination and that is reverberating throughout the\nplanet? We stand for a political settlement of conflicts.\nWe call for both sides to put an end to the bloody\nslaughter. In our view, the recommendations of the\nContact Group provide a way out of this crisis and hope\nthat peace can be restored in the heart of Europe.\nWe greatly value the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral, his Mission and the Observer Group of the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(CSCE) to resolve issues peacefully in Tajikistan. We\nwelcome the recently signed cease-fire in Tehran, in\naccordance with which hostilities have temporarily ceased\nand political prisoners and prisoners of war are being\nreleased. We have great hope for the gradual end of this\ncrisis and for the unification of the Tajik peoples, who\nhave experienced more than enough sorrow and suffering,\nfor the return of all refugees to their homes and for the\nrestoration of peace with our neighbours. We express this\nhope now, before the coming winter, and call upon all\n31\n\n\ncountries to render vitally important humanitarian aid to\nTajikistan.\nWe are following with great concern and alarm the\nsituation in Afghanistan and welcome the efforts towards\nsettlement. The restoration of peace in that country and the\nachievement of national reconciliation would bring long-\nawaited peace to the Afghan people, who have suffered so\nmuch, and drastically improve the situation in our region of\nthe world. That region is exhausted from gunfire and war.\nIt is yearning for trade and a return to tilling the soil.\nNotwithstanding the tremendous difficulties inherent\nin our search for peace and accord in that country, we urge\nthe world not to give in either to moral or to donor fatigue.\nIt is not possible to dodge responsibilities during this trying\nperiod because the deadly conflict in this country has been\nbrought about by participation on many different sides.\nAfghanistan has a plethora of weapons. The country is\nprey to a non-stop and intensive arms race. Hope for peace\ncan be guaranteed only if the international community\ndevotes its unwavering attention and political will to\nunravelling the knot of the Afghan conflict.\nThat is why my country has consistently called for\ncompletion and effective implementation of the Register of\nConventional Weapons. We support the initiative of the\nUnited States announced by President Clinton on the\nratification of and support for General Assembly resolution\n48/75 K of 16 December 1993 on a moratorium on the\nexport of land-mines.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic has consistently stood for a\ncomprehensive, effective reduction in conventional arms.\nWe are actively and diligently working on the conversion\nof our defence industry to civilian production. Kyrgyzstan,\nas a non-nuclear State, signed the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and advocates\ntransforming it into an agreement of unlimited duration.\nWe welcome the efforts of all countries - and first and\nforemost the United States of America and France - to\nreach a consensus on the issue of a comprehensive nuclear-\ntest ban.\nWe support the initiatives put forward by President\nNazarbayev of Kazakhstan on confidence-building measures\nin Asia, and we envisage our region of Central Asia,\nlocated as it is between two nuclear Powers, as an area free\nof nuclear weapons. That would be our Central Asian\ntreaty.\nOur world, so full of anxiety and so weary, believes\nthat hope for peace is not an illusion. I recall with great\nexcitement the unseasonably warm day of 13 September\n1993 at the White House in Washington when, after many\nyears of conflict, a declaration of principles on Palestinian\nself-rule in Gaza and Jericho was signed by the Israeli\nGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nIt is with great satisfaction and happiness that we see\ntogether with us in this Hall representatives of the\nGovernment of South Africa that was elected on a\ndemocratic basis. Let us stock up on patience. We can\nachieve breakthroughs and visible results on the difficult\npath to peace and concord only if we do not give in to\nfatalism.\nUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts are achieving\nsignificant success in settling many of the conflicts of our\ntime. We know that 75 countries are participating in 17\nUnited Nations Missions overseeing the holding and\nmonitoring of elections, rendering humanitarian assistance\nduring disasters and restoring what has been destroyed, as\nwell as ensuring a United Nations military and police\npresence. The issue of creating reserve peace-keeping\nforces has now been raised. From this rostrum we hear\nthe commitment of dozens of countries to peace-keeping\noperations. We need the blue helmets of peace, not the\nmercenary black helmets of death which have recently\nparticipated with increasing frequency in conflict zones\naround the world.\nFully aware that peace-keeping operations are an\nimportant factor in the future new world order, my\ncountry, with its highly qualified doctors, nurses,\nengineers and rescue workers, would like to participate in\npeace-keeping operations. We accept and support the\nproposals that many countries have made here at the\nGeneral Assembly during discussions of peace-keeping\nissues with regard to the need and opportunities for\nconducting training of military and civilian personnel on\nboth a multilateral and a bilateral basis. Such possibilities\nare also open to us as participants in the Partnership for\nPeace programme of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO).\nAs a country experiencing a period of emergency\nand in need of immediate assistance because of natural\ndisasters and social hardships, we warmly support the\nproposal of Argentina\u2019s President Menem that a civilian\nservice be created to provide immediate humanitarian\nassistance under the auspices of the United Nations.\n32\n\n\nDevelopment is the main problem facing young\ndemocratic societies. Thirty years\u2019 experience of North-\nSouth collaboration has taught us, the new 1990s generation\nof independent countries, instructive lessons. It is easy for\nour achievements and our real advantages to become lost in\nthe picture of the protracted drop in production levels and\nthe destruction of the social infrastructure. The people of\nKyrgyzstan are grateful to the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), the World Health Organization\n(WHO), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO) and other institutions in the\nUnited Nations family that have sought to help us at this\ndifficult time.\nIn the face of a sharp increase in drug trafficking,\ninterwoven with transnational organized crime, first in our\nregion and then through Russia to Europe and other\ncontinents, we need energetic and massive measures to\nblock the drug-distribution routes and destroy production.\nThe United Nations International Drug Control Programme\nhas become truly critical in our region. As a whole, we\nwould like to see greater action and coordination of the\nwork of the United Nations specialized institutions with the\nnew States, both at their headquarters and in their regional\noffices.\nIt is noteworthy that not only traditional developed\ncountries, but also developing countries, which bear the\nburden of their own numerous economic and social\nproblems, have helped in the establishment of the newly\nindependent States and their entry into the world order.\nAnd this has particular significance. We are firmly\nconvinced that the timely rendering of full-fledged,\neffective assistance to us - countries with transitional\neconomies that must now choose their own paths at this\ndifficult time - will help us to stand more quickly on our\nown two feet, form the foundation for a market economy\nand develop democratic foundations for society. We\nourselves will then be able to render speedier assistance to\nthe more needy. We support such a policy of reaching out\ntowards solidarity, mutual support and collaboration.\nBearing in mind the close collaboration of countries\nwith transitional economies with international financial and\neconomic institutions, precise coordination and deeper\ninteraction of the work of the United Nations and the\nBretton Woods institutions are becoming increasingly\nnecessary.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic welcomes and shares the\nobjectives and fundamental parameters of development set\nforth in the preliminary report of the Secretary-General,\n\\\"An Agenda for Development\\\". These are peace,\neconomic growth, the environment, justice and\ndemocracy.\nThe recent World Conference on Population and\nDevelopment in Cairo and future Conferences on social\ndevelopment and the improvement of the status of women\ntestify to the world\u2019s deep concern about the situation of\nbasic human needs at the turn of the next century. If\nhuman rights are all-inclusive, universal and inalienable,\nthen these rights also pertain to all women and children\non Earth. The improvement of the status of women is\nkey to resolving vital social problems such as those\ninvolving population, education and health care. In other\nwords, it is the most important issue on the eve of the\ntwenty-first century for an agenda for humanity.\nIn my country, we will fully support and are ready\nto cooperate with the newly appointed United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. We in\nKyrgyzstan, a country in which over 80 ethnicities reside,\nseek to create equal and just conditions for all of our\ncitizens. There are no restrictions on the development of\nculture, the arts, education or media in the languages of\nall ethnic groups. Along with an increase in mosques, the\nnumber of Orthodox and Protestant churches is growing.\nCommitted to ideas of friendship and concord, we are\nconsistently working on programmes and measures to halt\nmigration from our country and to preserve the present\nmulti-ethnic composition of society. On the basis of the\nDeclaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to\nNational or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities\nadopted at the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, my country, together with the Russian\nFederation, cosponsored a CIS convention on the rights of\nethnic minorities, which is currently open for ratification\nto all other Commonwealth members.\nDemocracy in my country is very fragile. Political\npluralism, freedom of the press and speech, and adherence\nto human rights and fundamental freedoms in the\nRepublic are not accidental gifts from above but genuine\nvalues for which a real struggle is being waged in society\n- the struggle between openness and isolation, blind force\nand respect for the law, totalitarian ways and commitment\nto freedom. But the people of Kyrgyzstan, headed by\nPresident Askar Akaev, having made its choice three\nyears ago, firmly and unwaveringly stand for democracy\nand a market economy.\n33\n\n\nA tectonic political, social, and economic shift is\ntaking place across the enormous Eurasian land mass. The\nsuccess of the present transformations in Russia strengthens\nour own awareness of the irrevocability of the choice of the\ndemocratic way. Kyrgyzstan, like other nations of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States, is deeply committed\nto democracy, the principles of freedom and independence,\nand the philosophy and spirit of the creation of peace. My\nancient people, yet still a young nation, like the \\\"Manas\\\" -\na Kyrgyz epic poem of a million lines - the millennium of\nwhich we will celebrate in 1995, is undergoing a\nrenaissance. We realize that a long and thorny path awaits\nus. But the most important thing on that path is peace,\nwhich is the same for everyone on this Earth and is\nindivisible.\n"

        "file_text": "We are gathered here today, in a new session of the\nGeneral Assembly, in a new year in the life of the United\nNations, one that will take us to the end of the first half\ncentury of its existence, which we shall celebrate next year.\nHalf a century will have passed since the birth of a\ngreat dream, a dream that humanity envisaged as an\nendeavor for peace, reconciliation, solidarity,\nrapprochement, and dialogue amongst peoples of different\nethnic origins and cultures across continents, a dialogue\namongst nations, States, ideologies, religions, and creeds\nof this world, with all its differences and singularities.\nThrough this great dream, humanity wanted to create\nan arbiter, a referee on right, justice, and peace, and a\nforum in which it could discuss its problems and seek\narbitration; in which it could find a way to defend rights\nwhen rights are denied, to defend itself when injustice\nprevails, and a champion that would stand by its side\nwhen it is threatened.\nThrough this dream, mankind sought to put an end\nto wars and armed conflicts, to protect the sovereignty of\nnations, and to guarantee respect for their independence\nand free choice.\nThus, the United Nations came into existence.\nThe United Nations was born; and along with it, a\ngreat project emerged - one that was expected to\ncontribute to the solution of the world\u2019s crises. Alongside\nthe Organization, its political, security, social, economic,\nand cultural organs were set up. The peoples of the\nworld expected a lot from those organs, and treated them\naccordingly, with a deference commensurate with their\nstanding.\nThe will of this prestigious world body, which\nrepresents the position, the decision, and the will of the\nworld\u2019s peoples, is more comprehensive than the will of\nany individual State, no matter how great and powerful it\nmay be. The peoples of the world looked up to it and\naccorded it the respect normally granted to the defenders\nof right and justice. Right and justice supersede political\ninterests, no matter how strong they may be.\nHow far away are we today from this dream, from\nthis great endeavour, from all those intentions, slogans,\nambitions, aspirations, ideals and prospects?\nWhere is peace in the world, when battlefronts are\nwidespread? What have we done about the resolution of\nconflicts while conflicts escalate? What about the\nelimination of violence which is still on the ascendance?\nHow far away are we today from protecting what is right;\nfrom upholding the sovereignty of nations which is still\nundermined; from respecting human rights and the rights\nof peoples and States which are still being trampled?\nWhat have we done about the resolutions adopted by\nthis very Organization, in this very General Assembly\n33\n\n\nHall? What about the resolutions that await\nimplementation, and the many others that await adoption,\nand are knocking about in the labyrinths of impotence and\ndeals? How far away are we today from the credibility and\nauthority of our resolutions, from the one single standard by\nwhich we should judge things?\nI beg your indulgence for daring to voice these\nquestionings. I beg your indulgence, because they are\nvoiced by a State which is not privileged to be a member\nof the club of powerful nations which dare to question the\nUnited Nations.\nI beg your indulgence, because those who need the\nUnited Nations are not the powerful and the influential.\nThe United Nations was not created for them. It was\ncreated for the oppressed, for the unjustly treated, for those\nwho are not powerful by any means.\nThe small size of States and the humble size of their\npopulations have never been the true yardstick by which\ntheir role and contribution should be measured. Many\nnations have had a history larger than their geography, a\nrole larger than their size, and a contribution far greater\nthan the potential of others. Lebanon is one of those\nStates.\nWe have existed for thousands of years, ever since\nhumanity first organized itself into entities. We have had\nour political, cultural, economic, legal, and humanistic\nstructures ever since.\n\nSide by side with its Phoenician civilization, Lebanon\nembraced Pharaonic, Mesopotamian, Persian, Greek,\nRoman, Arab, and Western civilizations. Our foremost\ncontribution was to give mankind its first alphabet. We\nhave also enriched it with our legal, intellectual, cultural,\neconomic, scientific, educational and humanistic\ncontributions.\nWe were present when the United Nations was born.\nWe were also present when the International Court of\nJustice issued its first opinion, and we contributed to its\nmaking. We volunteered to work in all the United Nations\norgans and programmes at all levels. We shouldered our\nshare of responsibility by hosting some of them, and by\noffering them the best of our men and intellectuals.\nSocial and cultural pluralism was our national\nhallmark. In our composition, we were able to develop\nan abridged formula for multicultural nation States. The\nprinciple of state-building in the post-First World War era\nwas based on nationalities and ethnic origins. But today\nin the era of communications super-highways, in the era\nof ever-increasing demographic mobility, we have come\nto recognize that this principle, when put to the test, has\nfailed.\nWhile attempts have been made through the years to\nobliterate the distinctive identities of peoples living under\ncertain regimes - as in the case of the Soviet Union\nduring the Stalin era - those identities have resurfaced, as\nhave the problems which resulted from the attempt at\ntheir suppression.\nIf Lebanon were an almost unique case in the past,\ngiven the pluralistic features of its society, it is no longer\nso today. The Lebanese experience has become\ncommonplace, as we have come to witness through the\nnow commonplace demographic movement of populations\nand the lowering of geopolitical barriers. While our\nformula has been tested, many countries are still in the\nexperimental stage.\nWith the demise of the theory of nationalism, there\nis need for a new system, one that allows for the\ncoexistence of different cultures and identities under the\nroof of one homeland, as dictated by modern economic,\ntechnological, and practical challenges and needs.\nLebanon, its land and its people have had to suffer\nthe ravages of regional and international conflicts, the\nvagaries of hurricanes of international ideological\ndifferences and their complications. But, as ever in our\nhistory, we have been able to prove that we have the\nability to rise to the challenges that face us and that our\nformula for coexistence is much stronger than some\npeople may have believed, merely because it is the only\nfeasible and practicable one.\nWhen Lebanon was able to overcome the wars\nwaged by others on its soil, armed with the will of its\npeople and the support of its brethren and friends; when\nLebanon enhanced its internal security and stability,\nreactivated its national dialogue and tore down the\nbarriers between its various factions and forces; and when\nLebanon started to rebuild its institutions, rehabilitate its\ninfrastructures and embark upon its political and\neconomic endeavours, it proved once again that its\n34\n\n\ntime-honoured existence could not be wiped out and that it\nwas too strong to be eliminated.\nBut Lebanon\u2019s full sovereignty over all its territories\nand its total independence will remain compromised so long\nas major parts of its soil are not under its control and so\nlong as the State remains unable to extend its full\nsovereignty over all its national soil through its own\nlegitimate national forces.\nSo long as Israel occupies Lebanon\u2019s territories,\ndespite repeated United Nations resolutions and the will of\nthe international community; so long as Lebanese citizens\nare still languishing in Israeli detention camps, ignored by\nthe international community and out of the reach of the\nhumanitarian organizations that are not allowed to visit\nthem; so long as this continues, the wounds will not heal\nand the blood shall not be stanched.\nSo long as that occupation continues over more than\none eighth of our national territory; so long as Israeli raids\ncontinue to sow the land daily with bombs, mines and\nbooby traps - killing mainly our innocent children; so long\nas these criminal acts continue against a heroic people that\nrefuses to surrender, the cries of our women and children\nwill continue to haunt the world along with our cries of\nanger, revolt and resistance.\nUntil now, the occupation has failed to contain this\nanger, regardless of the means employed. Day after day,\nthe death toll rises, ours and theirs. Blood flows in\nSouthern Lebanon and in the Beka\u2019a Valley. No\ntechnological invention, no matter how ingenious, and no\ntechnique of war have been able to undermine our people\u2019s\ndetermination to regain its independence, freedom,\nsovereignty and peace.\nThere are over 300 Lebanese men and women still\nlanguishing in Israeli prisons. Some have died; others have\nbeen disabled. In their prison cells, they hear about a\ntheory called \\\"human rights\\\", one that tops the agendas of\nour meetings and forums. Theorists are preoccupied over\nthe rights of flora, fauna and the environment while our\nprisoners wonder to which class they belong and under\nwhich category they are classified.\nSo long as the international community addresses the\nworld\u2019s problems by using more than one standard; so long\nas Security Council resolutions remain unimplemented; and\nso long as Chapter VII of the Charter is applied selectively\nto troublemakers who lack any kind of protection, we\ncannot be deemed faithful to the true mission of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe have waited so long for the international\ncommunity to show some real interest. We have also\nwaited impatiently for the implementation of Security\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978), only to see the Council\nrefrain from condemning the aggression rather than\nenforce its resolutions. When it does condemn, the\ncondemnation applies equally to the aggressor and the\naggressed under the pretext of supporting the peace\nprocess.\nWe were invited to the Madrid Peace Conference.\nWe were optimistic about the invitation, the content and\nthe sponsorship. The co-sponsors were super-Powers and\nthe Conference was to be convened on the basis of a just,\ncomprehensive and lasting peace, anchored in the\nprinciple of \\\"land for peace\\\" and on the basis of Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\n(1978) respectively. We accepted advice to join in that\nmechanism. By accepting the invitation, we accepted the\ncontent. We were expected to discuss mechanisms and\nschedules.\nThree years have passed since the convening of the\nMadrid Conference. Months followed upon each other\u2019s\nheels in waiting, time and again, for parliamentary\nelections, for presidential elections, for the appropriate\nmoment on the local level and for circumstances aimed at\nimproving the position of one side while isolating or\ncornering the other side.\nThree years have passed, and our tour of world\ncapitals is almost complete. From Madrid to Washington,\nto Paris, to Oslo and to Moscow. We are still discussing\nthe basic principles which should have been settled the\nvery first moment the Conference was convened. The\nprinciple of \\\"land for peace\\\" still awaits the definition of\nthe land concept. The principle of withdrawal is still\nunclear, since in the way that it is proposed, it still means\noccupation under different forms.\nThe principle of negotiating land for peace, which\npresupposes equality in the negotiating positions, is\npreempted by pressuring the Arab negotiator so that he is\nleft with nothing to offer. Resistance must stop - so we\nare told - without any guarantee of withdrawal or\nliberation. The boycott must end, but no guarantees are\ngiven for the recovery of the usurped rights. We must\nenter the multilateral negotiations without knowing\nwhether or not there will be peace and what the form and\n35\n\n\ncontent of that peace will be. We are asked to celebrate\nand to shake hands without knowing what it is we are\ncelebrating. We are required to take into account the local\npublic opinion of others; we have to reassure that public\nopinion of others as if we ourselves do not have a public\nopinion to convince and as if we do not have our own\nsceptics who question our opting for peace.\nYes, we the victims of aggression are required to give\nsecurity guarantees to the aggressor. Those without\nweapons are required to reassure those who possess nuclear,\nchemical and bacteriological weapons. Yes, we entered the\nnegotiations for peace - an honourable peace, not a guilty\none; a balanced peace, not a lopsided one; a just peace, not\nan unjust one; a comprehensive peace, not a partial one; a\ngenuine peace, not a festive one; an equitable peace, not a\nbiased one; a natural peace, not an artificial one; a\npermanent peace, not a temporary one; a peace of the\npeople, not of regimes; a peace that makes us proud, not\nashamed; a peace of loyalty to, not betrayal of our martyrs.\nWe want a peace that allows for the return of\nrefugees, rather than consecrates their dispersion; a peace\nthat satisfies the revolutionary, instead of provoking him; a\npeace from which we draw strength; a peace we can\nprotect; a peace that will, once and for all, relieve the world\nof this burden, the burden of our region; a peace that will\nput an end to exporting anger; a peace of prosperity,\ndevelopment, and stability; a peace that will allow our\nwidows to cease their mourning.\nThe days when the problems of peoples were confined\nto their own countries are over. The days when geographic\nand political boundaries were a barrier between peoples are\nover. Our era is one of interdependence and of\ncommunication. It is an era of the lowering of all barriers.\nNo country is too remote. No matter how far removed\nfrom the area of conflict, it will still be affected by that\nconflict and by the demographic problems that do not\nrecognize boundaries or borders, unless such problems are\nstemmed at the source.\nWe can always be subject to nuclear, chemical and\nbacteriological pollution, since there are no boundaries in\nthe atmosphere. The environment can very well become\ncontaminated, because the mountains cannot stop the wind\nfrom blowing, and nature cannot stop rivers from flowing.\nWe will all be affected, whenever and wherever a\ndisaster strikes. We are all concerned about the world\u2019s\nsecurity, its stability, prosperity, resources, needs,\nrequirements, markets and citizens, wherever they may be.\nThe Middle East must not forever remain a fiery\nvolcano that threatens the peace of the world around it,\nchallenges international security, and destabilizes the\nworld economy. It must not remain the source of the\nworld\u2019s anger and resentment.\nLet there be no more occupied territories, no more\nacts of aggression, no more prisoners languishing in the\nprisons. Let there be no more blood flowing through the\nland of the prophets. Let no more darkness prevail in the\ncradle of God\u2019s religions.\nThis region will not enjoy more favorable\nopportunities than those that exist today. Time will not\nbe forever on the side of those who seek peace. Our\nregion must produce visionaries, as it has always done,\nand not manipulators of peace.\nOur congratulations to you, Sir, on the assumption\nof the presidency of this session of the General Assembly\ncannot come from the heart in isolation of what we\nexpect from the United Nations during your presidency.\nThe efforts of the Secretary-General cannot be viewed or\nappreciated outside the scope of our view of the United\nNations. May God guide you and illuminate your path in\nthe service of world peace to which Lebanon is dedicated\nand for which it fights.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure\nthat I congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his election to the\npresidency of the current session of the General Assembly.\nHis remarkable talent and consummate experience assure us\nthat we can feel proud and confident as he discharges his\nnew functions admirably and with distinction. His\nleadership of the Assembly confers dignity on Africa, on\nWest Africa and on his country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, with which\nSierra Leone happily enjoys excellent bilateral relations and\nshares a common West African identity. We extend to him\nan abiding wish for his success.\nTo Ambassador Insanally of Guyana, his immediate\npredecessor, I convey my delegation\u2019s gratitude and\nappreciation for the commendable manner in which he\nperformed his duties as President of the forty-eighth session\nof the General Assembly.\nThe approach adopted by the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization since he assumed office has been exemplary\nin many ways. He deserves high tribute for his untiring\nefforts over the past two years, especially in the realms of\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and the\npromotion of development.\nThe world is still in transition. Although the outcome\nof the process of transformation is not easy to predict with\nany degree of certainty, it is nevertheless clear that the\nworld will continue to be preoccupied in the next half-\ncentury with problems carried over from the last -\nproblems concerning the promotion of development,\nespecially of the least developed countries; the\nmaintenance of peace and security; and the consolidation\nand strengthening of the process of cooperation and\nintegration between nations. These are among the major\nchallenges of our time.\nDevelopmental and political issues now occupy a\nlarger part of our global, regional and national agendas,\nand the past 12 months have been no exception. In some\ncases, these developments have been a source of joy and\nsatisfaction; in others, the stigma of shame and disgrace\nhas loomed larger.\nOn the economic front, the slow, uncertain and\nunbalanced growth of the economies of developing\ncountries generally has been a source of grave concern.\nThis is evidenced by the alarming increase in the number\nof peoples living in absolute poverty, stagnating resource\nflows, dwindling direct foreign investment, reduction in\nexport earnings, excruciating debt crises, rising\nunemployment, especially among the youth, and\nenvironmental degradation.\nThe persistence of these problems could easily\nundermine the stability of the world economy and pose\nserious threats to international peace and security.\nImmeasurable work has been done to redress the\neconomic stranglehold in which most of our countries\nfind themselves. A lot more, however, needs to be done\nby the developed countries and the international financial\ninstitutions to prevent many of the world\u2019s poor countries\nfrom being completely submerged by the heavy burdens\nimposed by the present international economic system.\nMore specifically, new, additional resources, at both the\nmultilateral and the bilateral levels, need to be provided\nby our development partners if any improvement in the\nlives of the teeming millions in the third world is to be\nassured.\nThe situation is even more acute for my country,\nwhich is in the throes of a rebel war and implementing a\nsubstantial economic reform programme as well as a\npolitical transition programme \u2014 all three activities\ntaking place simultaneously. Hardly any other State\nmember of the Assembly shares this unique experience.\nGiven the increasing interdependence and globalization of\nthe world economy, the massively deteriorating economic\nsituation of the developing countries and, in particular, the\n20\n\n\nuniqueness of the plight of Sierra Leone deserve the full\nand urgent attention of all the members of the international\ncommunity.\nPoverty and the decreasing living standards of the\nmajority of our people are at the heart of our problems. To\nalleviate these problems, my Government has embarked on\ncourageous, wide-ranging and far-reaching socio-economic\nreforms, including the deregulation of prices and exchange\nand interest rates, and the reduction of fiscal deficit. The\npace and scope of these reforms, however, contrast sharply\nwith the very modest results achieved so far. Despite\nconsiderable success in securing short-term macroeconomic\nstabilization, the reforms appear to have neither removed\nthe structural constraints facing the economy nor improved\nsupply capacity. We are now resolved to ensure that future\nadjustment programmes are designed and implemented in\na manner that takes due cognizance of the special needs of\nthe vulnerable groups of our society as well as the social\nrequirements of development.\nThose are just some of the difficult tasks ahead. They\nare made no less formidable by the new challenges posed\nby the Uruguay Round agreements signed at Marrakesh last\nApril. My Government welcomes the new agreements, but\nwould stress the need for continued evaluation of their\nimplementation to ensure expansion of world trade for all\ncountries, improved market access and adequate protection\nof the interests of the least developed countries in\nparticular. Any attempt, therefore, to impose new\nconditionalities, encompassing environmental and labour\nconditionalities in this context, must be strongly resisted.\nIn the meantime, the observation is inescapable that\nthe Marrakesh agreements pose a real danger to trade\npreferences previously assured developing countries; this\ncan lead to a loss in export market share and export\nearnings. Moreover, countries that are net importers of\nfood face the prospect of higher food-import bills arising\nfrom the liberalization of trade in the agricultural sector.\nThere is therefore a need to address without delay the\nquestion of how the adverse consequences of the Marrakesh\nagreements can be mitigated through enhanced trade\npreferences, assistance and compensation.\nThe external indebtedness of developing countries\nposes the biggest impediment to their development. A\npermanent and comprehensive solution must therefore be\nfound without further delay. That is why we commend the\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, His Excellency\nPresident Soeharto of Indonesia, for taking the initiative to\nconvene in Jakarta last August a ministerial meeting of\nnon-aligned countries on debt and development, with the\ntheme \u201csharing of experiences\u201d. That high-level meeting\non the debt crisis of developing countries, which I\nattended together with Ministers from twenty-five heavily\ndebt-distressed, least-developed countries, endorsed a\nnumber of general principles for debt reduction, which\nrepresent a significant step in the search for a lasting\nsolution to the debt problem. We therefore urge the\nUnited Nations and the international community to adopt\nthe principles contained in the report of the Jakarta\nmeeting, submitted to the Assembly by Indonesia.\nCalling upon the international community to pay\nspecial attention to the problems of developing countries\nis not a proclamation of abdication of responsibility. In\nAfrica, for example, we have accepted that the key to\nsustainable development is in the hands of Africans\nthemselves. The African leadership must therefore\ndemonstrate a determination to stay the course of\nappropriate economic reforms and improvement in\ngovernance. We do emphasize, however, that the\ninternational community must play a crucial supportive\nrole in the creation of the environment necessary to\nguarantee sustainable growth and development of\ndeveloping countries in ways that include the provision of\nadequate levels of concessional, financial and technical\nsupport for infrastructure and national capacity-building\non a continuous, predictable and assured basis.\nThe issues I have raised will no doubt be on the\nagendas of certain conferences slated for the coming year.\nThe World Summit for Social Development in\nCopenhagen, March 1995, will provide an opportunity for\nall of us to focus on such matters as socio-economic\ndevelopmental challenges, the adoption of a global\nstrategy for poverty eradication, the generation of\nproductive employment and the enhancement of social\nintegration \u2014 in all of which the needs of people will\noccupy centre stage. The situation of women and the\nneed to integrate them better in the development process\nas agents and beneficiaries of development will also\nreceive attention at the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, to be convened at Beijing in September next\nyear. This Assembly, for its part, is convening a\nhigh-level intergovernmental meeting to conduct a\nmid-term global review of progress in the implementation\nof the Programme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries in the 1990s. Naturally, my delegation holds\nhigh expectations that the recommendations and\nconclusions of these meetings will make substantial\ncontributions towards creating the climate necessary for\n21\n\n\nenhancing the socio-economic conditions of developing\ncountries.\nIn the same vein, my delegation commends the timely\ninitiative of the Secretary-General in submitting \u201cAn\nAgenda for Development\u201d pursuant to the resolutions of\nthis Assembly. It provides us with another historic\nopportunity to address the root causes of poverty and\nunderdevelopment of the developing countries in a holistic\nand comprehensive manner. We urge the Secretary\n-General to make concrete, action-oriented\nrecommendations for the enhancement of the\nsocio-economic conditions of these countries and to suggest\npractical measures for their implementation.\nTurning now to the environment, my delegation is\nconcerned at the general response to the recommendations,\ndecisions and commitments of the Rio de Janeiro\nConference on Environment and Development, held over\ntwo years ago. True, some progress has been recorded\nsince that Conference. What is missing, however, is a clear\ncommitment on the part of the developed countries to\nprovide financial and other relevant resources for the\nimplementation of Agenda 21. We in the developing world\nare committed to implementing Agenda 21, but this\ncommitment will remain illusory unless it is complemented\nby adequate human, financial and technical resources.\nOn the world political scene too, the picture that we\nsee concurrently inspires hope and engenders desperation.\nWithout a doubt, the holding of the first pluralistic,\nnon-racial, democratic elections in South Africa, in April\nthis year, and the subsequent installation of a Government\nof national unity, marked a major achievement not only for\nthe people of South Africa but also for this Organization.\nThe patient and dedicated struggle of all peace-loving South\nAfricans to resolve peacefully the abominable policy of\napartheid, aided by the committed solidarity of the world at\nlarge, has been amply rewarded.\nIn taking this opportunity, on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Sierra Leone, formally to\nwelcome South Africa back into this world Assembly, I\nwish to reiterate our commitment to work together with the\nnew Government to make our continent a better place for\nall of us. Theirs has been a long and arduous journey\nthrough dark and difficult times that tested both courage\nand faith. The presence of the South African delegation\nhere today is a confirmation of man\u2019s ability to rise above\nthose conditions that threaten his survival and to resolve\nthem peacefully, though they may have originally appeared\ninsurmountable.\nThere are at least three lessons to be learnt from the\nSouth African experience:\nFirst, with South Africa\u2019s freedom, the non-white\npeoples of that country, and indeed everywhere, are\nenabled to regain their lost humanity. While apartheid\nexisted, its stigma touched many, even beyond that\ncountry\u2019s borders. Yet, with that policy\u2019s banishment\nfrom the South African landscape, this Organization\nshould now rekindle its sense of purpose to continue the\nstruggle against racial discrimination and segregation\nwherever they exist.\nSecondly, the attainment by South Africa of\ndemocratic values under a non-racial Government of\nnational unity should demonstrate to all countries,\nespecially in Africa, that excuses for denying a similar\ntransformation to our own societies are now untenable.\nThirdly, the fact that such a man as Mr. Nelson\nMandela could emerge from 27 years of imprisonment on\nRobben Island and, setting aside any bitterness, preach\nand demonstrate accommodation and national\nreconciliation should in itself encourage our brothers and\nsisters in divided societies to forswear retribution and\nstrive instead for tolerance and harmony.\nThese lessons have not been lost on us in Sierra\nLeone. We have come to understand and appreciate from\nthis exemplary South African political experience that,\nwhere democratic principles are applied in full in the\ngovernance of any nation, there is every likelihood that\nsolutions will be found to the political problems of that\nnation, however intractable they may appear. Conscious\nof this fact, the Government of the National Provisional\nRuling Council of Sierra Leone, headed by His\nExcellency Captain Valentine Strasser, has unveiled a\npolitical reform programme that will ensure the\ninstallation of a democratically elected government in our\ncountry by January 1996.\nWith that in view, an Interim National Electoral\nCommission of eminent citizens has now been constituted,\nheaded by Mr. James Jonah, former Under-\nSecretary-General of this Organization. Furthermore, as\na result of extensive debates on an initial Working\nDocument put together by a National Advisory Council,\nthe draft constitution has now been finalized and will\nsoon be presented to the people for final approval.\nMeanwhile, a National Commission on Democracy, which\nwill undertake a programme of mass education to let the\npeople appreciate the values of democracy and their rights\n22\n\n\nand duties as citizens, will soon be appointed. All these\nsteps are designed to underscore the commitment of my\nGovernment towards the full restoration of democracy in\nSierra Leone by the end of 1995. Let me assure this\nAssembly that the Government of the National Provisional\nRuling Council remains fully committed to the transition\nprogramme, which continues to be on course. We look\nforward to the cooperation and assistance of the\ninternational community in enabling us to realize the\nprogramme\u2019s objectives.\nAllow me at this point to recall the adoption by the\nGeneral Assembly last year of resolution 48/196, entitled\n\u201cInternational assistance to Sierra Leone\u201d, and our\ncontinued expectation for the full implementation of its\nprovisions. We are appreciative of the assistance extended\nto Sierra Leone so far by the international community,\nespecially in the humanitarian field, and look forward to its\ncontinuation and increase in the future.\nYet, as promising as the nation\u2019s prospects are, it\nshould not be forgotten that we are engaged in a rebel war\nwhose origins are inextricably linked to the Liberian\nconflict, and whose consequences are still visible in the\nlarge number of refugees and internally displaced Sierra\nLeoneans, who now total an estimated 300,000 and 400,000\nrespectively. Further, the untold devastation of the\ncountry\u2019s economically productive areas continues to\nundermine an already fragile economy.\nMy Government realizes that even though our meagre\nresources are now committed to bringing this rebel war to\nan end, we must necessarily look forward to the\nreconstruction of our country and its economy, a task\nwhose success will be greatly enhanced through\ncollaboration with the United Nations system, especially in\nworking out a programme for the rehabilitation of the\ndevastated areas and the resettlement of our refugees and\ndisplaced citizens. To this end, we have already laid the\nfoundations for the expeditious rehabilitation of these areas\nupon the conclusion of the war, by setting up a National\nRehabilitation Committee that will oversee our efforts in\nthis matter.\nWhile, as a Government, we continue with reluctance\nto pursue the military option in prosecuting this war \u2014 and\nwe wish to record here our appreciation to all friendly\nGovernments, particularly Nigeria, Guinea and the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, for their assistance in that effort \u2014 let\nme say here and now that no option is foreclosed. We\nremain amenable to any option, military or non-military,\nthat will secure a speedy conclusion to this untenable\nsituation, thus ensuring the creation of an environment\nconducive to the holding of the elections anticipated in\nour transition programme.\nThe success of these undertakings and of others in\nmy Government\u2019s transition programme depends largely\non the progress that is made in restoring peace to Liberia,\nhence our deep concern about developments taking place\nacross our border. It is in this connection that we renew\nour commitment to the Cotonou accords and reiterate that\nthey contain the essential elements for the resolution of\nthe Liberian conflict, namely the disarmament of the\nwarring factions, leading to the holding of elections.\nDrawing from the experience in Angola, it is clear that\nwithout such disarmament, peace in Liberia will be\ntenuous at best. We therefore call on the United Nations\nand the international community to support the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)\nfinancially, logistically and otherwise in order to\nreinvigorate the peace process and ensure that\ndisarmament gains renewed momentum.\nGiven our own refugee situation, we are gravely\nconcerned about the increasing flows in the world refugee\npopulation, about half of whom are children, whose needs\nshould be met through appropriate measures of protection\nand assistance. This International Year of the Family\ntherefore provides an excellent opportunity to focus\nattention on the essential needs of refugee children. In\ncontemplating concrete measures to be taken by the\ninternational community in addressing this phenomenon,\nit is essential that the United Nations Convention on the\nRights of the Child be fully implemented.\nAs crucial as these measures are for mitigating the\nglobal refugee problem, we remain convinced that, unless\nand until the international community overcomes the\nscourge of poverty and political strife, this problem will\nremain constantly with us. It is our fervent hope,\ntherefore, that a renewed impetus will once again be\nfound to prevent and eradicate this condition of boundless\nhuman misery.\nLooking beyond the borders of our region, Sierra\nLeone acknowledges the signing of the Washington\nDeclaration by Israel and Jordan, ending the state of war\nbetween the two countries. We see this as a continuation\nof the peace process that started three years ago and that\nled to the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-\nGovernment Arrangements in the West Bank and the\nGaza Strip. It is a positive development, coming after the\nassumption of Palestinian self-government earlier this\n23\n\n\nyear, and anticipates the eventual attainment of\ncomprehensive peace among all concerned parties in the\nMiddle East.\nIn this connection, my Government would like to\ncommend the role of the United States and Egypt for their\nrelentless efforts in bringing together Israel and its Arab\nneighbours. We urge Israel on the one hand, and Lebanon\nand Syria on the other to intensify their efforts and display\nthe spirit of accommodation that had underpinned successes\nin other areas, so as to make the important objective of a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East\nrealizable within the shortest possible time \u2014 in the interest\nnot only of the people of the region, but of the world at\nlarge.\nWith regard to the dispute between Kuwait and Iraq,\nwe call upon Iraq fully to respect the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of Kuwait in accordance with the terms\nof the resolutions of the Security Council.\nWe would also hope that in other areas, such as\nSomalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, there will be\nprogress in bringing to an end the present unacceptable\nstalemate. While the absence of progress may be\nfrustrating, we nevertheless believe that it would be a tragic\nmistake even to contemplate disengagement from peace-\nkeeping operations in Africa at this crucial stage.\nBy far the most appalling situation that the\ninternational community has had to confront recently is that\nin Rwanda. We will not readily forget those graphic\nimages of death, abject misery and destruction, or soon\novercome the torment and challenges that our collective\nconscience has had to face. It is hard to explain and harder\nstill to understand how those dark days from April to July\ncould have taken place in this century in full view of the\nworld. That such a tragedy occurred at all points to the\nfailure of existing international mechanisms for responding\nto such devastating situations.\nDrawing from the Rwandan experience, the time has\ncome for all of us, but more so for us in Africa, to come to\nterms with the diverse nature of our societies and realize\nthat the denial by any group of the right of another group\nor section to participate in the life of a nation is\nindefensible and ultimately self-destructive. Peaceful\ncoexistence of heterogeneous communities and power-\nsharing within a nation are great values we must all uphold.\nFurther, we believe that painful admissions must be\nmade. A few years ago, when the Monitoring Group of the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOMOG) was deployed in Liberia, much criticism was\nlevelled against it. We were accused of harbouring\nulterior motives against that country and of encouraging\nintervention. Yet, looking back, none will deny today\nthat by its deployment ECOMOG averted a similar\ntragedy in Liberia. Concerted action by West Africans\nbrought that country back from the brink. Today,\nECOMOG represents Africa\u2019s flagship in preventive\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping, peace-building and peace\nenforcement. We call on States in Rwanda\u2019s region to\nreassert their lead role in the search for a peaceful\nsolution to the crisis in Rwanda. We believe that in the\nrealm of maintaining regional peace and security, regional\narrangements have an important role to play, as envisaged\nin Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. This has\nbeen recognized by the exemplary collaboration between\nthe United Nations and ECOWAS on the Liberian\nsituation.\nIn this context also, the OAU mechanism for conflict\nprevention, management and resolution deserves the\nfullest support of the United Nations system and the\ninternational community. We are therefore deeply\nencouraged by the positive resonance of some members\nof the Security Council in that connection.\nWe must at this point applaud the action of the\nFrench Government in Rwanda at a time when this\nOrganization seemed completely paralysed. We believe\nthat the French action, which undoubtedly brought a\nglimmer of hope to a situation that was palpably so\ncatastrophic and which prevented a second Goma, is\nworthy of special mention by all peace-loving nations.\nWe also commend the efforts of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity. What is now required to stabilize the\nsituation even further is the provision of full support for\nthe African and other troops that have been or are about\nto be deployed in Rwanda. We also call upon the present\nRwandan Government to continue to take all measures\nnecessary to restore peace and reconciliation to their\ncountry.\nThough we must all learn the painful lessons of the\nRwandan experience, it is essential that those who played\na part \u2014 any part at all \u2014 in visiting such horror on the\npeople of Rwanda be held fully accountable for their\ncrimes. In this connection, my delegation fully supports\nthe establishment of a special tribunal to bring to justice\nthose responsible for what can only be described as\ngenocide. We expect that the Commission of Experts\n24\n\n\nwill continue to collect all available evidence to make for\na speedy conclusion of this shameful episode.\nIn a similar vein, we expect that the International\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since\n1991 will soon begin the process of examining the available\nevidence in order to bring the perpetrators to justice. The\ninternational community has an obligation to ensure that\nsuch callous indifference to human life and the deliberate\ncommission of acts of atrocity, wherever they occur, do not\ngo unpunished. The time has come for a strong message to\nbe sent to all who may presume that no consequences will\nfollow from such despicable behaviour simply because it\ntakes place behind national borders.\nI wish to declare here and now that my Government\nrecognizes that no true governance can endure if people are\nseparated from and denied the full enjoyment of their\nfreedoms and liberties. Stemming from this recognition,\ntherefore, my Government has embarked on the major task\nof ratifying, as soon as possible, the remaining-human\nrights instruments to which Sierra Leone is not yet a party,\nthus guaranteeing within our domestic law their application\nto all Sierra Leoneans.\nAs conflicts go, none on our continent appears more\nintractable than that in Angola, where more than two\ndecades of devastation have fostered a culture of violence\nand war. The continuation of this conflict, which has cost\nthe lives of countless thousands of peaceful Angolans,\nremains a source of pain and anguish to my Government.\nAlthough not much optimism has been evinced, there\nseems to be some progress in the Lusaka peace talks. With\nthe acceptance by both the Angolan Government and\nUNITA of the comprehensive package put forward by the\nSecretary-General\u2019s representative, there is now renewed\nhope that the talks will soon yield the desired result of a\ndurable solution. My delegation welcomes this\ndevelopment and would like to encourage both parties to\nthe conflict in Angola to allow the will of the Angolan\npeople to prevail over the barrel of the gun.\nOn the positive side, in a year that has been as volatile\nas this one, the knowledge that general elections will soon\ntake place in Mozambique is cause for satisfaction. We\ncall upon the people of Mozambique to seize this\nopportunity to firmly demonstrate faith in their own ability\nto resolve finally the many years of conflict they have\nendured. Africans everywhere, I am sure, will give their\nblessing as Mozambique embarks on the path to durable\npeace and reconciliation.\nAmong the many ills that afflict our world today,\nfew are more inimical to the common good than the\nalarming resurgence of racism and xenophobia. Our\nconcern is heightened even further when we recall that it\nis scarcely more than 50 years ago that the world\nwitnessed the worst manifestations of racial\ndiscrimination. Back then, passions were inflamed by\nthose who argued falsely that the presence of so-called\nforeigners was injurious to the economic well-being of the\nState.\nToday, this nefarious argument is once again gaining\nground among bigots who see immigrants, asylum-seekers\nand refugees from other countries as targets for violence.\nSurely civilization has come too far to accept this\nsituation. It is for this reason, if for no other, that we\nbelieve that the world community should intensify the\npromotion of the Third Decade to Combat Racism and\nRacial Discrimination and to ensure the success of its\nobjectives.\nTo many of us it seems that the socio-economic\nwell-being of our world is under siege from conflicts in\nmany lands, far and near. In the Organization, our\napproach has been the traditional reliance on peace-\nkeeping operations. Yet, recent experience has shown\nthat this is not always the best option. My delegation\nmaintains the view that the Organization would be better\nserved by committing the greater part of its scarce\nresources to socio-economic development activities and\npreventive diplomacy.\nMany questions will continue to be asked about the\ndirection that the United Nations must pursue as its\nfiftieth anniversary dawns. Of vital importance is still the\nneed to encourage and provide for the full participation of\nall Member States in the work of the Organization. In\nmany ways, we are convinced that the growing incidence\nof political instability worldwide is a strong advocate of\na more efficient, transparent and democratic Security\nCouncil \u2014 a Council cultivating a culture that frowns\nupon a few seeking always to wield dominion over the\nrest.\nThere is now a compelling case for the pursuit of the\ndemocratic ethic nationally. But it does not and should\nnot end there: it is equally relevant to the international\narena. My delegation hopes that the deliberations of the\nOpen-ended Working Group, seized of the question of\n25\n\n\ninstitutional reforms, will gather momentum and will bring\nthese concerns to fruition as soon as possible.\nI have adverted at length to our problems, our\nconcerns, our fears and our aspirations, which we believe\nwe all share in this global village that is home to all of us.\nOver the years, we have striven together to find solutions\nto a wide range of problems whose impact can no longer be\nlocalized. If our journey through the decades has taught us\nanything, it is that blinding ourselves to the realities of our\ntime, turning away from them, avoiding involvement or\nseeking solace in inaction provides only momentary\nconsolation or comfort. The quantum leap in transport and\ncommunications makes us all our brother\u2019s keepers. No\nlonger is poverty merely the affliction of a distant cousin in\na far-off land, nor can we successfully shield ourselves\nfrom the trials and tribulations of those who may be less\nfortunate than we are.\nThe lesson to be learnt from all this is that, as human\nbeings, we have a fate inextricably interwoven, whether we\nlike it or not. Thus, our common endeavour to improve our\nworld should be impelled by a much bolder vision \u2014 one\nthat brooks no compromise in combating injustice, be it\npolitical, social or economic, and one that seeks to\nstrengthen the pillars of international cooperation, eradicate\npoverty and address the causes of instability.\nThese, then, are the challenges before us that a new\nand revitalized United Nations must pursue with vigour and\ncommitment. \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d and \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment\u201d not only show that peace and development\nare inseparable twins but contain the essential ingredients\nof a new vision of our one world. Let us now give that\nvision the focus and direction of a better tomorrow.\n"

I take this opportunity\nalso to commend your predecessor, Ambassador Insanally,\nthe representative of Guyana.\nI would be remiss if I did not pay special tribute to\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is conducting with his\nwell-known acumen and ability the work of this\nOrganization amid turbulent political waves and rapid\ninternational changes, and in the face of rising expectations\nregarding the role that the United Nations could play in the\nworld of today and tomorrow.\nAs we know, earlier this month, the International\nConference on Population and Development was held in\nCairo. We in Egypt are greatly satisfied that the\nConference concluded with a Programme of Action that\ndeals with population questions from their cultural and\ndevelopment perspectives, on the basis of a profound\nunderstanding of the various dimensions of this problem.\nUndoubtedly, the clamour that accompanied that\nConference was justified. Quite rightly, some have called\nattention to the fact that as the cultures of various nations\ndiffer from each other, there is no justification whatsoever\nto the imposition on any nation of a way of life it does\nnot approve of, a way of thinking it does not palate or\npractices which it does not accept. On top of all that,\nthere is the need to respect all religions, and to take into\naccount the virtues they preach and the guidelines they\nembody for the conduct of individuals and nations.\nIt might be important in this connection to refer to\nthe consecutive conferences that have been held in the\n1990s to deal with the social aspects of development. We\nbelieve that henceforth, the attention of developing\ncountries and of all other societies should be focused on\ndealing with these aspects. This is what all peoples of\nthe world have aspired after throughout the long years of\ninternational conflict which led to social and economic\nconvulsions that resulted in backwardness, misery and\nuntold suffering for millions of people.\nWhile we emphasize our interest in this approach\nthat relates to social development and its global character,\nwe also believe that the role of the United Nations therein\nis highly significant. Undoubtedly, the United Nations\nsponsorship of international conferences to this end\nconsolidates its role in shaping the world of tomorrow,\nwhich must be a world of equitable development,\ncollective security and social stability.\nI have made a point of beginning my statement by\naddressing the social dimension, in order to underline a\nnew tendency and a renewed awareness of this significant\naspect of international life. I call upon all countries to\naccord that aspect the high priority it has denied for\ndecades, during the cold war with its international\nconflicts that impacted negatively, not only on the social\nagenda, but also on international action in that respect and\nbeclouded people\u2019s awareness of its significance and\neffects.\nDuring the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, Egypt called for a new international social\n17\n\n\ncontract, to be formulated by all the world cultures and\nsocieties, so that it may act as a safety valve for the\ninternational community both now and in future.\nRealization of this vision will require, first and foremost,\nthe creation of an appropriate international social\nenvironment, that would be inspired by the specific and\ndistinctive characteristics of all societies and that would\nenrich the heritage of mankind. This could be done only\nthrough awareness of and respect for the integration and\ninteraction of cultures.\nProceeding from its awareness of the movement of\nhistory, Egypt was the first to sow the seeds of peace in the\nMiddle East. Today, Egypt is determined to continue to\nassist all parties to overcome the obstacles that impede\nnegotiations, and to lay the foundations of new, just and\nsecure conditions in the Middle East.\nYou may recall that last year, on behalf of my\ncountry, I called on the Governments and peoples of the\nMiddle East to reflect on the future of our relations after\nthe settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. My call was\nbased on the deep-seated Egyptian conviction that the only\nguarantee of a durable and stable peace in the Middle East\nis organically linked to the extent of the parties\u2019 success in\nworking out and laying the foundations of a new\nrelationship between the countries of the region that would\nbe based on a threefold foundation of political settlement,\nsocio-economic development, and regional security and\narms control.\nIn dealing with our vision of a new Middle East, I am\ngoing to deal with each of those underpinnings in a context\nthat has to do with the creation of a new situation which\nwould allow all the creative energies of the region to be\nunleashed in a climate of security, stability and confidence\nin the future.\nI speak first of political settlement. Last year, we met\nhere a few days after the signing of the historic agreement\nbetween President Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin in\nSeptember 1993. Under that agreement, the Israeli and\nPalestinian parties mutually recognized each other and\nagreed on a Declaration of Principles regarding the\narrangements of interim self-government. The wave of\noptimism that was generated at the time was tempered by\nthe customary caution which lasted until an agreement\nenforcing the Declaration of Principles was signed in Cairo\non 4 May 1994. That agreement constituted a significant\nstep on the long road of peace towards the exercise by the\nPalestinian people of their legitimate national rights.\nThe sight of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat\nentering Gaza on 1 July 1994 has thus epitomized the\nlong history of the Palestinian people\u2019s sacrifices and\nsteadfastness, with which they gained the support and\nsympathy of all peace- and justice-loving peoples\neverywhere. President Arafat\u2019s return was the first\ndividend of the peace option that heightened international\nrespect for the Palestinian people\u2019s responsible position\nand courageous decision at this historical and crucial\njuncture in their long struggle.\nAllow me to pay tribute from this rostrum to the\nadvocates of peace, on both the Palestinian and the Israeli\nsides. At the same time, I call upon both sides to\ncontinue to tend the shoot of peace until it becomes\nstronger and more deeply rooted. Moreover, I call for the\nexpeditious adoption of new concrete measures that would\nassure the Palestinian people in the occupied West Bank\nthat the peace dividends will embrace all the Palestinian\nterritories occupied since 1967.\nOne of the most important of such measures is the\nalleviation of the burden of occupation and mitigation of\nthe daily suffering of the Palestinian people. The\norganization of Palestinian elections in all the Palestinian\nterritories would enable them to move from the first step\nof self-government in Gaza and Jericho towards the\nexercise of their full political rights, in the framework of\nself-determination that is the appropriate and genuine\nresolution of this conflict. Moreover, I appeal to both\nsides, in equally strong terms, to confront all acts of\nviolence and practices of terrorism firmly and persistently\nto ensure safety for all and guarantee that peace will have\nthe upper hand.\nEgypt has commended the progress achieved on the\nJordanian-Israeli track. The 25 July 1994 agreement to\nput an end to the state of war between the two countries\nis a positive landmark on the road to peace. Egypt\nwelcomes this significant step and is confident that the\nrising momentum will soon help achieve tangible progress\non the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, based on full\nwithdrawal from the occupied territories of both countries.\nSecondly, I wish to speak of economic development.\nScrutiny of the Middle East situation makes it clear that\nthere is an organic link between peace and development\nin that region, whose peace and security are pivotal to the\nworld\u2019s peace and security. The laying of the\ngroundwork for the social and economic development of\nthe countries of that region is a necessary step, without\nwhich peace will remain meaningless and pointless. At\n18\n\n\nthe same time, the process of development can be\nsuccessful only within the context of balanced and well-\nplanned strategies that take into account the interests of all\nparties. In this regard, hopes are high and prospects are\nspacious enough. Nevertheless there is no room in all this\nfor the domination by one economy of another. The\nMiddle East can accommodate a comprehensive process of\nthe production and marketing of all that each country of the\nregion can excel in.\nEgypt, which is undergoing at present a stage of\nradical economic reform that aims at ensuring for its trade,\nindustry and private sector a significant breakthrough, is\nqualified to play a leading role in the economic\ndevelopment of the region. This should enhance the image\nof the Middle East as a region that attracts increasing\ntourism, flourishing trade and thriving investment, side by\nside with an advanced productive capacity. We nominate\nthe Middle East to be the cradle of new economic giants.\nEgypt does not seek opportunities of rapid gains, but\nrather an advanced economic framework that would\ncontribute significantly to changing the climate of the\nMiddle East and reshaping the region\u2019s ability to contribute\nto the interactions of the developed world economy.\nThirdly, I speak of regional security and arms control.\nComprehensive peace, in its wider sense, will never be\nupheld in the Middle East unless we change our old\nperceptions. These were the products of years of wars and\nenmity that engendered the belief that security could be\nassured only through the acquisition and stockpiling of\nweapons of mass destruction. This regional arms race, that\nplagued the region and accelerated in a climate of mutual\nsuspicion and hostility, must be tamed in order that we may\nadapt to the new realities prevailing in the region. Egypt\nbelieves that peace in the Middle East must be strengthened\nby taking arms-control measures, of which the first would\nbe a reduction of the levels of armaments.\nThe region\u2019s experience has shown that a higher level\nof quantitative or qualitative armament, in the case of any\ncountry has never deterred aggression nor guaranteed\nsecurity. If such experience is reason enough for\nreassessing our policies in this respect, the political\nachievements which have put us squarely on the road to\npeace make us question the wisdom of escalating armament\nunder conditions of peace.\nIf the first prerequisite is arms reduction, the second\nis the achievement of a better security balance amongst the\ncountries of the region. The emergence of a new more\nstable Middle East will never take place unless we\nrenounce the concepts of military superiority and agree to\nrid the region of the weapons of mass destruction. The\npersistence of such concepts can only jeopardize the\nexistent possibility of creating a new and different Middle\nEast. Any disruption of the security balance in the\nregion, is bound to generate suspicions that may cause the\nregion to slide once again into competition, escalation,\ndispute, conflict and confrontation.\nIf we are seeking normal relations between the\nparties, we have to ensure the co-equality of the\nobligations of all countries in the region. It is\nunacceptable that one party, to the exclusion of all others,\nshould be accorded a special exceptional status. Unless\nthis is addressed, serious cracks will develop in the\nfoundations we are laying which may deepen and widen,\nand undermine the whole edifice.\nProceeding from this, the Egyptian initiative\nlaunched by President Mubarak in April 1990, in which\nhe proposed that the Middle East should be declared a\nzone free of weapons of mass destruction, was\ncommensurate with the concepts of the new international\nera at the regional level and came as a natural extension\nof Egypt\u2019s 1974 initiative to declare the Middle East a\nnuclear-weapons-free zone.\nIn this regard, Egypt strongly urges all countries of\nthe region to accede to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and accept the\napplication of the safeguards regime of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency. This, if it takes place, will be a\nmajor step towards peace and reconciliation in the Middle\nEast that would safeguard against any setbacks in future\nregional relations. Egypt attaches great importance to\nIsrael\u2019s rapid undertaking of this step as we approach the\ndate of the Conference for the Review and Extension of\nthe non-proliferation Treaty in 1995. Otherwise, the\nextension of this Treaty, which aims at halting nuclear\nproliferation, would lead to the consecration of an adverse\nreality that is neither balanced nor proper and which runs\ncounter to the principle of universality. We would find\nthe persistence of such an exceptional situation strange\nand unacceptable.\nEgypt takes this opportunity to urge Israel to respond\npositively to this extremely earnest call which safeguards\nthe region against the evils of an unnecessary arms race.\nIt is a step that would help strengthen regional security.\nIn this era of peace, we should rethink our priorities and\nview the prerequisites of security from a different point\n19\n\n\nof view based on the new relations of peace instead of from\nconsiderations which had the upper hand at a time of\nregional conflicts. Israel should also conform to, rather\nthan depart from, the international way of thinking that\ncalls for universal adherence to the non-proliferation Treaty.\nWe adamantly insist on this in order to avoid a race in this\ndangerous field.\nWhile discussing issues of general concern to our world\nand its problems, I must also refer specifically to the\nprevailing situations in our region that create turbulence,\nproblems, hopes and pain. Brotherly Yemen is healing its\nwounds after discord and strife. We are hopeful that\nsufficient patience will be demonstrated to bring about\nnational reconciliation in accordance with the values of the\nYemeni people and in such a way as to ensure their\ncontinued march towards development and prosperity.\nIn Iraq, the brotherly Iraqi people remain in the grip\nof the tragedy that befell them and we look forward with\nthem to the day when their suffering will come to an end.\nThis would require the Government of Iraq to respond to\nthe demands of international legality and the unambiguous\nand formal recognition of the identity of Kuwait, its\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.\nWhile addressing the issues of the Middle East, we\ncall on Iran to extend good-neighbourliness to its Arab\nbrethren. In this regard, serious work is needed to resolve\nthe problem of the occupied Arab islands in the Gulf. This\nwould represent a positive indication that relations in the\nregion can be conducted on the basis of a positive dialogue\ndealing with the political tendencies that are a source of\nconcern in various parts of the region.\nI turn now to Egypt\u2019s closest neighbours in the region.\nIn this connection, I may say that the people and\nGovernment of Libya have now the clear political will to\nput an end to the Libyan-Western crisis concerning\nLockerbie by putting the accused on trial and attempting to\nreach practical solutions for the implementation of the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. An objective view of\nthe problem confirms the importance of respecting\ninternational legality since the trial of persons accused of an\ninternational crime is a necessity and the more\nexpeditiously it takes place the better it is for the process of\njustice.\nSimilarly, in addressing the issues pertaining to its\nneighbours, we must also mention Sudan, with which we\nhave had very special ties since the dawn of history.\nToday, Sudan is suffering from a challenge to its\nsovereignty in the south as well as an impediment to the\ndevelopment and prosperity of its people. In both\ninstances, Egypt stands firmly and clearly in support of\nthe unity and territorial integrity of Sudan. We cannot\naccept its fragmentation or division. With the same\nstrength and clarity, Egypt supports the right of the\nSudanese people to a tranquil and stable life that would\nafford them the opportunity to look to the future. In this\nframework, Sudan has a well-known history of tolerance\nand cordial relations amongst its people and with all its\nneighbours and brethren. There is no doubt that Sudan\u2019s\nimplementation of policies in this direction would ensure\na change in the strained relations in that region.\nDuring Egypt\u2019s chairmanship of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, which expired in June, the African\ncontinent witnessed a number of important achievements,\nthe most important of which was the success of the\norganization in creating a mechanism for the prevention,\nmanagement and resolution of African conflicts. This is\na development that contributes to the international efforts\ndeployed in that area. It also complements the role of the\nUnited Nations within the framework of the principles\nand objectives of the Charter.\nOver the same period, Africa has also witnessed the\nentry into force of the convention establishing the African\nEconomic Community. This represents a significant step\nby the African continent towards the realization of\neconomic integration, which will enable it to deal with the\nnew international economic realities and to face up to the\npotential consequences of international economic\ndevelopments that may not be entirely in the interests of\nthe African States. Moreover, we in Africa are currently\nstudying, in all earnestness, the social and economic\nsituation in the continent. We are fully aware of the high\npriority of this problem to Africa\u2019s present and future\ngenerations. This will be the subject of a special meeting\nof African foreign ministers soon to be held in Cairo.\nThe African continent\u2019s share of human tragedies\nhas been abundant enough, as demonstrated by the\nhorrendous events in Somalia, Burundi and Rwanda.\nWhile Africa reaffirms its principal responsibility to deal\nwith such sorrowful events by providing the necessary\ntroops to undertake peace-keeping and peace-building\noperations, experience has shown that the humanitarian,\npolitical and economic dimensions of such events require\na positive contribution by the entire international\ncommunity, primarily within the context of the United\nNations. Such contribution has been forthcoming and\nrepresents a unique international and regional solidarity.\n20\n\n\nAs regards Somalia, the tragedy is still unfolding,\ndespite strenuous African and international efforts to\nachieve national reconciliation between the warring Somali\nfactions. The crisis remains elusive owing to tribal rivalries\nand self-centered interests. The persistence of this situation\nhas further frustrated the international community, to the\nextent that a number of States have decided to withdraw\ntheir troops from the peace-keeping operation or to call for\nthe complete termination of the United Nations Operation\nin Somalia.\nWe are fully aware of the motives that have led to\nsuch decisions and proposals, and we emphasize that the\nresponsibility for putting an end to the current deteriorating\nsituation in Somalia and for reaching a solution to the crisis\nrests essentially with the leaders of the warring factions.\nWe are of the view that it is unacceptable and unwarranted\nthat the major Powers should impose a certain solution or\na particular leader in Somalia. At the same\ntime, we cannot wash our hands of this problem. There is\nstill an obligation on the part of the United Nations, the\nOrganization of African Unity and the League of Arab\nStates to assist in achieving a just settlement to the crisis.\nFrom Somalia we turn to Angola, in which recent\ndevelopments indicate a glimmer of hope that a final and\npeaceful solution may be close at hand. Egypt welcomes\nthe official acceptance by the Government of Angola of the\nproposals concerning national reconciliation. We call for\nthe intensification of efforts to achieve peace in order that\nthe Lusaka Conference may succeed and for the full\nimplementation of the peace agreement, as well as Security\nCouncil resolutions 864 (1993) and 932 (1994). We also\nstrongly urge UNITA to show its goodwill by negotiating\nconstructively to reach a peace agreement without delay.\nIt was our hope that a just solution to the Bosnian\ncrisis would be found before the commencement of this\nsession. Unfortunately, the painful reality is that the crisis\nis still with us. While we accept the position of the\nContact Group in its proposal of the peace plan which has\nbeen accepted by the Bosnian Government regardless of its\nshortcomings, yet we demand the most basic level of\nrationality and justice in managing this crisis. Frankly\nspeaking, we believe that lifting or easing the sanctions\nimposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Serbia\nand Montenegro - without deploying credible and capable\ninternational observers along its borders with Bosnia and\nHerzegovina or securing its recognition of Bosnia as a\nsovereign State amounts to a negative development that is\nbound to hinder a just settlement, that bespeaks\nacquiescence in considerations that run counter to the norms\nof justice and is tantamount to surrender to the policies of\naggression and racism.\nA few days ago, the Security Council adopted a\nrather hasty resolution easing the sanctions imposed on\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Serbia and\nMontenegro. It would have been more useful if the\nCouncil had given priority to a review of the extent of the\nimplementation of its many previous resolutions, adopted\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter. Those resolutions\ncontain provisions and requirements that should have been\nimplemented prior to any consideration of the easing or\nreviewing of sanctions.\nThe rules of international justice should not be\ntwisted to reward the aggressor for mere promises that\nlack credibility or effectiveness. Moreover, the\neffectiveness of the observers currently deployed on the\nBosnian-Yugoslav border is highly questionable. Indeed,\nin our view, they are ineffective and insufficient.\nEgypt, as a country contributing troops to the United\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), reiterates that\nthe purpose of the presence of these troops is to provide\ngenuine protection for those areas until such time as the\nBosnian armed forces would be in a position to undertake\nthe task of defending their territory.\nThe withdrawal of UNPROFOR while the power\nvacuum continues - an idea that is being floated - would\nbe a further step towards handing the protected areas to\nthe aggressors, who have the necessary power to control\nthem. This would certainly have negative implications for\ninternational relations as a whole.\nWe are at a unique juncture in history: our\ngeneration has been afforded an opportunity to lay the\nfoundations of a new era. Today, as we approach the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we feel that all\nnations, industrial and developing alike, must contribute\nto the development of a common vision of the new world\norder - a vision that will consolidate the foundations of\nour common future on the principles of democracy,\nhumanity and equality, arrived at through consensus by all\nmembers of the international community.\nWe wish to make it clear that any attempt to\nmarginalize the role of the developing countries in\nformulating the global vision for the coming era would\ninvolve the risk of drawing new lines of confrontation in\nplace of those that existed during the cold war. Those\nnew lines of confrontation would be ruled by economic\n21\n\n\nand developmental criteria and considerations that may ring\ndown a curtain thick enough to separate the North from the\nSouth, deepen disagreement between them, and give rise to\na situation inconsistent with the interdependence and\ncohesion of the present era. In this connection, I refer to\ndemands of the developing countries voiced during the\nmeeting held in Cairo this summer under the umbrella of\nthe Non-Aligned Movement.\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations coincides with the flagging of initiatives and\nproposals for the restructuring of the Organization\u2019s\nmechanisms. Such efforts will never rise to the level of\nexpectations unless they are preceded by an effort to reform\nour thinking, to bring it into line with the changes in the\ninternational situation and thereby to translate the new\ncollective vision into a concrete programme of action that\nwould be based on genuine consensus and that would afford\nus a real opportunity to ensure the stability of international\nrelations.\nIn this context, it is needless to point out that such a\nprocess of thought reform as the one I have just referred to\nmust impact on our efforts as we embark on the process of\nrestructuring the United Nations and, in particular, of\nreforming the Security Council with its extensive\ncompetence.\nWe must emphasize several points regarding the\nprocess of reforming the work of the Security Council.\nFirst, it must be carried out on a regional basis, not on a\nspecific-country basis. Secondly, the new seats - and there\nmay be two additional ones each for Latin America, Asia\nand Africa - must be allocated on the basis of the criteria\nstipulated in the Charter. Thirdly, it is not essential at this\nstage to specify the two States from each region that are to\noccupy the additional seats. The principle of rotation could\nbe applied to several States satisfying the criteria agreed\nupon, taking into account the specific characteristics of each\nregion. Fourthly, agreement must be reached\nsimultaneously on a number of issues concerning reform of\nthe Council\u2019s working methods and procedures and the\nneed to increase its transparency. Fifthly, the framework\nwithin which the right of veto is used should be reviewed\nand defined.\nWe should not pursue our work in this regard under\npressure of time or on the assumption that consideration of\nthe matter must be concluded by the time designated for the\ncelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\nFinally, it must be emphasized that rational\nrestructuring is infinitely preferable to what might result\nfrom a hasty decision that may please some States, upset\nthe overwhelming majority of States that suffer from lack\nof representation in the Security Council and put the\nCouncil itself in a position of extreme lack of credibility.\nIn this regard, I wish to state that a number of\ncountries are eligible for membership of the Security\nCouncil in accordance with the criteria to which I have\nreferred. One of those countries is Egypt, which has\nmade significant contributions to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security in all the political,\neconomic and social fields, and which continues to\ncontribute to the cause of peace and prosperity at the\nregional level and in the context of its various affiliations.\nEconomic clout has become the principal tool of\ncompetition and the determining factor in the distribution\nof power and influence on the political and economic map\nof the globe. At the same time, social development has\nbecome a goal which we all pursue and technological\ndevelopment has become a prerequisite of economic\nprogress and social advancement. It is a challenge that\nmust be faced by those who aspire to progress and\ndevelopment.\nRecent international developments have highlighted\nthe strong link between peace, stability and development.\nGlobal stability cannot be achieved without balanced and\nsustainable development. The existing structural\nimbalances in international economic relations will\ncontinue to cause the social turmoil and conflicts that turn\nunder our eyes to disputes which threaten international\npeace and security.\n\nOn its new journey - starting in New York, moving\non to Rio de Janeiro and Vienna, passing through Cairo\nto be continued in Copenhagen and Beijing - the United\nNations has proved that it remains the global umbrella\nunder which different ideas and positions interact.\nWe call on the United Nations not only to contribute\nto but to lead the process of formulating the new concepts\nand ideas required to lay the foundations of the new\ninternational order and the relations between the North\nand the South, particularly in the area of social\ndevelopment. This requires an overall process of\nrationalization, as indicated by the Secretary-General. In\n22\n\n\nhis current report on the work of the Organization he refers\nto\n\\\"the common misperception of the United Nations as\nan organization dedicated primarily to peace-keeping.\\\"\n(A/49/1, para. 1)\nHe states that economic and social questions should be at\nthe forefront of United Nations efforts. That is what should\nhappen.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like, first,\nto congratulate Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on his\nwell-deserved election as President of the General\n24\n\n\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session and to convey to him\nour good wishes for every success in his work.\nThe general debate is our chance, as Members of the\nUnited Nations, to undertake together an annual review of\nthe Organization\u2019s work - its successes and its failures -\nand to identify collectively the issues we want to focus on.\nWith the fiftieth anniversary next year, there is a pressing\nneed to do so. That will be the occasion to chart our new\npriorities for the twenty-first century.\nOur responses to some of today\u2019s challenges and\ntragedies have ranged from excellent but often\nunder-reported to woefully inadequate and, consequently,\ndefiantly reported.\nThe peoples of the world want to believe in the United\nNations and what it should achieve. If, however, within\nsome parts of the Organization we are bereft of purpose\nand intentions this golden anniversary threatens to be less\njoyous and more muted than many of us anticipated.\nNew Zealand has a strong vested interest in the United\nNations success, as do most small States. The New\nZealand people have always believed in the United Nations,\nin a collective approach to the resolution of global and\nregional problems. This has been demonstrated by strong\nsupport for the United Nations by successive Governments.\nFrom our experience of - and I do not hesitate to say\nthis - a turbulent two years on the Security Council and as\na committed founder Member of the Organization, I would\nlike to take this opportunity to offer some observations\nabout the problems we see as players in the collective\ndecision-making process.\nWhen New Zealand took part in the founding of the\nUnited Nations we and many others saw our primary\npurpose as providing for a system of collective security.\nUntil very recently that was little more than a vision. With\nthe end of the confrontation between two super-Power\nblocs, the goal of \\\"the organized common peace\\\", of which\nPresident Woodrow Wilson spoke so eloquently three\ngenerations ago, presents itself. We must not let it slip\nfrom our grasp this time. It will, however, take real effort\nand real determination.\nCollective security, or working together, is the\ncornerstone of the security of small States. Today they are\nthe overwhelming majority of the membership of this\nOrganization. New Zealanders recognize that peace is\nindivisible, that remoteness is certainly no safeguard: a\nproblem in any part of the world can ripple to the Earth\u2019s\nfarthest corners. While we are the country probably most\ndistant from the Balkans conflict, we have sent an\nenhanced company of soldiers to help in efforts to ease\nsuffering and, I earnestly hope with the will of the parties\ninvolved, one day bring peace throughout the former\nYugoslavia.\nFor the same reasons, our defence personnel can be\nfound engaged in peace-support operations in Africa, the\nMiddle East, Asia and most recently Haiti. And there are\nNew Zealand nurses, firefighters and aid workers spread\naround the globe in support.\nAgainst this backdrop, however, New Zealanders are\npuzzled at times by the way in which the United Nations\ncarries out some of its important tasks. In Bosnia, despite\nthe employment of what is by any standards a large, well-\narmed and well-trained force, people see on their\ntelevision screens nightly the frustration of the United\nNations Protection Force by small groups of irregulars, a\nsingle policeman or even small groups of non-combatants.\nIn Haiti they witnessed a boat full of Blue Berets turned\naway by a small group of pistol-toting thugs\nunconvincingly called \\\"attach\u00e9s\\\".\nAnd what can one say about the appalling tragedy in\nRwanda? How can so much hatred have been unleashed\nso viciously, killing hundreds of thousands? What we\nwatched with horror on our television screens was\ndestruction on a scale we thought only megaton bombs\nwere capable of. The systematic slaughter of men,\nwomen and children simply because of their ethnic origin\nleaves us all outraged.\nThere are no easy answers. But the first key to\nunlocking the possibilities for a genuine collective\nsecurity must be the proper application of the United\nNations Charter. We have to decide at exactly what point\nthe United Nations should get involved in the\npeacemaking operation. Do we recognize a problem, and,\nif we do, is the preventive diplomacy that we so firmly\nbelieve in occurring?\nIn my view, we have to follow the intention of the\nCharter. First, at the outset of a crisis, or even the signs\nof a crisis, we have to make more serious efforts through\nthat preventive diplomacy to resolve problems and\nconflicts by negotiation. Efforts must be made at an early\n25\n\n\nstage to address the root causes of conflicts by the Security\nCouncil\u2019s exercising all its responsibilities under Chapter VI\nof the Charter.\nHowever, on some occasions, in these days of modern\nmedia technology, we face the dilemma caused by the\ndivergence between what the public perceives as happening\nand what is the reality. Extensive media coverage puts\npressure on for immediate response. In the case of\nRwanda, that was appropriate. In other circumstances, the\nmedia oversimplify and ignore the fact that conditions on\nthe ground are chaotic and United Nations resources are\nover-stretched.\nA second area where the Charter could be more\ncarefully applied is when disputes are first placed before\nthe Council. I believe it should give affected States an\nadequate hearing before addressing the problem behind\nclosed doors. Our experience on the Security Council\nsuggests the investment in openness that would be achieved\nby developing a practice of collectively hearing directly\nfrom the parties involved would be worthwhile, even if it\nwere done only informally.\nIn the same vein, the Charter specifically contemplates\nthe involvement, without vote, of troop-contributing\ncountries in significant decisions. New Zealand has pressed\nthis issue for some time, but so far with limited success.\nThe time is coming, in fact, when the General Assembly\nwill have to address the question if the Security Council\ndoes not respond adequately to the concerns that have been\nraised.\nUnder the Charter, much is expected of the Council\u2019s\npermanent members. There is no doubt that they can and\ndo contribute greatly to the work of the United Nations.\nLeadership and sacrifices by the large Powers were, for\nexample, instrumental in successfully challenging\naggression against the small State of Kuwait three-and-a-\nhalf years ago.\nI emphasize again, however, the importance of the\ncollective nature of decision-making in the Security\nCouncil. Making distinctions between the views of the\n\\\"P5\\\" and the rest is not really healthy. The Council is a\nteam of 15. It must work together, and by that I mean\ngiving full weight to the views of all its members. The\nstrength of the Security Council is enhanced each year by\nthe vigorous enthusiasm brought by new members on 1\nJanuary, testing what may have become an accepted\nsecond-best.\nI would remind the Assembly that the Charter\nclearly envisages that the norm for operations to maintain\ninternational peace and security will be United Nations\noperations. National operations are not ruled out, of\ncourse. I wish therefore to highlight and question recent\ntrends toward coalitions under national command, and the\nimplications for the collective security needs of small and\ndistant countries where no strategic interest is involved.\nHowever, the Security Council will be judged on its\neffectiveness. Successes, hopefully, will outweigh\nfailures, but we all have an obligation to improve the\nsuccess rate. I am an enthusiastic supporter of improving\nour success rate, but much of that will come down to the\nway in which issues are managed. And it is that question\nof the management of issues that I wish to address.\nIn our experience, the key is to use management\ntools based on proven modern public- and private-sector\nexperience. This is very valuable. What are these tools?\nAnd how do we apply them to the conduct of peace-\nkeeping operations?\nI would suggest that there are six critical elements:\nfirst, a sustainable financial system; secondly, a\ntransparent political accountability; thirdly, clear\nobjectives that incorporate regular reviews; fourthly, a\nclear, unambiguous command and control structure;\nfifthly, a credible legal regime that guarantees the security\nof United Nations personnel; and, sixthly, the availability\nof resources so that objectives can be met quickly and\nefficiently.\nLet me go back to that first point, a sustainable\nfinancial system. There is no doubt that the Organization\nis facing a financial crisis that cannot be ignored. We\nhave had serious problems with reserves and we have\nsignificant debt to contributing countries. The largest\ncontributor has indicated that it will unilaterally reduce its\nshare of funding from October next year. The situation\nis not sustainable. It requires urgent action.\nWhy do we have this crisis? There are some simple\nanswers. Some members cannot pay; others will not pay;\nand some are arguing the legitimacy of their assessment.\nThe General Assembly, this body, must confront this\nissue. The United Nations must stop extending credit to\nnon-payers. There is enough evidence emerging to\nsuggest that there may be serious inequities in the present\nsystem.\n26\n\n\nSome countries with extraordinarily strong growth\nover the past 5 to 10 years appear in the revised scale\nissued by the Committee on Contributions with a constant\nor even reduced contribution level. That is not acceptable.\nIt must be remedied.\nWe do not want a hollow celebration on the fiftieth\nanniversary with a cash crisis hanging over the\nOrganization. We must make a commitment to resolve this\ncrisis before the conclusion of the forty-ninth session.\nThe next point is the need for political accountability.\nThere is in my view a parallel priority to develop and\nimprove the Organization\u2019s capacity for undertaking its\ncollective security responsibilities. To do that we need to\nput in place more transparent procedures throughout the\nOrganization. The management of peace-keeping\noperations is allocated to the Secretariat. This is necessary\nand appropriate in the same way any Government delegates\nresponsibility for a complex operation to its public service.\nHowever, and I speak as a politician and as a Minister\nresponsible for the management and oversight of\nGovernment departments, the days are long gone when a\npublic service mandarin could run a department or major\noperation without detailed political oversight. This is not\na promotion of micro-management, nor am I implying any\ncriticism of the Secretariat staff. But as any politician\nholding executive office in today\u2019s democracies knows, the\nclassic recipe for a failed project is for those who are\npolitically accountable to lose track of implementation or to\nlose the game plan.\nWe saw that all too clearly in the past year in\nSomalia. Ironically, the Security Council had, in resolution\n814 (1993), already foreseen the need in the case of the\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) for a\ndetailed political accountability and provided for a\ncommittee to follow the operation closely. But the\ncommittee was never established.\nNew Zealand has proposed in the Security Council\nthat a committee or an ad hoc working group should be\nestablished to fill this gap and enhance the accountability of\nthe Organization to its politically responsible\nrepresentatives. I certainly remain hopeful that progress\ncan be made in this area.\nThe third point I draw to the attention of members is\nthe need for clear objectives with regular reviews. Clearer\nmission objectives must be developed and kept under\nreview. I am delighted that some progress has in fact been\nmade. The Council is now identifying more closely the\nterms of mandates for United Nations operations, and it\nis becoming usual to build a specific review cycle into its\nmandates. But there are still two areas of weakness.\nFirst, there is a great deal of mythology about and\nvery little sound analysis of the circumstances in which\nforce should be used by United Nations operations. Many\nbelieve this is governed by the use or non-use of the\nwords \\\"Chapter VII\\\". This could well be a false\nconclusion. The rules of engagement rather than abstract\nreference to the Charter are much more likely to\ndetermine actual behaviour in the field.\nI am not alone in believing that there is a need to\ndevelop greater commonality in military doctrine for\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations. This is\nespecially relevant when so many peace-keeping\ncontributors are regularly placed side by side in the field.\nIt is, however, particularly urgent in the face of new-style\noperations of the intra-country type where the use of force\nby factions, not necessarily Governments, is the challenge\nfor this body to overcome.\nIt is clear that common principles are necessary to\nguide peace-keepers on the appropriate use of force when\nthey take part in operations in pursuit of an agreed United\nNations strategic objective. As for the review, while\nthere are plenty of mid-term reviews there is, as yet, no\nsystematic process of review at the end of an operation.\nThe budget of every peace-keeping operation should\ninclude provision, as a principal line item, for the\npreparation of a comprehensive review of the operation\u2019s\nachievements relative to the mandate set.\nSuch reviews should be separate from the financial\nperformance review and should address the substance of\nthe operation and seek to identify all relevant lessons for\nthe conduct of future operations.\nI address now the question of command and control.\nThere is a weakness in the command and control\nstructures and they do need attention. It is true the\npersonnel of national defence forces which contribute\nforces to the United Nations legally remain in their\ncountry\u2019s national service. But as I see it, parallel to the\nallocation of responsibility to the United Nations Force\nCommander must be a recognition that the national\ncommand structure will not seek to direct their forces in\noperational matters. If the national command authority\nhas serious difficulties, then the appropriate course of\naction in all cases - except an emergency - is for the issue\n27\n\n\nto be resolved with United Nations Headquarters. If\nresolution is not possible the unit should be withdrawn.\nI come to the question of the safety of peace-keeping\npersonnel. A major requirement for effective collective\nsecurity is that countries contributing troops and civilian\npersonnel should have confidence that their personnel in the\nfield will have the best possible support to ensure their\nsafety and security. That is an issue which, as many\nmembers know, New Zealand has pursued relentlessly\nduring its time on the Council. It bears on the level of\nequipment with which the forces are outfitted and there is\nplenty of room for improvement.\nIn addition, the legal regime under which peace-\nkeeping operations are conducted needs to reflect the\nextraordinary personal risk which United Nations personnel\nare undertaking on behalf of us all in carrying out collective\nsecurity operations. It is right that such personnel should\nbe differentiated from soldiers in an armed conflict and that\nthere should be a higher standard of legal responsibility for\nanybody who attacks them. I urge all members of the\nAssembly to support New Zealand\u2019s initiative on this issue\ncurrently in the Sixth Committee, that the necessary\nflexibility be shown on outstanding issues and that we make\na really determined effort to complete work on the draft\nconvention this year.\nThe question of resources is always before us. In my\nsixth point I would say that a critical tool for effective\ncollective security is a strategy for resource availability.\nThe situation we all saw recently in Rwanda is a classic\ncase. Human resources were available but they lacked\ntraining and they lacked equipment. But there is also the\nneed for a capacity in all peace-keeping operations for a\nforceful response in self-defence. There are important\nlessons to be learned from the troop losses in Rwanda last\nApril and again I draw attention to the linkage between\nmandates, rules of engagement, doctrine and planning.\nThe United Nations will have to go beyond the current\nwork being done on stand-by forces to address this\nproblem.\nWe believe that there is a case for redirecting a\nsubstantial portion of bilateral military assistance into forms\nof training that would better assist defence forces with the\nrequirements of peace-keeping operations.\nThere is also a role for the United Nations maintaining\nthe physical equivalent of the peace-keeping reserve fund\nthat it is supposed to have on the financial side now. A\nquick start-up capability, with owned or leased equipment\nimmediately available to the United Nations, would have\nmade a significant difference in the Rwanda situation.\nThis is a practical and feasible step that can be taken to\nensure that future collective security can in fact rise to the\nchallenge.\nI have spoken about the factors that need to be taken\ninto account in managing peace-keeping operations. I\nnow wish to address the terms of their engagements.\nThe United Nations should not be expected to take\nresponsibility for a situation of up to 30 years because the\nparties to a conflict are unable or unwilling to summon up\nthe necessary political will to reach a settlement. There\ncomes a point when the parties must take their fate in\ntheir own hands rather than the Council avoiding the hard\ndecisions just by rolling over the mandates.\nAt the same time, a range of different considerations\nshould prevail when the United Nations reaches the end\nof a successful peace-keeping process. The United\nNations cannot simply walk away when a perceived end\npoint - such as an election - has been achieved, because\nthere may still be outstanding issues that need the\nongoing support of the operation, such as humanitarian\noperations or local capability-building programmes to help\nprovide the required sound administration.\nThe United Nations deserves congratulations on its\nachievements in Cambodia, for example, but the future\nthere is still not certain, and the United Nations must\nmaintain its responsibilities. Rehabilitation in that country\nmust continue.\nAnother example of a situation in which\npeacemaking and peace-building have to be seen as a\ncoherent whole is in the area of demining. This is a\ncritically important humanitarian function. New\nZealand\u2019s military forces have had a lot of experience in\nhelping the United Nations with demining in Afghanistan,\nCambodia and, most recently, Mozambique.\nThe Security Council Mission that visited\nMozambique about two months ago reported its dismay\nat the delays and at the state of the programme generally.\nAt the request of the United Nations, New Zealand\nstepped in early in August and began the rescue effort for\nthe programme. The wheel should not have had to be\nreinvented. It is a concern that lessons learned from\nearlier operations such as Afghanistan and Cambodia do\nnot appear to be retained. Having seen firsthand the\n28\n\n\neffects of mines in Cambodia, I do believe we should move\nmore expeditiously than the speed of the present\nperformance.\nNew Zealand certainly looks forward to working with\nother delegations to improve performance in this area, and\nI would certainly add that my Government was most\ninterested in the comments President Clinton made here\nyesterday about the proposal for the elimination of the\nworld\u2019s 85 million anti-personnel land-mines. This is an\nurgent task. No one who has seen firsthand the human cost\nof mines can offer anything less than full cooperation to\nthis end.\nFinally, when we look ahead to what would really\nenhance proper use of the collective security powers, we\nhave to conclude that reform of the Security Council is a\nmajor task waiting to be fulfilled. Many of the things I\nhave discussed today require reforms by the Security\nCouncil, or at least in conjunction with it. But I cannot\nescape the conclusion that even if all of these were\naccomplished, the political legitimacy of the Security\nCouncil could still erode over a period of time. Ultimately\nit could lose the credibility vital to the role it carries out.\nCollective security requires the Council to be\ngenuinely representative of the entire United Nations\nmembership. We have, of course, as many others have\ndone, followed the debate on Security Council reform in the\nOpen-ended Working Group set up last year. We hear the\ncase made for additional permanent members. We also\nhear overwhelming support for expanding the number of\nnon-permanent members of the Council. There are shades\nof difference on the numbers for the total membership, but\nconsensus does seem to be emerging around five or six new\nmembers. We consider that a limited expansion of the\nnumber of members, paying regard to an equitable\ngeographical participation, is still a priority for the health\nof the Organization. It is time to do what is achievable and\nwhat benefits most Members. Given the need for 122\nratifications, we are aware that even a simple expansion,\nhopefully adopted next year, will take several years to come\ninto force. It would not be unrealistic, therefore, for the\nyear 2000 to see the first meeting of the expanded Council.\nThere is no worth in being critical of some aspects of\nthe United Nations without believing, as I do, that the\nproblems can be cured. We, all 184 of us, are its doctors,\nand we need to act quickly. We need to apportion our\ncosts fairly and systematically. We need to share peace-\nkeeping tasks, peace-keeping funding and peace-keeping\nsupplies. We need to accept the democratic decisions of\nthis Organization. We also need to adjust to the more\ncomplex and interrelated United Nations agendas of the\nfuture.\nI therefore leave with the Assembly New Zealand\u2019s\nassurance of a renewed commitment to this unique and\nessential body and of our willingness to work in that\nspirit to ensure the continued relevance of the United\nNations for the next half-century.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, we welcome with great\nsatisfaction your election to preside over the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly in the certainty that your qualities as an outstanding and experienced diplomat, in addition to your well-known personal dedication, will guarantee that our work is fruitful and effective. Through you, your country and all of Africa will have the well- deserved opportunity to contribute to the deliberations that lie before us.\nWe should like to express our gratitude to your predecessor. Ambassador Insanally, for the able manner and constructive spirit in which he guided the forty-eighth session.\nWe should also like to express to the Secretary- General our appreciation for the far-sightedness with which he is performing the task of guiding the United Nations in the new era into which it has entered.\nIn recent years there has been broad agreement that the great events that have shaken the world, giving rise to great hopes of human progress, have led to different and in many respects contradictory changes and prospects, and that there has been a delay in forging a genuine consensus among nations.\nDemocracy as a way of life has been established in a large number of countries in every geographical area and is developing with obvious dynamism. We hope for a kind of rebirth, inspired by an ever-greater participation in the whole social fabric of national life. In this framework, the civic aspect is coming to the fore and taking on increasing vigor.\nLong deemed indispensable to economic progress, private enterprise has seen its role considerably increased in many developing countries.\nUnquestionably, there is an increased general awareness of the environment throughout the world, and the idea that the value of the planet's resources must endure as a condition of our very survival is gradually becoming a guide and a criterion for human activities. International action to combat violations of human rights in all forms and to encourage the exercise of those rights has become a constant, despite the distance separating us from the attainment of our desired objectives. The rejection of the social inequality of women is gaining ground, and we shall from now on be discussing the way this is reflected in practice.\nThose are the salient factors, in addition to others of equal importance, that are among the positive trends which are at our disposal and which must be developed at all costs so that we can derive the full benefit of their great potential.\nHowever, in the two major areas that constitute yardsticks for assessing mankind's well-being - those of peace and development - the present situation is far from satisfactory. Conflicts continue to proliferate, and positive settlements have been achieved to very few of them. Situations of poverty have assumed vast proportions and even critical levels in several regions, particularly in Africa. The persistence of these evils in the post-cold-war era reminds us that the community of nations still lacks a direction that might lead it towards the fulfillment of its own concept of genuine community. There has been a lack of vision to recognize the true scope of collective interests and the political will and ability to implement them. There has also been a lack of cooperation and tolerance as independent values untouched by the systematic quest for the upper hand.\nPeace and development are closely linked. Moreover, we are convinced that the most complex challenge concerns development and that the most decisive influences on the relationship arise from that challenge. Indeed, collective security hinges on shared progress - shared within a framework that provides justice and equality. It is a fact that during periods of expanded economic growth the most visible effects of imbalance have, for better or for worse, been attenuated. However, the development to which we aspire cannot be limited by narrow so-called realism. Equality as an inherent element of progress cannot be described as an ideal today. It is, rather, a prerequisite.\nThe United Nations shouldered a very specific responsibility and role when, in its Charter, it solemnly committed itself to working towards a better world. The United Nations is a unique body and its indispensability in serving the interests of all is becoming ever clearer today. It is indeed in this universal forum that there is a need jointly to establish guidelines for the entire world, that the random developments we experience converge, and that mechanisms and measures commensurate with today's issues are promoted.\nIn order to increase its ability to carry out its mission in the present context, the United Nations has decided to reform its structure to make it more effective and stronger and to ensure greater participation: Under the dynamic and tireless coordination of the Secretary-General, the process is under way and we hope that at the present session of the Assembly new and fruitful progress will be achieved allowing the Organization further to promote economic and social development, prevent conflicts and eliminate their causes. In this regard, the Assembly will continue to make use of the guidelines set down in its \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" and will have the opportunity to evaluate the report containing the draft of an Agenda for Development.\nThe strengthening of the legitimacy and authority of the United Nations will remain linked to an improvement of its democratic representativeness and to better regional balance, as well as to safeguarding the identity of all, including that of smaller States. In this context, Africa has recently formulated its current position on the reform of the Organization. This reform must provide genuine political and operational consistency to all the bodies and structures of the system, within whose framework the African continent must have an appropriately expanded representation.\nIn the meantime, the question of the expansion of the Security Council has been answered by some States with expressions of their readiness to assume increased responsibilities within it. As to the diversification of regional representation, we note with satisfaction and welcome with great fellow-feeling the announced candidacy of a Portuguese-speaking country, Brazil.\nSince the opening last year of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, several important political events have taken place in the world. We were particularly struck by the magnificent example of maturity and vision offered by the people of South Africa and its leaders, particularly President Mandela. We wish to share with them the pride of all Africa and the admiration of the international community.\nUnfortunately, the lessons to be derived from this example have not yet been put into practice in some cases in our region. Recent events in Rwanda, which have brought such great pain to its people and especially its children, are a tragedy which our conscience demands never be repeated on our continent. Moreover, hostilities continue that could and should have been over by now, while opportunities for peace and reconciliation have been missed again and again, in particular in Liberia. The agreements already concluded among the Liberians must now be implemented and an end must be put once and for all to armed clashes and their repercussions on neighboring countries and the West African region.\nThe conflict that has so long afflicted Angola has passed through a stage of incredibly destructive, deadly violence following the failure peacefully to implement the results of the elections of September 1991, even though those elections were supervised and declared free and fair by the United Nations. We very much hope that the present stage of negotiations between the Government of Angola and UNITA will finally herald a cessation of hostilities in the near future and the opening of an era of peace, reconstruction and progress so long awaited by a people with which Cape Verdeans feel such brotherly solidarity.\nThe coming elections in Mozambique will doubtless close an era in which national interests have prevailed.\u2003\n\nbut also in which the United Nations and the international community have rendered praiseworthy assistance. We wish Mozambique all success in these elections, during which Cape Verde will be present as part of an observer team from the United Nations Operation in Mozambique. It is essential that the parties continue rigorously to observe the rules of the democratic game by unequivocally accepting the outcome of the elections once these have been declared free and fair by the international community.\nWe are gratified by the way in which the recent first legislative and presidential elections in Guinea-Bissau took place and by the peaceful respect shown for its results. This attests to the sense of responsibility of the political leaders of the country.\nIn Sao Tome and Principe, the established democratic system was reaffirmed by the calm that prevailed during the electoral process that was completed at the end of last week.\nWe also wish to declare our support and encouragement for the continuation of the talks which are taking place under the auspices of the Secretary-General between Portugal, Indonesia and representatives of East Timor. We hope that they are taking place on the basis of forms of participation that respect the fundamental rights of the citizens of East Timor.\nAs regards the maintenance of peace, it must be recognized that in recent times notable progress has been made on the international level, in the United Nations in particular. The improvement of this capability must continue, and this will require even greater cooperation and complementarity with the regional organizations. Africa is showing what it can do in this area, but obstacles to maximizing this potential remain in the form of gaps that must be filled through more consistent, predictable and timely support by the United Nations and the partner countries.\nThe prevention of conflicts remains, in any case, the primary objective to be sought. The action to be taken to this effect finds its reference points in the recommendations in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277). However, the ultimate success of prevention will continue to depend on the longer-term task of eliminating the deeper causes of the conflicts, which, of course, are many. In addition, it will be crucial to tackle them simultaneously, not only to produce synergy but also so that the relevant lessons can be learned concerning these causes and the relations between them.\n \n\nOne of the major causes of the instability that generates conflict is poverty, to which we referred earlier. That in itself would be sufficient to lend urgency to the eradication of poverty. However, the scope and nature of the phenomenon require of us a reaction based on the moral aspects of the heritage of mankind.\nToday, it is understood that all peoples must live in dignity; that is their basic human right, and we must guarantee them the realization of that right. This need must transcend the present stage of mere words, and a program must be implemented to transform the situation. A particularly valuable contribution to this is in the works: the World Summit for Social Development, for which preparations are now under way. Within this framework, there will be a need to analyze the development of the human being in society, and not just some reduced concept of the social element as an objective. We still have enough time, and it is our duty to muster the necessary will to achieve the goals set for this important Summit.\nThe fact that for countless individuals it is impossible to benefit from contemporary parameters of well-being has resulted in the major migrations of our era, which reveal the critical imbalances which continue in certain regions of the world. The solution can, clearly, come only from development and from the rejection of scenarios in which some parts of the world or groups of people are excluded or marginalized. In the meantime, we emphasize the need to see implemented the recommendations of the International Conference on Population and Development concerning refugees, displaced persons and migrants, a timely instrument which has been made available to us.\nWithin the framework of global development one of the major questions that arises is that of Africa. This question must continue to be given very high priority on the international agenda and on the agenda of the United Nations. The seriousness of the situation prevailing on our continent, the longstanding nature of the problem and the observation of indicators for future prospects deserve to be met as a particularly complex challenge and should never be considered as a pretext for showing lassitude or indifference. The lack of progress in Africa would be a set-back for all, not just for the Africans. We are convinced that this fact will become increasingly clear to us.\n\nIn the 1990s in particular, Africa undertook, in rather difficult conditions, reforms and economic adjustments as well as political and managerial transformations. The African achievement certainly has not yet reached its optimal goal, but it must be said that on many occasions it was not adequately supported by external measures and resources, which are, after all, indispensable complements.\nThe African economic and political systems doubtless still have a long way to go, and they must become more effective and be based on the participation of all. African regional cooperation must increase its pace and must obtain increased benefits. However, the continent must be the beneficiary of, inter alia, a major reduction in its debt burden, the elimination of obstacles to its exports, vigorous foreign investments and increasing international assistance better adapted to national policies.\nReferring again to the constraints that are affecting Africa in particular, we reiterate the need to mobilize adequate and sufficient resources to allow for the implementation of the International Convention to Combat Desertification, in particular concerning the Sudan and Sahel region and in cooperation with the Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel. For Cape Verde, which is coordinating the activities of this Committee, it is particularly important that this event be crowned with success.\nNext year, as we approach the end of the twentieth century, we shall be marking the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization. There are numerous reasons to celebrate this event, especially if we were to try to imagine what the world would be like without the United Nations. My country cannot forget the role which the Organization played in its political emancipation and in its development efforts following that emancipation, nor do we forget that it offers a forum in which small countries can have their say and participate in the deliberations. We welcome in this context the holding of the United Nations Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, and we hope that the results of the Conference will be fully implemented.\nThe time has come to consolidate the feeling of a shared destiny among the diverse nations that are today gathered together within the Organization. We must no longer put off the task of setting out on those re-charted paths which our aspirations require.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me, Sir, on\nbehalf of the Uganda delegation, to congratulate you most\nwarmly on your well-deserved unanimous election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. Your election is a recognition by our\n\n\nOrganization of your exemplary personal qualities. It is,\nindeed, a great honour to your country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, with\nwhich Uganda enjoys warm fraternal relations. I am\nconfident that, with your skills and experience, you will be\nable to guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion.\nI wish to pledge Uganda\u2019s full support and cooperation to\nyou in your endeavours.\nI also wish to pay special tribute to your predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for the\nable manner in which he steered the work of the forty-\neighth session of the General Assembly.\nOur appreciation goes to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his courageous and clear-\nsighted leadership of the Organization.\nAt the outset, let me say how warmly Uganda\nwelcomes the presence in our midst of a new South Africa,\nborn on the principles of equality, justice and democratic\ngovernance. I wish to pay a special tribute to His\nExcellency President Nelson Mandela and other leaders of\nthe South African liberation movements, and to\nMr. de Klerk, for their vision and statesmanship, which\nenabled the United Nations to achieve one of the key long-\nsought objectives of Africa.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, several\ndevelopments have taken place in the international arena;\nsome of these have offered hope and encouragement, while\nothers have led to frustration and despair. In many\ncountries, peace, the rule of law and democratic governance\nare being consolidated. However, in some others, such as\nAngola, Somalia, Liberia and Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nconflicts have caused untold suffering, loss of life and\ndestruction of property, and have contributed to the\nstaggering numbers of refugees and displaced persons, with\nthe attendant negative consequences.\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees estimates the number of refugees and\ndisplaced persons worldwide to be over 23 million and\n26 million respectively. Africa is estimated to have over\n32 per cent and Asia over 25 per cent of the total refugees.\nSeven countries in Africa are among the top 10 countries of\norigin of refugees. Most of these refugees and displaced\npersons have fled as a consequence of conflicts, mainly\nwithin nations, but to a lesser extent between nations. This\nis a vivid, awesome picture for Africa in particular, and for\ndeveloping countries in general.\nUganda welcomes the increasing priority attention\nbeing given by the United Nations to the resolution of\nconflicts in Africa and elsewhere, especially the emphasis\ngiven by the Secretary-General in \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d\nto preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. We agree\nwith his view that security, socio-economic well-being,\nenvironmental sustainability and the protection of human\nrights are closely interdependent and interlocked in a\nmutually reinforcing manner. They should therefore be\naddressed in tandem in order to avert conflicts and their\nattendant negative effects, such as the outflow of political\nand economic refugees, capital flight and brain drain.\nWe welcome the establishment of the OAU\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution. Such a mechanism is useful for confidence-\nbuilding among rival parties and can facilitate peaceful\nresolution of conflicts. Uganda is committed to making\nthe OAU Mechanism effective and usable. We urge the\nUnited Nations and the international community to lend\nit the requisite support.\nThe situation in Somalia remains tense and fragile\nwith serious negative implications for peace, national\nreconciliation and orderly provision of humanitarian\nassistance. Uganda supports the new emphasis by the\ninternational community on seeking a political settlement\nto the Somalia conflict. Uganda urges all Somali groups\nand factions to put behind them fear and mistrust, and to\nbegin to implement all commitments they undertook in\nthe Nairobi Declaration on National Reconciliation in\norder to pave the way for the implementation of the\nAddis Ababa Agreements, including the establishment of\ntransitional administrative mechanisms. We commend the\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) for\nfacilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and we\nurge continued international support to Somalia.\nAs regards Liberia, Uganda was encouraged by steps\ntaken to begin the implementation of the Cotonou\nAgreement, namely the establishment of the Liberia\nNational Transitional Government and the initiation of the\nprocess of disarmament and demobilization of various\ncombatants. However, we are disappointed by the\nincreasingly tense military situation on the ground, both\nwithin and between parties, which has brought the process\nof disarmament and demobilization to a virtual standstill.\nWe urge all parties to show seriousness to the process of\npeace and national reconciliation as this is vital for\ncontinued international support and a continued presence.\n2\n\n\nUganda welcomes steps taken so far by the\nGovernment of Mozambique and RENAMO to implement\nthe general peace agreement. We urge the parties to remain\ncommitted to the peace agreement and to respect the\noutcome of the elections scheduled for 27 and\n28 October 1994. We commend the United Nations\nOperation in Mozambique (UNOMOZ), which has helped\nto engender confidence among the parties \u2014 vital for the\nsuccessful implementation of the peace agreement \u2014 and\nwe urge continued international assistance to Mozambique,\nespecially in the resettlement of refugees and displaced\npersons.\nThe situation in Angola remains a matter of concern\nto the international community despite ongoing Lusaka\nnegotiations between the Government of Angola and\nUNITA. The people of Angola continue to suffer from\nindiscriminate killings and destruction of property. My\ndelegation urges the parties concerned, especially UNITA,\nto demonstrate flexibility, realism, political will, tolerance\nand compromise, which are necessary for peace and\nnational reconciliation.\nThe civil war in southern Sudan has continued to\nescalate, with an enormous loss of lives, destruction of\nproperty and a large number of refugees and displaced\npersons. Uganda alone hosts an estimated 300,000\nSudanese refugees. We urge the parties to the conflict to\nset their sights on the common good and mutual\naccommodation in the ongoing regional efforts \u2014 in\nparticular, the Inter-Governmental Authority for Drought\nand Development (IGADD) initiative \u2014 which are aimed\nat finding a durable political settlement.\nAs regards Western Sahara, Uganda is concerned at\nthe slow progress towards the holding of a United Nations\nsupervised referendum on self-determination of the people\nof that territory. We appeal to the parties to overcome their\ndifferences and enable a just and impartial referendum to be\neffected.\nThe systematic and widespread massacres of civilians\nwhich took place in Rwanda were tragic and deplorable.\nUganda supports the setting up by the Secretary-General, on\n29 July 1994, of an impartial commission of experts to\ninvestigate violations of international humanitarian law and\nacts of genocide committed in Rwanda with a view to\nidentifying persons responsible for those violations and\nbringing them to justice. This should contribute to the\nprocess of national reconciliation. We are encouraged by\nthe declaration of the Government in Rwanda that it will be\nguided by the spirit of the Arusha Peace Agreement as a\nframework for peace and national reconciliation and for\nits support for the regional initiatives on the problem of\nRwandese refugees. Similarly, we also appeal for\nassistance to be extended to local populations in\nneighbouring countries that are hosting the refugees, in\norder to mitigate the adverse socio-economic and\nenvironmental effects they are facing as a result of the\ninflux of refugees.\nUganda congratulates the Governments of South\nAfrica and Namibia for settling, through peaceful means,\ntheir long-standing dispute over Walvis Bay and the\noffshore islands.\nUganda notes the flexibility shown by the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya with regard to implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 731 (1992). We hope that this\nwill contribute to a peaceful resolution of the problem.\nUganda welcomes the initiation of Palestine self-rule\nin the Gaza Strip and Jericho. We commend Chairman\nArafat and Prime Minister Rabin for their political\nsteadfastness, which made this possible. We encourage\nthem to continue working together to resolve all\noutstanding issues for the full implementation of Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We\nappeal to the international community to provide\nincreased assistance to Palestine which is needed for\nreconstruction and development.\nWe express our satisfaction over the signing by\nJordan and Israel of the Washington Declaration by which\nthe two countries mutually agreed to end the state of war\nbetween them. This should go a long way in helping to\nbuild confidence, facilitating the normalization of\nrelations, concluding a formal peace treaty between the\ntwo countries and between Israel and other countries in\nthe region.\nUganda supports efforts with a view to the peaceful\nresolution of the problem in the Korean peninsula and\nurges all parties to work together to create an atmosphere\nthat will help ease the tension and that is conducive to\nnegotiating a durable political settlement of the Korean\nproblem.\nUganda welcomes the developments in Haiti directed\ntowards the return of President Aristide and the\nrestoration of a democratically elected Government in that\ncountry.\n3\n\n\nUganda is deeply concerned over the continuing\ngenocide and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe urge the United Nations and the international\ncommunity to act decisively and to take appropriate steps\nto end hostilities in accordance with relevant resolutions of\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as\nthe peace plan of the Contact Group and to create an\nenvironment conducive to a smooth and timely flow of\nhumanitarian assistance to the people affected.\nUganda is encouraged by some positive developments\nthat have taken place in the area of disarmament. We note\nthe ongoing formal negotiations on a comprehensive\nnuclear-test-ban treaty (CTBT), under the auspices of the\nConference on Disarmament, and urge successful\ncompletion of the CTBT prior to the convening of the\nReview Conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to be held early in 1995. As a\nState Party to the NPT, and in the context of the\npreparatory process and review of the Treaty, Uganda will\nseek the removal of all imbalances in the NPT and the\nsecuring of adequate technical assistance for developing\ncountries in the peaceful application of nuclear technology.\nWe also note the progress that is being made to strengthen\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)\nand Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction through\nmeasures such as mandatory data exchanges and periodic\non-site visits. These measures are useful in engendering\nconfidence in compliance and in helping minimize\nviolations of the Convention. We are also encouraged by\nthe possibility of the entry into force in mid-1995 of the\n1993 chemical weapons Convention.\nThe treaty on an African nuclear-free zone will be yet\nanother important landmark for peace in Africa. Uganda\nurges its timely and successful conclusion.\nIt is imperative to consolidate achievements so far\nrecorded in the area of nuclear testing and non-proliferation\nin order to lay firm ground on which to make progress in\nother new and more challenging areas of disarmament.\nUganda is committed to the full respect and universal\nenjoyment of human rights. We reaffirm our support for\nthe Declaration and Programme of Action on human rights,\nand welcome the appointment of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. For its part, Uganda has\nestablished a human rights national focal point within the\nJustice Department aimed at enhancing public awareness\nand developing national capacity in the observance and\npromotion of human rights in the country. My delegation\nwishes to pay special tribute to all countries that have\nextended support to Uganda in this vital area of our\ndevelopment, and we appeal for continued support.\nUganda is committed to democracy, good\ngovernance and the rule of law. A democratization\nprocess in the country is well under way. The\nConstituent Assembly was successfully elected on\n28 March 1994. The Assembly is currently debating a\ndraft constitution, which is expected to be finalized and\npromulgated by the end of 1994. That will be followed\nby nationwide presidential and legislative elections in\nearly 1995.\nUganda is concerned about the current trends in the\nglobal economy which continue to weigh unfavourably on\nmany developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. Excruciating external indebtedness remains a\nmajor impediment to our development. Many of our\ncountries are spending large proportions of meagre export\nearnings on debt-servicing alone. For instance, as of\n30 June 1994 Uganda had a total external public sector\ndebt of $2.99 billion \u2014 over 80 per cent of estimated\ngross domestic product for the 1993-1994 financial year.\nContractual debt-servicing was $185 million \u2014 almost\n76 per cent of export earnings; while arrears to be cleared\nwere $222 million \u2014 or 91 per cent of export earnings.\nThe situation is compounded by the fact that 77 per cent\nof the total stock of debt, which is the portion owed to\nmultilateral and bilateral institutions, is currently ineligible\nfor restructuring or reduction.\nThe problem of external indebtedness is further\naggravated by unfavourable terms of trade, especially the\ncollapse of our export commodity prices, severely\ncontracted resource inflows and limited access to\ntechnology. In addition to these unfavourable conditions,\nmost of our countries are implementing stringent\neconomic reforms, with their attendant adverse\nsocio-economic implications for our people. This\nnotwithstanding, some countries, including Uganda, are\nregistering positive economic growth and controlling\ninflation.\nFor economic reforms to succeed in our countries,\nall creditors, including multilateral institutions, should\nadopt enhanced measures that go beyond\ndebt-rescheduling in order to bring about a substantial\nreduction in our total stock of debt. Such measures\nshould include substantial debt cancellation or conversion\ninto grants and/or other innovative schemes such as the\nuse of reserves, a new issue of special drawing rights and\n4\n\n\ndebt swaps. In this regard Uganda endorses the conclusion\nof the recent Jakarta Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial\nMeeting on \u201cDebt and Development: Sharing of\nExperiences\u201d and also endorses the recent proposal by the\nBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer on measures to resolve\nthe debt problem of the poorest countries.\nEqually, there is a need significantly to increase\nresource in-flows to our countries \u2014 for example, through\nincreased levels of official development assistance; foreign\ndirect investment in areas such as manufacturing,\nagricultural processing and tourism; and the provision of\nremunerative commodity prices. Uganda, in the context of\nthe preparatory process and next year\u2019s mid-term global\nreview of the Programme of Action for the Least\nDeveloped Countries, will also seek the adoption of similar\nmeasures in favour of the least developed countries.\nAs regards the Uruguay Round, Uganda urges that in\nthe implementation of the provisions of the Final Act\nspecial offsetting measures be adopted to obviate adverse\neffects that are likely to arise from the erosion of special\npreferences currently enjoyed by some developing countries\nunder arrangements such as the Programme of Action for\nthe Least Developed Countries and Lom\u00e9 IV. Further, the\nway should be eased for more developing countries to gain\nincreased access to international markets for their products,\nin order to augment their export earnings. We also urge\nthat the necessary assistance be provided to enhance our\ncapacity to produce value-added goods and services for\ninternational markets.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d,\nwhich has been submitted to this session of the General\nAssembly, provides a useful framework for political\ndialogue between the North and the South on practical\nmeasures to make operational the international policies,\nprogrammes and actions on development which have so far\nbeen adopted by the international community. My\ndelegation supports this initiative. As we elaborate on the\nAgenda, we should be guided by the overall objective of\neffecting a substantial, rapid improvement in the quality of\nlife in developing countries, through the eradication of\npoverty and the provision of basic needs, namely, nutrition,\nshelter, health and education. Equally, we endorse the\nproposal made by Brazil for the convening of a United\nNations conference on development some time in 1996.\nUganda welcomed the fact that the General Assembly,\nin its resolution 48/214 on the United Nations New Agenda\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s, agreed to\naddress the full range of issues related to the diversification\nof African economies, with particular attention to be\ngiven to the issue of the establishment of a diversification\nfund for African commodities. Uganda attaches great\nimportance to the establishment of such a fund. We\nappeal to our developed partners to be understanding and\nflexible in the negotiations in order to enable the facility\nto be put in place as soon as possible.\nThe international economic system dictates that we\nenlarge our economic horizons beyond national\nboundaries in order to widen our markets. Uganda\nwelcomes the coming into force, of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Abuja Treaty establishing the\nAfrican Economic Community, which provides a useful\nframework for coordination of African development\nefforts at the continental level. In order to succeed,\nefforts to be pursued at subregional levels should be well\ncoordinated and rationalized. Uganda is committed to full\nimplementation of the Treaty for the Common Market for\nEastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Arusha\nTreaty on revived East African cooperation. We appeal\nto the international community to provide requisite\nassistance to support our regional integration efforts in\norder to strengthen or create infrastructures that facilitate\nthe movement of goods and services.\nUganda reaffirms its support for Agenda 21 and\nother agreements on sustainable development adopted in\nRio de Janeiro. However, it is necessary that the Rio\npolitical momentum be translated into practical measures\nto implement all commitments agreed upon, especially\nwith regard to the provision of financial resources and the\ntransfer of technology to developing countries. For its\npart, Uganda is committed to addressing all causes and\neffects of environmental degradation, particularly poverty.\nFor instance, we are sparing no efforts in seeking ways\nand means to exploit our enormous potential in\nhydroelectric power and solar energy, which are\nenvironmentally sound and are economic alternatives to\nwood fuels. This will help stem the current widespread\nforest depletion. We appeal to the international\ncommunity to support our efforts in the area of\nsustainable development.\nThe most important outcome of the Cairo\nConference on population was the endorsement of the\nview that the problem of population is not just a question\nof numbers; rather, the critical issue is that of human\ndevelopment and welfare. In this regard, the challenge is\nto improve people's standard of living in such areas as the\nprovision of education and health, housing, transportation,\nclean water and sanitation, and to eradicate poverty. In\n5\n\n\ndeveloping countries especially, population problems that\narise from irresponsible parenthood are ultimately a result\nof socio-economic despair and ignorance, and these demand\nour foremost attention.\nAs a follow-up to the 1990 Programme of Action on\nchildren, Uganda has established the National Council for\nChildren to oversee national activities aimed at their\nprotection, promotion and development.\nWe support the convening of the Copenhagen World\nSummit for Social Development in March 1995 to address\nissues of poverty- eradication, productive employment and\nsocial integration, which we hope will lead to the\nimprovement of standards of living, especially in the most\nimpoverished countries. We also support the convening of\nthe Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995\nto devise measures for the enhancement of gender equality\nand the empowerment of women. Uganda will continue to\nparticipate actively in the preparatory processes of both\nmeetings.\nThe reform of the Security Council, in our view,\nshould aim at achieving greater transparency in its methods\nof work, making it more democratic in decision-making and\nreflective of the increased United Nations membership in its\ncomposition. We therefore support the proposal to expand\nits membership. However, in our view, its expansion\nshould increase the number of seats for developing\ncountries on an equitable regional basis, to reflect the\nincreased membership of developing countries in the United\nNations and the fact that the agenda of the Security Council\nis increasingly dominated by issues of concern and interest\nto developing countries, such as conflict-resolution and\nhumanitarian emergencies. As regards the Council's\ndecision-making procedures, our view is that a\nproportionate number of developing countries, including\nAfrican countries, should be accorded rights and\nresponsibilities similar to those currently exercised by\npermanent members of the Security Council.\nOur legacy to future generations is to put in place a\nfirm institutional framework that can adequately and\nequitably respond to the interests and concerns of all\nmankind, rich and poor alike. This is the challenge that\nfaces our Organization as we enter the fiftieth anniversary\nyear of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to join my fellow Heads\nof State who have spoken before me in congratulating you\nmost sincerely on your well-deserved election as President\nof the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. As a\ndistinguished son of Africa, you bring to this high office\nvaluable experience, diplomatic skill and wisdom, all of\nwhich equip you superbly well to lead this Assembly - an\nassembly in which the faith and hopes of our people are\nreposed. Let me assure you, Mr. President, of Tanzania\u2019s\nwhole-hearted cooperation and support as you execute your\nnoble and immense responsibilities to humanity.\nI should also express the great appreciation which\nmy delegation feels for the dedication to duty and great\nleadership displayed by your predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Samuel Insanally of the Republic of Guyana, who\nvery ably led the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly to its successful conclusion.\nI wish also to acknowledge the untiring efforts of\nanother son of Africa, our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, who, together with his Secretariat, has\ncontinued to serve our Organization very well indeed.\nThe Secretariat needs, and deserves, the support of all\nMember States in facing the challenges of their\nday-to-day work, often under very trying circumstances.\nThis is my second appearance before a session of the\nGeneral Assembly since being elected President of the\nUnited Republic of Tanzania in 1985. I had the honour\nto address the forty-second session of the Assembly on 8\nOctober 1987. I used that occasion, as the new President\nof my country, to reaffirm our faith in the United Nations\nand our commitment to the principles of the United\nNations Charter.\nToday, I am addressing this Assembly for the last\ntime as President of my country. As members may well\nknow, Tanzania has embarked on extensive political and\neconomic reforms, which are proceeding very well, in\npeace and in harmony.\nAs part of the political reforms, the constitutional\nterm of a president is limited to a maximum of two five-\n\n\nyear terms. My second and last term, therefore, will come\nto an end towards the end of next year, a time when we\nwill hold our first general elections under a multiparty\ndemocratic system. It is my great wish that I should\nbequeath to the Tanzanian people a functioning democratic\nsystem that will allow them to choose their own leaders in\na free and fair atmosphere.\nAs I prepare to pass on the baton of the leadership of\nmy country to someone else, I can only reaffirm the faith\nand confidence my country has always had in the United\nNations system. All its imperfections notwithstanding, the\nUnited Nations remains the only hope for poor and weak\ncountries like mine, for it is only through the United\nNations that we can raise our concerns for human\ndevelopment, world peace, justice and equality without fear.\nThe imperfections of the United Nations system have\nnothing to do with the principles set forth in the United\nNations Charter; rather, they are a product of the action or\ninaction of the Member States.\nIn this connection we are pleased to extend to all the\nnew Members a warm welcome and sincere congratulations.\nTheir admission has brought us much closer to our\ncherished goal of universal membership of the United\nNations. We pledge to continue working closely with all\nnations to make our world a much better place for all\nhumanity.\nDuring my time as President of Tanzania, fundamental\nchanges have occurred in the world. Some of these\nchanges have given us reasons for hope; others have not.\nOur hopes that the post-cold-war era would bring a new\nimpetus in our Organization for peace and development in\nall corners of the world have not yet been realized. The so-\ncalled peace dividend is not reaching those who need it\nmost, that is, the poorest sectors of humanity. It is a pity\nthat global tensions have been replaced by regional and\nnational conflicts, with devastating consequences for\ninnocent men, women and children. Whether on\ndevelopment questions or security issues, the developing\ncountries, which constitute the vast majority, have seen\nlittle respite following the end of the cold war.\nThe collective security system envisaged under the\nUnited Nations Charter has not always worked to the\nsatisfaction of many Members. This is because some\nMember States have, in the past, been reluctant to\nimplement both the letter and the spirit of the Charter.\nInstead, loopholes and pretexts have often been used to\njustify action contrary to the spirit of the Charter. Today,\nas we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, we all need to rededicate ourselves to the goals\nand ideals embodied in its Charter. This includes the\nneed to make the United Nations and all its organs more\nrepresentative of all its Members and more democratic.\nIt is both hypocritical and a mockery of the ideal of\ndemocracy that some Members should preach democracy\nto the rest of the world and yet not accept the full\ndemocratization of the United Nations system.\nThis matter is particularly urgent in this post-\ncold-war world era. The emerging new power relations\nin the world can be either an asset or a liability,\ndepending on whether all Members have the political will\nto enhance the representative nature and the democratic\ntraditions of this world body. If such political will exists,\nI am sure we can make rapid progress on the expressed\ndesire of many Member States to look again at the role,\npowers and membership of the Security Council. I am\nequally sure that if we all have the political will to reform\nthe United Nations system for the better, we can quickly\nagree on enhancing the powers of the General Assembly\nand the Economic and Social Council. It is these two\norgans that are important agents in focusing our\nOrganization on the real and urgent issues confronting the\noverwhelming majority of humanity.\nIn his comprehensive report to the General Assembly\nat its forty-eighth session, the Secretary-General drew our\nattention to the peace-keeping role of the United Nations\nin the changing international context. While United\nNations peace-keeping and peacemaking responsibilities\nhave been on the increase, the means to implement those\nresponsibilities have hardly kept pace with these new\nrequirements. With more than 80,000 civilian and\nmilitary personnel serving in 17 peace-keeping operations\nworldwide, the Organization requires new commitment\ntowards meeting the costs involved.\nWe should all strive to honour our financial\nobligations as assessed to meet United Nations\npeace-keeping expenses. We must not reach the point\nwhere training and deployment of personnel will be\nundertaken only by those Member States who can afford\nsuch expenses on their own. Such an eventuality will not\nonly make peace-keeping the monopoly of a few rich\ncountries but will also deal a fatal blow to our cherished\nprinciple of universality of participation. In this\nconnection, we entirely support the proposal made by\nCanada last week in this Assembly for the establishment\nof a permanent United Nations peace-keeping force. This\nidea has been with us for a long time, and now is the\ntime to act.\n2\n\n\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to salute all\nUnited Nations personnel in the field for their devotion to\nduty and their perseverance under increasingly dangerous\nsituations. Many, including Tanzanians, have died in\naction. We mourn them. Many more have been wounded.\nThey deserve our heartfelt sympathy. The safety and\nsecurity of United Nations personnel must continue to be a\npriority, and we support every initiative taken to establish\nan international treaty for their protection.\nAs a neighbour of both Rwanda and Burundi,\nTanzania has found itself deeply involved in the search for\npeace and reconciliation in those two most troubled\ncountries. Last year in Cairo, we, the African Heads of\nState, decided that the time had come for Africans to take\ncharge of preventing, managing and resolving conflicts in\ntheir continent, for our countries may be poor, but our\npoverty does not extend to the realm of humanity, dignity\nand wisdom.\nIn both Rwanda and Burundi, there was a time when\nour hopes rose high, when we thought that at last a\npermanent solution had been found to their endemic\nproblems. In the case of Burundi, the high point was the\nelection of July 1993, which was declared by international\nobservers to have been free and fair. The transition of\npower from President Buyoya to the late President Ndadaye\nwas equally impressive. That man, whom the people of\nBurundi had chosen to lead them, personified not only hope\nfor peace, unity and reconciliation in Burundi, but also the\ndawn of a new era of peace, stability and cooperation in\nour subregion.\nBut some people in the military establishment decided\nto put their private and parochial interests above the wishes\nof the ordinary people of Burundi. What the Burundi\npeople got through the ballot was taken away by the bullet.\nThe attempted coup that followed in October 1993 resulted\nnot only in the death of President Ndadaye but also in the\ndeath of many innocent people of Burundi. No one knows\nexactly how many died; estimates range from 100,000 to\n200,000. But statistics alone are unimportant, as not a\nsingle life should have been lost in the first place; above\nall, behind these cold statistics are real people - husbands\nand wives, sons and daughters, all of whom perished\nleaving behind widows and widowers, as well as orphans.\nIn addition to those who died, over 700,000 others fled\ntheir country in order to save their lives; about 500,000 of\nthem fled to Tanzania alone. Another 200,000 or more\nwere displaced internally. With those events of October\n1993, our hopes for peace and reconciliation in Burundi\nwere dashed to the ground; since then we have been\nwaiting anxiously for new developments that could\nrekindle our hopes.\nWe are encouraged by the efforts of moderate\nelements in Burundi to create a transitional government of\nunity, based on the concept of power sharing. It is\nincumbent upon those of us neighbouring Burundi and\nupon the international community as a whole to support\nand encourage the Government of President Sylvestre\nNtibantunganya during this transitional period.\nIn the case of Rwanda, the event that gave us hope\nwas the signing of the Arusha Peace Agreement on 4\nAugust 1993. The Agreement provided a comprehensive\nframework for the permanent solution of the political and\nsecurity problems in Rwanda. But the Agreement, which\nhad been so painstakingly negotiated, was held hostage by\nthose who were keen to protect their own interests rather\nthan the interests of the ordinary citizens of Rwanda. For\neight months, the timetable agreed upon for the\nimplementation of the Arusha Agreement was not\nfollowed. The only transitional institution provided for in\nthe Agreement was the presidency. The death of\nPresident Habyarimana, therefore, denied us the only legal\ntransitional authority in Rwanda at that time. Then began\nthe worst carnage in African history - which, even as I\nspeak, is still claiming the lives of innocent people, not to\nmention having been the cause of over 1.5 million\nrefugees in neighbouring countries. Most of those who\nparticipated in the Arusha negotiations on behalf of the\nthen Rwanda Government were massacred.\nFollowing its military victory, the Rwandese\nPatriotic Front (RPF) established in July 1994 a fairly\nbroad-based Government of National Unity. Tanzania\nwas among the first countries to recognize this new\nGovernment. We recognize and appreciate the efforts and\ngood intentions of this new Government to restore peace\nin Rwanda, to rebuild State institutions and to bring about\ngenuine national reconciliation. In particular, we\nencourage and support all efforts of the Rwandese\nGovernment to create conditions within Rwanda that will\ngive Rwandese refugees the confidence to return home as\nsoon as possible. Rwanda needs to revert to a state of\nnormalcy as soon as possible. A country from which its\nown citizens run away to save their lives cannot be\nnormal. Even as I speak, some Rwandese refugees\ncontinue to enter Tanzania. This means that the\nRwandese people, especially the Hutus, still feel\ninsecure - whether for valid reasons or as a result of the\n3\n\n\npropaganda war waged by the ousted regime and its agents.\nIn this connection, the Government of Rwanda needs\nthe encouragement and practical assistance of the\ninternational community to restore essential services and to\nre-establish the rule of justice and law and order. The\ntraditional discipline within the ranks of the RPF needs to\nbe maintained, and individual acts of vengeance must be\ncontained. Innocent Hutu refugees must feel secure and\nconfident that no reprisals will be meted out to them for\nprevious atrocities associated with their tribe. On the other\nhand, all those guilty of the genocide in Rwanda must face\njustice. In this respect, we urge the United Nations, in\ncollaboration with the Rwandese Government, quickly to\nmake operational the international tribunal that will\ninvestigate and put to trial all those suspected of\ncommitting these atrocities. This, we hope, will reduce the\nmotivation for individual acts of revenge.\nThe urgency of stemming the tide of refugees, and of\neffecting their subsequent repatriation, is of paramount\nimportance. The refugee camps must not be allowed to\nacquire the character of permanency, as this would create\nan environment conducive to the political and even military\nmobilization of the refugees. In the meanwhile, we who\nare hosts to these refugees have a duty to disarm them and\ntake whatever action is necessary to make it impossible for\nthem to be mobilized, whether for political or military\npurposes.\nNeighbouring countries and the international\ncommunity should also warn the deposed regime and its\narmy not to entertain thoughts of a military return to power.\nWe cannot allow another chapter of this tragedy to be\nwritten in the history of Rwanda. For, as an English\npolitical philosopher, Edmund Burke, said two centuries\nago:\n\\\"The use of force alone is but temporary. It may\nsubdue for a moment; but it does not remove the\nnecessity of subduing again; and a nation is not\ngoverned, which is perpetually to be conquered.\\\"\nIn this connection, I wish to emphasize the need for\nthe Rwandese Government to proceed on the basis of the\nframework of the Arusha Peace Accord, which in my view\nremains the best hope for a permanent solution to the\nproblems facing that country. As Facilitator to the peace\nprocess in Rwanda, I wish to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nDr. Salim Ahmed Salim, and the OAU Secretariat for the\noutstanding commitment they have shown to the resolution\nof this problem, despite the many disappointments along\nthe way. I also wish to use this opportunity to thank the\nUnited Nations, as well as Belgium, Burundi, France,\nGermany, Senegal, Uganda, the United States of America\nand Zaire, which acted as observers to the Arusha peace\nnegotiations.\nI wish also to thank the United Nations agencies and\nall Governments and non-governmental organizations that\njoined hands with my Government in providing relief to\nthe Rwandese refugees in my country. But the relief\nwork is far from being over; new refugees are still\ncoming in. The local communities which have hosted the\nrefugees need to be compensated for the food and other\nservices and supplies they have shared with them. The\nenvironmental damage caused by the huge and sudden\ninflux of refugees also needs to be addressed as soon as\npossible.\nThe people of Ngara district in Tanzania have\nthemselves been forced to live like refugees in their own\ncountry. The local population has been outnumbered by\nthe refugees by a ratio of one to two. They face\novercrowding in social service centres and endure\ntremendous price hikes, sometimes reaching 300 per cent\nover a short period, for all their requirements. And to\nthis must be added increased security risks and\ncriminality.\nAs for environmental damage, the influx of refugees\ninto Ngara and Karagwe in Tanzania, between April and\nJune 1994 alone, caused a loss of 18,000 tons of trees,\nwith an estimated value of $12 million. The 400,000\nrefugees living in Ngara have since April consumed\n200 tons of firewood daily, with far-reaching\nconsequences for the environment. The international\ncommunity needs to continue to be seized of this matter\nand increase its support to those of us hosting this huge\ninflux of refugees.\nIt is only honourable for us as Members of the\nUnited Nations to accept that the role of our Organization\nin Rwanda has been far from honourable, and has been\nquite contrary to the principles of our Charter. While aid\nagencies and non-governmental organizations can do\nwonders on the ground, Governments wring their hands\nand wait for one another to lead the action. The crisis in\nRwanda was made worse by political indecision within\nthe international community. My delegation can only\nagree with the OAU Secretary-General that, by our failure\nto act promptly, we too stand to be blamed for the loss of\ninnocent lives and the suffering of an entire people.\n4\n\n\nAfrican troops pledged at the OAU Summit in Cairo\nlast June should quickly be given the necessary logistic\nsupport to enable the redeployment of the United Nations\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) at its full\nstrength to start without undue delay. The enlarged\nUNAMIR should then create safe zones along the Zairian\nand Tanzanian borders, which should be fully stocked with\nrelief supplies so as to encourage refugees to enter these\nsafe zones as a first step towards returning to their own\nhomes.\nSince my country became a member of this\nOrganization, there has perhaps been no issue before this\nAssembly which has preoccupied us like the question of\ndecolonization and the struggle against the apartheid system\nin South Africa. It is therefore a matter of tremendous\nsatisfaction to us that decolonization is now almost\ncomplete and that apartheid has finally landed where it\nbelongs - in the dustbin of history. South Africa\u2019s return\nto the membership of the United Nations is a victory for all\nthe people of that country, whatever their colour, a victory\nfor the United Nations and certainly a victory for the\ninternational community as a whole.\nThe political and economic reintegration of South\nAfrica into the rest of Africa is one of the biggest triumphs\nfor Africa for many years. We in the southern African sub-\nregion are happy that at last our people can sleep peacefully\nwithout fearing a surprise attack or a destabilization\ncampaign from South Africa. We are happy that the\nemerging peace and security in our region can now release\nscarce resources for the development of our people. On the\neconomic front, we have quickly begun to reverse the years\nof disengagement from South Africa and to work together\nto integrate our economies through the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC), in which the new South\nAfrica will play a very important role.\nThis, unfortunately, does not mean that all our\nproblems in southern Africa have been resolved. Events in\nAngola continue to cause us a good deal of anxiety.\nThrough its endless intransigency, UNITA continues to\ncreate problems for the Angolan peace talks in Lusaka\nunder United Nations mediation. I think the time has come\nfor the international community to exert final pressure on\nUNITA to stop it from continuing to obstruct these peace\nefforts. We must not forget that the MPLA party won the\nelections sponsored by the United Nations in September\n1992. Yet, regardless of its victory, the MPLA has been\ngenerous in inviting UNITA to join a government of\nnational unity. We cannot see why certain foreign\nGovernments should continue to pamper UNITA as it\ncomes up with new excuses to delay the process of\nnational reconciliation in that country. Our Organization\nshould tell Mr. Savimbi that he cannot have his own way\nforever. We therefore call upon all those with influence\non Mr. Savimbi to ask him either to cooperate or face the\nconsequences of the full sanctions promised in resolution\n932 (1994).\nIn Mozambique, thanks to the determined efforts of\nthe Secretary-General and the United Nations Operation\nin Mozambique (ONUMOZ), most of the difficulties have\nsince been overcome. We look forward with anticipation\nto the national elections later this month in the hope that\nthey will not only be free and fair, but also that all parties\nwill respect and abide by the election results. We hope\nthat the lessons from the Angolan experience have now\nbeen learned well and that the people of Mozambique will\nbe spared the menace that Mr. Savimbi continues to\npresent in Angola. We commend, in particular, the\noutstanding goodwill and generosity of the Government\nof President Chissano, which was demonstrated\nthroughout the negotiating process.\nDespite overall economic growth in the world, and\nthe creation of numerous developmental and social\ninstitutions, poverty has been on the increase in most\nparts of the developing world, particularly in Africa.\nA supportive international environment is crucial if\nwe are to attain sustained economic growth in developing\ncountries, especially in the least developed ones. The\nUnited Nations must be able to play a much greater role\nin this matter because, unlike the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, the United Nations is universal; its\nprogrammes operate everywhere; and it does not ignore\ncountries. But I must add that the United Nations has to\nbe strengthened, as mandated by its Charter, to enable it\nto play a complementary role vis-\u00e0-vis the other\ninternational organizations involved in development.\nMost of the least developed countries, including\nTanzania, remain among the most debt-distressed\ncountries. It is true that the magnitude of our debt is\nmarginal by international standards. Indeed, the\nindebtedness of the least developed countries does not\nhave a substantial effect on the international financial\nsystem. But in relation to the size of their economies, the\ndebt burden is far too heavy and constitutes a major\nobstacle to sustained growth. In the light of an already\ngrim financial flow situation, caused by declines in\nofficial development assistance, the crippling burden of\n5\n\n\ninternational debt has seriously hampered development\nprospects for most of our countries.\nAs an illustration, if we in Tanzania were to apportion\nour total national debt of $6.3 billion to each of our\ncitizens, every poor man, woman and child would be\nindebted to our rich creditors by the equivalent of their total\nearnings for over two years. Put differently, even if the\nTanzanian Government were to devote all its foreign\nexchange earnings to paying off this debt, it would still take\nus over 12 years to do so. With a debt burden of this\nmagnitude dragging us down all the time, it will be difficult\nfor our economy to take off.\nThere is an urgent need for the international\ncommunity to adopt a unified and coordinated approach\ntowards a durable solution of the external debt position of\ncountries like mine if we are serious about reducing poverty\nin the world. To achieve this, there should be a full\ncancellation of all bilateral and official debt, as well as a\nsubstantial reduction of the debt stock and the debt service\nburden owed to multilateral financial institutions and\ncommercial creditors.\nNowhere in the world today are the social conditions\nmore desperate and calling for more urgent attention than\nin the least developed countries. Declining income\naggravates poverty and threatens the social fabric of entire\nsocieties.\nIt is our hope that the forthcoming World Summit for\nSocial Development in Copenhagen will be an important\nforum for the world community to focus on the social and\ndevelopmental concerns of developing countries in an\nattempt to free them from the vicious circle of poverty.\nThe protracted Uruguay Round of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) finally came to a\nconclusion in December 1993. We then met at Marrakesh,\nMorocco, on 15 April 1994, to sign the new agreement that\nestablishes the World Trade Organization. We from the\ndeveloping world, and especially those of us from\nSub-Saharan Africa, signed that agreement not because we\nwere happy with it or because we thought it took care of\nour interests. We signed it because the alternative was\nequally tragic. In truth, this new agreement will only mean\nthe entrenchment of poverty in our countries unless\ncompensatory measures are urgently taken in our favour.\nIt is already being estimated that Africa is the only\ncontinent that will actually lose rather than gain from this\nnew agreement. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to lose\nabout $2.6 billion a year by the beginning of the next\ncentury. The cause of this loss is largely the\nentrenchment of unfavourable terms of trade, and the\nopening up of African markets to transnational\ncorporations based in the rich countries, which will now\nhave wider and unhindered access to markets in Africa\nand elsewhere. We will therefore continue to demand\nbetter terms of trade for our products in international\ntrade, as well as preferential treatment where this is felt\nto be necessary.\nIt is now two years since we assembled at Rio de\nJaneiro to bring to its conclusion the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development. The\nimplementation of the agreements reached at that world\nsummit has been extremely slow and in most areas\nnon-existent. The world is still far from the concept of\nsustainable development. The Agenda 21 document\nremains an academic masterpiece while the issues\ninvolved remain unresolved. Among other things, the\nUnited Nations, through the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment, should assume a major role in helping\ndeveloping countries to build their indigenous capacities\nin science and technology and in promoting access to\nexisting technology on favourable terms.\nWe are none the less gratified that the desertification\nConvention has been concluded. This is a great relief for\nthe 900 million people world wide affected by this\nphenomenon. We look forward to the signing of the\nConvention later this month.\nWe commend our development partners that\nsupported the negotiations on this important Convention\nfor Africa. The African annex to the Convention contains\nour commitments to implement the programmes of action\nin an effort to contain the processes of desertification and\ndrought, which are exacerbated by poverty and\nunderdevelopment. Unless there is a serious commitment\nby developed countries and multilateral financial\ninstitutions to extend the financial resources required to\nimplement the Convention, the social and economic\nconsequences of desertification and drought will be\nirreparable.\nWe welcome the timely initiative taken by the\nSecretary-General in preparing the Agenda for\nDevelopment. The Agenda provides an appropriate\nframework for dealing comprehensively with the\ninterrelated issues of economic and social development,\nthe environment, peace, justice and democracy.\n6\n\n\nDevelopment is a shared concern of all nations and the\nacceptance of this fact by the entire international\ncommunity will result in great success in dealing with this\nAgenda.\nWhile we recognize that States must assume\nresponsibility for their own socio-economic development,\nwe must also recognize that this will be increasingly\ndifficult without the assistance of the international\ncommunity. The solutions to the problems created by\npoverty, rural-urban migration, the degradation of the\nenvironment and the complexity of the refugee situation\nwill require an integrated approach. It is our hope that the\nAgenda for Development will project a coherent strategy\nfor achieving a new and inclusive vision of world\ndevelopment. Such a strategy must bind all countries, both\nsmall and large, rich and poor, in a planned and\nimplementable programme for human progress.\nTanzania attaches great importance to the full and\neffective participation of developing countries in decision-\nmaking for the resolution of economic problems facing our\ncommon planet. In addition, the Agenda should incorporate\nthe various agreements and strategies for international\ndevelopment already adopted over the years in different\nforums and conferences. We must also identify the reasons\nwhy so many of these commitments and agreements,\nespecially those related to developing countries, are still on\npaper only.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate our faith in and\ncommitment to the United Nations. In this post-cold-war\nera, the temptation to bypass, or dictate to, this world body\nmight be quite high. We must not allow that to take place.\nWe must instead work to strengthen the United Nations and\nits agencies and to entrench their democratic tradition. We\nmust, at the same time, recognize that poverty, like the\nenvironment, knows no borders. It is in our collective\ninterest that, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations system, we dedicate ourselves in practical\nterms to the eradication of poverty the world over. We\nmust agree that poverty is as much a threat to peace and\nsecurity and as much an affront to humanity as injustice,\noppression and discrimination.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and\nthe people of Fiji, I warmly congratulate His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.\nGiven his vast experience and his knowledge of the United\nNations system, I have every confidence that the current\nsession of the Assembly will complete its work\nsuccessfully.\nI also wish to pay a special tribute to the outgoing\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, for the\nexcellent and efficient manner in which he conducted the\nbusiness of the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nMost of the problems afflicting the world community\nthat have been discussed in this Assembly in previous years\ncontinue unchanged. A survey of the world scene readily\ndiscloses that no region of the world is free from tension;\nthat the economic divide between the rich and the poor\ncontinues to widen; that political and social upheavals in\nmany parts of the world are getting extremely difficult\nand expensive to contain; and that poverty and despair\nremain the lot of a substantial part of the world\u2019s\npopulation. There is an urgent need to address these\nproblems in a comprehensive and timely manner. The\npiecemeal approach that we have adopted so far only\ntends to plug the hole and does not eliminate the causes.\nMoreover, our efforts are invariably made after an event\nhas occurred, and often when our conscience cannot bear\nto see the misery on our television screens. We must\ndevise ways for a more preventive approach to the\nproblems.\nPolitical problems are often a consequence of\neconomic and social problems. The General Assembly\u2019s\ndecision at its forty-seventh session to convene a World\nSummit for Social Development at Copenhagen early in\n1995 was very timely. While we have seen some\nsignificant advances in human rights and democracy in\nmany parts of the world, and positive developments\ntowards reducing the potential for regional conflicts in\nother areas, the fact remains that in both developed and\ndeveloping countries new challenges to international\npeace and security are manifesting themselves under a\nbroad plethora of social development problems. We can\nno longer turn a blind eye to the increasing growth of\npoverty and unemployment and the attendant\nmarginalization of peoples.\nAnnually, between 13 to 18 million people die from\nstarvation, disease and famine. It has been estimated that\nworld wide one out of every five people live below the\npoverty line. While Governments, in many cases,\nequivocate on how to solve this problem, the poor\nincreasingly look to the United Nations to find effective,\nimmediate and practical solutions. To ignore this reality\nis to deny that it constitutes a real source of political\ninstability.\nIndeed, the Security council has expressed the view\nthat\n\u201cpeace and prosperity are indivisible and that lasting\npeace and stability require effective international\ncooperation for the eradication of poverty and the\npromotion of a better life for all in larger freedom.\u201d\n(S/23500, p. 5)\n26\n\n\nThese views are buttressed by the prophetic words of\nthe Nobel laureate Ralph Bunche who, as long ago as 1950,\nsaid:\n\u201cPeace is no mere matter of men fighting or not\nfighting. Peace, to have meaning for many who have\nknown only suffering in both peace and war, must be\ntranslated into bread or rice, shelter, health and\neducation, as well as freedom and human dignity \u2014\na steadily better life. If peace is to be secure, long-\nsuffering and long-starved peoples of the world, the\nunderprivileged and the undernourished, must begin to\nrealize without delay the promise of a new day and a\nnew life.\u201d\nWhile these words were uttered in a different context,\nI would suggest that they encapsulate the whole reason for\nthe social Summit. My Government will actively support\nand work in cooperation with other countries to achieve the\nobjectives of the World Summit for Social Development.\nMy Government looks forward to playing an active\nrole in the forthcoming World Conference on Women, to be\nheld in Beijing next September. Fiji has always recognized\nthe important contribution of women to society and to the\ndevelopment process in general.\nIn 1987, the Fiji Government established a Ministry of\nWomen. A Department on Women and Culture, which\noperates under the purview of this Ministry, carries the\nresponsibility of monitoring improvements in the status of\nwomen. It seeks to encourage the private and public\nsectors to address the needs of women in their policies and\nprogrammes. It is also the Government\u2019s policy to assign\n50 per cent of representation in training, appointments and\npromotions at all levels of the civil service to women, on\nthe basis of preference and merit. The Government\nencourages the same in the private sector. I might also\nmention that all three women members of the House of\nRepresentatives in Fiji are Ministers in the Cabinet.\nMy Government will continue to enhance and uplift\nthe status of women. It is in the process of ratifying the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\nof Discrimination against Women. Fiji will also explore\nmembership of the Commission on the Status of Women,\nin keeping with its policy of strengthening the role of\nwomen in the country\u2019s national development plans. On\nthe issue of gender equity, it is my belief that in order that\nthe principles enshrined in the first Article of the Charter of\nthe United Nations to be achieved, the equal participation\nof women in the Secretariat of this Organization, on an\nequitable regional basis, must continue to be implemented\nand be given urgent priority.\nMy country was pleased to have participated in the\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States in Barbados earlier this\nyear. In short, the Conference was convened because of\na universal recognition of the problems faced by small\nisland developing States in achieving sustainable\ndevelopment goals. While the Barbados Conference was\nimportant in re-emphasizing the special environmental and\neconomic circumstances of small island States, my\ndelegation wishes to reiterate that the Conference was\nonly the beginning of a process. We must now act to\nimplement the Barbados Programme of Action and\nDeclaration.\nIn this connection, we would urge the international\ncommunity, and particularly those countries with\ndeveloped and industrialized economies, to respond to the\ninvitation to enhance and promote human resource\ndevelopment programmes in small island developing\ncountries. Increased technical assistance will enhance the\ninstitutional and administrative capacity of small island\ncountries to implement the Programme of Action. One of\nthe ways in which this can be brought about is by the\nprovision of new and additional financial resources in\naccordance with Chapter 33 of Agenda 21. Unless\ncreative and supportive international responses to the\nspecial challenges faced by small island developing\ncountries in planning for sustainable development are\nurgently stimulated, I fear that their continuing\nvulnerability to both physical and socio-economic forces\nwill increase. In this context it is opportune to remind\nthe global community to fulfil the commitments it made\nat Rio some two years ago.\nWe are on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nestablishment of the United Nations. My country strongly\nsupports the principles contained in the Charter and I\nwould like to reaffirm our support for the Organization.\nOver the past 50 years, the Organization has seen many\nchanges. Its membership has increased from 51 to the\npresent 184. With the end of the cold war, it has\nassumed a more central role in world affairs. There is an\never-increasing demand on the limited resources of the\nOrganization and, in particular, on its Secretariat. We\nsupport the Secretariat and commend the adjustments it is\nmaking in order to respond to the changing needs of the\ninternational community. We urge the Secretariat to\ncontinue to pursue the goals of efficiency and\ncost-effectiveness. In this regard, my Government\n27\n\n\nwelcomes the creation of the Office of Internal Oversight\nServices. We believe this to be an important innovation that\nwill contribute to greater efficiency within the United\nNations system. We fully support the continuing efforts to\nbring about greater transparency and accountability on the\npart of the United Nations management and institutional\nstructures.\nIn the same vein, Mr. President, my Government\nsupports the view that it is now time that the current\nstructure and the membership of the Security Council were\nreviewed. With the very large increase in the membership\nof the United Nations since it was founded, with the\nchanges that have occurred on the global political scene in\nrecent years, and with the nature of problems that must be\nresolved by the United Nations, including the diverse facets\nof economic, environmental and peace-keeping and\npeace-monitoring issues, we agree that there is now a need\nto consider an enlarged Security Council with more\nequitable representation of membership to look at these\nissues more comprehensively.\nIn this regard, we welcome the report of the\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council (A/48/47) in response to General\nAssembly resolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993, and the\nrecommendation that the Open-Ended Working Group\nshould continue its work. In the event that membership of\nthe Security Council is expanded, Fiji fully supports the\nmembership of Japan, recognizing its important role not\nonly as a valued neighbour in the Asia-Pacific region, but\nalso as a key player in the global economy.\nMy Government has followed with close and keen\ninterest, meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on the\nElaboration of an International Convention dealing with the\nSafety and Security of United Nations and Associated\nPersonnel. We consider the United Nations staff and\nassociated personnel who participate in various missions\nsponsored by the United Nations as an integral and essential\npart of those missions. We have seen their courage in\nCambodia, Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and other places\naround the world. If the United Nations is to continue to\nrely on individual men and women to assist in carrying out\nthe mandates of its various organs, it is only fair and fitting\nthat we should provide them with an adequate level of\nsafety and security. At its last session, the Ad Hoc\nCommittee worked very constructively and made significant\nprogress. However, it is important for the Ad Hoc\nCommittee to conclude its work as soon as possible and we\nurge that this be done. We have a very real interest in the\nconclusion of this convention since in as much as Fiji has\nlost some of its nationals in various peace-keeping\noperations, and many others have been injured. For us,\ntherefore, peace-keeping has come at a high price. It\ninvolves the sacrifices, not only of individuals, but also of\nthe families left behind. But my Government remains\nunshaken in its belief that the price we have paid and are\ncontinuing to pay for our involvement in United Nations\npeace-keeping operations would have been worthwhile if\nwe have contributed towards making the world a safer\nplace. We owe this to our children and to our children\u2019s\nchildren.\nAt the present time, there are at least l,000 troops\nfrom Fiji serving in various peace-keeping operations - in\nLebanon, Sinai, Iraq, Kuwait and Rwanda. Only recently\nwe agreed to participate in the regional peace-keeping\nforce in Bougainville in Papua New Guinea. This was in\ndirect response to a request we received from the\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea, with the support of\nthe relevant parties in Bougainville. Our participation in\nthe South Pacific regional peace-keeping force for\nBougainville is in concert with our other neighbours in\nthe South Pacific, namely Tonga, Vanuatu, Solomon\nIslands, Australia and New Zealand. Our participation is\nalso for a specific purpose, and that is to assist the\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea and the relevant\nparties on Bougainville in facilitating a secure\nenvironment in which they will be able to hold a peace\nconference and, through dialogue, achieve a consensus on\nthe future of Bougainville. Let me say that our\ncommitment to peace-keeping is a continuing affirmation\nof our belief that the purposes and principles set forth in\nthe United Nations Charter must be given practical\nexpression. Fiji, as a responsible member of the\ninternational community, will continue to play its role in\nthe enhancement of global peace and security.\nOn the subject of peace-keeping, I want at this time\nto express my Government\u2019s satisfaction at the\nstrengthening of the Department of Peace-keeping\nOperations. I believe that continued innovations in the\ninstitutional structure of this Department will be necessary\nif it is to play a meaningful and effective role in support\nof United Nations peace-keeping activities.\nThis year marks an important milestone in the\ndevelopment of the international law of the sea. Fiji was\nthe first State to ratify the 1982 United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. We are therefore\npleased that, 12 years after its adoption, the Convention\nwill enter into force on 16 November 1994. The\n28\n\n\nConvention represents a historic achievement by the\ninternational community. It will establish the rule of law\nover more than two-thirds of the Earth\u2019s surface, and\npromote its peaceful use. Like many other States, Fiji has\nalready been implementing the provisions of the\nConvention, through its Marine Spaces Act. Entry into\nforce of the Convention would thus consolidate our claims\nto the archipelagic waters, the territorial sea and the\nexclusive economic zone. Fiji has always supported\nuniversal participation in the Convention. We therefore\nwelcome the conclusion of the Agreement to resolve the\noutstanding issues relating to the deep seabed mining part\nof the Convention, part XI. As at the Conference on the\nLaw of the Sea, our delegation, together with other\ndelegations, was pleased to play an active and constructive\nrole in bringing about that important agreement. We have\nsigned the agreement and will become a party to it. We\nurge all States that have not done so to become parties to\nthe Convention and to the new Agreement in order to\nachieve the goal of universal participation.\nAssociated with the law of the sea is the important\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\nFish Stocks. Fish is an invaluable gift of nature to man.\nHowever, man\u2019s unregulated and indiscriminate exploitation\nof this vital resource is rapidly depleting or destroying it.\nFish is an important national and regional resource and it is\na staple in our diet. In addition to other species, some 40\nper cent of the world\u2019s tuna is to be found in the south-\nwest Pacific region. We are therefore concerned at the\nlong-term impact on these resources and on the marine eco-\nsystem as a whole, if the current practice of uncontrolled\nfishing, especially on the high seas, continues. The\nConference has been organized to address the urgent\nproblems facing us with regard to the conservation and\nmanagement of fisheries around the world. These problems\nmust be addressed from the perspective of both present and\nfuture generations. Fiji therefore strongly supports an\neffective outcome from the Conference, an outcome that\nwould ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable\nuse of the fish resources of the seas and oceans. Our\ndelegation, in cooperation with other delegations to the\nConference, will spare no effort in working towards this\ngoal. We are grateful for the confidence shown in our\ncountry by our election as Chairman of the Conference.\nSince the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly, we have witnessed positive and constructive\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process. It is\nalmost a year now since the Declaration of Principles was\nsigned between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO). This was followed by the agreement\non the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area signed at Cairo in\nMay this year. The recent peace accord between Israel\nand Jordan, which was signed at Washington last July,\nwas another very positive development. My Government\nlends its support to the Middle East peace process. In\nparticular, we express the hope that the ongoing bilateral\nnegotiations between Israel and Jordan and between Israel\nand the Palestinians will continue. We are also hopeful\nthat the present dialogue between Syria, Lebanon and\nIsrael will eventually lead to further agreements.\nI would now like to mention a number of issues in\nmy own region, the South Pacific. One is New\nCaledonia. While some positive developments have been\ntaking place in New Caledonia in relation to the\ncontinued implementation of the Matignon Accords, I\nbelieve that there is still a need to accelerate the process\nof redressing social and economic imbalances in the\nterritory. In this connection, my Government will\ncontinue to observe developments in New Caledonia with\nkeen interest in the build-up to the referendum to be held\nin 1998.\nNuclear issues and transboundary movements of\nhazardous and radioactive wastes are also of considerable\nconcern to us in the South Pacific region. Fiji has long\nbeen a consistent opponent of nuclear testing anywhere\nand in any environment. Our opposition to such testing\nis by no means based only on environmental concerns.\nFor hundreds of years, the livelihood of our people has\ndepended on their limited land and on the resources in the\nmarine environment. Fundamentally, our abhorrence of\nnuclear arms and nuclear testing is based on the belief\nthat there is simply no place for nuclear weapons in our\nregion, or indeed in any other part of the world. In this\nconnection, we have been pleased to note the temporary\ncessation of nuclear testing in the Pacific region by\nFrance, and would urge the French Government to agree\nto a permanent moratorium on testing in the South\nPacific.\nFiji is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons. We believe that the Treaty\nrepresents a unique achievement in the promotion of\nglobal peace and security and in the reduction of the\nthreat of nuclear warfare. The Pacific region has long\nrecognized and embraced the principles enshrined in the\nTreaty, and these principles are now reflected in the\nTreaty of Rarotonga, which establishes the South Pacific\nas a nuclear-free zone. We would, in this regard,\nencourage the United States, the United Kingdom and\nFrance to accede to the Protocols to the Treaty of\n29\n\n\nRarotonga as a demonstration of their commitment to\nnuclear non-proliferation and to a ban on testing in the\nSouth Pacific.\nWe are equally concerned about the transboundary\nmovements \u2014 and, in particular, about the sea transit\nthrough the region \u2014 of consignments of plutonium from\nEurope to Japan. For obvious reasons, we object very\nstrongly to this development and earnestly hope that there\nwill be no more such shipments through the region.\nThe countries of the South Pacific region are also\ncurrently in the process of negotiating a regional convention\nto ban the importation into the island States of the South\nPacific Forum of hazardous wastes and to control their\ntransboundary movement and management within the South\nPacific region. My country fully supports this initiative and\nis actively engaged in the negotiation process. The\nconvention is expected to be adopted in mid-1995. This\nwill further strengthen our resolve to keep the South Pacific\nregion free of radioactive and hazardous wastes.\nAt the national level, the Government of Fiji has\ncommenced work on the review of the country\u2019s 1990\nConstitution. The members of the Parliamentary Select\nCommittee on the Review of the Constitution have already\nbeen announced. They have been drawn from both sides of\nthe House of Representatives and from the Senate, and\nrepresent all the racial groups in our population. As\nChairman of that Committee, the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs with Special Responsibilities on Constitutional\nReview, Senator Filipe N. Bole, had a fruitful meeting of\nthe Committee only a few days ago. Last November, the\nCabinet agreed to the timetable for the review of the\nConstitution, following the approval, by Parliament, of the\nterms of reference of the Constitution Review Commission.\nBecause of the general elections that were held in Fiji in\nFebruary of this year, the review process has been slightly\ndelayed, but it is expected that the substantive work of the\nCommission will begin soon after the Commission has been\nappointed, which will be done shortly.\nFiji has a very small, export-oriented economy that\ncannot isolate itself from the vagaries of the global\neconomy. We are less able to absorb adverse trends in\nexternal economic conditions than are larger and more\ndiversified economies; equally, an improvement in the\nglobal economy is slow to be reflected in our own small\neconomy. Like many small developing countries, we are\nstill in the process of gradual recovery following a\nprolonged downturn that afflicted the world as a whole.\nLike many countries, we have had to adjust our economic\npolicies in such a way as to give them a more\nmarket-oriented approach. This has involved the\nfollowing fundamentals: less interference with the market;\nrecognition that the Government cannot do everything and\nthat the private sector is the engine for development,\nwhich the Government must complement rather than\ncompete with; and the encouragement of, and reward for,\nentrepreneurship, skills, abilities and hard work. In this\nmanner we are proceeding with the deregulation of the\neconomy to bring domestic prices more closely into line\nwith world prices; restraining the growth of Government\nexpenditure to ensure availability of resources for growth\nin the private sector; reforming the system of direct and\nindirect taxation to minimize market distortions and\nimprove incentives for risk-taking and effort;\nimplementing wage policies that recognize the paramount\nimportance of maintaining international competitiveness;\nand mobilizing all sectors of the community in support of\neconomic expansion. These constitute a package of\nmutually self-reinforcing policies.\nIn a world that is economically interlinked and in\nwhich we are all economically interdependent, no country,\nhowever well-intentioned its national efforts might be, can\nsustain itself without support and interaction from outside.\nThis is true of large, diversified economies, and it is\ncertainly true for small, isolated economies such as ours.\nOur internal efforts to create a better economic climate,\nif not supported by external investments, will not succeed.\nNor will they succeed if we are denied or prevented from\ngetting access to markets of more developed countries.\nOur efforts, therefore, depend considerably on investment\nfrom outside and on access for our products to traditional\nand new markets. In this regard, we express our gratitude\nto our developed neighbouring countries for the\nconsideration they have given to some of our exports.\nWe believe, however, that in the spirit of regional\ncooperation and better balance in trade the present\narrangements must be further improved.\nIn our efforts to develop our economy, we also\ncount on the support and understanding of our good\nfriends and partners in our neighbouring region of Asia.\nWe value our increasing contacts and economic relations,\nparticularly with the countries of the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations, Malaysia, the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan,\nand we are confident that these relations will continue to\nbe strengthened in the future.\nOur Prime Minister, the Honourable Major-General\nSitiveni Rabuka, greatly appreciated the warm welcome\n30\n\n\nthat he received during his recent visit to the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China and Taiwan. Fiji remains committed to\nits official relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China but\nalso greatly values its trade and economic cooperation with\nTaiwan. It is our sincere hope that the People\u2019s Republic\nof China and Taiwan, in continued direct talks and\nnegotiations, will be able to reach agreement on a\npracticable basis on which to strengthen and expand\ncooperation between them, including cooperation in the\ninternational arena.\nThe establishment of the South Pacific Forum in 1971\nwas an early initiative taken by Fiji following its\nindependence, together with Australia, the Cook Islands,\nNauru, New Zealand, Tonga and Western Samoa. The\nForum now has 15 members, and it meets at the level of\nHeads of Government. The Forum originated from the\ndesire of our leaders to develop collective responses on a\nwide range of regional issues, including trade, economic\ndevelopment, civil aviation, maritime, telecommunications,\nenergy, environmental, and political and security matters.\nOne significant recent development is the post-Forum\ndialogue: immediately after a Forum meeting, the Forum\nisland countries meet separately with their more developed\ntrade and economic partners to discuss development\npriorities and constraints in the region. The post-Forum\ndialogue partners include Canada, the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina, France, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the\nUnited States. From our perspective as small island nations\nwhose economies, to remain viable, depend to a very large\nextent on economic ties with these larger and more\nvigorous economies, we value these discussions and are\nconfident that they will continue.\nIn a wider context, we of the South Pacific Forum\nbelieve that it is important and indeed mutually beneficial\nfor the Forum Secretariat to be more closely associated\nwith the United Nations. For this reason, the Forum\nmembers have decided to seek Observer status in this\nOrganization for the South Pacific Forum Secretariat. We\nurge the General Assembly to give favourable consideration\nto this request.\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to\nexpress, from this rostrum, the appreciation and profound\nthanks of my Government and people to the Secretary-\nGeneral, the staff of the United Nations and its various\norganizations and agencies for their continued support for,\nand technical assistance to, our national development, and\nindeed, for the numerous development projects in our\nregion as a whole. In these times, when valuable resources\nfor development purposes are becoming more and more\nscarce and difficult to come by, I wish to assure the\ndonors and agencies that my Government will manage\nand utilize these scarce resources carefully and\neffectively.\n"

        "file_text": " On behalf of\nmy delegation and Government and the people of Papua\nNew Guinea I join previous speakers in warmly\ncongratulating Ambassador Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\non his election as the President of the forty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that\nhe will maintain the high standards set by his\npredecessors and lead us skilfully through our important\ndeliberations. I pledge my delegation\u2019s cooperation in the\ndischarge of the responsibilities of his high office.\nAt the same time as we welcome Ambassador Essy,\nmy delegation would also like to pay tribute to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Ambassador Samuel\nInsanally of Guyana, who skilfully guided the work of the\nforty-eighth session.\nAs consistent opponents of the vile doctrine of\napartheid and the unjust political system on which it was\nbased, the people and Government of Papua New Guinea\ntake particular pleasure in welcoming the readmission of\na new and democratic South Africa to the United Nations.\nWe look forward to strengthening our relations with the\nGovernment and people of South Africa in a bilateral as\nwell as a multilateral setting.\n27\n\n\nWith the end of the cold war, we are in a challenging\nperiod. Our collective resolve should be for the good of\nhumanity. That calls for increased multilateral diplomacy,\nespecially of the nature espoused in the United Nations\nCharter.\nTo that end, my Government values regional\ncooperation and believes that such efforts would enhance\nthe basis for regional stability and international\ndevelopment cooperation. Papua New Guinea values its\nmembership of the South Pacific Forum and the Melanesian\nSpearhead Group, just as it enjoys its association with the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a\nspecial observer. These regional organizations have forged\nmutual cooperation between member countries as well as\nenhancing the atmosphere for international cooperation.\nSuch cooperation was evident during the recent South\nPacific Forum session held in Brisbane, Australia, where\nsix countries - namely Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua\nNew Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu - were able to\nagree to work together towards a common approach on\nlogging and the export of timber. That positive\ndevelopment in a regional context is of definite value to\nongoing global endeavours for the environment and\nsustainable development.\nWe believe that an increasing number of issues are of\nglobal importance and must be addressed on a global basis.\nIn this regard, the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, the\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States in Barbados, and the recent\nWorld Conference on Population and Development in\nCairo, as well as the forthcoming World Summit for Social\nDevelopment in Copenhagen and the Fourth World\nConference on Women in Beijing next year, suggest that\nthese issues are extremely important and need concerted\ninternational efforts. While there is emerging consensus on\nthese issues, there seems to be a lack of commitment to\nproviding the necessary resources to achieve those\nobjectives.\nIs it worth the time and effort expended in adopting\nvisionary resolutions and declarations when the required\nresources are not there to fulfil the programmes and\nobjectives of these world conferences? In that regard my\ndelegation is particularly anxious to see international\nsupport for the Barbados Programme of Action on\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates.\nThe United Nations initiative on opportunity and\nparticipation focuses on the particular need of developing\ncountries in their efforts to maximize the participation of\nall their citizens in activities aimed at sustainable\ndevelopment and an effective management of resources.\nIn this regard I welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s\ninterim report on this initiative, to be issued under item\n92 (j) of the agenda of the forty-ninth session. My\nGovernment looks forward to the final report by the panel\nof distinguished experts, to be issued to coincide with the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\nIt is clear that these issues and others require both a\nnational and a collective international approach,\nparticularly those relating to environmental and climatic\nchanges which transcend national boundaries. Agenda 21,\nadopted at the Rio Earth Summit, provides a good basis\nfor international cooperation and action.\nConsistent with the emerging international consensus\non major global issues, my Prime Minister, the Right\nHonourable Sir Julius Chan, has emphasized the need for\na global view to be taken of these concerns and for our\nGovernment to take effective action nationally as well as\nregionally in pursuance of our foreign policy.\nIn taking a global view we must not allow vague\ngeneralities to substitute for practical action. Each of us\nmust contribute to resolving global problems where we\ncan be most effective.\nWe must follow the thrust of recommendations\ncontained in the Secretary-General\u2019s \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\"\nand an \\\"Agenda for Development\\\" prepared for our\nguidance, and we must pursue those goals, starting at\nhome and in our respective regions.\nAs far as Papua New Guinea\u2019s foreign relations are\nconcerned, we are giving renewed attention to the need to\nwork the Pacific in a practical way. In doing so, we are\nnot turning away from mutually beneficial ties that have\ndeveloped over the years with countries and regional\norganizations such as ASEAN, but are trying to\nconsolidate and to continue diversifying our foreign\nrelations in a wider context.\nWe remain just as emphatically committed to\nmaintaining - and where possible strengthening - Papua\nNew Guinea\u2019s long-standing links with other countries in\nthe Asia-Pacific region, Europe and elsewhere.\n28\n\n\nEven as we focus renewed attention on certain\ncountries and objectives, our basic approach to the\ndevelopment of Papua New Guinea\u2019s foreign relations\nremains one of active and selective engagement. Our\nspecific objectives, including our efforts to work the\nPacific, will be viewed, and pursued, in a global\nperspective.\nDespite the uncertainties that have arisen and the\nterrible conflicts that have erupted in various regions, the\nend of the cold war has, we believe, enabled Members of\nthe United Nations to reconsider security on a\ncomprehensive basis. My Government therefore commends\nthe attention that reports of the Secretary-General and the\nUnited Nations Development Programme have given to\nnon-military threats, to security in the widest sense, and to\nmeasures to reduce threats to security by other - and more\nthan military - means. In a very real, and particular, sense\nthe end of the cold war enables the United Nations to return\nto its roots.\nWe are faced with a historic opportunity to pursue,\ndebate and take actions on issues of human welfare that are\ncentral to the purposes of the United Nations.\nEighty-five per cent of the people in my country live\nin rural communities where the basic needs of food and\nshelter are secured on a sustainable basis. However,\ndespite the sustainable livelihood of our people, natural\ndisasters can occur, as happened when unexpectedly high\nfloods destroyed houses, damaged crops and disrupted\nservices in much of my home province, Gulf, early this\nyear.\nIn the past 12 months, various parts of Papua New\nGuinea have been afflicted by natural disasters such as\nfloods, earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activities,\nwhich have placed a severe burden on our resources. The\nsudden volcanic eruptions that caused more than 60,000\npeople to be evacuated from the town of Rabaul and\nsurrounding areas of East New Britain Province more than\none week ago have considerably taxed our resources. The\nvolcanic activity is still continuing.\nWe appreciate the promptness with which various\nGovernments, particularly those in our region, including\nAustralia, New Zealand and the United States of America,\ncontinue to respond when natural disasters occur in small\nisland countries of the region, including my own country.\nI take this opportunity to register my Government\u2019s\nappreciation for the positive responses we have received\nfrom various Governments, international organizations and\nnon-governmental organizations. We have yet to establish\nthe extent of the damage to property, crops and food\ngardens due to the continuing volcanic activity. In this\nregard, my Government would appreciate international\nassistance in its restoration and rehabilitation programmes\nin due course.\nRegarding the collective international commitment\nwe all undertook at Rio de Janeiro, my Government is in\nthe process of instituting a national sustainable-\ndevelopment strategy. On a subregional level, we have\nissued a joint declaration on cooperation in the\ndevelopment of natural resources with our fellow\nmembers of the Melanesian Spearhead Group, the\nSolomon Islands and Vanuatu. Among other things, it\nprovides a framework for exchanges of information on\nforeign countries that exploit and harvest our natural\nresources in unsustainable ways and engage in transfer\npricing and illegal operations.\nWe are party to agreements reached at the Brisbane\nmeeting of the South Pacific Forum to cooperate on a\nwider basis in order to ensure the sustainable development\nof fisheries and forestry resources. We believe\ndevelopment must be equitable if it is to be sustained.\nThe ongoing failure to reduce environmental\npollution in advanced industrial countries undermines the\nglobal commitments made at Rio de Janeiro.\nThe people and the Government of Papua New\nGuinea are especially sensitive about the need for balance\nbetween equity and development. We are continuing to\nexperience the sad consequences that arose from the lack\nof proper balance among the immediate needs of people,\nthe environment and development in the area around the\nPanguna copper mine, in our province of Bougainville.\nAllow me to touch on an area of serious concern to\nmy delegation and my Government. This relates to\nallegations of human rights violations on the island in\nBougainville Province of Papua New Guinea. The\nallegations of human rights violations have been unduly\norchestrated through the Human Rights Commission in\nGeneva. This, I wish to assure the Assembly, is an ill-\nconceived attempt to discredit the Government and the\npeople of Papua New Guinea.\nFrom the very beginning of its life as an independent\nstate, in 1975, Papua New Guinea has had embodied in\nits constitution human rights provisions as entrenched\n29\n\n\nbasic and fundamental rights and freedoms of the human\nperson.\nThese cover all internationally recognized human\nrights Covenants and more. They include the liberty of the\nperson, freedom from forced labor, freedom from arbitrary\nsearch and entry, freedom of conscience, thought and\nreligion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and\nassociation, the right to freedom of employment, the right\nto privacy, freedom of information, freedom of movement,\nand protection from unjust deprivation of property. An\nhonest and objective assessment of the situation in Papua\nNew Guinea should leave no one in doubt as to our good\nrecord in the observance of and respect for human rights.\nMy Government therefore sees no difficulty in meeting\nthe request made by the United Nations Commission on\nHuman Rights to provide a report on alleged human rights\nabuses in Bougainville. Outsiders have been allowed to\nvisit and to report on what they see; Bougainville is neither\nclosed nor shut off from all external contacts.\nThe Bougainville peace conference is expected to\ndiscuss human rights issues, including allegations of abuses.\nThe Government intends to set up a human rights\ncommission to investigate, provide redress for and prevent\nrepetition of human rights violations. We are confident that\nthe report we are providing will deal with all legitimate\nUnited Nations concerns.\nThe situation in Bougainville is not a colonial\nproblem. It is not a problem of human rights as such. It is\nnot a minority or indigenous people\u2019s issue. The trouble in\nBougainville Province, stemming as it does from claims to\ncompensation for the use of tribal lands in the process of\ndevelopment during a mining project, makes all separatist\nclaims that are being canvassed by some commentators ring\nvery hollow.\nCompensation claims are very common in all the\nprovinces of Papua New Guinea, which is a country\nexperiencing a mining and petroleum resources\ndevelopment boom. The ownership of the land in which the\nmineral resources are located is vested in groups of clans\nor tribes or other congregations of extended families, and\nin a very special way their whole being is wrapped up in\nthe land and the environment. Therefore the determination\nof the legal rights of these groups to the benefits from any\nmining projects on their land becomes a very complicated\nand sensitive affair indeed. This is the real basis of the\nBougainville problem, and it is a problem faced by the\nGovernment in just about every province in the country.\nA perfectly legitimate resource-benefit dispute\nbetween the mining company and the traditional\nlandowners has taken advantage of by criminal elements,\nwhose activities derailed the negotiations for a just\nsolution on compensation for the use of land for the\ndevelopment of the giant Panguna copper mine, which at\nthe time was the biggest foreign-exchange earner for the\ncountry.\nIn a vibrant democracy such as the one we have in\nPapua New Guinea, we cannot deny our people\u2019s\nfundamental rights. The exercise of their rights\ndetermines the Government that will take office. In our\ncontinuing effort to find a resolution to the unfortunate\nsituation in Bougainville, my Prime Minister has recently\ntaken an initiative to bring the conflict to a peaceful end.\nWe have accordingly negotiated a cease-fire with all\nmajor parties to the crisis.\nI am pleased to add that preparations for a\nBougainville peace conference, planned to begin on\n10 October, are well in hand. A regional peace-keeping\nforce, made up of units from Tonga, Fiji and Vanuatu,\nwith Australian and New Zealand logistical support and\nthe cooperation, in particular, of the Prime Minister,\nDeputy Prime Minister, Government and people of the\nSolomon Islands, is being formed to facilitate the peace\nprocess. I am pleased to say that at this very moment a\nstatus-of-forces agreement has been signed in Suva, Fiji,\nbetween my Prime Minister and representatives from the\nparticipating countries to formalize the arrangements. We\nbelieve this peace-keeping operation now being put in\nplace is an example of regional self-help, and an approach\nworthy of endorsement and wider consideration and\napplication.\nWhile we are attempting to find a peaceful solution\nto the worst crisis faced by Papua New Guinea since\nindependence, my Government can only express its deep\nconcern at the continuing failure of people with much\nolder national institutions to do the same, and of\nGovernments elsewhere to act purposefully in their stead.\nWe are deeply disturbed by the continuing violence\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, the elusive cease-fire process\nand the paralysis of political will that has so far failed to\nhalt aggression. In the cases of Rwanda, Somalia and\nother trouble areas, I must say that the horrors being\nrevealed to the world have caused the most profound\nshock in my country. Can we, the Members of the\nUnited Nations, really do no more to end the violence, to\nreduce the suffering and to bring mass murderers to\n30\n\n\njustice? Can we not act faster? Can we be no more\neffective? These questions are especially urgent in an age\nwhere the complaint has sometimes been made that the\nUnited Nations is not balancing its attention and resources\nproperly between peace-keeping and development.\nEven as we regret the terrible situations in some parts\nof the world, we can only be heartened by developments\nelsewhere. Thus my Government welcomes the\nconstructive steps being taken by the Government of Israel\nand the Palestinian Liberation Organization to build peace\nin one of the most troublesome parts of the world. We\napplaud the skilful, determined and unselfish diplomacy that\nhas facilitated the process and still continues to lend it\nsupport.\nElsewhere in the world, developments to bring about\na political settlement in Haiti have given my Government\ncautious hope that diplomacy will continue to be an\neffective means of securing peace in such a complex\nsituation. The cease-fire in Northern Ireland suggests that\nall is never completely lost in even the most enduring and\nseemingly intractable conflicts.\nCloser to home, my Government is optimistic about\nthe prospects for securing peace through the Regional\nForum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) and other efforts to enhance confidence-building\nin South-East Asia.\nWe urge the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea to desist from the development of\nnuclear weapons.\nFirmly committed to maintaining and strengthening\nrelations with the People\u2019s Republic of China on the basis\nof existing agreements, my Government none the less sees\nthe developing dialogue between the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina and Taiwan as very promising indeed.\nFollowing the successful World Conference on Human\nRights held in Vienna in 1993, the draft text of the Agenda\nfor Development acknowledges that development is a\nhuman right. It also states quite rightly that development\nis \\\"the most secure basis for peace\\\". But development in\nan increasingly interdependent world involves more than\nnational will and resources. It requires international\nsupport, or at least an international environment that is not\nactively hostile.\nWhile the world must surely welcome the successful\nconclusion of the Uruguay round of negotiations under the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, peoples and\nGovernments in developing countries are entitled to look\nfor more, particularly by way of measures to reduce and\nultimately remove completely barriers that obstruct our\ncapacity to compete effectively in international trade.\nSuccessive Papua New Guinea Governments have\nbeen active participants in the deliberations of the Special\nCommittee on decolonization. We have been strong\nadvocates of the right to self-determination in New\nCaledonia and of special safeguards for the indigenous\nKanaks. Like other members of the South Pacific Forum,\nwe remain firm in our support of the rights of the\nKanaks. Our vigilance in relation to the implementation\nof the Matignon Accords will be maintained until the\nultimate objective is achieved.\nWith formal termination of the last United Nations\nTrusteeship mandate, over Palau, later this year, and with\nthe implementation of the Compact of Free Association\nwith the United States of America, my Government looks\nforward to welcoming Palau to full membership of the\nUnited Nations in due course.\nIn taking a global view from the perspective of the\npart of the Asia-Pacific region where Papua New Guinea\nis located, I have tried to relate immediate national and\nregional issues to wider international concerns. In doing\nso, I have been aware that other delegations, hearing of\nevents and attitudes in my part of the world, have been\nplacing us in a global perspective too.\nIn the South Pacific, my Government sees\nworthwhile prospects for enhancing mutually beneficial\ncooperation in a number of areas that have not previously\nreceived the attention they deserve, including the\npromotion of trade, investment and tourism, and\ndevelopment of the region\u2019s vast natural resources.\nPapua New Guinea believes that the ongoing\nconsultations aimed at expanding the number of\npermanent seats on the Security Council and at the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly are timely. We\nhope that the process will reflect the current international\neconomic and political climate. Thus, we are pleased to\nnote the progress being made in improving financial\ncontrols and in exploring options for further reform within\nthe United Nations system. We hope that both processes\nwill contribute to further development of the\nOrganization\u2019s capacity for effective achievement of its\nobjectives.\n31\n\n\nAs we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, we should all re-commit ourselves to the purposes\nand principles of the United Nations Charter. An era of\ncooperation and understanding has dawned. Let us not\nmiss the opportunity for peace, security and prosperity for\nhumanity.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate\nMr. Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on his election to the post of\nPresident of the General Assembly of the United Nations\nat its forty-ninth session. I wish him much success in this\nhighly responsible mission.\nAt the same time, I should like to thank Mr. Essy\u2019s\npredecessor as President, His Excellency Ambassador\nInsanally, for his great personal contribution to the\nsuccess of the last session of the General Assembly.\nI also avail myself of this opportunity to express\ndeep appreciation of all the work and effort of the\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, as the head of the United Nations.\nAllow me to open my statement with a personal\nremark. During the past few years we have witnessed\ndynamic changes in world politics. The dynamism of\ndevelopment in international life is reflected in my\npersonal life. In the course of the past four years I have\nrepresented two States as their Ambassador to the United\nNations. Today I am honoured and proud to represent\none of them - my native country, Slovakia - as its\nMinister of Foreign Affairs. The fact that the Permanent\nRepresentative to the United Nations was nominated as\nthe Minister of Foreign Affairs of his country is yet\nanother manifestation of the respect that the United\nNations enjoys in Slovakia.\nThe fact that my country, less than two years after\nits admission to membership of the United Nations,\nbecame a full-fledged component of the community of\nnations is confirmation of the credibility of our foreign\npolicy, which is based on respect for international law and\nfor principles of democratic coexistence among nations.\nIt is also a result of the implementation of our foreign-\npolicy principles, which originate from the hierarchy of\nvalues of Slovak society. These values are characterized\nby respect for democracy, human rights and a free-market\neconomy.\nIt is evident that Slovakia, as a small country in the\ngeopolitically sensitive central European region, must\nhave a transparent and clearly defined orientation in its\n20\n\n\nforeign policy. We therefore aim our activities at European\nintegrationist trends and strive to join the stable, democratic\nand prosperous countries. Joining the European Union and\nparticipating actively in the elaboration of an efficient\nmodel of European security are among the main priorities\nof Slovak foreign policy.\nOur international contacts are, of course, much wider\nand are of a more multilateral character. We are interested\nin the best possible relations with neighbouring countries.\nI am glad to state that we have recently managed to fulfil\nthis aim successfully. We believe that subregional\narrangements, such as Visegrad 4 or the central European\ninitiative, also help to strengthen the stability of the whole\nregion. Close contacts with western European countries -\nand these are being strengthened in respect of economic,\npolitical and security matters - also contribute to the\nfulfilment of this objective.\nAt the global level, the priority of the Slovak\nRepublic, which is part of the European region, is the\nmaintenance of solid transatlantic relations through the\ndevelopment of intensive cooperation with the United States\nof America and Canada, both bilaterally and multilaterally.\nFurther, we consider the development of cooperation with\nour eastern neighbours - Ukraine, the Russian Federation\nand other countries - as being especially important.\nRegardless of the fact that Slovakia is a small central\nEuropean country, we strive to maintain and further develop\ngood relations and cooperation with the countries of Asia,\nAfrica, Latin America and the Pacific region.\nOur tasks and goals are very demanding, and their\nfulfilment depends on sufficient support from the public\nand on the consensus of the major political parties. I am\nglad to state that in Slovakia there is wide public and\npolitical agreement on the principal issues of our foreign\npolicy. This is a positive signal for foreign countries,\nwhich can count on Slovakia as a reliable partner.\nAs I indicated at the beginning of my statement,\ntoday\u2019s world is defined by dynamic changes that are due\nto the growing multipolarity of international relations.\nMany important events that occurred in the last year\nadvanced the international community towards achievement\nof the goals of the United Nations - to guarantee the\npeaceful coexistence of nations - but there have also been\nevents that cannot fill us with optimism.\nOne positive event has been the peace process in the\nMiddle East. Slovakia has supported this process from the\nvery beginning with the aim of reaching a comprehensive\nand final peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nThe conclusion of agreements between the State of Israel\nand the Palestine Liberation Organization on the provision\nof limited autonomy in the zone of the Gaza Strip and\nJericho, and the Jordan-Israeli declaration on terminating\nthe state of war, as well as on measures to settle mutual\nrelations, justified once more the peace efforts of the\nparties involved, as well as those of the international\ncommunity, which is convinced that peace can be restored\nin this region.\nWe also welcome the democratization of South\nAfrican society demonstrated by the elections in April of\nthis year. Though South Africa is far from Slovakia, we\nput special emphasis on the continuation of this\ndevelopment. The visit of the President of the Slovak\nRepublic to South Africa for the inauguration of President\nMandela is evidence of this.\nOn the other hand, even these positive examples will\nnot help us in successfully ending conflicts in other parts\nof the world. We are deeply concerned over the\ncontinuing conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina that is\ntaking place some 300 kilometres from our borders.\nSlovakia is among the countries that yearn for an end to\nthe continuing tragedy in that country. We wish to\nunderline the superiority of a political solution to a\nmilitary one, which by definition cannot eliminate the\nantagonism between the opposing sides.\nThe Slovak Republic, as a user of nuclear energy for\npeaceful purposes, is a State without nuclear weapons.\nWe therefore support a speedy signing of the\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. We wish to emphasize\nthat such a treaty should apply to all tests without\nexception and for an indefinite period, including tests for\npeaceful purposes. Sustaining the moratorium on nuclear\ntests by all members of the nuclear club is considered by\nSlovakia to be the main precondition for concluding such\na treaty, and at the same time, it is a clear sign of the real\nintentions of the nuclear club members.\nWe consider next year\u2019s Review Conference of the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to be closely linked to the\nnuclear-test ban. The NPT has been playing an important\nrole in the history of humanity, and has managed to stop\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons. We support\nunequivocally the unconditional and indefinite extension\nof the NPT.\nThe Slovak Republic appreciates the steps\nundertaken at the United Nations in the sphere of\n21\n\n\ntransparency in armaments, whether conventional or\nchemical and biological. We welcome the first positive\nuniversal step regarding conventional weapons: the\nestablishment of the Register of Conventional Arms.\nThe verification level of the existing multilateral\ntreaties is in most cases either inadequate or incomplete.\nMany of the multilateral treaties on arms control do not\ncontain verification clauses - and if they do contain such\nclauses, they do not make full use of verification, as in the\ncase of the NPT. I believe that the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction\nwill be a test case for a new type of multilateral treaty on\ndisarmament. The ratification of this agreement is among\nthe top priorities in the agenda of our Parliament.\nI can assure the Assembly that Slovakia is fulfilling\nresponsibly and in a timely manner the obligations\nconcerning confidence building, security, control of\narmaments and disarmament that have been undertaken at\nuniversal and regional negotiating forums. We firmly\nsupport all disarmament activities; hence we are well aware\nof the important role of the Conference on Disarmament in\nthis field. I would like to confirm the permanent interest of\nthe Slovak Republic in resolving the issue of its\nmembership in the Conference, since the former\nCzechoslovak federation was a founding member of the\nConference. It is truly a paradox that a country in which\narms production decreased to 9 per cent of its 1989 level is\nnot yet a member of the Conference.\nWe are aware of the need to improve existing\norganizational structures and strengthen cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and the Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as a regional\narrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United\nNations Charter. The CSCE continues to adapt to the new\nrealities. Slovakia, however, is of the opinion that the basic\ncharacter of the CSCE should not change. It should remain\na wide political forum and its basic principle - the adoption\nof decisions by consensus - should be maintained.\nPeace-keeping operations are currently at a level that\nis perhaps the highest that the international community can\nprovide and sustain. They drain our financial resources,\nwhile not even sparing human lives. The original\nenthusiasm for peace-keeping operations has gradually\ncooled down with the knowledge that there are many\nobstacles that the United Nations cannot overcome. The\ntragic situation in Rwanda, where even the presence of\nUnited Nations forces could not avert a civil war and\nmassacres, is a clear example. The United Nations peace-\nkeeping operation on the territory of the former\nYugoslavia has also encountered serious problems. The\nSlovak Republic has a contingent of 600 soldiers in the\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) -\nmembers of the engineering unit who among their\nmilitary tasks provide highly specialized expert work and\nassistance in restoring that country, which has suffered so\nmuch tribulation. Along with their efforts in the\nmaintenance of peace, they have undertaken the\ndangerous task of removing mines from the country.\nSlovakia strongly supports President Clinton\u2019s appeal\nin his statement before the General Assembly on Monday\nfor the conclusion of an agreement that would reduce the\nnumber and availability of anti-personnel land-mines. I\nwould like to mention that Slovakia, in accordance with\nresolution 48/75 K, has already implemented, on 17 April\n1994, a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-\nmines for an indefinite period.\nIn connection with United Nations efforts to resolve\nseveral problems that have arisen in the field of peace-\nkeeping operations, the Slovak Republic welcomes the\ndecision to establish stand-by forces that can be\ndispatched on short notice and under the command of the\nUnited Nations. We have declared our interest in\ncontributing to these units with engineers of the Slovak\nArmy. Such units need highly specialized and thorough\npreparation and training designed for specific purposes.\nMy country is in the process of building such a training\ncentre and has already used it to train more than 1,200\nmembers of United Nations peace-keeping forces since\nMay of this year.\nExperience has shown that the traditional type of\npeace-keeping operation is no longer sufficient. If a\npeace-keeping operation is to succeed it should contain a\nhumanitarian element. Slovakia is of the opinion that in\nany operation under United Nations auspices and with\nUnited Nations coordination it is necessary to respect the\nprinciple of the priority of United Nations command.\nIn connection with the increased number of attacks\nagainst United Nations personnel, the Slovak Republic\nappreciates the Assembly\u2019s decision at its forty-eighth\nsession to elaborate an international convention dealing\nwith the safety and security of United Nations and\nassociated personnel. The next step the United Nations\nshould consider is providing proper armament and other\nmat\u00e9riel for members of peace-keeping missions so that\nthey might be able to react more appropriately to\n22\n\n\nchanging conditions and if necessary be able to defend\nthemselves.\nThe Slovak Republic respects human rights and\nwelcomes all international initiatives which could bring\nresults in this sphere. We highly appreciate the\ncommencement of the activities of the High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights. We believe that this post will be an\nactive United Nations instrument to guarantee the protection\nof human rights, especially where they are most flagrantly\nviolated. At the beginning of 1994 we opened the Slovak\nNational Centre for Human Rights in Bratislava. In this\nconnection, I wish to express our gratitude to the\nNetherlands for its assistance in establishing this institution.\nThe gravity of the problem of refugees continues to\nincrease. I express the hope that the United Nations will\nnot underestimate this problem and that the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will no\nlonger have to fight financial problems in future.\nThe Slovak Republic supports the reform of the United\nNations. It considers the revitalization and restructuring of\nthe Security Council to be one of the crucial issues. We\nhope that the solution adopted will increase the efficiency\nof the Security Council and will contribute to the overall\nstrengthening of the United Nations. We are of the opinion\nthat new permanent members of the Security Council must\nhave a global responsibility and be able to meet the ensuing\nfinancial obligations.\nWhen the mandate of the Security Council is fulfilled\nand sanctions are implemented, more attention should be\npaid to possible adverse impacts on third countries. We are\nconvinced that effective mechanisms of assistance to\naffected third countries should be seriously considered and\nestablished as soon as possible.\nSlovakia encounters many problems connected with\nthe transformation of society. It is crucial to solve the\neconomic and social issues of a transition process\nunprecedented in scale and method. The United Nations,\nwith its organs and specialized agencies, has an\nirreplaceable role in assisting their solution.\nI should now like to give some facts on the economic\nsituation of the Slovak Republic. Now that the first, basic\nsteps of transformation have been taken, the main goal of\nthe Slovak economy is to create permanent macroeconomic\nstability and conditions for substantial economic growth in\nthe years to come. My country, with 5.3 million\ninhabitants and with exports about 50 per cent of gross\ndomestic product, can be considered a small, open\neconomy. The Slovak Government is concentrating on\nspeeding up those reforms which should result in the\nquick transformation of ownership relations.\nConsiderable progress has been made in macroeconomic\nstabilization in the first six months of 1994. Real gross\ndomestic product has increased by 4.4 per cent. The\nState budget deficit represents only 3.8 per cent of gross\ndomestic product, and is considered a positive indicator.\nThanks to cooperation with, and assistance from, the\nInternational Monetary Fund, the foreign currency\nreserves of the Central Bank have increased. These data\nare considered to be the first sign of economic revival.\nEconomic cooperation and, within its framework,\ninternational assistance are prerequisites for further\ndevelopment of economies in transition. United Nations\norgans and specialized agencies cooperate intensively with\nmy Government. Thanks to this cooperation, the\neconomic situation is substantially better than had been\nanticipated, and the Slovak Republic has become an\naccepted international partner in economic cooperation.\nThe Slovak Republic welcomes the increased\nattention by, and efforts of, the United Nations aimed at\nbringing the issues of development and economic\ncooperation to the foreground. We hope that the agenda\nfor development will initiate concrete steps in this sphere.\nWe particularly appreciate the efforts of the United\nNations in helping to resolve problems and difficulties\nencountered by the countries transforming their\neconomies, and we are of the opinion that within the\nUnited Nations framework there are more opportunities to\nfacilitate and speed up the integration of these economies\ninto the world economy.\nIn the past decade the number of least developed\ncountries has increased horrendously. This results in an\nurgent appeal to all mankind, but especially the\nindustrially developed countries. However, at the same\ntime we cannot avoid the primary responsibility of the\nleast developed countries for their own destiny. The\nSlovak Republic offers assistance, within its own means\nand possibilities, especially through the participation of\nSlovak experts in development programmes - for\nexample, in education and health care. Slovakia is\nprepared to engage in organizational work for the\nInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty, 1996.\nI should also like to emphasize the importance of the\nrecently concluded International Conference on Population\nand Development, held in Cairo. The fact that it\n23\n\n\nsucceeded in reaching an agreement and adopting the Final\nDocument is a signal that the international community is\naware of its responsibility for global issues of humanity,\nand that international conferences and discussions are the\nonly right battlefield for the solution of problems, no matter\nhow sensitive and complicated they may be.\nAs can be seen from the facts I have set out, Slovakia,\nas one of the youngest Members of the United Nations,\nwishes not only to \\\"take\\\", but also intends to be actively\ninvolved in United Nations programmes, and has the\ncapabilities. My country has much to offer developing\ncountries. Slovak experts, with their know-how and\nexperience, are prepared actively to participate in United\nNations development programmes. Slovak products and\ntechnologies tested under demanding conditions could\ncontribute to the efficiency of these development\nprogrammes. In the sphere of the development of human\nresources, Slovakia, with a long tradition in this field, offers\na variety of courses at universities.\nMy country has a difficult task to carry out:\ntransformation of the economy. The United Nations also\nhas a difficult task; that of adapting itself to the new\nrealities and adjusting its structure and activities\naccordingly. I wish to assure the Assembly that the Slovak\nRepublic is prepared to do its utmost to carry out the first\ntask and to participate actively in the activities of the\nUnited Nations.\nI wish to conclude my statement by wishing much\nsuccess to this year\u2019s session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to occupy the presidential chair of the forty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations on\nbehalf of Africa.\nDespite the great difficulties we are experiencing\ntoday, we can see encouraging signs for the future. The\ngreat progress made during the preparatory work for the\nWorld Summit for Social Development and the World\nConference on Women gives rise to new hope for the\ncreation of a new international order.\nOur countries and our Organization face new\nchallenges that require creative and innovative responses if\nwe are to make progress and avoid the danger of reversing\nthe headway that has been made since the end of the cold\nwar.\nWhen I began my term of office in 1990, I faced the\nenormous task of rescuing my country from war and\nrestoring faith in democracy to thousands of Nicaraguans.\nI had a great dream: that we the peoples that had been able\nto free ourselves from dictatorships of one kind or another\ncould unite and help one another, reconstructing democracy\nin our countries, and that all of us together could then begin\na great march away from totalitarian and authoritarian\nforms of government towards democracy.\nIn July my dream became reality when the Second\nInternational Conference of New or Restored Democracies\nwas held in Managua, with participants, observers, special\nguests and international organizations from more than 70\ncountries from four continents.\nIn the Managua declaration, representatives to this\nSecond International Conference expressed their\nconviction that democracy is the only system that allows\nfor a free, firm and steadfast union of nations for peace.\nWe also agreed that the consolidation of democratic\nprocesses was a key factor in guaranteeing peace and\ninternational security.\nThe Managua declaration clearly establishes the\nessential ties between democracy and social and economic\ndevelopment, and between democracy and citizen\nparticipation.\nIt should also be stressed that the Managua\nDeclaration states the following: that the future of the\nnew and restored democracies as well as the future of\npeace are linked to the international community\u2019s\nresponse to such matters as external debt, protectionism\nin developed countries, insufficient concessional funds\navailable for development, poverty, and the impact on\nlow-income groups of economic adjustment processes.\nThe plan of action approved by the Conference\npromotes modalities for cooperation that take into account\nthe particular features of the new or restored democracies\nand the promotion of internal commitments in each\ncountry to strengthen democracy. In Nicaragua we have\nalready created a permanent forum for democracy and\npeace in which wide sectors of the civilian population\nparticipate.\nOn behalf of the new or restored democracies, I\nwould like to take this opportunity to make a request of\nthe United Nations Secretary-General that, in accordance\nwith the established procedures and during this session of\nthe General Assembly, a decision be taken to undertake\na study on the ways in which the United Nations could\nsupport the efforts of Governments to consolidate new or\nrestored democracies.\nI would like to appeal to the countries represented\nhere to give special attention to the difficulties we are\nnow facing during this fragile transition process, as we\nare attempting to consolidate democracy; we appeal to\nthem to support our efforts and the commitments made in\nour plan of action.\nWe cannot allow our dreams and the great sacrifices\nand suffering of millions of people who struggled for\nliberty to be in vain.\n9\n\n\nIt is with great sadness that we see the gap between\nrich and poor countries dangerously increasingly rather than\ndiminishing. According to the United Nations report on\nhuman development, more than one billion people in the\nworld are still languishing in abject poverty. In 1960, the\nrichest 20 per cent of the world\u2019s population had an income\n30 times greater than that of the poorest 20 per cent. By\n1990, the gap had deepened: by then the richest\n20 per cent had incomes 60 times greater and 20 per cent\nof humanity receives 80 per cent of the world\u2019s income.\nAs pointed out in this year\u2019s report on human\ndevelopment, in places where world trade is entirely free\nand open, those benefiting are in general the strongest.\nDeveloping countries enter the market as unequal partners\nand end up with unequal rewards.\nA large percentage of the new or restored democracies\nare to be found among the poorest countries. As a\nconsequence, they are excluded from the benefits of\ndevelopment. We must all work together to change this\nsituation.\nToday Central America is one of the best examples of\nthe new wave of democracy. Democracy is now\nestablished is all of our countries. In less than a year, we\nhave had four free elections in our region that produced\nnew Governments. Respect for civil and political rights has\nbeen strengthened; conditions which enable more people to\nenjoy economic, social and cultural rights have been created\nand civil power is prevailing over military power. Respect\nfor and protection of human rights is increasing. We are\ngradually becoming a region of peace, liberty, democracy\nand development.\nNext October, the Central American countries will\nsign the Alliance for Sustainable Development. This\nAlliance is a major effort at the political, social, economic\nand environmental levels to create a new and improved\ndevelopment model which can preserve the resources and\nway of life of future generations in Central America.\nOnce again, I would like to thank organizations and\ncountries that have provided continuous and valuable\nsupport to Nicaragua and Central America. They have\nmade resources available, and have helped find new and\nefficient solutions for establishing and consolidating peace\nwhile achieving sustainable human development. We are\ncertain that this spirit of cooperation will be manifested\nonce again at the International Conference on Peace and\nDevelopment in Central America, to be held in Honduras.\nLast year, before the General Assembly, I made a\ndetailed presentation on the political and economic\nsituation of my country, and about our real prospects.\nMy country has made great efforts to attain a\nmacroeconomic balance and at the same time establish a\nfirm foundation for sustainable development.\nWe have made substantial progress in the last four\nyears in improving public finance. We have significantly\nreduced inflation, re-established relations with foreign-\ndebt holders and multilateral agencies, and implemented\nstructural adjustment reforms.\nThe success of this difficult programme and the\nattainment of sustainable development will depend, to a\nlarge extent, on our ability to promote production and\ninvestment, to increase employment and improve the\nquality of life for our people, and on the quality of the\ninternational support we receive.\nIn order to consolidate and deepen the democratic\nprocess in Nicaragua, this September I approved the law\non military organization. This new law clearly establishes\nthat the armed forces are subordinate to civil power. The\narmed forces have now been transformed into a small,\nnon-partisan, efficient body, appropriate to the transition\nperiod in Nicaraguan society.\nIn compliance with the General Assembly resolution\ndeclaring the celebration of this year as the International\nYear of the Family, we have established a national\ncommission to coordinate the efforts of different\ngovernment and social agencies to support the family as\nthe main nucleus of society and the main agent for the\ntransmission and development of values such as the\ncommon good, equality and mutual respect.\nWithin the framework of the strengthening of the\nfamily, I wish to reiterate once again our commitment to\ngiving the highest priority to the protection and\ndevelopment of children. We made this commitment at\nthe World Summit for Children in September 1990.\nAlso, taking into account our commitment to respect\nfor, and to the observance of, human rights, my\nGovernment will create an office of ombudsman in\nNicaragua.\nAs we approach the next millennium, humanity still\nfaces critical questions that threaten our societies and our\ndevelopment. We cannot, however, deny that substantial\n10\n\n\nadvances are being made to remove the main sources of\nconflict that linger in various continents.\nFor this reason we welcome with great satisfaction the\nsigning of the agreements concluded between the\nGovernments of Israel and of Jordan and between Israel\nand Palestine. This will help to improve security and\nstability in the Middle East.\nAt the same time, we welcome the efforts being made\nto reach a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.\nNicaragua rejoices greatly in the inauguration of the\nnew democratic and non-racist Government in South Africa.\nThis augurs well for a new era of prosperity and peace for\nthe whole population of that brotherly country and for\nsouthern Africa.\nWe support the strengthening of democracy in\nMozambique. Thus Nicaraguans will participate in the\nUnited Nations mission to observe next October\u2019s elections.\nIt is still necessary to promote new international\ninitiatives in the search for a definitive political solution to\nthe situation in the former Yugoslavia and to the sad events\nin Rwanda that continue so to shake the world\u2019s\nconscience. This requires wider and stronger mechanisms\nfor humanitarian protection, as well as for regional security.\nI should like to make special mention of the crisis in\nHaiti. Nicaragua welcomes with satisfaction the diplomatic\nway out and the negotiated solution to the Haitian crisis.\nAll available peaceful means should be used to guarantee\nreconciliation among the long-suffering people of Haiti, as\nwell as and the re-establishment of constitutional order.\nFinally, we believe that, within the new international\norder, it is necessary for the United Nations to recognize\nthe rights of the Republic of China in Taiwan, within the\nframework of universal participation and respect for human\nrights.\nI feel sure that the future will not conceal from us the\ngreat difficulties that humanity still faces. We must work\ntogether, with what we have at hand, to make this world a\nmore dignified place for all of us, regardless of race, creed\nor political belief, to live in.\nNext year we shall celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe founding of the United Nations. We hope that the\nSecurity Council, at its summit meeting of Heads of State\nto be held in New York on that occasion, will adopt some\nimportant decisions, particularly with regard to\nrestructuring of the Security Council to provide for\nequitable geographical representation and an increase in\nthe number of members.\nI wish, on behalf of the people of Nicaragua and on\nbehalf of the new or restored democracies that\nparticipated in the conference in Managua, to reaffirm our\ndeep commitment to contributing to the development of\na world society inspired by progress, liberty, democracy\nand peace.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am delighted\nto begin by congratulating you and your country, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at this session. I also wish to thank your\ndistinguished predecessor, Ambassador Insanally.\nLet me also take this opportunity to congratulate the\nSovereign Military Order of Malta on its admission to\nObserver status in the General Assembly.\nMy statement fully endorses and follows on that of\nthe German Foreign Minister, who spoke in his capacity\nas Chairman of the European Council.\n6\n\n\nFrom the very beginning of its membership in the\nUnited Nations Italy\u2019s foreign policy has been guided by its\nactive support for the Organization\u2019s principles and\nfunctions. Our contributions to United Nations\ndeliberations, peace-keeping operations and aid through\nmultilateral channels are tangible proof of Italy\u2019s faith in\nthe project drawn up at San Francisco almost 50 years ago.\nOur newly elected Government will remain steadfast\nin this approach to supporting the United Nations and\nbuilding upon the historic opportunities offered by the new\ninternational situation. Let me emphasize that, now more\nthan ever, Italy is firmly committed to fostering personal,\npolitical, and economic freedom, protecting individual rights\nand liberties and enforcing the rule of law. These are the\npreconditions for peace and prosperity and the reasons why\nItaly is presenting its candidature to the Security Council\nfor the period 1995-1996.\nUnfortunately, the hopes that were kindled by the end\nof the cold war, with its promises of peace and stability,\nhave not been met in international reality. At the same\ntime, there is little doubt that today we are facing fewer\nglobal risks, despite local conflicts, intolerance and racial\nand ethnic strife. It is thus our task to embark on a new\nage of cooperation, democracy and development, in which\nthe United Nations must play a central role. Today, the\nGeneral Assembly can become the link between\nexpectations and commitment.\nItaly will continue to play its part in peace-keeping, as\nit is already doing in eight different missions, including\nlogistical support for the operation in former Yugoslavia\nand training centres and permanent bases for peace-keeping\nforces on its territory. The new United Nations base in\nBrindisi is particularly significant in this regard.\nHowever, we cannot ignore the high costs of the\nproliferation of primarily internal conflicts. The budget for\npeace-keeping operations currently amounts to\napproximately $3 billion, three times the regular budget of\nthe Organization. The Presidency of the European Union\nhas noted this particular aspect of peace-keeping operations.\nWe must strengthen preventive diplomacy in order to avoid\nover-extending our capabilities, becoming ineffective and\nrisking financial collapse.\nIn the wake of the crisis in Rwanda, my Government\nis promoting the establishment of a task force for rapid\nintervention in humanitarian emergencies. This matter is\nnow being considered in the appropriate forums and the\nresults will be presented to the United Nations. I welcome\nthe support expressed for an emergency humanitarian\ninstrument by the Presidents of the United States, the\nRussian Federation and Argentina, and believe that our\nideas and proposals follow the same orientation.\nEntrusting peace-keeping functions to regional\norganizations is another option for crisis management.\nMy Government has moved consistently in this direction\nat the national level and in its capacity as\nChairman-in-Office of the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE).\nItaly attaches particular importance to an effective\nand efficient functioning of the Security Council. The\nmatter of equitable representation on the Security Council\nand of increasing its membership requires thorough\nexamination. To this end, Italy has submitted one of the\nmost realistic and comprehensive proposals to the Ad Hoc\nWorking Group. We hope that the General Assembly\nwill reach a consensus on the methods and timetable for\na truly equitable reform.\nMany members question whether the pre-eminence\nthe Organization has given to peace-keeping in recent\nyears has not drained the other fundamental objectives of\nthe United Nations - namely, economic and social\ndevelopment - of initiative and resources. The\nSecretary-General has wisely acknowledged these\nconcerns in his recent agenda for development.\nMr. Seniloli (Fiji), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nAs that document states, peace is only one of the\ndimensions of development. The others are the economy,\nthe environment, justice and democracy. To the extent\nthat democracy protects and promotes personal liberty and\neconomic freedom, it has a decisive impact on\ndevelopment by encouraging the strongest force behind\neconomic growth and personal development - individual\ncreativity. A prosperous democracy will be free of the\ninternal tensions that have caused so many of today\u2019s\nconflicts. The United Nations will foster a more peaceful\nworld by promoting freedom and justice in addition to\ncontinuing its peace-keeping functions.\nIn today\u2019s world, the issue of trade is of paramount\nimportance. As I like to say, trade unites us; politics\ndivides us. At the Naples Summit, Italy, in its present\ncapacity as Chairman of the G-7, strongly advocated the\nfurther dismantling of barriers to world trade in order to\nfoster the creation of wealth. We are convinced that the\nleaders of the free world must avoid squandering the\nunique opportunity for world peace and prosperity offered\n7\n\n\nby current historic developments. They must resist the\npressure of interest groups and be ready to serve the\ngeneral interests of their nations and the nations of the\nworld, which today more than ever require the opening of\nmarkets and the liberalization of trade. This will be the\nrole of the World Trade Organization.\nIn this spirit, we endorse the principles of the agenda\nfor development and are ready to help establish the\nguidelines for their implementation. The fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations Charter will provide an\nopportunity for fostering such a process.\nI should now like to address the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly in my capacity as Chairman-in-Office of\nthe CSCE. We are actively promoting peaceful solutions\nto several regional crises. In the former Yugoslavia we are\nengaged in restoring long-term missions, appointing\nOmbudsmen for the Bosnian Federation, instituting a CSCE\nmission in Sarajevo and admitting The Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia to the CSCE.\nWe have lent our good offices to Ukraine, where a\nCSCE mission will be instituted, and to Georgia for the\ncrises in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The CSCE\nPresidency has also worked towards facilitating the\nwithdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic States and\nfinding a solution to the problems of citizenship and status\nof non-citizens in that area. Through the local CSCE\nmissions, the CSCE Presidency is also attempting to foster\na political solution to the Moldova-Trans-Dniester and\nTajikistan crises, while it actively supports the efforts of the\nChairman of the Conference on Nagorny Karabakh,\nAmbassador Eliasson.\nAt the 1992 Helsinki Summit the CSCE declared itself\nto be a regional arrangement under Chapter VIII of the\nUnited Nations Charter and adopted specific guidelines on\npeace-keeping. The ministerial meetings in Stockholm and\nRome led to the United Nations-CSCE Framework\nAgreement in March 1993 and to the CSCE\u2019s being granted\nobserver status at the United Nations. My recent letter to\nthe Secretary-General on developing and strengthening\ncooperation between the CSCE and the United Nations was\na follow-up to these decisions, as was the establishment of\nrelations between the CSCE and numerous United Nations\nagencies working in areas of common concern. One\nspecific proposal is to attribute primary responsibility to the\nCSCE for issues concerning stability and security in its\narea, without impinging on the statutory powers of the\nSecurity Council.\nPeace-keeping is an area that requires closer\ncooperation. The two Organizations should adopt a\nstandard set of principles for the peace-keeping activities\nundertaken by individual States or third parties.\nI should like to address the European Presidency\u2019s\nstatement and memorandum on our current international\npolicies, limiting myself to those issues which more\nclosely concern Italy for historical and geographical\nreasons.\nItaly warmly welcomes the acceptance by the\nCroatian-Muslim federation and the Serbian-Montenegran\nfederation of the peace plan submitted to them on 6 July.\nThat plan provides a realistic solution to territorial\ndisputes and constitutional issues and ensures that Bosnia\nand Herzegovina will retain its international identity.\nUnfortunately, the repeated rejection of the plan by the\nBosnian Serb leadership is a source of deep\ndisappointment. This has made tougher sanctions against\nPale inevitable in order to force it to reconsider its\nposition.\nThe partial lifting of sanctions against Belgrade,\nwhich we have advocated from the beginning, will\nencourage the Serbian Government to pursue its new,\nmore constructive policy. This includes the agreement to\nallow international monitors to ensure the effective\nsealing of the border between Serbia and Bosnia. In our\nongoing commitment to find a solution to the intractable\ncrisis in Bosnia, we have been trying to involve other\nimportant international forums, starting with the G-7,\nenlarged to include Russia, in joint efforts to foster a\npolitical solution.\nWith regard to the Middle East, Italy welcomed the\nsigning of the Cairo Accords, concluded on 4 May, which\nauthorized the start of self-government in Gaza and\nJericho. We also salute the subsequent transfer to the\nPalestinian authorities of jurisdiction over the issues\ncovered in the Washington Agreements. Italy is pleased\nto have contributed to the resumption of negotiations that\nled to the Cairo Accords, through our participation in the\ninternational temporary presence in Hebron to implement\nSecurity Council resolution 904 (1994). Italy reaffirms its\ncommitment to contributing politically and economically\nto the reconstruction of the Palestinian territories. The\nIsraeli-Jordan Accords of 25 July represent a milestone in\nthe construction of a new Middle East on the basis of\npeace and cooperation. We hope that all these\ndevelopments will stimulate progress in other negotiations\nbetween Israel and its neighbours.\n8\n\n\nIn the Mediterranean basin, serious instabilities and\ntensions are spreading. Italy intends to make its efforts to\nensure that this region sets an example of tolerance,\neconomic cooperation and democracy.\nAs one of the main architects of the peace process in\nMozambique, Italy is pleased with the progress achieved in\nrecent months. Elections are now set for 27 and 28\nOctober this year. We will continue to collaborate with the\nUnited Nations and other donor countries in the\nreconstruction of Mozambique. We also hope that regional\ncooperation in southern Africa will help improve economic\nconditions in Mozambique, thereby strengthening the\nprocess of peace and democratization. We hope that\nMozambique will become another United Nations success\nstory, like the peace-keeping operations in Namibia,\nCambodia, El Salvador, Guatemala and elsewhere.\nWe would also like to encourage the trends towards\nre-establishing peace in Angola on the basis of the Peace\nAccords and the pertinent Security Council resolutions.\nAn area that has seen great progress in recent years is\nthe further strengthening of disarmament and non-\nproliferation. The implementation of existing agreements\nis a difficult task for our diplomacies, but the drive towards\nmore advanced forms of disarmament and arms control is\nrelentless. We look forward confidently to negotiations to\nban nuclear testing and to halt the production of fissionable\nmaterial. Progress in this field should also contribute to the\nindefinite and unconditional extension of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty.\nWith regard to conventional weapons, I wish to take\nthis opportunity formally to announce the terms of Italy\u2019s\nmoratorium on the export of anti-personnel mines. The\nmoratorium will apply to all transfers and be applied until\nnew international regulations become effective. This\ncommitment imposes an economic cost, but one that my\ncountry is willing to pay. We urge all Member States to\nadopt similar national moratoriums until the international\nregime has been finalized.\nBut let us not forget that conflicts, especially internal\nones, are also created through the violation of fundamental\nhuman rights. That is why we are in favour of\nstrengthening the mechanisms to monitor and protect those\nrights by fully implementing the High Commissioner\u2019s\nmandate and strengthening the Centre for Human Rights.\nWhen these rights are seriously violated, despite all\nefforts, we are in favour of recourse to a fair judicial\nprocess. In the same spirit with which we welcomed and\ncontributed to the International Tribunal on crimes\ncommitted in the former Yugoslavia, we support the\ncreation of an international criminal court for the\nadjudication of all violations of human rights, wherever\nthey may occur. This court must be allowed to inflict the\nappropriate punishment, with the exception of the death\npenalty, which Italy has consistently opposed. We are\nparticularly pleased that, after years of hard work, the\nInternational Law Commission has completed a draft\nstatute for the court, and look forward to contributing to\nthe Assembly\u2019s debate on the matter.\nThe strengthening of international security is closely\nrelated to the fight against terrorism and organized crime.\nFrom 21 to 23 November this year, Italy will be hosting\nin Naples the ministerial World Conference on Organized\nTransnational Crime, under the auspices of the Crime\nPrevention and Criminal Justice Branch of the United\nNations.\nItaly is also actively participating in the preparation\nof the World Summit for Social Development, to be held\nin Copenhagen in March 1995, by contributing its\nexperience in the three crucial issues on the agenda:\ncombating poverty, unemployment and discrimination.\nWe live in an exciting but complex world. Few of\nus would disagree with the comment of Alfonso the Wise,\nKing of Castile, a medieval patron of astronomy, who is\nquoted as saying, in effect, \\\"If the Lord Almighty had\nconsulted me before embarking on the Creation, I would\nhave recommended something simpler.\\\"\nWhile rereading the first address Italy delivered to\nthis Assembly at the eleventh session, I was deeply\nmoved, and not only because it was given by my father.\nRereading it, it made poignantly clear the far-reaching\nchanges since 1956, both on the international scene -\nfrom decolonization to the end of the cold war - and on\nthe Italian domestic political scene. In that address, he\ndefined the United Nations as\n\\\"the most complete expression of that education of\nthe human race, acquired, as Lessing said, through\nsuffering and error\\\". (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Eleventh Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 588th meeting, para. 94)\nAnd today, so many years later, it is an honour for\nme to reaffirm the same profound conviction and to\npledge to this Assembly the total dedication of Italy and\nits Government to the ideals embodied in the United\nNations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "Please allow me\nto begin by congratulating Mr. Amara-Essy, on behalf of\nthe Government of the Republic of Angola, on my own\nbehalf and on behalf of my delegation, on his election to\nthe presidency of this forty-ninth session of the United\nNations General Assembly. We are fully convinced that his\ndiplomatic experience and dedication to the noble ideals of\nour Organization will ensure the success of the Assembly\u2019s\nproceedings at this session. I wish to assure him of my\ndelegation\u2019s full cooperation.\nI should also like to express our appreciation to your\npredecessor, His Excellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally,\nfor his proven dedication and skill in conducting the\nactivities of the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nI also wish to express the profound gratitude of the\npeople and Government of the Republic of Angola to the\nSecretary-General for his skill, energy and tenacity, and for\nall his efforts in the search for solutions to the innumerable\nand serious problems afflicting the peoples of our planet.\nThe history we are witnessing today clearly shows a\nflagrant betrayal of many peoples\u2019 expectations of a better\nworld following the end of the cold war. We had all hoped\nfor, and anticipated, life in a better world of peace and\nprosperity. Instead, we are witnessing the proliferation of\ninternal conflicts, with such tragic consequences, and we\nsee no visible signs of any immediate satisfactory and\nlasting solutions, despite the efforts of this Organization.\nWith the end of the cold war and ideological\nconfrontation, the African continent has witnessed during\nthe past five years a vast expansion of democracy, which\nhas contributed to the revival of hope for the prosperity and\nwell-being of the African peoples, still suffering the\neconomic backwardness bequeathed by colonialism.\nHowever, Africa continues to be the continent most\naffected by the proliferation of war and political instability.\nIt is sufficient to mention as examples the conflicts in\nRwanda, Somalia, Liberia, Burundi and my own country.\nSimilar problems are occurring in many other parts\nof the world, which indicates the need for an immediate\nintensification of efforts by the international community,\nand in particular for increased participation by the United\nNations, to find a negotiated, just and acceptable formula\nto protect the legitimate interests of peoples.\nThe United Nations must define universal guidelines\nto prevent the application of differing criteria to the\nsolution of various conflicts. In other words, in order to\nmaintain the credibility of our Organization, all crises and\nconflicts must be given fair and equal treatment. This\nunderlines the urgent need to restructure United Nations\nprocedures in order to make the existing mechanisms for\nthe prevention and management of conflicts compatible\nwith the realities of our time.\nWith respect to human rights, the United Nations\nshould continue to play an active role in order to prevent\ntheir continuing to be jeopardized. The recent\nestablishment of the post of High Commissioner for\nhuman rights by the General Assembly was an important\nstep forward in this sense.\nThe Republic of Angola reaffirms that human rights\nand fundamental freedoms are universal, and that their\npromotion and protection should be ensured on the basis\nof equality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity.\nThe human rights issue cannot and should not be used as\na political weapon or a pretext for interference in the\ninternal affairs of States.\nAngola follows with interest and satisfaction the\npositive developments taking place in some regions of the\nworld, where solutions are being found to conflicts that\nhad seemed endless. In the Middle East, for example, the\ndetermination of the Palestinian people and the political\ncourage of the present Government of Israel have\ncontributed to the climate of reduced tension that led to\nthe historic agreement, signed in Washington, for the\nautonomy of Gaza and Jericho - territories illegally\noccupied in the past.\nWe appeal to the international community to make\nevery effort to ensure strict compliance with the\nagreement, and success for it, by providing all possible\nhelp to the Palestinian people for the reconstruction and\nsocio-economic development of the embryonic Palestinian\nState.\n42\n\n\nIt would not be immoderate to once again hail the\ncourage and determination demonstrated by President\nYasser Arafat and by Mr. Shimon Peres.\nWe encourage the Government of Israel to continue\nthe contacts already initiated with the countries of the\nregion with a view to achieving peace and harmony in the\narea.\nIn southern Africa, we laud the courage and\ndetermination of the people of South Africa, which led to\nthe fall of the inhuman and anachronistic apartheid regime.\nToday we rejoice to see the people of South Africa free at\nlast. We again greet the new South Africa, led by\nPresident Mandela, this different South Africa, which\nemerged from a democratic election, whose results were\naccepted by all the political forces in the country.\nWe warmly congratulate the new South African\nauthorities and welcome them to our Organization. We\nalso pay tribute to the peoples of southern Africa, who\nmade so many sacrifices before toppling the dreadful\napartheid regime.\nAngola, which was the main victim of innumerable\nattacks, suffering enormous loss of human life and\ndestruction of social and economic infrastructures, because\nof the support we gave to the brotherly people of South\nAfrica, has reason to ask here and now whether the\nresolutions of this Assembly and of the Security Council\nregarding compensation to my country will now be\nimplemented.\nIn Mozambique, we welcome and encourage the\nGovernment\u2019s commitment to organize democratic\nelections, and we urge RENAMO and other political forces\nto respond with an equal commitment to the success of the\nprocess, leading to lasting peace in that country. However,\nthe United Nations, in particular, and the international\ncommunity, in general, have an important role to play in\nensuring the attainment of the main objectives: peace,\ndemocracy and prosperity.\nIn Liberia, we are encouraged by the positive\ndevelopments and by the dialogue that is taking place\nbetween the parties involved. Angola encourages the\ncontinuation of such dialogue and urges the parties to truly\ncommit themselves to the search for a lasting peace.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Angola urges the\nparties involved to apply the United Nations peace plan\nstrictly and to adhere scrupulously to the mechanisms\nestablished for that purpose, which have the full support\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and we\nencourage the parties to enter into direct dialogue to\nfacilitate progress.\nIn Rwanda, the easing of political and military\nupheavals notwithstanding, a precarious socio-\nhumanitarian situation prevails. Angola expresses its\nsolidarity with the brotherly people of Rwanda. We\nconsider that the international community should continue\nto play an important role in solving the crisis in Rwanda\nand in maintaining the peace and tranquillity of its\npeoples.\nIn Somalia, in spite of the commitment demonstrated\nby the international community, we do not foresee an end\nto the armed conflict in the near future, because of the\nlack of consensus between the parties involved. Angola\nconsiders that our Organization should continue to assume\nits responsibility in the maintenance of world peace and\nsecurity, which are threatened in that part of Africa, and\nwe appeal to the common sense of the parties to\ncooperate with the United Nations in the efforts to\nre-establish peace in that country.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, in spite of the enormous\nefforts by the international community to restore peace,\nprofound differences still remain, and this contributes to\nthe continuation of the conflict. We therefore urge the\nparties and the international community to continue their\nefforts to find a lasting solution that is acceptable to the\nparties involved. Finally, we salute the Government of\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for its efforts to that\nend.\nWith regard to the Korean peninsula, Angola\nencourages the efforts towards reunification and salutes\nthe positive signs registered in the dialogue between the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United\nStates of America.\nAngola is following with concern the situation in\nEast Timor. The international community has witnessed\nthe serious and persistent violations of human-rights to\nwhich the suffering people of East Timor have been\nsubjected. Angola considers that there is a fundamental\nproblem to be resolved first. Here, I refer to\ndecolonization and to respect for the rights of the peoples\nof this territory - mainly, their right to self-determination.\nWe therefore urge the Government of Indonesia to\nrecognize the legitimate right of the people of East Timor\nto self-determination and independence and to cooperate\n43\n\n\nwith Portugal, as the administering Power, and with the\nUnited Nations towards fulfilment of the wishes of the\nMaubere people.\nThe current situation in Cuba, following the tightening\nof the economic embargo, should be one of the main\nconcerns at this session of the General Assembly, as its\ndirect victims are the populations of island.\nThe General Assembly\u2019s adoption of resolutions 47/19\nand 48/16 clearly demonstrates that the economic,\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba is\ncontrary to the principles of international law and the\nCharter of the United Nations. For this reason, and in\nparticular because of the extraterritorial application of that\nunilateral measure, Angola condemns it.\nAs we add our voice to those of all who seek an end\nto the embargo imposed against Cuba we are convinced that\nonly through dialogue - never by adopting drastic and\ninhuman measures such as I have mentioned - can disputes\nbe resolved. We therefore encourage the continuance of\ndialogue between the two countries towards the resolution\nof their differences within the framework of the Charter of\nthe United Nations.\nThe international strategy for development for the\nyears 1991-2000, which was adopted in December 1991,\nbrought hope to the international community, which has\nregarded the effective implementation of this new strategy\nas the solution to the socio-economic problems of our\nplanet. Today, three years having elapsed, a certain\nscepticism is shaking our initial convictions.\nThe Republic of Angola considers that the role played\nby the international economic institutions - bodies such as\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,\nthe World Trade Organization and the General Agreement\non Tariffs and Trade - is of vital importance. In the fight\nagainst trade barriers, these bodies create enormous\nopportunities for developing countries to participate in the\ndevelopment of the world market. The heavy and painful\nburden of external debt dating back to 1982 leads us to\nbelieve that the efforts of all are necessary if we are to find\nmedium- and long-term solutions.\nEqually, special attention must be given to the issues\nof sustainable development. This necessarily implies\nimplementation of the objectives of the Rio summit and the\nhonouring of commitments assumed thereafter by the\nindustrialized countries.\nThe data included in the reports presented to the\nCairo Conference on Population and Development\ndemonstrate that the social situation throughout the world\nis assuming almost alarming proportions. The fact that\nthe world\u2019s population is now 5.5 billion and that the\nmajority of these people live in absolute poverty\nconvinces us of the urgent need to adopt, during the\nforthcoming World Summit for Social Development, a\nconcerted plan of action calling for measures to counter\nthe increasing deterioration in their social condition. We\ntherefore reiterate our firm belief in the legitimacy of the\ngoals set out in the document entitled \\\"African Common\nPosition on Human and Social Development in Africa\\\".\nHaving made a few comments on the main problems\nthat affect all of us in one way or another, I should like\nto make a brief reference to the situation in my country.\nRepresentatives will probably recall that, following\nUNITA\u2019s rejection of the results of the democratic\nelections in 1992, which the international community\nmonitored and judged to have been free and fair, UNITA\nresorted to war, with the objective of taking power by\nforce of arms, contrary to the spirit of the Bicesse\nAccord, of which this Organization is a signatory and\nwhich served as the basis for the electoral process.\nThe situation created by the resumption of war\nrapidly degenerated into a real catastrophe, jeopardizing\nthe country\u2019s territorial integrity and forcing the legitimate\ngovernment to take defensive measures to prevent the\nrealization of UNITA\u2019s intentions.\nIn spite all the efforts of the Angolan Government\nand of the international community, and as a result of this\nwar, imposed on the people of Angola by the militaristic\nwing of Mr. Savimbi\u2019s UNITA, Angola faces a rather\nsombre future - one dangerously similar to those of the\ncountries that I have already mentioned.\nThe present situation in my country is characterized\nby the extreme poverty of the people, who, having fled\nthe war zones in order to save their lives, have become\nrefugees in their own land.\nIn Angola there are currently 3.75 million displaced\npersons, more than 500,000 mutilated people and\nthousands of orphaned children and abandoned elderly\nfolk. In addition, almost of the country\u2019s all economic\ninfrastructures have been destroyed. In some areas\ncontrolled by the Government, people and goods cannot\nalways circulate freely, owing to mines and to the acts of\n44\n\n\nterrorism and banditry perpetrated by UNITA\u2019s military\nwing.\nThe difficult situation that I have just described must\ncontinue to command the attention of the international\ncommunity if the people and the legitimate Government are\nto be helped to re-establish peace throughout the country.\nAs those present in this Hall know, on 15 November\nlast, following the failure of our attempts to establish a\ndialogue, from Namibia to Addis Ababa and Abidjan, the\nGovernment of Angola initiated the negotiations of Lusaka.\nThese were mediated by the United Nations and were\nobserved by Portugal, Russia and the United States of\nAmerica, whose endeavour has contributed to the consensus\nin the negotiators\u2019 position.\nIt is important that we should once again express our\nsincere gratitude to the Government of His Excellency\nPresident Chiluba for his generosity and patience in\nreceiving the Angolan people in his country and for his\npositive action, albeit discreet and unofficial. We also\nreiterate our appreciation of the important role played by\nthe troika of observers - Portugal, Russia and the United\nStates of America - and for the committed way in which\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s special representative, Mr. Allioune\nBeye, has conducted the negotiations in Lusaka. Mr.\nBeye\u2019s knowledge of the Angolan situation is our guarantee\nof a rapid conclusion to the talks. The people of Angola\nand the international community expressed their satisfaction\nat the fact that UNITA has finally accepted the mediators\u2019\npackage of proposals, for this constitutes an important step\ntowards peace and national reconciliation.\nIt is none the less true that UNITA accepted this\npackage of proposals by the mediators only because of\npressure from the international community and, first and\nforemost, from the Security Council through its numerous\nresolutions, in particular resolutions 864 (1993) and\n932 (1994), which advocated the imposition of sanctions\nagainst UNITA if its leadership did not demonstrate good\nfaith about the conclusion of an agreement; and, also\nbecause on the military front there had been a clear reversal\nof the situation. Today the Government already controls\nmore than 75 per cent of the territory and 90 per cent of\nthe population.\nWe are convinced that if this pressure is maintained\nUNITA, which knows only the language of the force of\nweapons, might engage in a constructive and honest\ndialogue. In this context we once again urge the\ninternational community to continue exercising its various\nforms of pressure on UNITA\u2019s militaristic wing so that an\nagreement is reached in Lusaka to put a definitive end to\nthe war and to restore peace and harmony among the\nAngolan people.\nWe are not aiming at a military victory. We want\nan agreement that can bring lasting peace and pave the\nway to national reconciliation. Our insistence on pressure\nis based on our desire that the relative progress made in\nLusaka be irreversible, as it is only a step along the\ndifficult path to peace and its consolidation, to the\npromotion of the country\u2019s unity and national\nreconciliation, and to the defence of legality and\ndemocracy.\nTherefore, the international community, and the\nSecurity Council in particular, must be prepared to act\nimmediately as soon as an agreement is reached in\nLusaka in order to avoid any pretexts for non-compliance.\nThere must not be a substantial interval between the\nsigning of the agreement in Lusaka and the\nre-establishment of the cease-fire, on the one hand, and\nthe beginning of the implementation of the Lusaka\nagreement, or understandings on the other; this will avoid\nviolations. In this context it is necessary to anticipate the\nsending of the component of the United Nations Angola\nVerification Mission (UNAVEM III) immediately after\nthe signing of the agreement.\nPlease allow me to reiterate before this Assembly\nthat it is the firm commitment of the Government of the\nRepublic of Angola not to spare any effort in the search\nfor a negotiated solution to the crisis in Angola and that\nit is not our intention to destroy UNITA militarily.\nContrary to information which has been circulated\nrecently accusing the Government of launching a military\noffensive against UNITA, we have to say that the truth is\ncompletely different. The Government is engaged in\nstopping the UNITA military offensive, with the aim of\nhalting the kind of events that occurred before the signing\nof the Bicesse Accords, in order to ensure that a military\nadvantage not be obtained while the Lusaka Accord was\nbeing signed. We should not enable UNITA to obstruct\nthe full implementation of the Accord. We want UNITA\nto become a political party, to be prepared to live in\ndemocracy and to respect the existing constitution, which\nis the result of a difficult national consensus which\nUNITA itself joined in and which it amended before it\nwas approved by the Parliament.\n45\n\n\nFinally, we would like to send a strong appeal to the\ninternational community to increase humanitarian assistance\nto the needy people. The Government\u2019s scarce resources\nare insufficient to meet the dramatic socio-humanitarian\nsituation of the people being rescued from the captivity of\nUNITA.\nMembers have had the opportunity to see on\ntelevision the real situation in Kuito and elsewhere. The\nGovernment of Angola has always been committed to\ndelivering humanitarian assistance to all the needy\nregardless of where they may be, and requests that\npressure be exerted on UNITA not to hamper the efforts\nto distribute relief supplies to the population and the work\nof non-governmental organizations and United Nations\nagencies which with great sacrifice are involved in\nhumanitarian assistance to Angola.\nI reiterate our best wishes for the success of this\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session and to wish you every\nsuccess in leading this august body. May this session be\nconstructive and productive for you and all delegations.\nNew geopolitical, economic and technological realities\nhave appeared at the close of the twentieth century. The\ndestructive cold war has come to an end and its symbol -\nthe Berlin Wall - has collapsed. The insuppressible\nlong-held yearnings of many peoples for freedom and\nindependence led in the end to the disintegration of even\nthe seemingly indestructible Soviet empire, clearly\nreaffirming the lasting strength and integrity of the\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations -\npeace, equality and justice. That is why this Organization\nhas always played and will continue to play a role in\nfurthering the progress of nations, as evidenced by its vast\nundertakings in the maintenance of international peace\nand security, as well as its efforts to increase the\nwell-being of society and every individual.\nTwo years ago, the Secretary-General in his report\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", comprehensively analysed\naspects related to the maintenance of peace and security.\nThis report led to a broad debate on concepts such as\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking and\npost-conflict peace-building. Preventive diplomacy by the\nUnited Nations and other organizations undoubtedly\nfurthered the resolution of a very difficult issue for Latvia\nand all of Europe - the withdrawal of foreign military\nforces from the territories of the Baltic States.\nWith satisfaction I should like to report to the\nGeneral Assembly that, on the whole, General Assembly\nconsensus resolutions 47/21 of 25 November 1992 and\n48/18 of 15 November 1993, entitled \\\"Complete\nwithdrawal of foreign military forces from the territories\nof the Baltic States\\\", have been implemented. The last\nRussian military units departed Latvia and Estonia at the\nend of August. Thus, the Second World War has ended\nfor the Baltic States. Our bilateral negotiations with the\nRussian Federation, which lasted for more than two years,\nculminated with the signing on 30 April 1994 of\nagreements the ratification of which has been included in\nthe agenda of the Parliament of Latvia.\n\n\nI can state with full conviction that the international\ncalls for the withdrawal of Russian troops, made by the\nUnited Nations and the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), amongst others, were\npivotal to the successful resolution of this long drawn-out\nmatter.\nWe believe that this approach may be useful as an\nexample for the resolution of other global issues and we are\nprepared to share our experience with others.\nThe United Nations and the CSCE will continue to\nhave an important role in the implementation of the\nagreements. According to the bilateral agreement between\nLatvia and Russia on the Skrunda radar facility, any attempt\nto settle disputes or differences of opinion connected with\nthe agreement by means of military threats or by the use of\narmed force shall be considered a threat to international\npeace and security and shall be brought before the United\nNations Security Council. For its part, representatives of\nthe CSCE will observe the implementation of the\nagreements and the fulfilment of the respective parties\u2019\nobligations.\nHowever, we have yet to exhaust the opportunities for\npreventive diplomacy in the Baltic region. Baltic regional\nsecurity continues to be a pressing issue. On his visit to\nLatvia last summer, Mr. William Clinton, President of the\nUnited States of America, stressed that the sovereign and\nindependent Baltic States must not be part of any sphere of\ninfluence. It must be noted that President Clinton played\na vital role in disentangling problems which had developed\nduring negotiations with the Russian Federation on the\nwithdrawal of its troops from Estonia and Latvia.\nI should like to remind the international community\nthat the Russian radar facility will remain in Skrunda for\nfive and a half years, and nuclear reactors will remain in\nPaldiski, Estonia. Heavy Russian military transit takes\nplace through Lithuania to Kaliningrad, where a high\nmilitary concentration is maintained. On the whole, these\nare risk factors which potentially threaten the Baltic States\nand, in fact, the entire Baltic Sea region. In many respects,\nBaltic security is a guarantee for peace and stability in\nEurope. The Baltic States are already considering the\npossible solutions to this important question, and I hope\nthat the Member States will devote their full attention and\ninterest to these ends.\nA significant dialogue between our two countries has\nconcluded with the completion of Russian troop withdrawal\nfrom Latvia. Thanks to the support of many countries and\ninternational organizations, Latvia today is free from\nforeign military presence. Nevertheless, without the\nforesight and the civility displayed by both parties, we\ncould not stand here today and speak of social harmony\nand tolerance in Latvia, nor could we say that both Latvia\nand the Russian Federation have one less problem to\naddress. Last spring, when I met with President Yeltsin\nin Moscow, I gained the conviction that in solving our\nproblem he was guided by good will.\nIn 1995, Europe and the world will celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Allied victory over nazism.\nLatvians, too, fought against Hitler\u2019s occupying forces in\nthe belief that an Allied victory would be followed by the\nrestoration of Latvian independence. However, whilst\nmany nations breathed freely again after the end of the\nNazi occupation, the Baltic States were engulfed for the\nsecond time by the totalitarian Soviet empire. As other\nnations celebrated the defeat of nazism, Latvia was\nsubjected to the deportation of hundreds of thousands of\ninnocent persons and the systematic destruction of the\nLatvian State and national identity. Latvia and its people\nare the victims of both regimes - nazism and communism.\nJustice would prevail if the new democratic Russia,\nwhich played a decisive role in the destruction of the\n\\\"Evil Empire\\\", were to engage with Latvia in the\nappraisal of the actions taken by the Soviet Union against\nLatvia in 1940. The signing of truthful bilateral\ndocuments would preclude any petty psychological\nfeelings of revenge and would provide amends to the\nvictims of the totalitarian regime in both countries. These\n\\\"truth\\\" documents would foster even greater harmony\nbetween the various nationalities in Latvia and, we\nbelieve, lift some of Russia\u2019s unenviable inherited burden.\nSuch cases already exist. The documents signed by\nthe Presidents of Russia and several Central and Eastern\nEuropean States have marked an end to the legacy of the\npast, which had also been a burden to Russian society.\nWe believe that it is impossible to fully comprehend\nthe consequences of the Soviet occupation without an\nobjective analysis of the events of 1939 and 1940. These\nconsequences have been and continue to be felt in Latvia\nin the areas of political, economic and social\ndevelopment. No other country lost nearly 40 per cent of\nits native population during the Second World War; in no\nother post-war European country has the native population\nbecome a minority in seven of its largest cities, including\nthe capital; and no other country has experienced\npopulation transfers and mass deportations on such a\n2\n\n\nscale. The Latvian language, too, was under threat of\nextinction, despite the fact that it had survived for 4,000\nyears, partly in the form of a unique collection of more\nthan one million folk songs. We wish to protect Latvia\u2019s\nhistorical and cultural heritage, because Latvians can\npreserve their national identity only in this small land on\nthe shores of the Baltic Sea. Latvians never have and never\nwill ask for any other land.\nI should like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the\nnecessity for regional cooperation. History has repeatedly\nshown that geographically and historically close States have\nforged the deepest relations, thereby enriching and\nfurthering mutual development.\nFollowing the restoration of independence, the Baltic\nParliamentary Assembly was formed, and this month work\nwas begun by the Baltic Council of Ministers, which\ncoordinates our policies in foreign affairs, trade, legislation\nand other matters. In other words, a balanced and active\nBaltic union has been created. At the same time, an\nevolutionary process towards an expanded European Union\nwith a dynamic Nordic-Baltic dimension is taking place.\nThe model for regional cooperation in Northern Europe\naspired to by Latvia is \\\"three plus five\\\" - three Baltic States\nand five Nordic States.\nRecognizing the important role played by the United\nNations in international peace-keeping, Latvia, together with\nits neighbours, Estonia and Lithuania, has established the\nBaltic Battalion, which in the future may participate in the\npeace-keeping operations of the Security Council. The\nNordic States, the United Kingdom and the United States\nhave greatly contributed to the establishment of the Baltic\nBattalion. We believe that the three Baltic States will\nthereby further the aims shared by the Member States of\nthe largest and most influential of international bodies - the\nUnited Nations.\nDuring the cold war the Baltic Sea was a boundary.\nNowadays the Baltic Sea unites rather than divides States.\nFive years ago the \\\"Baltic Way\\\" - a human chain reaching\nfrom Tallinn through Riga to Vilnius - symbolized the\nshared road towards independence and democracy. Today\nthis road has also regained its historical and economic\nsignificance in our region. At the turn of the century the\nBaltic Way will already be an established part of the global\ninformation highway.\nI wish to reaffirm that Latvia will do its utmost to\nfoster peaceful cooperation and the spirit of understanding,\nmutual trust and tolerance on the shores of the Baltic Sea.\nInternational peace and security and good-\nneighbourly relations between States are inextricably\nlinked to economic and social development. The end of\nthe cold war has created new opportunities to devote\ngreater attention to these issues. Last spring the\nSecretary-General issued a report (A/48/935) entitled\n\\\"An Agenda for Development\\\". Latvia welcomes this\ninitiative, which marks a historic turning point in the\nwork of the United Nations. From being an international\nforum primarily serving the interests of individual States,\nthe United Nations is becoming a representative and\ndefender of the needs of humanity. Economic and social\ndevelopment increases the security of every inhabitant of\nour planet.\nWe believe that the United Nations and each\nMember State should recognize the need not only for a\ncoalition for democracy, but also for a fight against\norganized crime and the trafficking of nuclear materials\nand narcotics. Without effective solutions to these\nproblems, the security of each inhabitant of our planet\nand the development of every country and society are\nendangered. I invite the United Nations to consider\norganizing a high-level meeting for the solving of those\nproblems.\nMany components of the United Nations system,\nprimarily the Development Programme, are concerned\nwith the promotion of economic progress. Therefore,\nwithin the framework of the aims of the proposed Agenda\nfor Development, one of the challenges is to simplify,\nrenew and integrate the United Nations system. Latvia is\namong those countries whose economic, governmental\nand social structures are undergoing a period of transition.\nEffective United Nations assistance to these countries\nwould speed this process, allowing them to become donor\ncountries sooner.\nThe concept of development is very broad. It\nincludes social and economic progress; justice and\ndemocracy, as the foundation of society; and the\nprotection of human rights and the environment. Even if\nthe threat of global nuclear war has subsided, the prospect\nof environmental catastrophe remains. I therefore restate\nLatvia\u2019s proposal, first made at the 1992 Rio de Janeiro\nEarth Summit, to host in Latvia before the end of this\ncentury a world summit at which participating States\nwould commit themselves to diverting all resources\ngained from disarmament towards long-term development,\nespecially for the protection of the environment and\nreversal of ecological damage caused by military activity.\n3\n\n\nThis conference could take place in Jurmala, on the shores\nof the Baltic Sea.\nLatvia attaches great importance to international\nconferences organized by the United Nations. As a\nmember of the Bureau of the Preparatory Committee,\nLatvia has become actively involved in the preparation for\nthe World Social Summit. Furthermore, Latvia is one of\nthe few States whose head of delegation is also a Vice-\nPresident of the Conference.\nEach global conference is an opportunity for every\nparticipating State to review and compare the sum of its\nexperience. The issue of implementing the adopted\nresolutions at both the national and international levels is\nyet to be fully addressed. I would like to inform the\nAssembly of the extent of Latvia\u2019s adherence to the\nrecommendations adopted at the World Conference on\nHuman Rights. In its Vienna Declaration and Programme\nof Action the Conference invited States to establish and\nstrengthen national institutions for the protection of human\nrights. The Conference recommended that each State\nconsider the desirability of drawing up a national action\nplan identifying steps whereby that State would improve the\npromotion and protection of human rights.\nLatvia demonstrated its commitment to United Nations\nprinciples and its readiness to implement the\nrecommendations of the Conference by establishing in\nMarch 1994 the post of State Minister for Human Rights,\nas well as forming a Government Working Group on the\nProtection of the Rights of Individuals, allocating the\nnecessary resources towards these ends. We believe that\nthe United Nations should devote a greater percentage of its\nregular budget to the promotion and protection of human\nrights.\nIn response to a request by the Working Group, a\nhigh-level international mission organized by the United\nNations Development Programme visited Latvia in July this\nyear. The mission, which included representatives of\nseveral international organizations, including CSCE and the\nCouncil of Europe, consulted Latvia on the development of\na national programme for the protection and promotion of\nhuman rights. At Latvia\u2019s invitation, the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights will visit Latvia in\nOctober this year.\nI am proud that Latvia is one of the first countries to\nhave demonstrated an awareness of its responsibility by\nestablishing a national programme for the protection and\npromotion of human rights. Latvia is prepared to discuss\nand share its knowledge and experience with all interested\nparties.\nWe support the proposal made to the General\nAssembly by Mr. Boris Yeltsin, President of the Russian\nFederation, that the principles of the Declaration on the\nRights of Persons Belonging to National, Ethnic,\nReligious and Linguistic Minorities be embodied in the\nlegislation of all Member States. At the World\nConference on Human Rights Latvia called for the\nestablishment of standards and implementation\nmechanisms for the rights of minorities and foreigners.\nThose activities in the sphere of human rights are\ngrounded in history. Prior to the Second World War, as\na member of the League of Nations, Latvia fostered\nharmonious inter-ethnic relations. We are now trying to\nrenew and cultivate this great tradition. Immediately after\nthe restoration of its independence Latvia declared its\naccession to all the principal international human rights\ninstruments. As I have already mentioned, a major effort\nis being made in the establishment of a national\nprogramme for the promotion and protection of the\nhuman rights of the individual in order that every\nindividual be guaranteed equal rights and an equal\nopportunity to defend these rights. I believe that the\nconcept of equal opportunity not only characterizes the\nfundamental rights of the individual, but is also a\nprerequisite for development.\nLatvia has always been open to cooperation with the\nUnited Nations, the CSCE and other international\norganizations. Latvia reaffirmed this when it passed its\nCitizenship Law. In promulgating this legislation, it\nfollowed the recommendations of the CSCE and the\nCouncil of Europe, and the passing of the law has been\nevaluated positively by these organizations.\nThe need for rationalizing and revitalizing the work\nof the United Nations is becoming ever more apparent.\nLatvia is actively participating in the search for optimal\nsolutions. Latvia supports the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil, perceiving this as a fair opportunity for small\nnations to increase their role in important international\ndecision-making. Latvia also supports the improvement\nof cooperation and coordination between the United\nNations and other international organizations, including\nthe CSCE, the European Union and the Council of\nEurope.\nWe also welcome and support the action taken by\nthe Secretary-General to introduce a new, effective system\n4\n\n\nof accountability and responsibility, and, pursuant to the\nUnited States initiative, to establish the Office of Internal\nOversight Services.\nLatvia supports especially the initiative to reform the\ncalculation of United Nations assessments, based strictly on\nthe principle of \\\"capacity to pay\\\". This would be a step\ntowards improving the dire financial situation of the\nOrganization and would pave the way for a fair solution to\nthe issue of the assessments of Latvia and many other\nStates.\nAlthough the inescapable difficulties associated with\na transition period can still be felt in our economy and\nsocial sector, Latvia is endeavouring to fulfil its\ninternational obligations and commitments. However,\ncontrary to standard United Nations practice, the current\nassessment of Latvia has been calculated without taking\ninto account its actual capacity to pay. Instead, the data of\na non-existent country - the former Soviet Union - has been\nused to determine Latvia\u2019s assessment. Latvia has\nconsistently and unwaveringly stated that it was forcibly\nincorporated into the former Soviet Union and therefore is\nnot, and cannot ever be, its successor, with all the rights\nand obligations that this would entail. This was also stated\nin a letter to the Secretary-General in 1992.\nLatvia expects that the General Assembly will address\nthis issue in the course of this session on the basis of the\nprinciple of sovereign equality.\nWe consider that the same importance should be\naccorded to the United Nations principle of universality.\nNext year, the world will celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Latvia,\ntoo, has begun preparations for this great anniversary. We\nhope that the Riga Dom Boys Choir will sing at the\ncelebration concert to be held here in New York. This\nwould be deeply symbolic, since future generations will\nshape the fate of nations. In many ways their fate will be\ndecided by the heritage we leave to our children. We must\ndo our utmost to draw closer to the age when nations will\nnot fight against nations, but all will join forces in the\nbattle against darkness. This sentiment, which has been\ndrawn deep from the well of our national wisdom, seems to\nembody the essence of the United Nations now and in the\nfuture.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, Sir, to convey to you on behalf of the people\nand Government of Chad, our heartfelt congratulations on\nyour unanimous election to preside over the forty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly. It was a resounding\ntribute to your country, whose devotion to peace and\ndialogue is well known. Not simply C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, but the\nwhole of Africa has thus been honoured.\nWe should like to take this opportunity to salute the\nmemory of the late President F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny,\nwhose renown as a statesman extended beyond our\ncontinent.\nI should also like to convey heartfelt thanks to your\npredecessor, Ambassador Samuel Rudolph Insanally of\nGuyana, for the skill with which he conducted the business\nof our previous session.\nFinally, I wish to express our profound gratitude to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ndedication to international peace and security, to which he\nhas contributed with \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, now\nsupplemented by \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d.\nWe welcome the return to this Hall of South Africa,\na South Africa now free of apartheid. We welcome it and\nwish every success to President Nelson Mandela, whose\ntenacity should once again be commended.\nThe picture of the international situation following the\nend of the cold war is mixed, being one of both hope and\nuncertainty.\nThe evolving peace process in the Middle East is an\nimportant step towards the achievement of a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting settlement of a crisis which\nhas persisted for too long. We pay warm tribute to the\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders who, with their\nforesightedness and sense of history, have taken this\ndecisive step. We venture to hope that the peoples of this\nregion, sorely in need of peace, have the benefit of the\nwholehearted support of the international community.\nWe also commend the efforts now going on to\nrestore democracy to Haiti.\nChad has also been following with interest the\nprocess under way in Mozambique, and we hope that the\nelections to be held on 27 and 28 October will pave the\nway to a new era of peace and prosperity.\nHowever, grim situations still continue. How can\none fail to be outraged at the daily events occurring in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Liberia, Afghanistan or\nSomalia? Chad, which has been through three decades of\nconflict, sympathizes with the tragic experience of the\npeoples of these countries and condemns practices based\non ethnic, racial and religious criteria, practices which\nbelong to the past.\nThis was one of the reasons which prompted my\nGovernment to make a modest contribution, first, by its\nmilitary presence with the French force in Op\u00e9ration\nTurquoise, and then in the second United Nations\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda.\nChad urges the United Nations to continue its\ntireless, energetic peacemaking and peace-keeping efforts\nand asks the parties involved in any conflict to attach\ngreater importance to dialogue.\nIn this regard, we welcome developments in the\nongoing talks to bring lasting peace to Angola.\nWe appeal for a speedy solution to the question of\nthe embargo afflicting the Libyan people, a solution in\nkeeping with resolutions of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and the Organization of the Islamic\nConference.\nThe proliferation of armed conflicts in Africa is a\ngreat challenge to us. Chad therefore makes an urgent\nappeal to the international community to give its\nwholehearted support to the OAU\u2019s machinery for\nconflict-prevention, conflict-management and the\nsettlement of conflicts.\nConflicts of any kind are always a disaster for the\nhuman race. Therefore, in order to save present and\n11\n\n\nfuture generations from the danger of a nuclear holocaust,\nmy country supports the indefinite extension of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\nConventional weapons are a permanent source of\nconcern for Chad. That is why we support resolution 48/75\nE and welcome the initiative by President Alpha Omar\nKonare of Mali to halt the proliferation of such weapons in\nour region.\nEconomic development is a constant concern of the\ninternational community. That is why the various\ninitiatives and discussions on the subject, as well as the apt\nanalysis in the Agenda for Development, deserve careful\nconsideration at this session. The worsening economic\ncrisis, marked by chronic indebtedness and the drop in the\nprice of raw materials in developing countries in general,\nand in Africa in particular, has torn at the weak social\nfabric and threatened the stability of States. This explains\nthe spread of phenomena such as juvenile delinquency,\nwidespread drug-trafficking and organized crime.\nHowever, we look forward to the World Summit for\nSocial Development to be held in Copenhagen next year,\nand to the World Conference on Women, to be held in\nBeijing, also next year.\nThey will give the international community an\nopportunity to discuss today\u2019s challenges and to try to\nimprove the lives of millions of human beings.\nI now turn to Chad, where the democratic process\nwhich began with the coming to power of the Patriotic\nSalvation Movement is continuing, to the satisfaction of all,\nthanks to the wisdom of our President, His Excellency\nColonel Idriss D\u00e9by, who has honoured the spirit and the\nletter of the historic declaration of 4 December 1990 to\nestablish a State of law.\nThe Sovereign National Conference organized, in a\nspirit of transparency, with the participation of citizens of\nChad of all strata and all political leanings in the presence\nof foreign observers, adopted a consistent, comprehensive\nstrategy. It thus reflected the general consensus on\nresolving all our problems, and in particular the creation of\na State that respects the rule of law. To that end, a\nschedule was worked out and transitional institutions were\nestablished.\nAt the last session, my delegation took note of\nprogress made towards democratization. I am happy to say\nfrom this rostrum that the transition in Chad is proceeding\nnormally thanks to cooperation between the three organs,\nthe presidency, the primature and the Higher Transitional\nCouncil.\nIn order to keep within our deadlines, the framework\nagreement was reduced to more realistic proportions,\nbacked up inter alia by the following priorities: the\nelaboration of a constitution and texts to govern the\nupcoming elections; the establishment of a national\nreconciliation committee consisting of governmental\nrepresentatives, representatives of the provisional\nparliament, political parties and civilians. That committee\nhas already achieved some results by signing certain\nagreements with some organizations, in particular the\nBangui II Agreement. We express gratitude to His\nExcellency Ange F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, President of the Central\nAfrican Republic, for the decisive role he has played\nthroughout the negotiations. At the same time the\nnational reconciliation committee is continuing its\ncontacts with other political and military groups. Our\nGovernment is confident that definitive peace will be\nrestored to our country.\nConsiderable progress has been made in the\nrestructuring of the national army but much remains to be\ndone because of the complexity of the problem of\ndemobilizing elements and reintegrating them into civilian\nlife. We reiterate once more our appeal to the\ninternational community to provide assistance in carrying\nout this essential programme for lasting peace in Chad.\nThe signing of a social covenant concluded between\nthe Government and the trade unions took place on 1 July\n1994. It restored social peace and is the reason for the\nimportant progress that has been made in applying the\nprovisions of the framework agreement.\nEqually important progress has also been made in\nother areas. I wish to speak now of human rights and\nfreedoms. For almost four years now we have seen the\nunprecedented establishment of several independent\nnewspapers, the formation of many political parties, 49 of\nwhich have been legalized, and the creation of unions and\nhuman rights associations.\nThe recent establishment of the Supreme Council for\nCommunications is another guarantee of freedom of\nexpression, opinion and information.\nI turn now to human rights. My country, which has\nexperienced one of the most cruel and misguided\ndictatorships, attaches great importance to the promotion\n12\n\n\nand defence of these rights. The ratification of various\ninternational instruments and, more recently, the Convention\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment, the establishment of the National\nCommission for Human Rights and the authorization\nprovided by my Government for the visit to Chad of an\nindependent expert from the United Nations Commission on\nHuman Rights, attest to this will.\nThe Government of the Republic of Chad is therefore\nsurprised that certain press organs, certain human rights\nassociations and organizations, manipulated by those who\nare fighting for power, have launched a campaign that is\nseeking to mislead international opinion by spreading false\ninformation about Chad.\nI wish to draw attention to the special situation in my\ncountry, where there are many political and military groups\nequipped with weapons, as a consequence of the long\nconflict. The abuses committed by uncontrolled groups\ncannot and should not be attributed to Government policy\nto violate human rights. I should like, therefore, to take\nthis opportunity to call on all countries and governmental\nand non-governmental organizations that are interested in\nChad and in the future of its people to come to my country\nto establish the facts.\nFree democratic elections will be organized at the\nbeginning of next year in keeping with the timetable\nestablished by the framework agreement. On 7 October\n1994 His Excellency Colonel Idriss D\u00e9by, Head of State,\nonce again reaffirmed his determination to respect the\ntimetable for the elections to give the country reliable\ndemocratic institutions, inter alia, to guarantee the rights of\nall citizens. Accordingly, we ask our traditional partners to\nassist the Government of Chad to conclude this delicate\nmission which require many resources.\nI now turn to the question of the border dispute that\nexisted between my country and the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya. On 3 February 1994 the International Court of\nJustice in its Judgment put an end to this 20-year-old\nconflict. An Agreement on the practical modalities for the\nimplementation of that Judgment was signed on 4 April\n1994 in Surt. In keeping with the Agreement the\nwithdrawal of Libyan troops from the Aouzou Strip was\ncarried out according to an agreed timetable and under the\nsupervision of United Nations observers. Now all that\nremains to be done is to make a reality of the border as\ndefined between the two countries.\nI wish to reiterate my sincere thanks to all those who\nhave contributed directly or indirectly to the peaceful\nsolution of this dispute and our gratitude to the United\nNations. This fortunate outcome, which reflects the pre-\neminence of negotiation over confrontation, is a reason\nfor hope in the matter of prevention and resolution of\nconflicts.\nIn the framework of the rehabilitation of the Aouzou\nStrip and the reintegration of the local population, Chad\nhas already set up a technical committee to study the\nvarious aspects of rehabilitation, particularly the\nrestoration of infrastructure, the cultivation of our oases,\nand the restoration of our education and public health\nsystems. We should also create an environment\nconducive to all these actions by carrying out mine\nclearance and disinfecting wells that were poisoned during\nthe occupation. We appeal to the entire international\ncommunity to help us to carry out this programme.\nChad, like many other countries in Africa, is\nconfronting an unprecedented economic and financial\ncrisis. Existing difficulties have been compounded by the\ndevaluation of the CFA franc, which has wiped out all the\nefforts by the Government within the structural\nadjustment framework. My country regrets the fact that\nthe steps to accompany the devaluation have not been\nentirely honoured. We urge some of our partners to\ncomply with their commitments in this respect.\nChad is a country which is half desert and has\nsuffered a rapid degradation of its environment because of\nits lack of energy resources and we welcome, therefore,\nthe signing on 17 June 1994 in Paris of the International\nConvention to Combat Desertification in those Countries\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\nParticularly in Africa. We hope that the provisions of the\nConvention will not remain a dead letter.\nWhile in the Sahel rain is welcomed enthusiastically,\nthe rainfall, which has been particularly abundant this\nyear, has caused flooding in many regions of my country,\ncausing serious damage to crops and leaving many\nfamilies homeless. At the same time an epidemic of\ncholera has broken out in some cities in Chad.\nWe are working together with our various partners,\nUnited Nations agencies and non-governmental\norganizations to deal with these situations following\nappeals made respectively by the Ministers of Agriculture\nand Health.\n13\n\n\nThe United Nations will celebrate its fiftieth\nanniversary next year. To meet the many challenges we\nmust adapt to present changes. Therefore my country\nsupports the common African position on restructuring and\nthe revitalization of the United Nations in the economic,\nsocial and related fields.\nI turn now to the Security Council. I wish to recall\nthat the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\nChad stated from this rostrum on 8 October 1976 that\n\u201cThe Security Council, whose principal role is to\nsafeguard international peace and security, should\nreflect the geographical composition of the\ninternational community.\u201d (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Thirty-first Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 23rd meeting, para. 22)\nIn the light of ongoing discussion of this question, we\nreiterate this position because it is a requirement of our\ntime.\nI cannot conclude my statement without saying that we\nhope that the work of the present session will yield answers\nto our legitimate concerns.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the United\nArab Emirates it gives me pleasure to extend to the\nPresident our congratulations on his election to the\npresidency of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. This is a clear recognition by the international\ncommunity of his wisdom, diplomatic skills and a sign of\nesteem for his country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. We would also like\nto pay tribute to his predecessor, Ambassador Insanally, for\nhis efforts and his efficiency in steering the deliberations of\nthe last session. In this connection, we salute the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\nefforts aimed at improving the work of the Organization\nand its efficiency so that it may face up to the challenges\nand changes of today\u2019s world.\nOn this occasion, I am happy to welcome the return of\nSouth Africa to the fold of the international community.\nWe are fully confident that by its return, it will effectively\ncontribute to enhancing the work of the Organization.\nThe end of the cold war has created a new climate in\ninternational relations as better prospects have emerged\nwhich promise to make possible the achievement of\ntangible progress towards finding solutions for a number\nof international problems. Such encouraging\ndevelopments afford unprecedented opportunities for\ninternational cooperation in the interests of peace,\nsecurity, stability and sustainable development. At the\nsame time, we must take stock of the new realities that\nhave emerged on the international scene.\nIn a number of regions, the escalation of wars and\nregional conflicts poses a serious threat to international\nand regional peace and security and has led to a state of\neconomic, social and developmental instability. New\nforms of racism, nationalism and religious fanaticism\nhave emerged, and acts of violence and terrorism in all its\nforms take place. All these situations and factors impede\nthe building of the better world of peace, coexistence,\ntolerance and prosperity after which humanity aspires.\nThis makes it clear that the tasks the United Nations\nundertakes in performing its role in such areas as the\nresolution of conflicts, peace building and the prevention\nof regional conflicts are not easy, given the complex\nnature of the problems of today\u2019s world which differ from\nthose of yesterday\u2019s world. Therefore, we must intensify\nour efforts in support of what the Secretary-General has\nproposed in his report \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, in order\nfor that agenda to be translated into a concrete reality. I\nrefer in particular to the proposals concerning the\nstrengthening of cooperation, partnership and coordination\nbetween regional organizations and the United Nations, in\nline with the provisions of the Charter and the rules and\nnorms of international law. I should mention in particular\nthe organizations associated with our region, such as the\nGulf Cooperation Council, the League of Arab States and\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, all of which\npossess a good deal of comprehensive knowledge of the\naffairs of the region and the nature of its problems.\nIn the current international situation, it is important\nto reconsider the question of reforming the structure of\nthe United Nations \u2014 particularly the Security Council\nand the General Assembly \u2014 in accordance with the\nCharter, so that, in the exercise of their functions, they\nmay respond and adapt to the nature of the current world\nsituation. The responsibilities of the Security Council\nhave greatly increased over the past few years. This fact\nmakes it necessary to ensure greater participation by all\nMember States, taking into account the fact that equitable\nand just geographic and regional distribution would\ncontribute to the maintenance of international and regional\npeace and security.\n23\n\n\nDevelopments in international and regional situations\nover the past years have made it clear that radical solutions\nto regional disputes can be reached only by peaceful means,\nthrough dialogue and negotiation between countries in\naccordance with the United Nations Charter and the rules\nand norms of international law. Proceeding from this, the\npolicy of the United Arab Emirates is based on full and\nmutual respect for States\u2019 sovereignty and independence\nand for the principles of non-interference in the internal\naffairs of other States, good-neighbourliness and peaceful\ncoexistence.\nThus, throughout the years, we have had a sincere\ndesire to conduct direct negotiations with the Government\nof Iran with a view to the restoration of our full sovereignty\nover our three Islands \u2014 namely, Lesser Tumb, Greater\nTumb and Abu Moussa, which were militarily occupied by\nIran in 1971, an action which we consider to be illegal and\nin breach of the United Nations Charter and the rules of\ninternational law.\nOn a number of occasions, my country has declared\nfrom this rostrum its complete readiness to settle this\ndispute by peaceful means. Hence the initiative by the\nUnited Arab Emirates which called for serious and direct\nnegotiations to put an end to the Iranian occupation of our\nthree islands. This stance on our part stemmed not only\nfrom the nature of the traditional and historic relations\nbetween the two countries and from the current trends on\nthe international scene in dealing with issues of peace and\nsecurity, but also from our adherence to the principles and\ntenets of the Islamic Sharia\u2019a, the provisions of the Charter\nand the rules of international law.\nOwing to the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s failure to\nrespond to all these endeavors and initiatives on the\nquestion of the three Islands of the Emirates, the\nGovernment of my country has declared its full readiness\nto put the issue before the International Court of Justice\nwhich is the judicial organ competent to settle disputes\nbetween States. My Country is pledged to accepting all\nthat follows from the Judgment of the International Court\nas that Judgment would be based on legal arguments and\ndocuments.\nThis initiative was supported by our sister countries of\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as by Arab and by\nother friendly countries. We hope that the international\ncommunity will support this peaceful initiative, which is\nbased on international legality.\nFurthermore, the United Arab Emirates hopes that\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran would share this sincere\ndesire and respond to our serious initiative, especially as\nthe Government of Iran has on previous occasions \u2014 I\nrefer to disputes in respect of which the Court was likely\nto rule in Iran\u2019s favour \u2014 had recourse to the\nInternational Court of Justice and accepted its Judgments.\nWe are confident that this initiative will help to achieve\nan atmosphere of stability and security in the region and\nwill enhance peaceful coexistence and mutual respect\namongst its States and thereby enable them to channel\ntheir energies and resources towards the achievement of\nthe socio-economic development for which they stand in\ndire need after so many years of conflict and war.\nAlthough almost four years have elapsed since the\nliberation of the sisterly State of Kuwait, the Iraqi regime\nis still being selective in its implementation of the\nrelevant resolutions of international legality, indifferent to\nthe serious consequences. In addition, it is using delaying\ntactics and procrastination, instead of cooperating by\nreleasing hundreds of hostages and detainees from Kuwait\nand other countries.\nWhile we in the United Arab Emirates, with our\nbrethren in the Gulf Cooperation Council, affirm the\nneed to uphold the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq,\nwe consider the international resolutions operative and\nmandatory. Thus, we demand that the Iraqi regime abide\nby its legal and political obligations, as stipulated in the\nSecurity Council resolutions related to its aggression\nagainst Kuwait \u2014 in particular, resolution 687 (1991)\nconcerning respect for the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of Kuwait; and resolution 833 (1993), which\ndetermines the demarcation of international borders\nbetween Kuwait and Iraq in accordance with the\nprovisions of Chapter VII of the Charter. Short of the\nimplementation of both these resolutions, there cannot be\na positive climate conducive to peace and security in the\nregion.\nThe peace dividend, the product of the atmosphere\nof international cooperation in the wake of the Cold War\nera, has increasingly come to determine the characteristics\nand parameters of a new world order based on regional\ncooperation, for whose success peace is considered an\nindispensable prerequisite. Proceeding from this, the\nUnited Arab Emirates was one of the countries that\nwelcomed the holding of the Madrid Peace Conference\nand the conduct of bilateral negotiations. This was also\nthe reason why my country participated in the multilateral\nnegotiations.\n24\n\n\nWhile we considered the Declaration of Principles and\nthe agreements that followed on the Palestinian and\nJordanian tracks as the first real steps of detente in the\nArab-Israeli dispute and the Question of Palestine based on\ninternational legality as represented in the relevant United\nNations resolutions, particularly Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) on the\nIsraeli withdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian and\nArab territories, including Al-Quds Al-Shareef, the Syrian\nGolan and southern Lebanon, at the same time we affirm\nthe necessity of attaining positive results on the Syrian and\nLebanese tracks based on these resolutions and on the\nprinciples and the premises that were agreed upon in\nMadrid Peace Conference, namely the land-for-peace\nprinciple.\nMy country, which pins its hopes on the success of the\nnational reconciliation conference in Somalia within the\nterms of the Nairobi Declaration, is still concerned about\nthe deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation\nand the obstruction of the distribution of relief supplies to\nthe suffering people of this sisterly country. We did not\nhesitate to grant humanitarian assistance in addition to our\nparticipation in the United Nations Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM II).\nWe think that the international relief efforts cannot be\nsuccessful in the worsening internal situation. Therefore,\nthe major responsibility lies with the Somali leaders\nthemselves to formulate a serious response to mediation\nefforts aimed at the political settlement and national\nreconciliation, without which their country will not be\nsaved, its reconstruction will not be achieved and the\nrehabilitation of its people will not take place or pave the\nway for Somalia\u2019s return as an active member of the\ninternational community.\nMy country is deeply concerned over the situation in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, particularly under the\ncircumstances of the continued violation of its sovereignty\nand of the human rights of its people, especially the\nMuslims. The facts still indicate that Bosnian Serb forces\nand their supporters have not refrained for a single day\nfrom their acts of aggression or from perpetrating further\ncrimes of ethnic cleansing and genocide. To the contrary,\nthey have gone to great lengths in defying the international\nwill and have even attacked United Nations personnel.\nThese Serbian actions aim at regional expansionist gains\nthat violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nAlthough the United Arab Emirates has continued to\ncall upon the international community since the eruption\nof this crisis to take serious measures that could restore\ndignity, security and stability to that country, yet, after 30\nmonths, we are obliged to reiterate our call, in the\nstrongest possible terms, to the international community,\nparticularly the Security Council, to reconsider the\nmanner it has opted for in dealing with the question of\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The Council must once again\ntake firmer measures against the Serbian aggressor in\naccordance with Article 42 of Chapter VII of the Charter,\nand in a manner that would achieve a just negotiated\nsettlement.\nAt the same time, we reiterate our previous call for\nthe lifting of the arms embargo imposed on the Republic\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina by Security Council resolution\n713 (1991) so that the people of that country may be able\nto defend themselves in accordance with Article 51 of the\nCharter.\nIn view of the rapid developments in international\nrelations at the end of the Cold War era, the international\nsituation necessitates an early settlement of the problems\nleft behind by that era. This will be realized only through\na general orientation towards disarmament in all its forms,\ncovering both nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\ndestruction. Thus, we look forward to the 1995\nConference on the Review and Revision of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty, hoping that that Conference will\nproduce confidence-building measures on the regional and\ninternational levels that would create zones free from\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons,\nparticularly in the Middle East region, which has been\nplagued by conflict for a long period of time.\nDespite progress in the Arab-Israeli peace\nnegotiations, we are deeply concerned over Israel\u2019s\nacquisition of an immense nuclear capability, which\nconstitutes a constant and continued threat to the security\nof the countries and peoples of the region, hampers the\nrealization of the comprehensive objectives of these\nnegotiations and will also endanger international peace.\nWhile social issues are now at the forefront of\ninternational relations, the economic and developmental\nquestions of developing countries are increasingly\nmarginalized, and the economic disparities between\ndeveloping and developed countries continues to widen as\na result of the measures taken by developed countries.\nThe exports of developing countries are still impeded by\nprotectionist measures, and their efforts for development\n25\n\n\nare threatened by the burden of foreign indebtedness,\nreverse financial flows in addition to the constant decline in\nthe price of commodities, on which most of developing\ncountries depend as a major source of national income, as\nwell as the general deterioration in the terms of trade and\nfinance of the developing countries themselves.\nThe persistence of these problems and the absence of\na solution will lead to political and social tensions, which\nin turn will adversely affect international and regional peace\nand security.\nThe nature of these problems requires us to reconsider\nthe structure of the current international social and\neconomic relations with two approaches. The first includes\nthe development of new measures and mechanisms for\ncooperation amongst the countries of the North and the\nSouth, and the second hinges on finding a strategy for\neconomic integration that addresses the elements of\ndevelopmental deficit among the countries of the South in\na way that ensures the realization of socio-economic\nimprovements in the process of sustainable development,\nand alleviates the concerns of the countries of the South\nvis-\u00e0-vis implementation of their immediate and medium-\nterm development plans.\nInternational economic integration has become a\nconcrete reality that must be taken into account. This\nconcept has been recently endorsed by the agreement of\na majority of countries to the establishment of the World\nTrade Organization in Marakesh in sisterly Morocco on\n15 April 1994. There can be no doubt that this is a\nhistoric event and gives new momentum to the world\neconomy. We hope that the setting up of this new\norganization will be a positive beginning that improves\nand enhances the prospects of economic, financial and\ninternational trade relations based on justice, co-equality\nand equity, with a view to bridging the gap between\ndeveloped and developing countries.\nThe spirit of tolerance and of adherence to noble\ncultural and humanitarian values, to the principles and\npurposes of the Charter and the rules of international law\nshould be our beacon which guides our steps towards the\nfuture that we desire. Consequently, we call on Member\nStates to take advantage of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations and to transform it into a historic occasion\nfor a comprehensive review and for ushering in a bright\nfuture of stability, security and coexistence prevail for all\npeoples and countries of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of Belize\nwarmly congratulates you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. We are proud that such an illustrious son of Africa\nhas been selected to preside over our deliberations in this\nperiod leading up to the celebration of the Organization\u2019s\nfiftieth anniversary year.\nPermit me too to express my delegation\u2019s thanks and\npraise for the sterling performance of your immediate\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of\nGuyana.\nOnce again we gather to review the state of world\norder. And of the year just past it might perhaps be said\nthat it was the best of times and the worst of times.\nOn the one hand, a jubilant South Africa kept its\nrendezvous with freedom and now appears to be bathed in\nsunlight. Furthermore, the peace in the Middle East,\npresaged by the Agreement on Palestinian self-rule, is\ntaking root. Tension on the Korean peninsula has eased,\nand the cease-fire in Northern Ireland represents a hitherto\nunimaginable breakthrough.\nOn the other hand, the pall of nuclear weapons still\nhangs over our fragile planet. So does the gloom of\nconventional armaments, the din of battle and the smell of\nrotting flesh in the Balkans, parts of our beloved Africa and\nwestern and central Asia. In particular, the scale of the\ntragedy in Rwanda has been incomprehensible. The initial\nparalysis of will of the world community, our belated\nresponse in the face of horrible genocide, has not been our\nfinest hour. That hesitation, that failure of leadership,\nunderscores the need for the United Nations system\u2019s\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping\nmechanisms to be better developed as a matter of urgency.\nThe fact is that there is still rampant lawlessness\nabroad on our planet, and we continue to be traumatized\nby the death and destruction it brings. In particular, the\nliving hell of refugees, fleeing almost inconceivable\nconditions of terror, seems to have become a stock feature\nof our end-of-the-century international existence.\nIn this sort of depressing world political climate,\neven small countries such as mine must do what we can\nto ease the pain. Thus it was that Belize became the first\nsmall State to agree to participate in the multinational\nforce currently overseeing the end of tyranny in Haiti.\nWe took seriously the Security Council\u2019s particular\ninvitation to regional States and hope now that the\ncollective response will succeed in giving our beleaguered\nsister republic surcease from its unhappy history and a\nchance of lasting peace and true democracy. We salute\nthe Haitian people and we congratulate President Aristide.\nWe expect soon to be able to send our messages of\ncongratulations direct to the presidential palace in Port-au-\nPrince.\nIn Belize\u2019s own neighbourhood, the\nredemocratization of the Central American isthmus\ncontinues apace. In the last year, the free elections and\norderly transitions of power that have taken place in\nPanama, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras have\nvindicated our new-found, or rather rediscovered, destiny.\nIn Guatemala, a plebiscite, congressional elections and the\nOslo Agreement between the Government and the Unidad\nRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) guerrilla\ngroup have strengthened the internal order. Furthermore,\nthat country has undertaken, in its letter to the Secretary-\nGeneral (A/49/94 of 14 March 1994) to abide by pacific\nprinciples and good-neighbourliness in its relations with\nmy country. As a Member of this Organization, with our\nhistorical and constitutional land and sea borders\nuniversally recognized as inviolable in accordance with\nthe principles of self-determination, sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity, Belize welcomes this Guatemalan\ncommitment. It is a further encouragement to regional\npeace.\nTalking of peace, we note with interest the\ndevelopment of the concept of stand-by forces. This idea\nneeds to be deepened and refined, and arrangements\nshould be made for appropriate training in regional\ntraining centres. In this regard, Belize\u2019s offer to serve as\none such locale, making special use of our jungle terrain\nand facilities, is a matter of record.\n4\n\n\nThis Organization must be allowed to develop an\nagency for rapid and effective military deployment. Again,\nwe call for the implementation of Article 43 of the Charter.\nWhat we are saying is that security and world order\nmust be significantly improved. Mankind and the vision of\nour founders must be vindicated. In that light, we reiterate\nthe call we made during last year\u2019s debate for reform of the\nSecurity Council. Since that time, we have refined our\nideas on that subject. These include our proposals that\ncertain developing countries, on account of sheer population\nnumbers and geopolitical realities, should be permanent, or\nindefinite, members; that contributions to the peace-keeping\nbudget should be a relevant criterion for permanent, or\nindefinite, membership; and that, in both existing categories\nof membership, adjacent States should be permitted to pool\ntheir resources as composite or constituency members. We\nnow call upon all the members of this Assembly to ensure\nthat, by the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization, we\nshall demonstrate our commitment to world order by\ndemocratically bringing the Council to a better state of\ngrace.\nAnother aspect of international order that deserves\nmention is that of the number of entities which are not fully\nembraced by the notion of universality in our Charter and\nwhich do not participate completely in the system of\ninternational order. These entities are mostly in or around\nthe Asia-Pacific region, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and\nthe Caribbean. We call on all parties in good faith to\ncontinue their various dialogues to resolve this issue.\nTo contribute to this restructuring of world order, we\nare in the process of finalizing a massive new economic\ndimension with the conclusion of the multilateral trade\nnegotiations, the establishment of the World Trade\nOrganization, the development of new mechanisms for the\nresolution of trade disputes and the deepening and widening\nof the system of norms relating to international commerce.\nWe applaud the transformation of the General Agreement\non Tariffs and Trade and these other advances, while urging\nthat the less well-endowed countries receive their due, both\nunder domestic jurisdictions and laws and in adjudications\nby the new organization. Rampant unilateralism and\nprotectionism must now take a back seat. We are satisfied\nat the expansion of the institution of non-discrimination into\nsuch new areas as trade in services and trade-related\ninvestment measures. We are also happy that dumping and\nsubsidies regulations have now been significantly improved\nand that progress has been made in the trying area of\nsafeguards.\nWe hope, however, that the thread of liberalism that\nruns through these new instruments will not become a\nnoose to suffocate those of us that did not inherit a head\nstart. We therefore call for sensitivity in the application\nof those various provisions for special and differential\ntreatment of such countries.\nIn the same vein, we would wish for increased\nsensitization on the part of the Bretton Woods institutions.\nEven as the global order swings to and fro, we call for\nimprovement of the various mechanisms as they affect\nour sensitive economies.\nIn Belize we have begun our own adjustment\nprocess. This is necessary if we are to cope with the\ninitial dislocations to small economies, which will be the\ninevitable consequence of the new international trading\nrealities. As well, the profligate behaviour of the central\nGovernment between September 1989 and June 1993 had\nresulted in an unmanageable deficit, precipitously\ndeclining reserves and imprudent short-term, high-interest\nforeign borrowing.\nSo we seek now to restore fiscal discipline and\nregain macro-economic stability. We are also intent on\nremoving the traditional distortions inherent in the\ndomestic trading regime, and on instituting tax reform\nthat will eliminate our overreliance on import duties.\nThis is a process that we must manage carefully, since\ndrastic reductions in public expenditure and trade\nliberalization will work initial hardship on our local\neconomy. In this context, the Bretton Woods institutions\nhave a duty to respond to our special circumstances.\nSupport for our public and private sectors must be\nforthcoming, for the brave new economic world that we\nmust enter, whether voluntarily or otherwise, will no\ndoubt prove a most inhospitable clime to those not\nclothed with the requisite garb.\nIn particular, the funds for skills training, human\nresource development and poverty alleviation must be\nfound. Our young people are already hostage to the\nsubculture of violence perpetrated as much by the\ntelevision images transported undiluted from the first\nworld, as by the indigenous problems peculiar to our\nsmall societies. The hope-extinguishing cycle of\nalienation, joblessness and incarceration must be broken.\nOtherwise, those nice new economic edifices we are so\ncarefully constructing will come crashing to the ground,\nundone by the confrontation and social chaos that\ncontinued marginalization of our youth will surely\nengender.\n5\n\n\nWe repeat, then, that small, hitherto hardy,\ndemocracies must not now be swamped by a heedless\nforward march of soulless economic principles. And the\ncase for urgent Bretton Woods social and economic\nassistance should be even more compelling in the instance\nof voluntary, vis-\u00e0-vis imposed, structural adjustment.\nWe are somewhat embarrassed that, almost 50 years\non, this journey into a putative glorious world order just\nnow sees us seriously crafting new substantive agendas for\nwhat are really some very old problems. Yet, we must deal\nwith reality. The development decades and the new\ninternational economic order were, in part, chimeric or\nexercises in rhetoric. But I believe we are truly now\nengaged in writing a new, coherent, agenda for\ndevelopment. Let it be a properly annotated agenda. In\nfact, let it be a fully programmed model that entirely\nanticipates what lies ahead.\nWe are grateful that this Organization is also taking\nnote of the unfulfilled promises of the Second World War\norder. It is now 53 years since the call for social justice\nwent out in the Four Freedoms and the Atlantic Charter.\nYet we are far from freedom from want and improved\nsocial security. Now, with the recently concluded\nConference on Population and Development, and with the\nWorld Conference on Women and the World Summit for\nSocial Development just before us, the opportunity is here\nagain. Let us seize it and develop bold concepts and\neffective normative systems. And while we do so, let us\ncontinue to develop such recent notions as those relating to\nthe relief of children in difficult circumstances. Let us also\ndevelop this Organization\u2019s capacity for technical assistance\nin crime prevention and interdiction to those United Nations\nMembers which are increasingly beset by the scourge of\nviolence, weapons and narcotics. These plagues are, almost\ninvariably, brought on by demands and excesses imported\nfrom thousands of miles away, mostly with the aid of the\nelectronic media.\nAnother area in which we are still in the agenda stage\nis that of humanitarianism. Despite unfair criticism, the\nSecretariat has done what it could to carry out the promises\nmade in the Charter. We commend all concerned with the\nestablishment of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs,\nand we pledge to work beside them.\nAnother relatively recent watchword is sustainability.\nIt has a redolence to which we have all taken with alacrity.\nIt warns the well-endowed of the truth of the adage \\\"Waste\nnot, want not\\\". It reminds the less fortunate to try to\nresolve their dilemma wisely, as necessity obliges them to\nreduce their woodlands while leaching the present vitality\nof the land. It has brought us out of our slumber and\nhumbled us into sincere discussions about fish stocks,\nfragile low-lying developing small island and coastal\nareas, and global warming.\nWe have seen the Commission for Sustainable\nDevelopment and the Global Environment Facility take\ntheir faltering first steps. While they are to some extent\nfurther examples of the somewhat unstructured way in\nwhich the Organization is sometimes obliged to operate,\nwe nevertheless commend those agencies. And we\nsincerely hope that sustainability will keep us whole.\nAnother area in which the Organization has been\ndiscovering its role is human rights. We all recently\nparticipated in the stimulating exercise of establishing the\npost of High Commissioner for Human Rights. We have\nseen the number of instruments on that subject increase.\nHuman rights bodies have become more experienced and\neffective. Even in the field of population and\ndevelopment, we notice how the recent Cairo Programme\nof Action uses human rights as its main point of\ndeparture. It is striking that, in places, that document\nalphabetizes the basic species of human rights. So did\nthe Assembly\u2019s resolution establishing the post of High\nCommissioner. We did this to stress the non-selectivity\nand neutrality of the various genres of human rights.\nThat is to say, cultural, economic and social rights are as\nmuch our concern as civil and political rights. The\ncoincidence of development with population and other\nconcerns in the Cairo document, and the stress of the\nright to development both in the resolution establishing\nthe post of High Commissioner and in the Cairo\ndocument, underscore the coequal importance of that\ncategory of right. I believe that we are now seeing the\nbeginning of the concretization of international concern\nabout a wider range of human rights for individuals and,\nI beg to stress, groups and peoples.\nAbove all, these recent developments in the field of\nhuman rights, sustainable development and social justice\nare pointing us to the reality that values must become an\nintegral part of statecraft and of diplomacy. Only by\ninculcating respect for values will our world straighten up\nand fly right.\nIn our fledgling world order, my subregion of the\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) has begun to show\nsigns of coming of age. We have established several new\nstructures for subregional integration and cooperation.\nWe recently joined our friends and neighbours in the\n6\n\n\nnon-English-speaking Caribbean and proximate mainland\nareas in signing a treaty to establish an ambitious\nAssociation of Caribbean States designed to bring about\ncoordination, concentration and cooperation in our far-flung\nproto-region. Even before this, CARICOM had begun to\ndevelop separate cooperative relationships with Central\nAmerica, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. In all of these\nendeavours, it has become more widely noted that Belize is\nideally situated to assist with this bringing together of\nvarious subregions. We are equidistant from Tijuana and\nParamaribo and, in other respects, are at the very centre of\nthis new Caribbean. Belize is bilingual and multi-cultural.\nBesides, Belize has a history and a polity which well equip\nus for this role.\nWe earlier referred to the issue of equitable\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council. This is an important aspect of the world\norder. It is also the quintessential example of the need for\nreform and revitalization of this Organization.\nThe General Assembly\u2019s health is generally quite\ngood. However, in some respects it needs improvement.\nOne such area is the roster for this general debate. The\nannual seating arrangements for our numerous members are\nmade quite democratically and scientifically. Yet the order\nof the list of speakers in this debate is not fixed in quite the\nsame manner. What is the justification for annually placing\ncertain nations at certain positions at the end of the list? I\nremember that the Christian Bible makes flattering\nreferences to what comes \\\"Out of the mouths of babes and\nsucklings\\\" (The Bible, Psalms 8:2). Similar expressions\ncan be found in every philosophy and religion on this\nplanet. It is time that this be learned and observed by those\nwho prepare the annual speakers\u2019 list.\nWith many others, we call for the development of an\nimproved system of coordination here at Headquarters of\nthe structure of the Organization\u2019s machinery in the social\nand economic sectors. More thought must also be given to\nthe rationalization and coordination of the Organization\u2019s\nmultifarious development agencies in the field.\nEven as the World Trade Organization and the Bretton\nWoods institutions develop their separate complexes of\nstructures and prescriptions, my delegation sees a greater\nneed for overall coordination by this premier Organization.\nThe United Nations must be appropriately developed as the\nfirst among equals within the global organizational system.\nWe laud the Secretary-General and the Assembly for\nimprovement in the systems of oversight and conditions of\nservice, especially in the area of gender equity. But\nequitable distribution of staff posts and responsibilities\nwithin all United Nations bodies must be radically\nimproved.\nAbove all, the United Nations must learn to speak\nto, not at, the peoples of the world. In the ongoing\nefforts to rearticulate, reinform and reinforce the vision of\nthe Charter\u2019s framers, we can even envisage our Chief\nExecutive going on camera on popular talk shows,\nteaching new constituencies about what is after all their\norganization. He should continue to find bully pulpits in\nthe global electronic information meeting-place, for the\nneed to sound the themes that underline the continuing\nvitality of our world body is particularly urgent at this\ntime. After all, in the run-up to our fiftieth anniversary\nwe must be able to give a proper account of our\nstewardship, to withstand the special scrutiny we will\nsurely now provoke. Our world Government has to\ndemonstrate that it is relevant, effective, moral and, above\nall, democratic. It is only then that we can fully expect\nthat it will be able hereafter to call out ever more clearly,\nforcefully and directly to \\\"We the peoples of the world\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people\nand Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, and on my\nown behalf, I have the pleasure to extend to you, Sir, our\n4\n\n\nwarmest congratulations on your well-deserved election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-ninth\nsession. Your election is a fitting tribute to the efforts that\nyour country has made and continues to make in\ninternational relations, especially its mediatory role in\nconflict situations on our continent. Our special thanks also\ngo to your predecessor, the Ambassador of the Republic of\nGuyana, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, whose\nabilities and clear vision in steering the Assembly during\nthe forty-eighth session will forever be remembered with\nappreciation.\nWe are also indebted to our distinguished\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, whose track record is without parallel.\nMy delegation is proud to welcome the Republic of\nSouth Africa, now free and democratic, back into the\ninternational fold. The resumption of the right of South\nAfrica, a founding Member of the United Nations, to\nparticipate in the deliberations of the General Assembly and\nother organs of the United Nations, is very timely, coming\nas it does as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations.\nEven as we approach the threshold of the twenty-first\ncentury, our world is still mired in conflicts. Our\nOrganization must strive to contain these and other\nsituations, which are the legacy of the post-cold-war era.\nWe are entering a new era, one in which democratic and\ninclusive global institutions can play a principal role in\nbuilding a better world. It is still difficult, however, to\nhave a clear vision of the future role of the United Nations\nin the new international political order that is emerging\nfollowing the end of the cold war.\nAs it approaches its fiftieth anniversary, the United\nNations faces a number of challenges; it has to become a\nreal instrument of international legality, peace and security.\nThe Organization needs to have the means and the\nflexibility to play an increasingly active role in these\nunpredictable times. Unfortunately, however, the United\nNations of today still reflects the structure of the world of\n1945 as seen by the victors of the Second World War.\nUnited Nations organs such as the Security Council need to\nbe revitalized and democratized so that they may become\nmore representative of the regions encompassed in this\nOrganization.\nThe General Assembly, as one of the principal organs\nof the United Nations, an organ that is universal in\ncharacter and one in which Member States enjoy sovereign\nequality, needs revitalization as part of the current process\nof the transformation and reform of the United Nations\nsystem. The United Nations system should be able, at all\ntimes, to respond rapidly to changes and new\ndevelopments as they occur around the world. In the last\nfew years we have witnessed significant events of historic\nmoment. We had not anticipated that the Iron Curtain\nwould be dismantled so quickly; nor could we have\nforeseen the demolition of the Berlin Wall and the\neradication of apartheid in South Africa. The United\nNations may not possess the clairvoyance to predict\nevents before they occur, but it should have the capacity\nto respond to developments and crises rapidly and\neffectively as they arise. The events in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and, recently, in Rwanda starkly demonstrate\nthe sluggishness of the decision-making process and the\nlack of responsiveness on the part of the system.\nDisarmament, especially in the nuclear field, remains\nan urgent concern of this Organization. Its relationship to\ninternational peace and security is today more evident\nthan ever before. We are mindful of the fact that in\nrecent years, at the height of the cold war, the world\nexperienced a period of uncertain peace, a peace that was\nsustained more by the fear of a nuclear holocaust than by\nthe existence of harmonious relationships among nations,\nespecially the opposing nuclear blocs, or by progress\ntowards complete and general disarmament. Today,\nconditions exist for the establishment of a stable and\npeaceful global environment. It is under such conditions\nthat the world can begin to enjoy what may be called the\npeace dividend, whereby global expenditures will be\nshifted away from preparations for war and unending\nconcern for national security towards investment in\ndevelopment.\nSolid groundwork for cooperation and\nconfidence-building has been successfully laid in a\nnumber of regions. The progress in this regard bodes\nwell for the future. In our region, the continental\norganization, the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nhas established a mechanism for the prevention,\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts. The apparent\ninability of the world community to act in a timely and\ndecisive manner during some tragic conflict situations in\nour continent has taught Africa the cardinal lesson that we\ncannot continue to delegate our responsibilities to the rest\nof the world. We have seen evidence of this a number of\ntimes, particularly during crisis situations in Rwanda and\nSomalia. Africa is taking up more seriously the challenge\nof fending for itself. We shall, however, continue to\n5\n\n\ncount on international solidarity and cooperation during the\ntrial stages of the mechanism.\nIn Liberia, the OAU, in conjunction with the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\nand the United Nations, continues to seek a solution to the\nconflict on the basis of the implementation of the Cotonou\nPeace Agreement. We are happy with the progress\nachieved thus far in Mozambique. The situation in Angola,\nhowever, continues to be of grave concern to us.\nWe urge the parties involved to show political will and\nto negotiate in good faith in order to ensure the early\nestablishment of lasting peace, stability and development.\nThe complementarity between democracy and the\nobservance of human rights on the one hand, and\ndevelopment on the other, can no longer be a subject of\ndebate. Democracy is the cornerstone of every civil society\nand the preservation and sustaining of its institutions should\nbe binding on all of us. The expression by the international\ncommunity of the will to cooperate in this endeavour has\nbeen clear in recent times. If it is necessary to look\nbackward to yesterday, it is only to draw lessons that will\nenable us to march confidently and resolutely into the\nfuture, a future in which our citizens will live in harmony\nand enjoy prosperity.\nThe attainment of democracy, peace and development\nas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the\ncharters of the Organization of African Unity and other\norganizations has become the responsibility of all nations.\nWhere these principles are threatened by those who are\nreluctant to come to terms with the realities of today, the\ninternational community has stood up resolutely in defence\nof our fledgling democracies. This attitude augurs well for\nthe new world order we seek to establish.\nThe events in Haiti and our recent experience in\nLesotho demonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt that\nyoung and fledgling democracies can be seriously\nthreatened or turned off their course. In the early morning\nof 17 August this year, the people of Lesotho woke up to\nhear an announcement over Radio Lesotho that shocked and\nbewildered them. According to that announcement, certain\nclauses of the Constitution of Lesotho had been suspended,\nand as a result of that illegal and arbitrary act the\ndemocratically-elected parliament and Government of\nLesotho had, it was said, been dissolved. The constitutional\ncrisis we faced has since been resolved; however, I recall\nthese events because of the important lesson they brought\nhome to all of us who were directly concerned.\nFirst, it became abundantly clear that the support for\ndemocracy among our people cuts straight across party\npolitical lines. Secondly, the international community can\nno longer countenance an open attack upon democratic\nprinciples and the institutions of democratic governance.\nThe people of Lesotho rose up in large numbers to\ndemonstrate their displeasure and their abhorrence of the\ndisguised coup against their elected Government. Despite\nthe repressive measures taken by those who had brazenly\nintruded upon the constitutional order of our country, the\npeople sent a clear signal that the powers of a tyrant are\nforever circumscribed by the will and the determination\nof the people to resist oppression and by their desire to be\ngoverned only with their own consent.\nI take this opportunity to thank the United Nations,\nthe Organization of African Unity and the commonwealth\nof nations for supporting my Government and my people\nin their struggle to maintain legality, constitutionality and\ndemocratic rule in Lesotho. I need to mention\nspecifically the timely and principled intervention by\nPresident Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Nelson\nMandela of South Africa and President Ketumile Masire\nof Botswana. It is through their mediatory efforts that we\nwere able to emerge from the unfortunate constitutional\ncrisis that we experienced.\nThe people of Lesotho will always remember that\nwhen they faced a critical test, when the foundations of\ntheir young democracy were under attack and threatened\nwith wanton destruction, the friends of democracy stood\nfirm and remained resolute to the end. The member\nStates of the European Union and the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) never wavered in their\nsupport for democracy in Lesotho. The Governments of\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan,\nthe Federal Republic of Germany and Sweden took a\nstand and immediately suspended all economic assistance\nto Lesotho, thus sending a clear signal to the usurpers of\npower that what is really here to stay is democracy, and\nnothing else.\nWe in Lesotho believe that the observance of human\nrights would go a long way towards eliminating hotbeds\nof tension and civil strife. In almost every country\nexperiencing some kind of civil strife, it will always be\nfound that the first casualty of that strife is human rights.\nIt is in this context that, recently, Lesotho ratified\nquite a number of international human rights instruments.\nAt the regional level, we all support the work of SADC,\nwhich has recently decided to establish a sector to deal\n6\n\n\nwith human rights questions. We pledge to work with our\nfellow SADC member States as we develop this new sector\nof our organization. We also pledge to fulfil our\nobligations at the international level through the various\nUnited Nations bodies engaged in human rights work.\n"

We all have\nour specific problems, our differences, our advantages and\nour handicaps. We all have many unresolved questions\nwhich stem from an international situation where the\nfactors of political and economic instability are becoming\nincreasingly frequent.\nThe hesitations of a changing world tend to engender\na feeling of pessimism, as we see contemporary history\nbeing made.\nBetween the industrially developed countries and\nthose who are still marking time on the path to\ndevelopment, considerable barriers are blocking the road\nto sharing and to solidarity.\nWe now see cruel dissensions arising among peoples\nthat were previously bound by brotherhood.\nOn the international scene, where we are witnessing\na relentless confrontation between divergent interests,\nwhat place do we now give to the human dimension in\nrelationships?\n31\n\n\nThe end of this century is constantly being redefined\nby shocks, upheavals and various types of aggression born\nof negativism.\nMore than ever, the success of our societies will\ndepend on their capacity to absorb these shocks and, when\nthere is nothing or little left to reinvest courage,\ndetermination and perseverance, in spite of sometimes\nterrible lack of understanding.\nBut we also have to reinvest our capabilities, our\nfunds, our means and our inborn willingness - in other\nwords, unprecedented alliances have to be struck; for there\nis no longer time to philosophize about the world we shall\nbequeath to our great grandchildren. Because of the\nunprecedented speeding up of history demographic,\neconomic and social projections are becoming alarming in\nthe medium term and no longer in the long term to which\nwe had grown accustomed through our cozy selfishness or\nour defiance in the face of the unforeseeable.\nThe phenomenon of exponential growth, which is\nwidening gaps and encouraging rivalry, causes immediate\nrather than delayed reactions. We have become our own\nheirs! Undoubtedly, there is more food for thought in this\nidea than in many statements.\nThat illustrates to what extent our efforts must be both\nplanned and creative. It also means that the immediate\nproblem to be tackled is to define our priorities. Here, my\nthinking is consonant with much of what has been said\nfrom this rostrum. Certainly there is no lack of those who\nplead for a safer, healthier and more prosperous world.\nAnd so many conferences and seminars have echoed the\nsame thought and have recalled this idea in their final\ndocuments. But we are aware that we have to go beyond\nthis; hence, we are asking for action programmes which\nmobilize experience, energy and imagination. When\ncontinuity of effort is the key factor for success, we must\nexpand the underpinnings of projects, assess results and\nrenew assistance.\nIn other words, what we are advocating is a definitely\nprescriptive approach, rather than the sort of analytical and\ndescriptive exercises which has been the comfortable route\nof many international gatherings.\nIf we are specific in defining the areas of our\ndeliberations, then the ensuing action will necessarily be\nbased on precise, useful and needed dynamics.\nThis specificity, in the case of Seychelles as in the\ncase of more than 30 territories throughout the world, is,\nfrom the point of view of development, the dual\nconstraint of geographic and demographic smallness and\nbeing an island.\nNeed we recall that the situation of small island\nStates can, in many respects, provide indications as to the\nfuture of mankind. Here, more than anywhere else,\nbecause of their vulnerability - whether it be due to the\nfragile ecosystems, the scant economic outlets or the lack\nof human resources - any dependence necessarily impacts\nupon the very future of the societies concerned.\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held in\nBarbados, was indeed extremely beneficial for us all. It\nfocused attention on the particular situation of those small\nStates whose relatively high per capita income does not\naccurately reflect the reality of a situation which donors\ntend to tie to any aid for development.\nThere is no doubt that that Conference has been the\nsource of great hope for the small island States. But\nsome remain sceptical. In any case, we hope it will lead\nto a change in attitude on the part of the industrialized\ncountries with respect to the unique situation of small\ndeveloping island States, for it is the industrialized\ncountries that will not only have to take up and enlarge\nupon the concerns of the small island States but also have\nto set in motion the strategies and the plans of action,\nwhich are the only real vehicles of change or of\ndevelopment.\nFar be it from us to engage here in singling out the\ncountries or international organizations concerned.\nHowever, two years after the Rio Summit we are very\ndisappointed to see that the provisions of Agenda 21 have\nrarely given rise to actions. Does this mean that the\nconcept of lasting and sustainable development is going\nto be severely compromised because of a lack of\nsolidarity and international support and failure to respect\ncommitments?\nLet us get to the core of the problem. The\nharmonization of development policies and measures to\nprotect the environment necessarily implies the definition\nof specific budgetary categories by priority, based on\ncriteria of complementarity as between national effort and\ninternational efforts. This must be done free from any\nspirit of charity, as well as divorced from any evaluation\nbased on per capita income.\n32\n\n\nLet us not forget the backdrop to all this, the fact that\nin an era where everything occurs on a worldwide level the\nindividual and collective responsibility of States calls for a\nglobal approach and equitable sharing of the cost and moral\ninvestment the environment represents. Those\nresponsibilities must be consciously assumed.\nAll these are indicators that merit the attention - the\nunwavering attention - of decision-making bodies and\ninternational donors. In the past, many pronouncements\nhave concluded on a hopeful note. Joined together in an\norchestral score, such notes would barely fill out a refrain\nin praise of development, one that, like a clear conscience,\ncan often sound hollow.\nAnd yet we do not doubt the wisdom of our\nnegotiating partners. There are surely some who would like\nto deal with questions of development from a dialectical\nviewpoint, but that is not true of us. If, for us, the essential\nthing is not to hesitate to be specific, we seek, in return,\nmeasures that will be real, meaningful and measurable.\nMore generally, this could apply to the role women\nshould play in the development process. This is an old\ndebate. Fortunately, the time is now past when women\nwere viewed as non-conventional vehicles of progress.\nAbolishing a principle, however, although paving the way\nfor many improvements, can also generate a considerable\npotential for inertia, for the walls of hypocrisy, as we all\nknow, are infinitely thick. It is not enough to quote some\ncases of women who are entrepreneurs or decision-makers,\nThere have always been some effective women. The\nimportant thing is to modify behaviour and practices in real\nterms, at the societal level, and to analyse and transpose\nthose models and ideas which have from time to time led\nto good results. That is what we expect from the Beijing\nConference.\nWhere natural prerogative is concerned, we cannot of\ncourse speak of delegating authority but here too of\nequitable and responsible sharing. Indeed, do we in fact\nhave a choice?\nWomen must act within their communities as a\nproponent force that is open to change and capable of\nenriching the dynamic processes linked to changing values.\nIt is impossible to give life without being concerned about\nsurvival, without being deeply aware of the changes that\naffect the individual or the society whenever they give rise\nto uncertainty and muddy the waters.\nHumanism obviously owes a great debt to women.\nLet us enrich it with our understanding. The woman\u2019s\nidentity is strong, but in many places there is still a lack\nof both recognition and expression, which are the\nfoundations of her legitimacy.\nThe ideal of legitimacy is a noble concept, in\naddition to being a good working notion. It is legitimate\nto look forward to the fulfilment of the promises made in\nsolemn declarations; it is legitimate to expect that\nintentions so boldly and courageously stated will become\npromises, and it is also legitimate, when the urgency of\nthe matter no longer leaves time for either declarations of\nintention or promises, to take action. Consensus can\ncome later.\nHere, and in the same spirit, I should like to\nemphasize our interest in the proposal made by the\nDirector-General of the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for swift\nhumanitarian action - what we might call a \\\"spontaneous\nreaction\\\" - whenever called for. For here again we are\ntalking about the legitimacy that endows the human entity\nwith dignity and makes it worthy of respect.\nBefore concluding I should like to appeal to all\ncountries and peoples present here to unite our efforts to\ntake one large step towards world brotherhood. Let us\noverturn the rigid barriers of all kinds of self-interest, let\nus be attentive to the needs of others and the future of our\nplanet. Let us shape our relationships for active solidarity\nand willing adherence to the principle of shared\nresponsibility.\nOn such vital questions there is no place for trite\nofficial statements. In coming decades, no one will be\nfooled by our unwillingness to engage, openly, fully and\nwith determination, on the path of well-being, especially\nwhen it is the neediest of us who most require it.\nThat is the price of true unity among nations. And\nwe in Seychelles harbor this desire to stand alongside all\ncountries in concluding the unprecedented alliance that\nwill guide the great ship of mankind towards the shores\nof the third millenium.\nIt is up to us to ensure that those shores will be\nwelcoming ones.\n"

        "file_text": " Please allow me to\ncongratulate you, Sir, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. Our deliberations under your presidency are\ncertain to be a success. May I also take this occasion to\nthank His Excellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally, the\nPermanent Representative of the Republic of Guyana, for\nhis many contributions as President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session.\nThe economic and political changes currently under\nway have raised the hopes of all of us for a better future.\nDemocracy has been restored to much of the world, thus\nnot only showing that it is the most suitable model of\ngovernment, but also making possible a greater degree of\ninternational cooperation, strengthening the rule of\ninternational law and giving the United Nations a more\npowerful role.\nIn Eastern Europe, the process of democratic change\nis now irreversible. Though much is made of the dangers\nof new ethnic conflicts and the rise of new\nultra-nationalistic and totalitarian forces, they become ever\nless likely to succeed with each day that passes. Have we\nnot seen two of the most apparently intractable problems -\nthe Middle East and South Africa - brought to a peaceful\nconclusion? The Middle East was a crucible of conflict;\napartheid in South Africa was a disgrace to the entire\nhuman race. Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela showed both\npolitical wisdom and human tolerance in agreeing on a\ntransition for the Republic of South Africa. South Africa\nwill play a major role in future developments in the\nAfrican continent.\nThose are just some causes for optimism. But\noptimism does not mean expecting that all our crises will\nsimply resolve themselves without any action on our part.\nIf our collective hopes and desires are to lead anywhere,\nthen the work must begin here at the United Nations,\nwhere representatives from the entire world are gathered.\nThe time has come when we can make this world a better\nplace to live.\nNever in the history of the world has the awareness\nof the global nature of the basic issues been as strong as\nit is today. Never has the desire for cooperation between\nnations so clearly superseded the wish for the domination\nof one nation by another. And never has man had so\nmuch knowledge and technology at his fingertips as he\nhas today. All of these factors are predispositions for a\ngreater role for the United Nations, and we must do\neverything to ensure that the mechanisms of the United\nNations work more effectively.\nWe support the efforts for the reconstruction of the\nSecurity Council. The Security Council ought to enhance\nboth its effectiveness and its efficiency, as well as its\nrepresentational capacity. A measured, realistic expansion\nof the composition of the Council would be appropriate.\nFurthermore, Slovenia supports the proposal that Germany\nand Japan become permanent members of the Council.\nAn additional task in this regard relates to the need\nto enhance the transparency of the work of the Security\n11\n\n\nCouncil. The system of consultations should be developed\nfurther, so as to provide an adequate opportunity for the\nparticipation of United Nations Member States interested in\nvarious situations dealt with by the Security Council.\nThe General Assembly could also make a greater\ncontribution to the development of adequate approaches on\nthe part of the Security Council, as well as to less costly\nand more effective methods of preventive diplomacy, and\nat the same time decrease the need for the Security Council\nto intervene in armed conflicts.\nFurthermore, in recent years the General Assembly has\ntaken an important step in this direction through the\nestablishment of the post of High Commissioner for Human\nRights.\nLast, but not least, it is important to do as much as\npossible to strengthen the United Nations financially, even\nthough the finance ministers in each and every Member\ncountry find that their contributions to the United Nations\nare a significant component of their State budget. Slovenia\nis committed to the principle that contributions to the\nUnited Nations must be paid in full and on time. The\nregular payment of contributions is an essential part of all\nefforts aimed at the financial reform of the United Nations.\nThe Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and the recent\nConference on Population and Development have brought\nthis Organization into the public consciousness in a new\nway; they have shown that we are conscious of some of the\nmost fundamental problems that face all of us, not just\nGovernments, but the people. Though some may be\nsceptical about the results of these Conferences, my feeling\nis that they have contributed significantly towards a global\nconsensus and have involved a whole new constituency in\nour work.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security is\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter as the main\npurpose of the Organization. I believe that one of the most\nimportant questions to be dealt with is dealing with the\nprovision of armed forces acting within the framework of\nUnited Nations operations. The variety and complexity of\nUnited Nations military and related activities have\ndeveloped far beyond what was once defined as\n\\\"peace-keeping\\\". Careful reflection is needed on future\ndirections to be taken. Slovenia welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s current efforts to develop a system of stand-by\nforces and is ready to participate in these efforts.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\nmust be strengthened by effective measures in the field of\ndisarmament. Slovenia is, like most other States Parties\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons, convinced of the need for indefinite extension\nof that Treaty. Furthermore we are convinced of the need\nfor enhanced security guarantees, in particular negative\nsecurity guarantees. We also support the efforts to\nachieve a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing and other\ndisarmament measures with respect to weapons of mass\ndestruction. With respect to conventional weapons, we\nsupport the United States initiative for the conclusion of\nan agreement to reduce the number and availability of\nanti-personnel land-mines. In short, the issues of\ndisarmament ought to remain high among the priorities of\nthe United Nations agenda.\nThe protection of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms is another of the highest priorities of the United\nNations. For the Republic of Slovenia, it represents both\na basic domestic task and a strong international\ncommitment. Slovenia actively participated in the World\nConference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in 1993,\nand in the subsequent efforts leading to the appointment\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights.\nBy the same token, we support the efforts for further\ndevelopment of the United Nations system in the field of\nhuman rights. We are ready to contribute to the work of\nthe Working Group of the Third Committee in its search\nfor the appropriate methods of protection of human rights.\nHere again we believe that prevention is better than cure,\nand that appropriate international action is necessary in\norder to prevent situations characterized by violations of\nhuman rights.\nThe United Nations is confronted with a variety of\nsituations involving the use of force. The armed conflicts\nin the Balkans are among the most difficult situations.\nSlovenia is the only successor State of the\nnow-disintegrated former Yugoslavia which is not directly\nthreatened by the ongoing conflict in that region. None\nthe less, Slovenia remains vitally interested in the stability\nof the Balkans. The horrors of war against ordinary\ncitizens, mass violations of human rights and breaches of\nthe United Nations Charter first in the Republic of Croatia\nand now in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\ncause serious concern to the entire international\ncommunity.\nI will not be telling Members anything new when I\nsay that the international community was not prepared for\n12\n\n\nthe eruption of the crisis that occurred within the territory\nof the former Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, the conflict that\nwas subsequently to occur within Bosnia and Herzegovina\nhas seriously damaged the image and credibility of the\nUnited Nations. It is true that without the involvement of\nthe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR), working in conjunction with many\nhumanitarian organizations, the tragedy in Bosnia would\nhave been even worse. But humanitarian assistance alone\ncannot be considered as a substitute for effective policy.\nSuch achievements as the Washington Agreement,\nconcluded between the Bosnian Muslims and Croats, do at\nleast raise some hope that appropriate international\nassistance can meaningfully influence the political aspects\nof the conflict. Nevertheless, the continuation of the\nmilitant behaviour by the Bosnian Serbs maintains the need\nfor the option of lifting of the arms embargo against the\nlegitimate Government of the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina to remain on the agenda. This war, with all\nits consequences, is threatening to continue into a third\nwinter, and I am afraid that this certainly most risky and\nnegative of options will be the only one left if the\ninternational community does not prove able to bring about\nan end to hostilities and open the way towards a viable\npeace with the necessary elements of justice.\nI would like to end this sad chapter of my address\nwith a warning. We should by no means forget that the\nterrifying pattern of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" has been patented in\nthe conflicts that have occurred across the territories of\nseveral successor States of the former Yugoslavia.\nRegardless of the final outcome of these conflicts in the\nBalkans, we must seriously consider all the means and\nmethods at our disposal that may prevent a repetition of\nthis pattern of events occurring in other parts of the world.\nI speak for a country which has the good fortune not\nto be a problem, but a country which seeks solutions. In\nthe less than two years in which our independence was\ninternationally recognized, we have, under difficult\ncircumstances, achieved positive economic growth. We\nhave managed to maintain a high level of social security\nand stability. The transformation and reform of our\neconomy has gone hand-in-hand with the rapid growth of\nour democratic institutions. We are paying special attention\nto the protection of human rights and of our ethnic\nminorities. Slovenia is a member of the Council of Europe;\nwe have signed the Partnership for Peace and the Pact of\nStability; Slovenia is a factor of stability in Europe and\nstrives to be an active part of Europe\u2019s integration.\nI do not wish to imply that there are no obstacles to\nthe progress of that integration. Europe may have high\nlevels of prosperity and deeply rooted democracies and it\nmay be one of the most stable regions in the world, but\nthe ghosts of the past and leanings towards near-forgotten\nforms of nationalistic chauvinism are still with us. These\nare in direct contradiction to the very idea of a\ncooperative and multicultural Europe; they endanger the\nprocesses of integration. Unexplained and unjustifiable\nimpediments have already been raised against Slovenia\u2019s\nassociation with the European Union.\nIn closing, allow me to express Slovenia\u2019s great\nsatisfaction that our proposal that the moral and ethical\naspects of social developments be considered at the World\nSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen next year\nhas been widely accepted. We are particularly glad that\nSlovenia will have the honour to host the United Nations\nseminar on the ethical and spiritual dimensions of social\nprogress and development, an event to which we attach\ngreat importance. If one thing is certain, it is that\neconomic, scientific and technological views on\ndevelopment do not exist in a vacuum. The United\nNations Charter calls for the fostering of the prosperity,\nharmony and freedom of people both as individuals and\nas cultural entities. This ultimate objective should be\nborne in mind in all the United Nations endeavours.\nIt is my hope that under your leadership, the\nAssembly will take positive steps in that direction.\n"

        "file_text": "I sincerely thank you,\nSir, for the honour and opportunity of addressing this\nforum, and I extend my congratulations to you upon your\nelection to lead the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly.\nIn this Hall, we see representatives of the entire world,\na world in which there has been unprecedented global\nchange. Our planet is growing more unified in all areas of\nlife; economic and political integration is well under way.\nNations, States and entire continents are drawing closer\ntogether. It is unfortunate that not all changes lead to\nprogress. A new avalanche of problems confronts the\nUnited Nations and other international organizations,\naffecting rich and poor countries alike.\nI fully concur with Secretary-General Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali in his belief that today as never before our\ninternational community needs a new and forward-looking\nvision of our future. The time has long been ripe for us\nto discuss within the United Nations agenda the creation\nof a new and universal concept of development that\nwould embrace peace, economic development, a clean\nenvironment, social justice and democratic governance as\nthe five spokes supporting the wheel of humanity\u2019s\nprogress. It is clear, I believe, that our generation must\ntake up the task of rediscovering the world and building\nwithin it new, mutually supportive relationships. One of\nthe fundamental instruments at our disposal in this global\ntask is the United Nations.\nOn the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nestablishment of the United Nations, it is appropriate to\nrecall the circumstances of its creation. It is important\nthat we examine the strengths and weaknesses of the\nUnited Nations predecessor, the League of Nations. We\nmust learn from this analysis so as to ensure that the\nUnited Nations shall not become a mere bystander to\nworld events. It is true, of course, that the global\nsituation today is fundamentally different from that which\nexisted at the outbreak of the Second World War. We no\nlonger suffer from the presence of dictatorial bandit States\nled by fanatics. But potential dangers exist today; they\nare multifaceted and have spread throughout the world.\n\n\nTogether we must overcome racism, hatred of\nforeigners, fanatical nationalism and intolerance. If we do\nnot, these demons, once having manifested themselves in\nmen, communities or entire nations, could destroy the entire\nworld.\nToday I would like to take note of a historic day for\nLithuania, the Baltic States and all of Europe. It is all the\nmore significant in that the General Assembly will discuss\nat this forty-ninth session, the complete withdrawal of\nforeign military forces from the territories of the Baltic\nStates, as called for by a General Assembly resolution\nadopted at the forty-eighth session. On 31 August 1993 the\nwithdrawal of the Russian military from Lithuania was\ncompleted, and exactly one year later the same historic\nevent took place in Estonia and Latvia. That date also\ncoincided with the withdrawal of Russian troops from\nGermany. This harmony of dates is more than merely\nsymbolic: it marks the resolution of one more consequence\nof the Second World War.\nGuided by the principles of the United Nations\nCharter, Lithuania continues to broaden its international\nrelations in a consistent manner. The goals and priorities\nof our economic, social and foreign policies remain\nunchanged.\nLithuania seeks to secure democratic government and\nthe principles of a free market, and at the same time to\nensure the well-being of its people and the protection of\nminority rights. Lithuania is confronted with serious\nproblems of a social character common to all young\ndemocracies.\nYet at the same time, we must also recognize what has\nalready been accomplished. Lithuania has a stable\ncurrency. Inflation is under control. The private sector\nalready employs the majority of the work force. A vibrant\nand innovative market continues to grow. After four years\nof dramatic decline, the standard of living has been\nstabilized, although it is still rather low. An attractive legal\nenvironment has been ensured for foreign investment.\nWe attach great value to the bilateral and multilateral\nassistance to the process of democracy-building and free-\nmarket reforms. Western interest in and attention to the\nrestored democracies of Central Europe is vital not only for\nus, the recipients of such assistance, but for the future of a\nunified Europe. Today the future of the West can no\nlonger be considered in isolation from developments in the\nEast.\nWe benefit from successful cooperation with Estonia\nand Latvia, our closest neighbours, with whom we share\na common history and common fate. This year a\npermanent body, the Baltic Council of Ministers, was\nestablished. But as we look to the future, this will not be\nenough. If the Baltic countries are to become integrated\nmembers of Europe, then the establishment of a common\nvisa and economic space can only be the first step of\nmany. It is imperative that our foreign and defence\npolicies be even more closely coordinated and that we\nharmonize our legislation in accordance with the norms of\nthe European Union.\nI believe that all the countries of our region face\nnew opportunities with the establishment of another\ncooperative body approximately one year ago: the\nCouncil of Baltic Sea States. This region has great\npotential. It is home to countries large and small,\neconomically strong and less developed, that not so long\nago were separated by the front lines of the cold war.\nThe Baltic Sea States are unified by many common\ngoals as well as problems. Sadly, in recent days we have\nalso shared a common tragedy. I wish to express my\ndeepest condolences to the Governments of our\nneighbouring countries and to the people whose loved\nones perished in the catastrophe that befell the ferry M.S.\nEstonia.\nAs I speak of our neighbours, I must also point to\nour relations with Belarus. We are heartened by the new\npossibilities of concluding a treaty on inter-State relations\nbetween our two countries. The signing of such a treaty\nwill further secure the principle so valued by our nations:\ngood-neighbourly relations.\nLithuania attaches particular importance to its\nrelations with Russia. As neighbours, we are very\ninterested - perhaps even more so than other countries -\nin the success of the democratic and free-market reforms\nin that country.\nRussian relations with Lithuania and the other Baltic\nStates today are a reflection of the current Russian\nposition concerning the evolving European order, one in\nwhich old divisions are disappearing. We would like to\nhope that the new Russia will adhere to the principles of\ninternational law and will not obstruct the integration of\nthe Baltic countries into European political, economic and\nsecurity structures. This would be a clear signal that the\ndemocratic reforms undertaken in Russia are irreversible\nand that new lines of division will not be drawn in\n2\n\n\nEurope. It would reaffirm that Russia does not seek to\nisolate itself from the West and that, on the contrary, it\ntrusts the West and seeks cooperation with it on an equal\nbasis.\nGiven Lithuania\u2019s geopolitical situation and our\neconomic opportunities, we can and are prepared to be a\nbridge between East and West. But I also want to\nemphasize that a future as a buffer State is completely\nunacceptable to us.\nSeveral days ago, in his address to the Assembly,\nRussian President Yeltsin stated that it was essential to\nreject the imposition of one\u2019s will on weaker States and to\nbuild a new order, founded on law and morality. I express\nmy hope that democratic Russia will adhere to these\nresponsibilities and thus justify the growing trust of the\ninternational community in its future.\nOne year ago I said from this podium that Lithuania\nwould welcome steps toward the gradual demilitarization of\nthe Kaliningrad district. Today I can state with satisfaction\nthat Russia is reducing its military presence in that area.\nLithuania, whose territory is traversed by transit to this\nRussian enclave, is not indifferent to the future of the\nKaliningrad district and the Lithuanian minority residing\nthere. Occupying a unique place on the map of Europe, this\nRussian territory demands special attention. It could\nbecome a stone in the foundation of security and an\nattractive economic partner or, under less favourable\nconditions, a source or even exporter of military threat and\nunrest. Lithuania proposes to examine issues pertaining to\nthe Kaliningrad district as part of the round-table\nmechanism established by the European Stability Pact. We\nhope that all interested parties will give their support to this\ninitiative.\nIn concluding a fundamental bilateral Treaty with\nPoland this year, we have closed a chapter of our common\nhistory. From the start of the 1930s and the outbreak of\nconflict over Lithuania\u2019s capital of Vilnius, relations\nbetween us were tainted by open confrontation, a state of\naffairs still remembered in the halls of the Palais des\nNations in Geneva. I believe that this Treaty, which\nrecognizes and confirms the present borders of our\ncountries, can be considered the final rapprochement for\nLithuania and Poland. As we greet the future, Lithuanians\nand Poles will be able to make their rightful contribution to\na unifying Europe.\nWe also strive to establish closer ties with other\ncountries of Central Europe. We share not only a similar\nhistory, but also current problems and future goals. I am\nconvinced that the convening of a meeting of the leaders\nof all Central European States in the very near future\nwould benefit our countries. Such a conference would\nallow us to discuss our common reform experiences and\nour strategies for drawing closer to the European Union.\nParticipation in multilateral and international forums\nprovides new opportunities for Lithuania. An ever-\nincreasing number of important political decisions are\ntoday being reached in international organizations. This\nis especially beneficial for small and medium-sized States.\nLithuania sees the guarantee of its security, stability\nand well-being in joining European political, economic\nand security structures. Lithuania has always been an\nintegral part of European civilization and culture. We\nhave never lost our European heritage. Our recent 50year\nseparation from the world did not sever our roots. Our\ngoal remains membership in the European Union. We\nhave already concluded a free-trade agreement with the\nUnion that should come into affect next year. We also\nexpect soon to sign an agreement on associate\nmembership with the Union.\nIntegration into the European Union cannot be\nconsidered in isolation from the broadening of\nqualitatively new ties with the Western European Union.\nLithuania is an associate partner of this defence\norganization of ever-increasing importance. We believe\nthe strengthening of the role of the Western European\nUnion to be both logical and necessary.\nI am also convinced that the security and stability of\nmy country and the region demand closer cooperation\nwith the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nLithuania has presented its formal request for membership\nin that organization and will continue resolutely to seek\nthe fulfilment of this goal. Lithuania\u2019s participation in the\nPartnership for Peace programme opens new avenues for\nLithuanian cooperation in efforts with Europe, the United\nStates and Canada in their endeavours to prevent conflict\nand maintain peace. We firmly hope that our active\nparticipation and that of other Central European States in\nthe Partnership programme will have a positive impact on\nthe broadening of NATO.\nThe expansion of NATO eastward would not pose a\ndanger or threaten any European State. Russian fears of\nisolation, I believe, are groundless. We welcome Russia\u2019s\njoining in the Partnership for Peace and hope that its\n3\n\n\nparticipation in the programme will contribute to the\nstrengthening of mutual trust and stability.\nI should like to take note of several concerns of a\nmore global character, the burden and urgency of which are\nparticularly felt by the countries in transition. Our\nwell-founded fears are heightened by the continuously\ngrowing gap between the developed and developing\ncountries. Can we truly speak of a stable Europe when the\nhourly wages of a laborer in the European Union are equal\nto one day\u2019s pay in Central Europe and, in some countries\nof Eastern Europe, to a month\u2019s income? If this\nunfortunate tendency is allowed to continue, a wave of\ndespondency and instability may overflow all barriers.\nThe young democracies of Central and Eastern Europe\nare confronted by dangers posed by organized crime, illegal\nmigration and trafficking in narcotics and, most horribly, in\nnuclear materials. These are the unfortunate negative\nconsequences of our rejoining the world; without the\nnecessary experience, they are difficult to address. We\nrequire coordinated and concrete assistance.\nWe live not only in a time of great changes, but also\nin a world of great contrasts. As we celebrate the historic\ntransformation of Europe, the stunning successes in the\nMiddle East peace process and the end of apartheid in\nSouth Africa, we are nevertheless witnessing continuing\ntragedies and conflicts all over the world.\nThe efforts of the international community, expressed\nthrough the United Nations, do not always achieve their\ndesired results. The main reason for this is the inability to\nenact decisive measures. This is particularly evident when\nlarge countries are for any reason drawn into local conflicts,\nleading to a clash of their global interests. In such cases,\nthe timely removal of built-up tensions becomes difficult.\nIf we fail to avoid conflict, its containment and reduction\nbecome painful and long-term, often leading to the death of\nBlue Helmets in the execution of their peace mission. It is\ntherefore crucial that we join forces to improve the conflict\nprevention mechanism. In this regard, we support the\ninitiative of Germany and the Netherlands to improve\ncooperative relations between the United Nations and the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\nEvery State must contribute in a tangible way towards\nthe creation of a peaceful and stable world. This must be\nthe responsibility of everyone. It would be inappropriate\nfor any country to seek to achieve its own interests or\nexpand its sphere of influence under the guise of\npeace-keeping missions. There are criteria which must be\nfollowed in this regard - namely, the principles of the\nUnited Nations and the CSCE. These principles must, in\nmy opinion, apply to all countries, including the Russian\nFederation. We cannot agree to allowing countries to\ncarry out peace-keeping missions in any given\ngeographical space without the consent of the parties to\nthe conflict or the proper international mandate. I would\nlike to emphasize my conviction that the principles of\ninternational law must be adhered to by all States, small\nand large.\nWith the end of the cold war and the spread of\ndemocracy, old global divisions begin to disappear. It is\nvital that this continue. Those who believe that a new\ndelineation of spheres of interest can bring stability to the\nworld are mistaken. We who have felt the consequences\nof such divisions of influence can testify that this would\nonly bring about new conflicts and upheaval.\nThe United Nations has a particular significance for\nsmall and medium-sized States - in other words, the\nmajority of countries. These States suffer first when\ninstability and mutual distrust take root in the world. In\nan anarchic world, guided only by an ad hoc order, small\nStates are the first to fall victim to larger interests. Small\nStates experience with considerable pain the negative\nside-effects of global changes; they are the true front-line\nStates. We have only to look at the front pages of the\nworld\u2019s newspapers. Bosnia, Rwanda, Tajikistan - all of\nthese are small States struggling with tragic historical\nlegacies.\nAt the same time, if there exist guarantees for their\nsecurity, small States develop rapidly and bring their own\ncontributions to the international community. I firmly\nadhere to my remarks, made a year ago in this Hall, that\n\\\"the future of a more integrated world lies in\ndemocracy and the individuality of free nations.\\\"\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-\neighth Session, Plenary Meetings, 7th meeting,\np. 14)\nThis individuality and diversity do not have to divide us.\nQuite the opposite - they will enrich us.\nLithuania became a Member of the United Nations\nthree years ago. Until now, Lithuania was perhaps a\npassive recipient of the assistance and security this\nmembership provided. Today Lithuania seeks to\ncontribute actively to the undertakings of the international\n4\n\n\ncommunity to strengthen security and stability throughout\nthe world.\nTogether with Estonia and Latvia, Lithuania is in the\nprocess of establishing a Baltic peace-keeping battalion\nwhich will be fully operational in the very near future.\nWith the consent of the Lithuanian Parliament, a group of\nLithuanian peace-keepers, serving within a larger Danish\nbattalion, is today a part of the United Nations Protection\nForce stationed in Croatia. I take this opportunity to thank\nDenmark and the other countries that provide continuous\nassistance in the creation of Lithuanian and Baltic\npeace-keeping units. In the future, within its financial\ncapabilities, Lithuania will continue to participate in similar\nUnited Nations peace-keeping and humanitarian missions.\nWith the expansion of United Nations membership, the\nrange of issues we are asked to discuss within the United\nNations has also increased, imposing new responsibilities\nand new demands on the Organization. It is very important\nthat the international community be properly represented in\nthe Security Council. Lithuania therefore supports\nproposals to expand the membership of the Council,\ncreating new permanent as well as non-permanent seats.\nOne of the principle guarantees of international\nstability is respect for fundamental human rights and\nfreedoms and their development and defence. It was, of\ncourse, within the framework of the United Nations that the\nfirst landmark international human rights documents were\nadopted.\nWe believe the establishment of the office of High\nCommissioner for Human Rights to be a timely decision.\nThe High Commissioner must become the overall\ncoordinator of United Nations activities in the field of\nhuman rights. The world clearly needs an institution that\ncan rapidly and effectively report human rights violations,\nparticularly those which pose a danger of escalating into\nprolonged conflict. Such reporting would enhance the\npolicy of preventive diplomacy.\nLithuania continues along the difficult road of reform,\nmaintaining a relatively high human development index, as\nreflected in the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s\n1994 report on human development, where it is in twenty-\neighth place. We are well aware of the particular\ncircumstances of this high ranking and of the fact that it is\ncalculated with the use of rather distorted gross national\nproduct statistics. Unfortunately, the use of these distorted\nfigures has led to excessive contributions to the United\nNations and to a reduction in assistance provided.\nAt the same time, Lithuania, like other Central\nEuropean countries, has despite the odds achieved a high\nlevel of development in education, science and culture.\nThis, too, is reflected in the human development index.\nThis state of affairs has two aspects. As Lithuania cannot\neffectively finance these areas from its own resources, an\noverall decline is unavoidable. Another possibility\nremains: with the help of the United Nations and other\norganizations, the decline may be halted in the fields of\neducation, science and culture. If the existing foundation\nis protected, recovery in the economic and social fields\nwill follow more rapidly. Adopting this second solution\nwould be less costly and more effective than allowing a\ncollapse of the system.\nLithuania, like other formerly central-command\neconomies, has inherited environmentally damaging\ntechnologies. While we have witnessed political and\neconomic change, the restoration of a balanced\nenvironment in our countries will take many years and\nrequire financial resources.\nAs the possessor of a powerful nuclear energy\nfacility, Lithuania is particularly concerned about nuclear\nsafety. Here, I wish to express our particular gratitude to\nSweden and other Western European partners for\nassistance they provide to increase the safety of our\nnuclear energy programme.\nLithuania welcomes the increased attention that\ninternational environmental organizations are giving to the\nconcerns of our region. I believe that combined efforts\nare capable of producing results much sooner than we\nfirst imagined. But, for this to occur, we must be assured\nthat assistance provided by the United Nations will not be\nreduced. Of particular relevance to my country is the\ntransfer of environmentally sound technology and\nknow-how. An ecologically aware civilization must\nbecome the goal of our era.\nIf the international community does not provide the\nnecessary assistance and cooperation the situation in our\nregion could change for the worse. The countries of\nCentral and Eastern Europe receive a small portion of the\ntechnical assistance provided by the United Nations, but\nit is employed in our region effectively and with visible\nresults.\nHere I should like to welcome the reforms initiated\nby the Secretary-General. We now see the first results of\nthe restructuring, and we are satisfied with the progress.\nWe are particularly encouraged by steps taken to increase\n5\n\n\nmanagerial and policy-making accountability within the\nSecretariat, as well as the simplification and streamlining of\nthe decision-making machinery. Lithuania supports and\npledges its full cooperation with the new Office of Internal\nOversight.\nI would also draw attention to the fact that the United\nNations Charter still contains certain outdated concepts\nconcerning enemy States. These are a relic of the Second\nWorld War. Therefore, I believe Articles 53 and 107 of the\nCharter ought to be amended.\nOne of this year\u2019s most important international events\nwas the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment held recently in Cairo. Next year the United\nNations will continue the tradition of transcontinental\nforums. The world social Summit in Copenhagen will\nafford us an opportunity to put people\u2019s concerns at the\ncentre of social policy. This is of particular relevance to\ncountries whose economies are in transition, where people\ncarry the burden of rapid economic, social and political\nchange.\nThe World Conference on Women, to be held in\nBeijing, will address the key question of how, in times of\nawesome change, men and women can work together for a\npeaceful world in which equality and harmony will be the\nnorm and reality of life.\nAt the beginning of my address I spoke of the wheel\nof human development being supported by five basic\nprinciples. Today we clearly face a time for decisions.\nEither that wheel will turn, slowly but surely, through the\njoint efforts of us all, taking us towards ever higher plains\nof progress, or it will stop turning, and if it stops it will\ninevitably begin to roll backwards - to chaos and barbarity.\nAs humanity crosses into a new millennium, we must\nnot allow the wheel to stop turning. This demands the\ncollective action of all States and peoples. That is why we\nmust always remind ourselves that no organization in the\nworld today can equal the authority, longevity, dynamism\nand vitality of the United Nations.\nThat which divided nations, States or continents\ncannot achieve alone they can and will achieve together as\nthe United Nations. I am convinced of this, as there is no\nalternative.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like sincerely to congratulate Mr.\nEssy on his election as president over the forty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly. His country and mine\nmaintain friendly diplomatic relations and close links\nstrengthened by the historic ties between Africa and Latin\nAmerica. I wish him success in his endeavours and offer\nhim the fullest cooperation of the Peruvian delegation.\nWe live in an age that confronts the international\ncommunity as a whole, and the United Nations in\nparticular, with big challenges. Representative democracy\nand the market economy have spread throughout the world,\nalong with an intensification of integration processes and\nthe globalization of trade.\nNevertheless, international peace and security have not\nyet been consolidated in all regions. We have witnessed\nevents such as the unexpected collapse of States that had\nseemed to be solid, episodes of massive violence within\nsome countries and the tragic and complex situations that\nresulted, persistent aggression against a Member of this\nOrganization and the exacerbation of nationalism in many\nparts of the world. All these things challenge the present\ncapacity of the United Nations to respond.\nFaced with such challenges, the United Nations must\nreaffirm its central role as the indispensable leader in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and in the\npromotion of world-wide development. This is its duty, not\nonly because of the universal character of the United\nNations system, but also because of the contractual\nsignificance of the instrument by which it was established.\nIn this respect, we must bear in mind that the\npotential of the United Nations as the foremost\ninternational Organization can be reinforced by increased\nand more efficient coordination with the regional\norganizations.\nBy the same token, we attach special importance to\nthe General Assembly\u2019s exercise of the powers assigned\nto it by the Charter, as well as to the expansion and\nreform of the Security Council. With regard to the latter,\nwe should seek to correct the imbalances in its present\ncomposition, improve its decision-making machinery and\nmake its working methods more transparent, while\nstriving to make its composition truly representative of all\nMember States of the Organization.\nAs the Secretary-General pointed out in his reports,\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) and \\\"An Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\" (A/48/935), it now appears to be politically\nfeasible to respond to the multiple requirements of\ninternational peace and security while encouraging\ncooperation in the social and economic field, because the\ncomplementarity of these elements is such that without\neconomic development there can be no peace or security.\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" must therefore be complemented\nby an agenda for development. In this way the United\nNations could lead the international community, in\naccordance with the purposes and principles of its\nCharter, and integrate the actions of our Organization with\nthe work of the Bretton Woods institutions, and above all\nthe World Trade Organization.\nIn this regard, we share the concern of the Secretary-\nGeneral, who has warned that the subject of development\nis in danger of vanishing from the United Nations agenda.\nWe must therefore emphasize that the grave problems\nrelated to development must be included in our\nOrganization\u2019s work and that developed and developing\ncountries must agree on the need to address, urgently and\nadequately, critical situations such as dire poverty.\nThe coming World Summit for Social Development\noffers us an opportunity that we must seize. Peru, which\ntook part in the early stages of the process that led to the\ndecision to convene that Summit, will contribute to it the\nnational programme for social development that the\nGovernment of President Fujimori has been carrying out,\na programme that gives priority attention to the basic\n10\n\n\nservices of health, education and the administration of\njustice, particularly for the poorest.\nIn the same context, Peru believes that the internal\nefforts of developing countries in the vital spheres of social\nand economic advance must be matched by high-priority\nmultilateral and bilateral cooperation.\nI must also observe that in most of our countries\nsocial development also means stability. Therefore,\ncontinuing democratization and modernization is largely\ndependent on the assignment of high priority to this\ninescapable challenge.\nAlong with the problems of development, the rapidly\nevolving situation today presents us, as an international\nOrganization, with a number of particularly complex\nsubjects. Outstanding among them is the process of\nreconciliation and peace in the Middle East, which will\nhave important effects on regional and world stability and\nsecurity, as well as on trade, regional cooperation and\ndisarmament. Peru supports this process, and believes that\nresolutions adopted in the General Assembly must properly\nreflect that reality and contribute to the maintenance of an\nappropriate political climate to advance the negotiating\nprocess.\nWe also welcome the new South Africa, which\nembodies the fulfilment of the essential principles of the\nCharter and which is a possible factor for regional stability.\nIt also provides an example of democratic change.\nThe tragic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which\nhas made clear the serious limitations of multilateral\norganizations, demands increased efforts by the\ninternational community to ensure an early and lasting\npeace.\nI now wish to address a subject that we cannot ignore,\none that affects the international community as a whole and\nthat is particularly delicate for my own country: the drug\nproblem. Peru reiterates its resolve to continue to fight\nillegal drug trafficking, as well as its conviction that this\nserious problem urgently requires the unwavering political\ncommitment of the international community. That alone\nwill make it possible to adopt concrete and realistic\nmeasures to stand up to this scourge in accordance with the\nmandates of the Global Programme of Action adopted by\nthe General Assembly in 1990.\nInternational coordination and cooperation against\ndrug-trafficking are indispensable. In that regard, I am\npleased to point out that the recent Summit of Presidents\nof the member countries of the Rio Group accepted the\nproposal of the President of the Republic of Peru, Alberto\nFujimori, to coordinate legislation to penalize money-\nlaundering, allow the confiscation of property linked to\ndrug-trafficking, establish swift extradition procedures,\npromote judicial and police cooperation on this matter and\nbolster cooperation for alternative development.\nMy country also pays special attention to human\nrights. Their promotion and defence constitute an\ninescapable obligation of the international community,\nwhich must therefore reinforce and improve current\nmechanisms of the system for the protection of human\nrights, in order to increase their efficacy.\nWe are pleased to note the growing recognition and\nsupport by this international Organization for those\ncountries that, like us, are continuing to struggle to defend\nlife and civilized ways of coexistence against the\nunjustifiable and irrational violence of terrorism. For us,\nthis means that the international community has made\nprogress, by recognizing that in countries such as Peru\nterrorist groups are the primary, the true, violators of\nhuman rights.\nIn the current context of renewal, we supported the\ncreation of the post of United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, in an effort to improve\nUnited Nations measures to prevent and monitor\nviolations of human rights, whether the violators be\ngovernment agents or others. It is a matter of pride for\nour region that a distinguished Latin American diplomat\nis the first to fill this high office.\nWithin this chamber last year, the President of Peru\nannounced that the leader of the bloodiest terrorist\nmovement in the Western Hemisphere - caught as a result\nof our successful campaign for national peace - had\nacknowledged in writing the clear defeat of his totalitarian\naims and his bloodthirsty methods. Today I am pleased\nto confirm that Peru is swiftly progressing towards\nreconciliation and peace. The Peruvian strategy, which\ninvolves the State and civil society, has borne fruit, as\nevidenced by the mass desertions of terrorists as a result\nof the \\\"repentance law\\\" passed on repentance and the\nreturn of peaceful villagers to their homes, with the\nsupport and backing of the State.\nMy country, having guaranteed democracy and\neconomic freedom, now has, after many years, excellent\nprospects. We have established a new national\n11\n\n\nenvironment by consistently applying economic, social and\npacification policies. The results prove that we have taken\nthe correct path, as shown by the growth in gross national\nproduct - 7 per cent last year, and projected to be between\n9 per cent and 10 per cent this year, figures which\nconstitute the highest growth rates in the hemisphere.\nThis new situation will allow us, for the first time in\ndecades, to give social issues the priority they deserve. The\neconomic policies followed in Peru have made possible a\nsocial programme implemented through non-inflationary\ninvestment, with our own resources. This programme has\nthe technical backing of international financial institutions\nand is in line with the conceptual approaches on social\ndevelopment promoted by the World Bank, the United\nNations Development Programme and a growing number of\nnon-governmental organizations that share a belief in\nputting the human being at the core of development efforts.\nTo do otherwise would be to make sustainable long-term\ngrowth impossible. This essential task for the whole of\nPeruvian society requires the cooperation and support of the\ninternational community.\nMy country\u2019s contribution to change in the world has\nbeen made possible by the efforts of our people, who have\nenabled us to enjoy internal peace, security, stability and\neconomic growth. The path we are taking leads the most\ntenacious nation in South America, a people of long-proven\ncreativity, on the threshold of a new millennium with the\nenthusiasm, the ability and the necessary tools for its\ndevelopment.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me, as President of\nColombia, to speak in the General Assembly, which, as the\nOrganization reaches the fiftieth anniversary of its\nestablishment, remains the principal forum for the\ndiscussion of topics of concern to mankind and for the\nsearch for peaceful solutions to its distressing problems.\nFifty years ago, when the United Nations system was\ncreated, the world hoped that the spectre of war was finally\nbeing laid to rest. But lack of understanding between\nnations, ideological fanaticism and the politics of force led\nto the world\u2019s polarization into two antagonistic blocs. For\nmany years, the cold war put on ice the hopes held at the\nbeginning for developing a world-wide system of\ncoexistence. Such coexistence reappears today when we\nsee a black person at the helm of South Africa; when we\nsee Palestinians and Jews discussing fruit groves in the hills\nof the Golan; and when we see all Berliners drinking good\nColombian coffee on the spot where the wall of infamy\nonce stood.\nBefore the end of this century, we shall have to strive\nto resolve peacefully the most important conflict to outlive\nthe cold war: the conflict with the brotherly Republic of\nCuba.\nWe now have the happy opportunity of reviving the\nspirit of the San Francisco Charter and of reinitiating the\ndeferred task of building a new world system based on\nsolidarity, respect for the self-determination of peoples\nand the real search for better living conditions for all - as\nwas stated a few years ago before the General Assembly,\nby a distinguished Colombian, Indalecio Li\u00e9vano Aguirre,\nin his capacity as its President.\nThe history of the 1990s must not be one more\nrecord of the frustration of our aspirations to peace, well-\nbeing and justice. Our objective can be nothing less than\nthe human person. Our actions must be directed towards\nthe struggle against poverty and for the attainment of\nsocial justice. Our commitment is to make the arbitrary\nuse of power and abuses of human rights things of the\npast.\nBut this task - this vital task - is not free of threats.\nNeoprotectionism threatens the free-trade prospects of\ndeveloping countries. It is true that tariff protectionism\nhas come to an end, but a new and dangerous form of\nprotectionism is now emerging: non-tariff protectionism:\nbarriers to the export of plants and vegetables, customs\nbarriers, quotas, anti-dumping clauses, social clauses, the\nrationale of \\\"reasons of State\\\", and fears of losing\nelections. We developing countries are no longer\nstruggling against the barbed wire of hostile tariff\nbarriers: we are struggling against an army of invisible\nenemies moved by the most diverse interests and\nsystematically opposed to the rhetorical aspiration to free\ntrade - an aspiration that would seem to have something\nin common with our feelings about paradise: we all want\nto get there, but not quite yet.\nImpoverishment is another threat. Granted, we are\nall committed to the openness of our economies, but that\nmust not mean that we can ignore the need to manage the\nobvious social costs. Unemployment, the postponement\nof social investment programmes and neglect of the living\nconditions of the rural population can ultimately\ndelegitimize in vast regions of the world - this, at least, is\ntrue of Latin America - the efforts made over many years\nto democratize our political systems. The only thing\nmore serious than poverty is impoverishment, and it is\nbeginning to make itself felt in many parts of the world.\nEither we leaders renew our commitment to the people or\nthe social costs of economic change will in the end\ndestroy our achievements in political consolidation.\nFinally, there is the threat of the formation of blocs.\nThe development of economic blocs runs counter to the\n6\n\n\nidea of a world based on the democratic rules of free trade\nfor all on an equal footing. What is at stake today is not\nthe exchange of goods and services but rather the exchange\nof the means necessary to produce those goods and\nservices.\nSelective appropriation of the means of production\nputs those of us in the developing countries in the worst of\nworlds. We do not have the means of production nor do\nwe have fair access to them, but we do have the arduous\nresponsibility of competing on an equal footing with the\nworld\u2019s most industrialized countries.\nIt is not a matter of repeating the third-world litany of\ncomplaints and demands. The point here is to define new\nrules that can enable us to gain access to technology and to\nfinance our infrastructures on favourable terms, that can\nenable us to reach acceptable levels of competitiveness, that\ncan enable us to break with dependency on the cartels of\nservice companies and to buy market outlets in a world\nwhere what counts and what is important is not producing,\nbut selling.\nThat aspiration to develop new conditions that can\nenable us to play a vital role within the new spectrum of\nworld forces must take the shape of a new development\nmodel for our countries, an alternative model which I\nshould like to discuss with you this afternoon in this Hall.\nI am speaking of an alternative model that will be an\nalternative to the protectionist system of the 1960s, for the\nglobalization of the economy requires not only open and\ncompetitive economies but an alternative to the\nneoliberalism that irresponsibly leaves it to the market to\ncorrect all imbalances.\nI am speaking of an alternative to the old assistance\npopulism, for there must be social change based on\neconomic criteria, and for an alternative to fierce\ncapitalism, which sets up the rule of every man for himself\nas a form of social selectionism.\nI am speaking of an alternative to the blind criteria of\npublic interventionism as well as an alternative to attempts\nto sell out the State to the highest self-interested bidders, to\nthe Government abandoning its own responsibilities with\nregard to the unprotected masses.\nI am speaking of an alternative to anachronistic\nconcepts of representative democracy but also of an\nalternative for meeting attempts to reduce the free play of\ndemocracy to sterile confrontation between private interests.\nThe objective of this alternative model, the model of\nthe South, should be the establishment of a new and more\nproductive citizen in the economy, a citizen who\nparticipates to a greater degree in politics and who is\nmore supportive in the social sphere.\nWords and phrases like \\\"social investment\\\", \\\"good\ngovernmen t\\\" , \\\"ag r i cu l tu ra l deve lopmen t\\\" ,\n\\\"competitiveness\\\", \\\"harmonization\\\" and \\\"gradualness\\\" are\nall part of a new alternative vocabulary that will enable us\nto speak the language of a new identity, of our own\nidentity as countries seeking our own way.\nThe new model of development, if it is to be\ngenuine and not simply an abstraction, must take into\naccount some basic elements.\nFirst, it must allow for the modernization of our\nproductive structures. We gain nothing if we continue to\nopen markets when we have nothing to sell, because we\nproduce nothing or very little.\nModernization goes hand in hand with the\ndevelopment of an adequate infrastructure of\ntransportation and communications and the optimum use\nof energy sources.\nWe must develop new conditions of productivity,\nespecially in the field of technology, and adopt more\nefficient and environmentally sustainable production\nprocesses. The world today is not divided between the\nhaves and the have-nots but, rather, between those who\nknow and those who do not, and we, the developing\ncountries, are among those who lack knowledge. We\nmust buy, develop and assimilate new technologies.\nSecondly, there is the concept of social solidarity.\nOur greatest challenge in this sphere is to give legitimacy\nto a new economic system through real social-\ndevelopment proposals. Investing in the human being is\nthe best business. Investment in health, education and\nhousing is highly profitable, not only in social terms but -\nespecially - in economic terms.\nThirdly, in addressing those two great revolutions of\ncompetitiveness and solidarity it is necessary to change\nthe ideas of those who today act as agents of the\neconomic process.\nWhat should the role of Government be? Above and\nbeyond the dilemma of privatization or nationalization,\nthe dilemma of whether or not to reduce the size of\n7\n\n\nGovernment, it is imperative that Government work, and\nthat it do so honestly. Good governance must be our goal\nin reforming Government.\nGood Government means building a new type of\nGovernment, one that promotes efficiency. It means the\ntraining of technically skilled bureaucracies. It means\ntransparency and the streamlining of administrative\nprocedures in such a way that the roots of corruption are\nextirpated. It means administrative decentralization and\ncitizen participation, and it means the organizing of civil\nsociety on bases other than the old contradictions between\ncapital and labour.\nFourthly, and lastly, we must bear in mind that this\nprocess is occurring in the context of the globalization of\nthe world economy and of interindependence among\npeoples. The principal problems affecting every country\ntoday are no longer merely national in nature; they are\nglobal, and for that reason they require the coordinated\naction of all nations.\nThe new cooperation the international community\nrequires is based on adjusting domestic policies to global\nobjectives within a framework of respect for the\nsovereignty of States, the principles of international law and\ndomestic legislation. Only if we can attain a new concept\nof cooperation will we avoid the pitfall of interventionism,\nwhich threatens to make its way through the open door of\ninterdependence and globalization. Cooperation, as an\nalternative to intervention, is the route that can ensure for\nthe community of nations the fulfilment of its aspirations\nfor peace and stability.\nI come from Colombia, a country that respects\ninternational law and the principles that ensure peaceful\ncoexistence; a country that has placed its faith in Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean integration; a country with a\ndynamic Constitution and an economy sound as few others\nin Latin America; a country that is moving forward thanks\nto the sacrifices and steadfast labour of its people, creative\npeople avid for progress and imbued with a sense of the\nmagic of life about which Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rques, our Nobel\nlaureate, has written; a country searching for peace because\nit so loves life.\nThe times we are now living in are times of crisis, but\nalso of opportunities. In Colombia we have had to learn to\nlive with terrible difficulties, always inspired by the biblical\ninvitation to maintain a vision as a people in order to\nprevail as a nation.\nI know that some here must have asked themselves\nwhy I have not referred in this speech to the problem\nwith which my country is everywhere associated: the\nproblem of drug trafficking. I have not done so because\nin Colombia we believe that we are entitled to be\nrecognized by other, positive factors: those that identify\nus as an honest, hard-working people that offers respect\nto friendly countries and expects respect in return.\nOf course, we have struggled and will continue to\nstruggle out of conviction, while paying a high price to\nfight the scourge of mankind that is drug trafficking. But\nI must confess that we sometimes feel alone in this task.\nWe feel alone when we see the drug consumption rates\nincrease in countries that request our help to defeat a\nproblem whose origins and consequences concern all of\nus. We feel alone, very much alone, when we see\nmayors who are avowed chronic drug users elected by\npopular vote. We feel alone when, after extensive efforts\nto eradicate illicit crops, the doors are closed to us when\nit comes to selling exactly those products that we have\nmanaged to cultivate, with great effort, as alternative\ncrops.\nTherefore, in the midst of this lonely struggle that\nhas left many victims dead in the fields, a struggle of\nwhich I count myself a fortunate survivor, what many of\nus want is for Colombia to be looked at from a different\nperspective - that it be recognized for the soundness of its\neconomy, that Colombia be taken into account when it\ncomes to investment decisions. We want those present\nhere to get to know the Colombian people - my people.\nWe want visitors to see our country so that many more\npeople the world over will be as much in love with my\ncountry as are those of us who were born, who live and\nwho will die in that privileged corner of Latin America -\nColombia.\n"

We wish you\nluck and success in your high office.\nWe thank Ambassador Insanally for the wise\nleadership with which he guided the forty-eighth session\nof the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.\nI am addressing the Assembly on behalf of a Europe\nthat has become more closely integrated as a result of the\nMaastricht Treaty, a Europe which in a few weeks\u2019 time\nwill admit four new members, and which intends to\nbroaden its cooperation based on partnership with the\nworld\u2019s other regions as well. I am speaking for a\nEurope that is committed to world peace and development\nand whose political actions are determined by its belief in\nindividual freedom, democracy and the rule of law, a\nEurope which sees in the realization of justice a crucial\nprecondition for avoiding war and the use of force and\nwhich is prepared to play its part in promoting the\neconomic development of all regions, the struggle against\nhunger, and measures to protect the Earth\u2019s natural\nsources of life. But I am speaking above all on behalf of\na Europe that wishes to place the United Nations in a\nbetter position to meet its foremost obligation as\nguarantor of peace and security in the world.\nNext year\u2019s fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations coincides with that marking the end of the\nSecond World War. The founding of the United Nations\nwas the response to that catastrophe, which had its origins\nin Europe. Today we can look back on impressive\nachievements by the United Nations. The 51 members in\n1945 have grown into a membership of 184. The United\nNations has thus developed into a truly universal\nOrganization.\nBy recently concluding the negotiations on the Law\nof the Sea Convention, the United Nations has made\noutstanding progress in promoting the reconciliation of\ninterests and the peaceful settlement of disputes around\nthe world. The choice of Hamburg as seat of the\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is a token\nof confidence in Germany and an obligation for my\ncountry.\nThe achievements of the United Nations are\nconsiderable, yet it is often the object of unfair criticism.\nThe United Nations can be only as good as its Members\nallow it to be. It needs their active support. Many of its\npersonnel, both soldiers and civilians, have done their\nutmost to help alleviate distress and save lives. No small\nnumber of them have lost their own lives in the process.\nWe pay tribute to them and honour their memory.\n15\n\n\nMany of us believed that the ending of the cold war\nwould usher in an era of peace. Today we know,\nunfortunately, that that hope was premature. Day in and\nday out, hundreds of people are falling victim to hostilities\nand thousands more are dying of starvation or disease.\nWhat has happened and is still happening in Bosnia,\nSomalia and Rwanda is appalling.\nThe European Union sees a response to these global\nchallenges in a strengthening of the United Nations and of\nthe multilateral system for the safeguarding of peace world\nwide, in more intensive preventive diplomacy and conflict\nprevention within the United Nations and regional\ninstitutions, in respect for human rights in the world and for\nthe rule of law, and in closer development cooperation in\nand among the regions.\nWe Europeans therefore welcome the report of the\nSecretary-General on an Agenda for Development. An\nAgenda for Development must soon find its place alongside\nthe Agenda for Peace. With his report, Mr. Boutros-Ghali\nhas again pointed the way for our Organization\u2019s future\ndevelopment and work. I wish to convey to him the\nappreciation of the European Union. We pledge a\nconstructive contribution to the debate on this document.\nFollowing the disaster of the Second World War,\nEurope had the opportunity for political renewal and it took\nthat opportunity. We Europeans derive courage and\nstrength from that renewal. No other region in the world\nhas such a dense network of regional, intergovernmental\nand supranational institutions, and no region in the world\nhas such close relations with other nations and their\norganizations. In the field of security, therefore, it is our\naim to create a network of mutually supporting institutions\nwhich will include, together with the European Union (EU),\nthe Western European Union (WEU), the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) and the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). All must\nwork closely with the United Nations. NATO and the\nWEU are already helping the United Nations to carry out\nits difficult mission in the former Yugoslavia.\nBecause our interests are interwoven as they have\nalways been, we will not allow ourselves to be discouraged\nby set-backs and will therefore do our utmost to bring\nabout a peaceful settlement in the former Yugoslavia. The\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has our\nunreserved support. The terrible war of destruction in\nBosnia and Herzegovina must be brought to an end.\nFederation is, we believe, a first and indispensable step\ntowards a peace settlement. Winter will be here soon and\nthe people will once again have cold and hunger to\ncontend with. But the precondition for lasting progress\nand for peace is the will for reconciliation among all\nethnic groups. The European Union is trying to help, and\nwe shall continue to do so. For that reason we have\nestablished an administrative office in Mostar, which\nbegan its work in July under the courageous leadership of\nHans Koschnick.\nThe entire international community must constantly\nmake it unmistakably clear to the Bosnian Serbs that in\nrejecting the peace plan they cannot reckon with tacit\napproval. There must be no toleration of a policy of war\nand expulsion. We seek a solution for the Croatian\nterritories under UNPROFOR protection which will be\nacceptable to both sides. The territorial integrity of\nCroatia must be respected. Autonomy arrangements will\nhave to be found for the Krajina Serbs. We Europeans\nbelieve that an extension of the mandate of UNPROFOR\nis absolutely essential for this purpose.\nThe United Nations envisages a world in which it is\nnot the law of the strongest but rather international law\nthat prevails. We Europeans share that vision. We are\neven more convinced by what has happened in the former\nYugoslavia that a relapse into divisive nationalism must\nbe prevented.\nWe, the Members of the United Nations, must\nsummon the strength to make a great joint effort to\nprovide the United Nations and its Secretary-General with\nthe means to meet their global responsibility. The United\nNations must become what its founding fathers aspired to\nin their noble vision nearly 50 years ago: mankind\u2019s\nprincipal guardian of the peace.\nBut we, the Members of the United Nations, must\nabove all be prepared to stand up for the cause of peace.\nThe members of the European Union have played, and\nare continuing to play, a major role in helping maintain\nor restore peace in many of the world\u2019s trouble spots on\nbehalf of the United Nations. We Europeans are guided\nby the following basic principles.\nFirst, for its peace-keeping measures the United\nNations should be able to rely on the broadest possible\nsupport and involvement of its Members. Such\noperations ought to foster peace and unity among them\nbut not divide the community of nations.\n16\n\n\nSecondly, we Europeans will always be in favour of\ngiving priority to non-military means of safeguarding peace\nwherever possible. But aggressors must also realize that\nthe United Nations is capable of military intervention where\nother means of achieving the aims of the Charter have\nfailed, and that it has the will to take such action.\nThirdly, the use of military force cannot be an end in\nitself. Successful peace-keeping presupposes an\nunequivocal mandate based on international law, a\nconvincing political plan for settling the conflict, and the\nequitable participation of the Member States.\nFourthly, we Europeans welcome the idea of stand-by\narrangements developed by Secretary-General\nBoutros-Ghali. It can effectively help reduce the length of\ntime between the decision to mount a peace-keeping\noperation and its actual implementation. Many members of\nthe European Union, including Germany, are willing to\ncontribute to stand-by arrangements.\nFifthly, in many countries military training is geared\nsolely to the traditional duties of the army. The specific\ntasks of peace-keeping require a completely different kind\nof training. The national preparation of Blue Helmets\nneeds to be coordinated to a greater degree by the United\nNations. What is needed for this are common training\nguidelines and the training capacity of the United Nations.\nJoint training and exercises are, at the same time, important\nsteps in confidence-building.\nSpeaking as the Foreign Minister of Germany, I would\nadd that last year I stated in the Assembly that my country\nwas willing to shoulder more responsibilities with regard to\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations. Today I can\nconfirm that Germany will be able to join fully in\npeace-keeping operations of the United Nations, the\nGerman Federal Constitutional Court having cleared the\nway a few months ago.\nThe European Union looks for the revitalization of the\nUnited Nations and its various organizations. In the course\nof the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly a\nworking group considered all aspects of the question of\nincreasing the membership of the Security Council and\nother matters related to the Security Council. The working\ngroup had a substantive and constructive discussion. Its\nreport states that\n\\\"... while there was convergence of views that the\nmembership of the Security Council should be\nenlarged, there was also agreement that the scope and\nnature of such enlargement require further\ndiscussion.\\\" (A/48/47, para. 8)\nSecurity Council reform is an important issue which\nrequires a productive outcome. These days, the most\nimportant decisions on security and peace are made in the\nSecurity Council. We therefore look forward to a report\non enlargement of the Security Council membership and\nrelated issues from the open-ended working group, and to\nproductive results.\nTransparency in the Council\u2019s decision-making\nprocesses is important, particularly in peace-keeping,\nwhere the interests of contributor nations are involved.\nIndeed, the cost of establishing and consolidating peace\nis enormous. The explosion of the peace-keeping budget\nhas almost brought the United Nations to a standstill. In\norder to overcome the financial crisis, three tasks must be\naccomplished.\nThe United Nations urgently requires more efficient\nmanagement and better organization. The creation of the\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services by the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session was an important step\ntowards this objective, and the fact that a German has\nbeen appointed as the first head of that Office is a mark\nof confidence in my country. Members\u2019 contributions\nmust be brought more into line with their actual capacity\nto pay. The aim of comprehensive financial reform must\nbe to establish a scale that is transparent and reliable,\nreflects Members\u2019 financial situations, is automatically\nadapted to changed national circumstances, and gives\nconsideration to the needs of countries with low per\ncapita incomes. But it is crucial that all Members be\nwilling to meet their membership obligations. We cannot\nhave a situation in which the United Nations has\ndifficulty carrying out its responsibilities because\nindividual Members feel exempted from their duties.\nIt is always better to prevent a fire than to have to\nput it out. The European experience is that conflicts must\nbe prevented -but this is not a purely European\nexperience. We bank on the power of preventive\ndiplomacy, confidence-building and the early detection of\nconflicts. The United Nations must further enlarge and\nstrengthen its instruments of preventive diplomacy. This\nincludes helping countries along the road to democracy\nand observing elections. The establishment of and respect\nfor human and minority rights, as well as measures to\nbring about economic and social stability, are other basic\nelements of prevention.\n17\n\n\nThe Declaration and Programme of Action of the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna calls\nfor more active implementation. Our priority must be to\nsupport the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In\naddition, we must substantially increase the resources\navailable in the United Nations for human rights activities.\nIt is, I believe, inadequate for the United Nations to provide\nonly 1 per cent of its funds for this task.\nWork on the establishment of an international criminal\ncourt must proceed apace. Human rights and the protection\nof minorities are indivisibly linked. Ethnic or cultural\narrogance and the curtailing of minority rights are one\ncause of the ever-swelling refugee flows in our world\ntoday. That is why minorities need the protection of the\nUnited Nations. We Europeans are striving to implement\nthis objective. In Europe, the Pact on Stability is designed\nto promote political stability and the protection of\nminorities.\nWe do not want to close our eyes to our own\nshortcomings. There must be no room for racism and\nxenophobia in Europe. That is why we have made it our\ngoal to develop a Union-wide strategy against racism and\nxenophobia in the course of the coming year. We need\nmore efficient management of humanitarian relief actions.\nThe need for resources and measures to alleviate emergency\nsituations through disaster relief operations is likely to\nincrease rather than decrease.\nWe expect the United Nations Disaster Relief\nCoordinator to ensure more effective coordination of\nmeasures within the United Nations system. He must be\nable to intervene before it is too late for the people\naffected. I should like to stress that point. Work on the\ndrafting of a convention for the protection of the work of\nhumanitarian organizations must be brought to a speedy\nconclusion.\nOne task of preventive policy as we understand it is to\ncombat terrorism. There is no justification for terrorism.\nDrugs and organized crime are an ever-increasing danger\nnot only to our young people, but also to the social and\npolitical stability of whole societies. To combat these\ndangers we need international alliances, and we need them\nurgently. The European Union offers comprehensive\ncooperation and the experience it has gained in this field.\nDisarmament policy, too, is preventive policy. Over\nthe past few years, major successes have been attained in\nthis field. These must now be made irreversible. The\nSTART Treaties must be implemented quickly. In Europe,\nthe Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces has proved to\nbe a milestone.\nUncleared mines are amongst the worst legacies of\nwar and civil war. We Europeans are in favour of the\nestablishment of a United Nations fund for mine-clearing\nand of more stringent provisions under international law\nto protect civilian populations.\nThe increasing proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, the continuing operation of unsafe nuclear\nplants and the smuggling of plutonium and other nuclear\nmaterials are among the new global dangers of our age.\nWe must counter them at the national and global levels.\nWe Europeans urgently appeal to North Korea to fulfil its\ninternational obligations. We in the European Union are\ncommitted to the indefinite, unconditional extension of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In\nGeneva, we want to arrive at a universal and universally\nverifiable comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. I\nbelieve that it is also high time that consensus was\nreached there on negotiations to bring about a ban on the\nmanufacture of weapons-grade fissile material.\nThe European Union, together with its partners, is\nproviding considerable funds for improving the safety of\nnuclear plants in the neighbouring countries to our east.\nWhat happened at Chernobyl must never, ever be\nrepeated. That would indeed be terrible.\nI appeal to all signatory States to ensure speedy\nratification and implementation of the chemical weapons\nConvention at the national level in order for it quickly to\nbecome fully effective.\nThe dangers I have just mentioned affect us all. As\nthose dangers have a global dimension, action by the\nUnited Nations, too, is called for. At its summit meeting\non 31 January 1992, the Security Council rightly stated\nthat the proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction\nconstitutes a threat to international peace and security.\nThe United Nations, the Security Council and all of us\nmust resolutely shoulder our responsibility to overcome\nthese new threats.\nA fair balancing of interests through the ever-closer\nregional integration of States and ever-increasing\ncooperation between regions of our planet in the spirit of\nArticle 1 of the Charter of the United Nations are the\nnecessary response to the huge economic, ecological and\nsocial challenges and the manifold ethnic conflicts we are\nfacing today - unfortunately, I might add. No one region\n18\n\n\nalone can master the global tasks confronting us. Nor can\nthe United Nations accomplish everything itself. The\nburden on the United Nations can be substantially reduced\nwith the help of regional associations and cooperation. We\nshould strive to achieve that objective.\nFor Europe, the post-war era has finally reached an\nend. A few weeks ago, the last Russian soldiers left\nGermany. Russian troops have also withdrawn from the\nBaltic States and other Eastern European countries. Now\nthe aim must be to prevent new divides from emerging in\nEurope. The European Union will become not a \\\"Fortress\nEurope\\\" but a Europe based on partnership and solidarity.\nThe European Union is supporting the countries of\nCentral and Eastern Europe on their way to democracy and\nthe establishment of market economies. The peoples in the\nreformist States fought for their freedom. We encouraged\nthem in their struggle and we will not now abandon them.\nWe will gradually smooth their path towards the\nEuro-Atlantic institutions. It is important to mention that\nthere will be no pan-European order of peace without or\nagainst Russia. The European Union has concluded\npartnership and cooperation agreements with Russia and\nUkraine. The North Atlantic Alliance\u2019s \\\"Partnership for\nPeace\\\" enhances Europe\u2019s security.\nThe CSCE, as a new instrument of conflict-prevention,\nconfidence-building and conflict resolution, can set an\nexample for other regions of the world. And it can, as a\nregional arrangement under Chapter VIII of the Charter,\nrelieve the United Nations as the guardian of peace. At the\nCSCE Summit in December the European Union will urge,\non the basis of a German-Dutch initiative, that the CSCE be\ngiven priority in conflict settlement and prevention within\nits area and that it be equipped accordingly.\nThe European Union wants to further extend and\ntighten its network of regional cooperation. Transatlantic\nrelations with the United States and Canada remain the\ncornerstone of European policy. The Summit meeting\nbetween the European Union and the United States in\nBerlin in July this year confirmed our resolve to further\nstrengthen transatlantic relations.\nWe are seeking closer relations with the countries of\nAsia. In Germany a few days ago we discussed with the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) the\npossibilities for even more intensive political and economic\ncooperation. We are following with interest ASEAN\u2019s\ninitiative to launch a policy dialogue on security in\nSouth-East and East Asia, and I wish to emphasize the\nEuropean Union\u2019s interest in and willingness to cooperate\nmore closely with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\nCouncil (APEC).\nThe European Council meeting in Corfu reaffirmed\nthat it attaches great importance to relations with the\ncountries of Latin America and with their regional\nassociations. The institutionalized dialogue with the Rio\nGroup has become for us an important element for the\nconsolidation of democracy and peace. We intend to\nbroaden the cooperation agreement with the States of the\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR).\nThrough its policy on the Mediterranean, the\nEuropean Union will have made available a total of\nroughly $9.6 billion between 1975 and 1996. Europe\nattaches great importance to security in the\nMediterranean.\nFrom the outset the European Union actively\nsupported the Middle East peace process, playing a\nleading role in international assistance for the\ndevelopment of the Palestinian economy and society.\nWith the roughly $600 million earmarked for direct aid\nfrom 1994 to 1998, the European Union is the\nPalestinians\u2019 largest international donor.\nCooperation in southern Africa has made great\nstrides. The course South Africa has embarked upon\nunder Nelson Mandela shows that it is possible for former\nadversaries to be reconciled and to shape a common\nfuture, given the necessary political will and wise\nleadership. At the Berlin conference with the States of\nthe Southern African Development Community (SADC)\nearly this month the European Union initiated a new\nphase of cooperation with southern Africa.\nWe in Europe want closer dialogue with the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on conflict\nprevention and security cooperation because we want\npartnership with the countries of Africa and thereby a\ngreater United Nations peace-keeping capacity.\nAgreement on an agenda for development is\nbecoming ever more urgent. One billion people in this\nworld are still living in absolute poverty. Global\nexpenditure on arms still amounts to as much as the\nincome of half of the five and a half billion people on our\nplanet.\nPoverty, increasing demographic pressure and\nirresponsible harming of the environment have made the\n19\n\n\ndangers to peace and stability greater, not smaller. The\nConference on Environment and Development in Rio and\nthe International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, which ended in Cairo a few days ago,\nconfirmed that there are no simple answers to global\nproblems. The two conferences none the less sent out an\nencouraging signal: there is growing recognition that we\nmust tackle such problems together, and this I believe is a\nvery important basis for the World Social Summit, which\nwill be held next year in Denmark.\nIn many countries women are still excluded from\nactive participation in public life. We expect the World\nConference on Women, to be held in Beijing next year, to\nheighten awareness of this.\nIn the Maastricht Treaty we Europeans for the first\ntime made development policy an integral part of a treaty\nsystem for Europe. We undertook to seek the sustainable\neconomic and social development of the South, to promote\nits integration into the global economy and to combat\npoverty.\nDespite the huge budget difficulties facing its member\nStates, the European Union has increased its development\nassistance from over $1 billion in 1988 to almost $3 billion\ntoday. Funds for emergency disaster relief and food aid\nwere increased to $1 billion this year. Even more\nimportant than such financial transfers, however, is the task\nof integrating the countries of the South into the world\neconomy. Without doubt, the conclusion of the Uruguay\nRound improved the chances of growth for all States\nparticipating in world trade. The aim now must be for the\nTreaty to enter into force on 1 January 1995, as planned,\nand for the newly-established World Trade Organization to\ncommence work.\nThe treaty-based cooperation between the European\nUnion and the other regions of the world is designed to\nfurther liberalize world trade. Every region should be able\nto participate in the European market. That is why we\nwant to complete the forthcoming review of Lom\u00e9 IV,\nincluding the new finance protocol, on time, and we are\nworking to achieve that end.\nSpeaking here last year I suggested the development\nof an early detection capacity for environmental disasters in\ndeveloping countries, and for the European Union I can\ntoday say this: World-wide energy consumption is\nincreasing, although the use of fossil fuels is already\nendangering climatic stability. In particular, we, the\nindustrialized countries, therefore need a more\nenvironment-friendly and resource-friendly attitude on the\npart of producers and consumers and increased recycling\nof raw materials. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions\nmust be tackled as a matter of urgency.\nThe destruction of the forests continues mercilessly.\nSoil erosion, loss of bio-diversity and impaired\nregeneration are the consequences. This destruction must\nbe halted. We Europeans will seek better international\ncooperation in the United Nations for the sustainable\nutilization and protection of the forests. The United\nNations is the guardian not only of peace, but also of the\nenvironment.\nThe historian Arnold Toynbee was right when he\nconcluded that people are entirely capable of learning\nfrom disasters and finding responses to historic\nchallenges. Today we Europeans know that only\nintegration and cooperation lead to the desired goal, and\nthe international community\u2019s response to the global\nproblems is and has to be to strengthen the United\nNations. Our central tasks for the future are: first, to\nsecure peace world-wide; secondly, to respect human\nrights and the rule of law; and, thirdly, to create the\nconditions for lasting stability through economic and\nsocial development.\nOur common goal is to create a better world for all.\nBut the determination with which we implement this goal\nin practice is the precondition for success against which\nwe will be measured.\n"

        "file_text": "\nMay I first congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\npreside over our work.\nI wish you every success in your presidency, and\nassure you that you may rely on the full cooperation of\nthe delegation of Chile.\nI wish also to greet the Secretary-General and to\nassure him once again of our support in the performance\nof his difficult task. When he visited Chile a few days\nafter the inauguration of President Eduardo Frei, the\nSecretary-General had an opportunity to appreciate our\nreadiness to cooperate in the activities of the United\nNations system, in the conviction that multilateral action\nwas essential to the strengthening of international peace\nand security and to the improvement of the living\nconditions of men and women the world over.\n36\n\n\nThe fall of the ideological barriers imposed by the\ncold war gave rise to expectations of an era of peace and\nglobal security. These expectations are strengthened by the\nspread of democracy and the emergence of a new\nawareness of the importance of human rights throughout the\nworld. At the same time, the processes of globalization and\neconomic interdependence are creating new opportunities\nfor progress and making the dissemination of technology\nand knowledge more feasible.\nNevertheless, five years after the end of the cold war\nwe must acknowledge that the reality has fallen far short of\nour dreams. The last decade of this century is one of\nuncertainty and contradictions. Regrettably, along with the\nsigns of hope there has been a re-emergence of many\neconomic, political, ethnic, religious and cultural conflicts\nand a tendency towards fragmentation and differentiation,\nwhich pose new threats to the peace and new challenges for\nthe international order.\nThis process of transition has enhanced the role of the\nUnited Nations as the guarantor of world peace and\nsecurity. It has compelled our Organization to assume new\nresponsibilities, both in negotiations for conflict prevention\nand in operations for the maintenance or restoration of\npeace.\nNevertheless, the immediate concern to maintain peace\nand security should not prevent us from recognizing and\nattacking the root causes of these conflicts. Poverty,\ninequality between individuals and between nations,\nenvironmental deterioration, unemployment and ignorance,\nover-population, disorganized migration, and discrimination\nagainst women and young people are today as important\nfactors in creating conflict as is military proliferation or\nideological confrontation - if not more so. Tackling these\nproblems requires using the imagination, creativity and\nsolidarity of the international community, as well as\nresources as large as or even larger than those being spent\ntoday on resolving conflicts that have already begun. The\nsecurity of human beings must be an international priority\nalong with widespread promotion of respect for human\nrights.\nIn March of this year a new phase in the Chilean\ndemocratic process began with the installation of the\nGovernment of President Eduardo Frei. The continuity of\nthis process has made it possible to strengthen the stability\nof democratic institutions and has increased respect for\nhuman rights in the country. Of course, we do not claim\nthat our democracy is perfect; many aspects of it still\nrequire further attention, and with that in mind draft\nlegislation on institutional changes is currently being\ndiscussed in the National Congress. Nevertheless, we are\ncertain that, together with the other countries of Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean, Chile will continue to\nadvance along the path of political stability, democratic\ninstitutionality and respect for human rights.\nOur recent economic experience has been successful.\nSince the return of democracy we have had an average\nannual growth of more than 6.5 per cent with a very low\nunemployment rate and controlled inflation. On the basis\nof these facts the Government has formulated an\nambitious modernization strategy focusing on three main\nareas: education and training, development of\ninfrastructure, and modernization of the State. The\nreforms in education seek to respond to the need for\neffective and creative integration of young people into\nsociety, and to meet the challenge of competitiveness.\nThe changes in the functioning of the State entail a\nspecial concern for ethics and probity in the exercise of\npower.\nAttainment of these priorities should enable us to\nraise our productivity and increase our capacity to\ncompete in international markets in the context of a\ngrowing open economy. We are concerned at the\ndifficulty the major countries are nevertheless\nexperiencing in opening up their economies in sectors that\nare vital to the equitable functioning of world trade. We\nreject an international trade system based on\nprotectionism by the powerful directed against those who\nare prepared to accept competition.\nNevertheless, economic advances would lack\nmeaning if they did not lead to a substantial improvement\nin the living conditions of the majority of Chileans. The\nGovernment recognizes this and has made the elimination\nof extreme poverty an essential priority of its programme.\nWithout equity, growth would lose its raison d\u2019\u00eatre and\nstability would be threatened by the tensions arising out\nof the privations experienced by large sectors of the\npopulation. Economic growth and social justice constitute\ntwo terms of a single equation.\nLatin America and the Caribbean are our natural\nframe of reference and external action as a region that\nshares both political and security interests and major\neconomic interests. The region has overcome the\npolitical, institutional and economic crisis which afflicted\nit in earlier decades. Most countries of the continent have\nrecently held elections, or will do so in the coming\nmonths. The tranquillity, openness and participation that\n37\n\n\ntoday characterize these processes are convincing proof that\nLatin America has embarked on a major process of\nmodernization and stability.\nAlong with this has come a major expansion of\ncooperation and regional integration. Integration initiatives\nand mechanisms of varying geographical coverage and\nthematic scope have multiplied. Chile has participated in\nthese efforts, negotiating economic complementarity and\nfree-trade agreements with the majority of the countries in\nthe region. In the immediate future, Chile hopes to be able\nto make a new contribution to the creation of a broad Latin\nAmerican economic area by achieving closer links with the\nCommon Market of the Southern Cone and by signing\ncomplementarity agreements with Ecuador and Peru to add\nto those already concluded with Mexico, Venezuela,\nArgentina, Bolivia and Colombia.\nWe also view with enthusiasm the strengthening of our\nlinks with the Central American and Caribbean countries\nwith which we have significantly expanded our political and\neconomic relations and cooperation.\nWe wish to promote a climate of peace, dialogue,\nsolidarity and mutual trust among the countries of the\nregion. We are sure that today this is more possible than\nbefore, given the presence in the region of more democratic\nregimes than it has ever had in its history.\nIn this context, the Rio Group has become a\nsignificant regional political cooperation mechanism, and its\nactivity has recently expanded to cover economic\ncoordination aspects. The strengthening of the Rio Group,\nwhich emerged from our continent\u2019s re-democratization and\nresurgence, is a key to Latin American\u2019s ability to speak\nwith a unified voice in the new international context. That\nis how our main partners in the world, with whom we meet\nperiodically in discussion forums to which we are attaching\nincreasing importance, perceive it.\nOur policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean\nis fully compatible with closer integration into world\nmarkets. Chile today is a country that is open to the world,\ndependent for 40 per cent of its gross national product on\nexternal transactions and seeking to strengthen its relations\nwith the dynamic centres of growth and technological\ninformation. We define our policy as an open regionalism,\none which seeks regional integration not in order to close\nits markets but in order to achieve greater integration into\nthe world economy.\nIn this connection, our preference for multilateralism\nis well known. We support all the phases of the\nextensive negotiations under the Uruguay Round of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and are\nnow in the process of ratifying the agreements reached\nthere.\nOur attitude in this respect matches that of our main\npartners in Latin America. During the eight years for\nwhich the Uruguay Round lasted the countries of the\nregion unilaterally reduced their tariffs by an average of\nmore than 50 per cent and contributed by making\nsignificant concessions, despite the fact that not all the\nobjectives they were seeking to negotiate were achieved.\nAccordingly, we now have the right to call for the\nresults of the Round to be implemented and, once the\nWorld Trade Organization has been established, for\nprogress to be made in discussion of the many problems\nthe Round left pending, especially in relation to\nagriculture and services.\nNevertheless, it is obvious that in the current phase\nof the world economy multilateralism is being\naccompanied by the negotiation of partial or regional\neconomic agreements which are progressively extending\nover a large part of international trading activity. Hence\nour interest in the integration progress in North America,\nour search for sounder and more imaginative patterns of\neconomic relations with the European Union, our\nimminent entry into the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council (APEC) and our constant readiness,\nshared with our region, to move ahead with economic\ncooperation with all regions of the world.\nCurrent international circumstances have led to\nprogress in various areas which it is important to\nemphasize: the defeat of racism and apartheid, progress\nin disarmament, the solution of international conflicts,\ncooperation and d\u00e9tente - all issues which have led to the\nstrengthening of the world Organization.\nChile salutes the people and the Government of the\nnew South Africa in the person of President Nelson\nMandela and welcomes the success achieved by the\nUnited Nations and by the South African people\nthemselves in building a democratic and just South Africa\nwhich respects the principles of the Charter of the United\nNations.\nWe wish also to express our support for the peace\nand negotiation process under way in Angola and\n38\n\n\nMozambique. We urge the rebel forces in both countries\nto negotiate seriously and in good faith to end this conflict,\nin compliance with United Nations resolutions. In the case\nof Angola, the date of 30 September set by the President of\nthe Security Council for the ending of the negotiations is\napproaching, and it is accordingly essential to arrive at a\nspeedy solution on the basis of the \\\"Acordos de Paz\\\".\nLet me also express our satisfaction at the progress\nmade through the agreements between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization, which are overcoming\nobstacles to the attainment of a lasting peace throughout the\nMiddle East. On behalf of my country, I wish to reiterate\nour support for the negotiations under way between Israel\nand Jordan, as well as those between Israel and Lebanon\nand between Israel and Syria.\nIn contrast to these positive steps, we view with great\nconcern the tragedy in Rwanda, horrified at its magnitude\nand at the inability of the international community to\ncontain it. Chile conducted a national campaign of\nsolidarity with the children of Rwanda which met with an\nextremely good response in our country. The risk is that,\nif efforts are not made to eliminate the deep-lying causes of\ntragedies such as this, other similar sources of tension may\narise in other countries, testing the capacity of our system\nto react.\nLikewise, we cannot fail to express our most profound\nconcern at and most energetic rejection of the extremes to\nwhich the fratricidal struggle in the former Yugoslavia has\nbeen taken. We urge the warring parties to abandon the\nuse of force as a means of solving their disputes and to\nsubmit them to the internationally recognized peaceful\nmeans of settlement.\nChile is also profoundly concerned at the situation in\nHaiti resulting from the protracted usurpation of power and\nthe non-implementation of the Governors Island\nagreements. The military occupation of a country is always\na regrettable occurrence that we should all like to avoid.\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that in this\ninstance such action was taken on the basis of a Security\nCouncil resolution and in response to repeated failure to\ncomply with international commitments, failure for which\nthe Haitian military alone are responsible.\nWe reiterate in this Assembly our support for the\nmeasures taken by the United Nations and, in particular,\nour full acceptance of the resolution adopted by the\nSecurity Council. The Government of Chile will fulfil its\ncommitments to participate in the reconstruction of Haiti,\nin the manner agreed upon with the democratic\nGovernment of that country, as soon as institutional order\nhas been restored.\nChile has cooperated in peace-keeping operations,\nand it has recently expressed its readiness to expand that\ncooperation, in the profound conviction that improving the\ncapacity of the United Nations system in these efforts is\na priority task. The current bureaucratic mechanisms,\nwhich place a very heavy burden on the countries\nproviding peace-keeping contingents, must be replaced by\nothers that will make it possible to provide the United\nNations with the best in human resources and equipment.\nIt is essential to reach agreement on a statute for\nprotection of United Nations personnel and to create an\ninternational fund to administer the financing of\npeace-keeping operations.\nThe new impetus in international disarmament\nnegotiations, particularly with respect to a nuclear-test-ban\ntreaty, increases the need for a global, democratic and\nparticipatory approach in this area. There is an urgent\nneed to increase the membership of the Conference on\nDisarmament - the only major multilateral negotiating\nforum on these topics - to make it sufficiently\nrepresentative and enable it to respond appropriately to\nthe new challenges.\nChile considers that prohibiting the use of fissionable\nmaterials for hostile purposes and universalizing security\nguarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States would be\npositive steps in the direction of nuclear disarmament.\nNevertheless, their success would depend on full\nacceptance of inspection and verification procedures. In\nstep with progress in the substantive negotiations, a need\nis making itself felt to extend and expand safeguards and\ncontrol regimes until they become universal, without\nthereby impeding the access of developing countries to\nsources of science and technology.\nThe recent ratification of the Treaty of Tlatelolco by\nChile, Argentina and Brazil, as well as Cuba\u2019s decision to\nsign it, will enable Latin America to become a genuine\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. This, together with the\nmanifest reduction in tension and armaments in the\nregion, constitutes an effective contribution by our region\nto world peace.\nIn this context, we have indicated our interest in\nbecoming a member of the Security Council for the\nperiod beginning 1996. We have done so convinced that\nChile can legitimately and adequately represent the\n39\n\n\ninterests of Latin America and the Caribbean in that\nimportant body.\nWe can and must make substantive progress in\ndesigning better systems for preventing conflicts or taking\nimmediate action to restore peace. But, unless we\nsimultaneously attack the enormous inequalities and\nprivations that lie at the root of many conflicts we shall not\nsignificantly reduce international tensions. The origins of\nthese tensions lie in the exclusion of major sectors of the\nworld\u2019s population from the benefits of the new order, an\nexclusion aggravated by population growth and by the\ncharacteristics of the new world economy, for when factors\nsuch as knowledge and technology come to outweigh\nothers, such as the availability of raw materials or low-cost\nlabour, the hopes of those who possess only an abundance\nof the latter are increasingly disappointed, thus widening\nand deepening the social gaps within and between\ncountries.\nFrom a bitter past, Chile has learned the lesson of the\nclose relationship that exists between peace, democracy,\neconomic growth and social development. The central\nobjective of a security policy is the security of individuals\nand of the communities in which they live. The\naccentuation of inequality or exclusion is not only ethically\nunacceptable, but also politically dangerous. No new\ninternational order will be stable or lasting if it is based on\nthe exclusion of the majority of those who comprise it.\nWe are convinced that the absence of democracy and\nthe lack of economic growth centred on the human being\nare at the root of the international instability that\ncharacterizes our era. President Frei has spoken of a\n\\\"diplomacy for development\\\", referring in these terms to\nthe necessity to adjust foreign policy to the objectives and\nneeds of each country and to the link that must necessarily\nexist between our international action and our internal\nobjective of growth with equity. We therefore attach the\ngreatest importance to the Agenda for Development that is\nunder discussion in the United Nations.\nThis was the thinking behind the convening of the\nWorld Summit for Social Development, unanimously\napproved by the General Assembly. The analysis by Heads\nof State and Government in Copenhagen next March should\nlead us to a new policy to combat poverty, promote\nemployment and accelerate social integration. In particular,\nwe believe that the social Summit should adopt a common\ncommitment to eradicate extreme poverty in the world\nthrough a concrete and efficient plan of action. What is\ndecided there will be intimately linked to the conditions of\nsecurity and coexistence in the emerging international\norder.\nThe social Summit, together with the recent\nConference on Population and Development, held in\nCairo, the World Conference on Women, to be held in\nBeijing in 1995, and the Secretary-General\u2019s proposed\nAgenda for Development, indicates the growing interest\nthat this Organization is taking in social issues.\nChile intends to comply with the agreements reached\nat the Rio de Janeiro Summit and to promote a new\npolicy on environmental issues. In this context, its\nNational Congress recently approved the Convention on\nBiological Diversity, and our ratification has just been\ndeposited with the United Nations. In turn, we are\nconvinced that environmental problems will remain\nunresolved, and may even become exacerbated, if the\nnecessary resources are not available to deal with them\nthrough joint action by developed and developing\ncountries. This is becoming increasingly apparent in\nsome developing countries, where poverty is accelerating\nenvironmental deterioration as a result of the excessive\nand uncontrolled use of certain resources.\nThe dual task of maintaining peace and at the same\ntime creating conditions for the elimination of structural\nsources of conflict is an enormous challenge to this\nOrganization. Nevertheless, we are convinced that if we\ndo not take up the challenge we shall reach the beginning\nof the next millennium without having laid the real\nfoundations for a new international order that will permit\nthe peaceful coexistence of mankind.\nTaking up this challenge is not a task for the major\nPowers alone, although their involvement is essential;\nrather, it is a task for all nations capable of making a\ncontribution - especially the medium-sized countries,\nwhich make up a large part of the international\ncommunity.\nChile is prepared to be a part of this effort, as are,\nwe are sure, all the countries of Latin America. The\ncentral role of this Organization must be strengthened and\nsupported in the crucial years that lie ahead, for this is the\nonly way to ensure that the settlement of conflicts does\nnot alter international legality, that arbitrary intervention\nis prevented and that the rights of the weakest are\nrespected.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by\nextending my congratulations to Mr. Amara Essy on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\nninth session. It is a fitting acknowledgement of his\nconsiderable experience, as well as a tribute to his country\u2019s\nhigh standing in the international community.\nI should also like to offer greetings and special words\nof gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for the attention and careful consideration he\nhas accorded to my country\u2019s problems and for his selfless\ndevotion to the cause of securing a safer and saner world\nfor future generations. The Georgian people are looking\nforward with great anticipation to his forthcoming official\nvisit to Georgia.\nFirst of all, I would like to convey to the Assembly\nthe greetings and best wishes for productive work from the\nHead of State and Chairman of the Parliament of the\nRepublic of Georgia, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze.\nJust over two years have passed since the day I had\nthe privilege of ushering my country into the United\nNations as its one hundred seventy-ninth Member and\naddressing the Assembly from this rostrum. It was a\nmoment of joy and celebration for my nation.\nMany events have taken place in those two years, and\nthey certainly cannot serve as a basis for euphoria and\ncomplacency.\nMy country has only recently set out on the arduous\njourney of building a democratic society. It is encountering\nnumerous internal, as well as external, problems in its\nefforts. Despite fair and democratic elections and the\nforming of government structures, the country continues to\nlanguish in a deep economic and political crisis.\nThe international community has extended a helping\nhand to Georgia, and I should like to convey our\nappreciation and gratitude to the Governments of the United\nStates of America, the Russian Federation, Germany, other\nStates members of the European Union and Turkey, to\nname but a few, as well as to the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies, for their invaluable assistance to my\ncountry in times of hardship.\nGranted, a large measure of the problems facing\nGeorgia and all those nations which have only recently\nreverted to independence and normal development have\ndomestic roots and must be addressed, first and foremost,\nby the countries themselves. But let us leave the internal\naspect aside for the moment and concentrate on the\ninternational environment, of which these nations, as well\nas all other nations, are a part.\nWith the demise of the cold war the world\nunderwent profound changes. The risk of an all-out\nnuclear catastrophe receded, and the world thus became\na less dangerous place; but at the same time it became\nless stable and less predictable. The relationship between\nStates and other actors on the international scene has\nchanged, too.\nThe system of post-war international relations was\ntailored to the economic, political, ideological, geographic\nand other realities of that era. One of these realities was\na deep realization of the fact that a totalitarian regime of\nthe fascist variety had been defeated. Therefore, despite\nits major flaws, the post-war bipolar system generally\nresponded to the demands of the times and somehow\nensured security and stability on our planet.\nOur generation witnessed the fall of another\ntotalitarian regime with the downfall of communist\nideology and of its followers. This resulted in deep\nchanges in the nature of international relations. Different\ndemands are being dictated by the times and different\nchallenges are now facing the community of nations.\nThis end of a whole era of human history, however, was\nnot followed by the creation of a new system of\ninternational relations that would correspond to the\nrealities of the contemporary world, as happened some 50\nyears ago. International political institutions, as well as\npolitical thought in general, found themselves unprepared\nfor the changes, and they continue to apply stop-gap\nmeasures to this very day.\nToday\u2019s political leaders seem to have\nunderestimated both the essence and the importance of\nthese changes; hence the inability to cope with today\u2019s\nproblems or with the challenges of the\npost-confrontational world. The infrastructure, principles,\ntools and mentality of international relations need to be\nadapted to the changed circumstances.\nTherein lies the external aspect of the problems that\nthe newly emerging independent States, including my own\ncountry, are facing. They are taking their first unsure\nsteps on the road to a democratic society, a long and\ndifficult road in a world that is still reeling from the\nnature of the changes and that realizes neither the extent\nof the predicament these nations face nor the stake it has\nin their existence and stable development.\n24\n\n\nMany of these nations, including my own, can,\nunfortunately, be described as \\\"hot spots\\\": they are the\nunhealed wounds that cover the body of our planet. These\nopen wounds cry out for radical surgery, while the\npeace-keeping activities of the international community,\ndespite its best efforts, tend in some cases to resemble\ncautious treatment with prescribed medication.\nPerhaps, as I am the Foreign Minister of Georgia, it is\nnot for me to complain about the deficiencies of the United\nNations in terms of its peace-keeping activities. The\nOrganization as a whole, its Security Council,\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his Special\nEnvoy, Ambassador Brunner of Switzerland, have accorded\na great deal of attention to the problems of my tormented\ncountry. On the issue of Georgia\u2019s Abkhazia region alone,\nnine Security Council resolutions have been adopted,\nnumerous missions have been dispatched and the mandate\nof the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia\n(UNOMIG) has been extended. Alas, this has not proved\nto be sufficient. Clear decisions and bold, timely action are\nwhat the peoples of the world expect of the United Nations\nand of the Member States that make up the Organization.\nIn this regard, I would like to note how useful and\ntimely the Georgian Government found the recent visit to\nGeorgia of the United States Permanent Representative to\nthe United Nations, Ambassador Madeleine Albright. That\nvisit also demonstrates the attention President Clinton\nattaches to events in Georgia.\nWhile I would not want to belabour the issue of \\\"hot\nspots,\\\" the predicament of my own country does not allow\nme to ignore this problem altogether. We would hate to\nthink that yet another experiment is perhaps being\nconducted in Georgia, the result of which may well have a\ndirect bearing on the security and sovereignty of other\nnations.\nIt is hard to describe the disappointment - and\nsometimes apathy - which the Georgian nation is feeling\nwith regard to whether the international community will be\nable to promote a peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian\nconflict.\nThese feelings have created a dangerous and volatile\npolitical situation domestically. A wave of indignation is\nrising in Parliament and among the people at the inability\nto resolve this conflict - and the efforts to do so have been\ngoing on for more than a year now - and allow almost\n300,000 displaced persons, who escaped physical\nextermination, to return to their homes and continue their\nlives.\nAt the heart of the Abkhazian conflict is an attempt\nby forces of aggressive separatism, bolstered by external\nsupport, to wrench a piece of territory away from a\nsovereign State and to create, in that part of Georgia, a\nprovincial dictatorship based on ethnic hatred, intolerance\nand discrimination.\nWe appealed to the United Nations in the hope that\nit would be responsive to our desire to settle the conflict\nby peaceful means through a United Nations\npeace-keeping operation. But our hopes were only\npartially fulfilled. Despite almost a dozen resolutions of\nthe Security Council, Member States could find neither\nthe financial resources, the military contingents nor the\npolitical will to order a peace-keeping operation in\nGeorgia.\nConvinced of the possibility of a fair solution under\nthe auspices of the United Nations, the Georgian\nGovernment has been negotiating with the separatists in\ngood faith all this time under the auspices of the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, with the Russian\nFederation as facilitator and the Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as an observer. As a\nresult, a number of agreements have been signed, which\nare designed to promote the return of the displaced\npersons to their homes and a settlement of the conflict.\nBut the bitter memory of a string of broken promises\nand unfulfilled obligations on the part of the separatists\nconfirms how naive it is to expect a forthcoming position\nfrom a regime that conducts \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and\ngenocide against the Georgian population. Predictably,\nthe Abkhazian separatists are using far-fetched pretexts to\ncontinue ignoring their commitments under the\nagreements that have been signed.\nFrustrated in its hopes for a United Nations\npeace-keeping operation in Abkhazia, the Government of\nthe Republic of Georgia sent a similar appeal to the heads\nof the States members of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS). A decision was reached and a\nCIS peace-keeping force was deployed in the zone of\nconflict. While its presence is beneficial and provides\nhope for a settlement, we feel that it could be more active\nand proceed beyond the stage of disengaging the parties\nin conflict.\n25\n\n\nThe Abkhazian conflict is not a problem for Georgia\nalone. Believe me, I am not saying this in order to lay our\nproblems at somebody else\u2019s doorstep. This conflict has\ndirect and dangerous implications for the entire world.\nThere are also compelling reasons why the world should be\nconcerned with finding a solution to this problem.\nAbove all, we believe that the international community\nsimply cannot act as an outside observer when a blatant\nattempt is being made against the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of a Member State and when peace and stability\nare threatened. Allowing separatism to attain its goals in\none country would set a precedent that could start a chain\nreaction throughout the world. And how many of us\nrepresented here today can safely say that their countries,\ntheir peoples, are immune from this danger?\nAnd, lastly, the Caucasus is one of those areas in the\nworld which have a geopolitical importance and bearing on\nthe stability of large regions of the planet. The Caucasus\nis one of the world\u2019s few crossroads where North, South,\nEast and West meet, and where continents, cultures,\ninterests and strategies encounter one another. If peace and\nstability cannot be maintained in the Caucasus, they cannot\nbe maintained anywhere.\nIn this regard, it is tragic that our closest neighbours,\nArmenia and Azerbaijan, have been unable to resolve their\ndifferences for so many years now. This conflict, too, tears\nat the fabric of the Caucasus and greatly increases the\ninstability of the region, as well as the misery of hundreds\nof thousands of people.\nIt is my Government\u2019s firm position that the\nAbkhazian conflict can and should be resolved by peaceful\nmeans. A great deal of effort, delicate statesmanship and\ndeep commitment are required from all sides.\nThe Georgian Government has to be very meticulous\nin elaborating a modern, workable and fair structure for its\nethnically and culturally diverse population, a diversity\nwhich throughout the centuries has been a source of\nfriendship, stability and pride, and never of tension or\nhatred. Most important, it has to create a strong economic\nbase for its people, one that would prevent economic\nhardships from taking on a political and ethnic character.\nGeorgia will never accept the loss of any part of its\nterritory. Not only because its territory is not large, but\nalso because what it has is incontestably its own - every\nsquare inch of it. The leaders of the Abkhazian separatists\nhave to realize this. They too have to find the political\ncourage and will, the flexibility and the foresight, to\nnegotiate in good faith and come to a settlement that\nwould be fair and lasting, so that future generations of\nGeorgians and Abkhazians could forget this one dark\npage in their fathers\u2019 lives and pick up in friendship and\npeace where their grandfathers left off.\nThe Russian Federation is an active participant in the\nprocess designed to find a peaceful solution to the\nAbkhazian conflict. It has taken on a great responsibility\nwith regard to this peace process. We firmly believe that,\ndespite the feelings of some political groups, the Russian\nFederation, as a great Power - and President Yeltsin, as\nthe leader of that nation - does indeed want to see a\nstrong, stable, sovereign, united and friendly Georgia on\nits southern border. Any other considerations would be\ncontrary to logic. We are gratified that in his address to\nthis Assembly a few days ago President Yeltsin alluded\nto this when he said that Russia\u2019s relations towards other\nStates members of the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates are based on good will and mutual benefit. In\nshort, it is a time to think not about the mistakes of the\npast, but about the possibilities for the future.\nGeorgia has only recently joined the community of\nnations as a full-fledged member. And yet this period has\nbeen filled with events of great intensity and emotion for\nus. We feel an obligation to share our experience and\nthoughts in a number of areas which, we believe, will\ncontribute to the effectiveness of our collective efforts in\nthe future.\nWe live in troubled times and are witness to rapid,\nunpredictable changes in the world. It is of paramount\nimportance that contemporary political thought bring\nexisting international institutions into conformity with the\ninternational political realities of today. It would seem\nthat even such a representative body as the United\nNations, if it is to continue to be ahead of events and\nfulfil its role as the parliament of man in a new situation,\nmay have to effect some changes in its structure.\nThe reforms - prompted by the times - which the\nOrganization is about to embark upon, the efforts of the\nSecretary-General to implement them, and the consent of\nthe majority of the Member States are evidence that the\ntime has come for a new era in international relations.\nThe number of Member States has more than\ndoubled since the creation of the United Nations. We\nfully support the proposal to reflect these changes by\nincreasing the numerical composition of the Security\n26\n\n\nCouncil to 21, and we believe that the candidacies of\nGermany and Japan are appropriate for inclusion as new\npermanent members of the enlarged Security Council.\nApart from reflecting the political and economic weight of\nthese nations, this would also enable us finally to bring to\na close the legacy of the Second World War and the cold\nwar.\nIn considering the possibilities for increasing the\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members of the\nCouncil, one of the main criteria, in our view, should be the\ninvolvement and role of member States in maintaining\nuniversal peace and stability. Although we see this\nconsideration as a crucial one, other aspects, such as\nequitable geographical representation, should not be\nneglected either.\nThe task of creating a modern comprehensive system\nof ensuring peace and security in the world requires an\nincrease in the effectiveness of the International Court of\nJustice, the main judicial body of the United Nations. We\nshare the concern of the Secretary-General that the Court,\nthe most important instrument for the settlement of\ndisputes, is not being fully utilized for this purpose. More\nefficient use of the International Court would, undoubtedly,\nreinforce the ability of the United Nations to promote and\nstrengthen peace. In this regard, we fully support the\ninitiative of the Secretary-General to recognize the universal\njurisdiction of the International Court, in accordance with\nArticle 36 of its Statute, and on the basis of the\nrecommendations put forward in the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277).\nEfforts aimed at creating a comprehensive system of\ninternational security can be effective today only if they are\napplied at both the global and the regional level. In our\nview, the ties between the global and regional security\nsystems are inadequate for today\u2019s needs, and are\nmaintained in a haphazard way. In this regard we consider\nit timely to raise the issue of achieving a higher level of\ninteraction between global and regional security systems by\nconcluding a series of special \\\"form\\\" treaties that will\nensure more effective use, in close coordination, of their\nrespective mechanisms.\nWithout prejudice to United Nations rules and\nregulations and to the provisions of the Charter, or to the\nstatutes of the regional systems, these treaties should\nprovide, inter alia, for regional organizations to exercise\nconsultative and controlling functions on behalf, and on the\nauthorization, of the United Nations.\nIn various international forums we often discuss the\nspecific challenges of the post-confrontational world.\nSeparatism, especially in its aggressive, extremist form, is\none of the most dangerous of these challenges, and it is\nspreading like a cancer all over the planet. We believe\nthat the creation of a legal basis for the containment of\naggressive separatism is imperative and long overdue so\nthat situations, such as the one in Georgia, will not flare\nup in other parts of the world in future, or if they do, they\nwill be localized and defused in a timely manner.\nWe propose that clear provisions be inserted into\ninternational legal documents, outlawing aggressive,\nextremist separatism from its first stirrings. It is\nbecoming more and more clear that the mere reiteration\nand confirmation of the principle of territorial integrity\nand the inviolability of borders is insufficient, all the\nmore so since it is being flagrantly disregarded in many\ninstances.\nThese legal provisions should also envisage a strict\nembargo on military deliveries and swift, surgical\neconomic measures against separatist movements that\nhave turned to armed struggle and violence, as well as a\nmechanism to use, in exceptional cases, the most decisive\nmeasure - military force.\nThe military forces for these operations could be set\nup in one of two ways: either United Nations stand-by\nforces, an option which would entail considerable\nfinancial expense, or special well-trained units within the\narmed forces of each Member State which, when needed,\ncould be put under the direct command of the United\nNations Military Staff Committee, which itself could\nbecome more active and energetic.\nWhile the second option seems more realistic at\npresent, I would still like to stress the virtues of early\npreventive measures against such conflicts. Perhaps many\nof them could be localized and defused at an early stage,\nif the United Nations had relatively small, mobile forces\nof rapid reaction and deployment at its disposal. These\nforces could be made up on an international voluntary\nbasis, thereby emphasizing their impartial and unbiased\nnature. They could be rapidly deployed in the conflict\nzone and, acting within a limited mandate, could ensure\nthe disengagement of the conflicting parties in order to\ncreate the conditions for the deployment of a United\nNations peace-keeping force.\nIn this regard, it would also seem indispensable to us\nto set up a special department within the United Nations\n27\n\n\nSecretariat the sole purpose of which would be to work to\nresolve conflict situations. Ten highly experienced and\nrespected political figures could form the nucleus of such\na department. To perform their functions they would be\nvested with special rights and obligations.\nWithin such a department a special unit could be set\nup to coordinate the actions of the rapid deployment force.\nIt would ensure the collection of information and\nintelligence data, and generally function as operations\nheadquarters. The unit could also provide valuable\nearly-warning information on potential conflict situations\ninvolving separatist tendencies.\nTo anticipate a natural question on the financing of\nsuch forces, I should say that, yes, it will undoubtedly\nentail additional financial, material means and human\nresources. This, however, is a case of the end clearly\njustifying the means. As we have paid a far greater price\nfor being late so often in the past, the international\ncommunity can no longer afford such a luxury.\nA few days ago a proposal was made very forcefully\nfrom this rostrum that, in order to safeguard and uphold the\nrights of national minorities, the principles of the\nDeclaration on the rights of national minorities should be\nembodied in the legislation of all member States. We\nfirmly support the principle of providing national minorities\nwith wide political, economic and cultural rights, and of\nensuring civil and human rights for everyone. We would\nthus like to go a step further and propose to codify all\naspects of this issue.\nSince every right presumes a responsibility, we believe\nthat it is imperative that international legal documents and\nnational legislations of Member States, along with the rights\nof national minorities, also incorporate provisions on the\nresponsibilities of these minorities towards the country of\nwhich they form a part.\nIn view of the rapidly growing role of individual\nleaders and personalities in international relations today, it\nwould seem appropriate to us to consider also the issue of\nresponsibility for an individual\u2019s role in the violation of\nhuman rights and liberties of persons, or groups of persons.\nThus, we fully support the proposal to work out a\ndeclaration on the rights and responsibilities of individuals,\ngroups and political bodies to ensure commonly accepted\nfreedoms and human rights. It is precisely in this context\nthat Georgia supported the creation of the post of United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nI have attempted to outline some of my\nGovernment\u2019s thoughts with regard to the changes that it\nthinks should be made in the structure and work of the\nOrganization in view of the many profound changes in\nthe international landscape today. While these are just\nsome elements, a comprehensive and balanced vision of\nthe needed changes is laid out by the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" and\nother documents. The implementation of the changes\nwould go a long way towards eliminating many of the\nproblems that we are discussing in this Hall and would\nalso represent, as Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze put it so\naptly, a very timely \\\"blood transfusion\\\" for the entire\ninternational system.\nAn important period is approaching in the life of the\nOrganization. Next year we will be commemorating the\nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\nWe have reached a mature age which allows us to take\nstock of the Organization\u2019s many accomplishments, but\nalso one that obliges us to look ahead to what still needs\nto be done.\nA half century of existence and experience confers\neven greater responsibility upon the Organization, as well\nas upon individual Member States. It imposes grander\nobjectives, but also opens up wider horizons. Some of\nthese objectives can be attained in our lifetime, while\nothers will be left to succeeding generations. It is our\nresponsibility to provide a legacy which will serve as a\nstepping-stone for mankind to make a leap into the\ntwenty-first century and land softly on solid ground.\nGeorgia is a small country, but it is a democratic\ncountry, and its foreign-policy objective is to have\n28\n\n\npeaceful, friendly relations with all the nations of the world.\nGeorgia will not be a passive observer of international\nevents; it will carry its fair share of the responsibilities of\nthe international community and make its contribution to\nachieving our common goals.\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation welcomes the\nelection of Ambassador Amara Essy as President of the\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly with a\ngenuine feeling of great pride and satisfaction; he is not\nonly our neighbour in the West African subregion, but a\nseasoned diplomat. He is certainly no stranger here,\nhaving served his great country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, as\nPermanent Representative at the United Nations for many\nyears. We in the Gambia hold him in high esteem for his\nconstructive and positive contributions to problems of\ncommon concern, both at the bilateral and multilateral\nlevels. I have no doubt that those qualities, for which he\nis well known, will contribute immensely to the\nsuccessful conclusion of our deliberations. I should\n13\n\n\ntherefore like to congratulate him warmly on his\nassumption of office and to assure him of the full support\nof my delegation in carrying out his important mandate.\nLet me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to\nAmbassador Insanally for the excellent manner in which he\nperformed his duties during his tenure of office last year.\nIn the same vein, I wish to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his untiring efforts\nand effective leadership in ensuring the realization of the\nideals for which our Organization, the United Nations, was\nfounded.\nMy delegation joins many previous speakers in\nwholeheartedly welcoming South Africa to the Assembly\nafter a 20- year absence. The advent of a non-racial,\ndemocratic Government in South Africa symbolized a\nsignificant turning point in the constitutional and colonial\nhistory of South Africa, in particular, and of Africa in\ngeneral. The resilience and resourcefulness that have\nguided and inspired the people of South Africa in the\ncrucial years of their march to a non-racial and democratic\nGovernment will, I have no doubt, serve as important assets\nin South Africa\u2019s effective participation in the work of the\nUnited Nations.\nOn 22 July this year there was a peaceful removal of\nGovernment in the Gambia, when it was replaced by the\nArmed Forces Provisional Ruling Council under the\nchairmanship of His Excellency Lieutenant Yahya A.J.J.\nJammeh. This change was caused by a series of events and\ndevelopments within the country that the previous\nGovernment had neglected and in some cases had refused\nto address. The continued abuse and misuse of political\npower and of public office, coupled with serious corrupt\npractices at various levels of Government departments,\nnecessitated this action.\n\nThe Gambia has since independence in 1965 enjoyed\na relatively long period as a democratic State and as a\npolitically stable country. We acknowledge this\nachievement, but at the same time we also have good\nreasons why the Government in power had to be removed.\nIn the evolution of nation States a stable political\nsystem is essential in any country for peace, security,\nstability and development. When that stability comes under\nincreasing strain, however, and is threatened from within by\ncertain important officials of Government and politicians\nalike, the preservation of that stability and national\nintegrity becomes more important than anything else.\nThere is no political system that is perfect. We take\nthe view that when a democratic political system is under\nattack by some unscrupulous individuals holding public\noffice through corrupt practices and other selfish acts, in\nopen violation of the moral tenets of honesty,\ncommitment, discipline and hard work, it becomes\nnecessary to institute corrective measures to stop and\nprevent that system\u2019s decay and instability.\nThe privilege of being the people\u2019s representatives\ndoes not confer any rights that entitle those\nrepresentatives to do anything other than the people\u2019s\nbusiness. The restoration of public trust and confidence\nin government in the older democracies is an\ninstitutionalized process that has acquired value and\nstability. The mechanisms that protect the State and\nallow for a peaceful and acceptable mode of restoration\nof public trust and confidence have been tested and\nproved effective over time.\nThat action is reinforced by the fact that the strength\nof democratic societies lies with the people, who freely\nparticipate in the political process and select or elect their\nrepresentatives. The legitimacy of government derives,\ntherefore, from the expressed will of the people to have\na government that will promote and protect their rights as\nwell as the collective interest of society.\nIn the newer democracies, however, where there are\nno mechanisms or institutions that can protect and\npreserve the essence of the democratic process, there has\nbeen a tendency, in response to a moral imperative, to\ntake radical measures that are intended to arrest the abuse\nof political power and the misuse of executive authority\nin the interest of society as a whole.\nWe wish to emphasize that the events that took place\nin the Gambia in July this year must be understood as\npolitically necessary to allow for corrective measures to\nbe put in place and to usher in a new and equitable\ndemocratic political system. In this connection, the\npresent provisional Government\u2019s overriding objective is\nto set up those institutions that would provide the\nnecessary checks and balances and thus enhance the\ndemocratic process in the Gambia and the right of the\npeople to elect a government of their choice.\n14\n\n\nThe essence of a democratic political system is, in\naddition to its inclusive character, its ability to promote the\npolitical, economic, civil, social and cultural rights of the\nindividual and of the community as a whole. Any\nunbalanced approach to the promotion of those rights\nrenders the system less democratic, less responsive and thus\nmore suspect.\nAny democratically elected Government that only\npromotes the civil and political rights of its people and\nneglects the promotion of their social, cultural and\neconomic rights, or that deliberately fails to provide equal\nopportunities for all its people, forfeits, in our view, its\nright to govern. The challenge that faces democratic\nGovernments - and any Government, for that matter - is\nhow to promote that cluster of human rights without giving\nany undue attention to a few of them. In other words, the\npromotion and protection of human rights requires a\nbalanced approach as opposed to an unbalanced one.\nHis Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally - the President\nof the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session - in his\naddress to those who participated in the Second\nInternational Conference of New or Restored Democracies,\nwhich was held in Managua, Nicaragua, in July, said:\n\\\"To survive and flourish, democracy must be\nprovided with an infrastructure of institutions which\nare conducive to the culture of a free society. Each\ncitizen must be guaranteed, in addition to his or her\nfundamental human rights, opportunity for economic\nand social development. ... Basic rights such as\neducation, health and housing must be provided by the\nState to guarantee a stable society in which democratic\nnorms and practices can prevail.\\\"\nThe Gambia subscribes fully to the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights of 1948, the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the\nAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and other\nhuman-rights instruments. We shall continue to respect our\nobligations under these international covenants. In this\nregard, we shall also continue to give full support to the\nCommission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights of the\nOrganization of African Unity and the African Centre for\nDemocracy and Human Rights Studies, which are based in\nBanjul.\nTo those who, in these times of new and emergent\ndemocracies in Africa and elsewhere, may argue that the\nGambia had a genuine democratic system we wish to\nrestate that democracy as practised in our country had\ncertain fundamental weaknesses, which failed to allow\nchange to emerge from within the democratic process. We\naffirm our commitment to returning the country to civilian\nrule after addressing these inherent weaknesses.\nThe peaceful manner in which the people of the\nGambia responded to the change of Government\nencourages the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council\nto move towards a timetable that would return the country\nto civilian rule before long.\nA programme of transition and rectification will\nshortly be announced. This will give details of the\nactivities to be undertaken within a time-bound\nframework. As part of the programme, and in an effort to\ninstitutionalize transparency and accountability in our\nsociety, the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council is\nsetting up four commissions of inquiry designed to shed\nlight on the past practices of some public servants and\nformer politicians suspected of corruption and the\nembezzlement of public funds.\nThe Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council has\nmade it abundantly clear that much as we are determined\nto recover funds stolen from public coffers, there will be\nno witch-hunt. In pursuit of these objectives, we are\nmindful of the need for objectivity and impartiality. No\nmilitary tribunals will be set up. All the suspects will be\ntried in civilian courts by civilian judges.\nIn this connection, the new regime has already\napproached a number of friendly countries in our\nsubregion that have the same legal heritage as the Gambia\nand asked them to assist by providing judges with the\nrequisite expertise in similar exercises. In this way the\nobjectivity, impartiality and independence of the judiciary\nwill be further guaranteed.\nAt the same time, a Constitutional Review\nCommission is being established to look into certain\naspects of the Constitution with a view to making it more\nfunctional in terms of advancing the cause of democracy.\nAs part of this process, an independent electoral\ncommission will also be put in place for the same purpose\n- to strengthen democracy.\nThe military take-over was not, therefore, directed\nagainst any country; its purpose was to redress certain\ninternal difficulties. As soon as that task has been\ncompleted the country will be returned to civilian rule.\nIt is our intention to ensure that the democratic system\n15\n\n\nthat will be put in place in the Gambia will champion, in\nword and in deed, the balanced promotion and protection of\nall human rights and respect for those rights on the part of\nall those who hold public office. We look forward to the\nunderstanding and support of the international community\nat this critical phase of the transition process.\nIt goes without saying that while we are engaged in\nthis national exercise we shall also honour all our inter-\nnational obligations, in addition to playing an active role in\nthe comity of nations. I therefore take this opportunity to\nrenew my country\u2019s unswerving commitment to the ideals\nand principles of the United Nations.\nWe have followed with interest the numerous events\nthat have taken place around the world since the last\nsession of the General Assembly.\nThe situation in Liberia has always been of major\nconcern to us, and the failure to implement the Cotonou\nAccord fully has not dampened our enthusiasm. The\nAkosombo Agreement constitutes another attempt, in a long\nand tortuous peace process, to galvanize the principal\nplayers in the Liberian conflict in an effort to achieve a\ngenuine peace leading to free and fair elections. It is the\nfervent hope of my delegation that the continued efforts and\nsacrifices being made by the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and other African friends of\nLiberia, and indeed by the United Nations in the shape of\nthe continued presence of the United Nations Observer\nMission in Liberia (UNOMIL), will encourage the warring\nfactions to agree to disarm without further delay.\nThe Gambia has followed with keen interest recent\npositive political and military developments in Rwanda\nleading to the cessation of hostilities and the establishment\nof a Government of national reconciliation, which we hope\nwill be consolidated further. The assistance of the\ninternational community will continue to be needed in\nRwanda, not only to restore peace and stability and law and\norder but also to ensure the smooth, safe and speedy return\nof all Rwandese refugees and displaced persons to their\nrespective homes.\nWe continue to observe with concern the failure of the\npeace process in Somalia. The current inability of the\ninternational community to broker a durable peace and\nreconciliation between the parties to the conflict should not\ndeter us; rather, it should spur us to redouble our efforts\nand our resolve to find a satisfactory solution to the\nconflict.\nWe understand and appreciate the international\ncommunity\u2019s frustration at the failure of the warring\nfactions to work towards reconciliation and reconstruction.\nBut peace is priceless and constitutes one of the principles\nunderlying the creation of this noble Organization, and\nthis is certainly not the time for the United Nations to\nconsider withdrawing the United Nations Operation in\nSomalia (UNISOM).\nIt is with equal concern that my delegation views the\nsituation in other trouble spots around the globe - notably,\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nOn the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is\nsaddening to note that, so far, all the efforts deployed by\nthe international community to find a negotiated settle-\nment have been persistently frustrated by the Bosnian\nSerbs without the slightest compunction. Furthermore, the\nBosnian Serbs have persisted with their heinous policy of\n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and other war crimes, in total disregard\nof the basic norms of international behaviour.\nAt the General Assembly\u2019s last session my\ndelegation expressed the firm view that the defenceless\nMuslim population should be given the opportunity to\ndefend itself in accordance with Article 51 of the United\nNations Charter, which makes provision for the exercise\nof the right of self-defence. I believe that by lifting the\narms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina the\ninternational community would be sending strong and\nclear signals to the intransigent Bosnian Serbs.\nWith regard to the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir,\nmy delegation upholds the view that the Simla Agreement\nand the relevant Security Council resolutions provide a\nsound basis for a just and lasting solution to the conflict.\nWith regard to the situation between Kuwait and\nIraq, my delegation would like to reiterate that the key to\na durable solution lies in compliance by Iraq with all the\nUnited Nations resolutions on the issue - in particular,\nthose dealing with recognition of and respect for the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. However,\nrecent Iraqi military action does not augur well for a\nspeedy lifting of United Nations sanctions and the\nachievement of stability in the region.\nIn respect of the Arab-Israeli conflict, we are\nencouraged by the events that have been unfolding since\nthe signing of the Peace Accord between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The balance\n16\n\n\nsheet has been generally positive, and we encourage both\nsides to pursue the peace process.\nAt this juncture I should like to congratulate Jordan\nand Israel on the courageous and constructive step they\ntook recently to end the state of war between them. Such a\npositive development will give added credibility to the\nentire Middle East peace process to secure a comprehensive\nand durable solution in accordance with Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nAnother important and worrying factor, which\nthreatens to undermine any political gains in our countries,\nis the question of poverty and the lack of economic\ndevelopment. Extensive external debt and debt-servicing\nobligations continue to be important constraints on the\nadvancement of the developing countries. The situation is\nmost acute in Africa.\nThe external debt of Africa as a whole has been\ngrowing by about 2.5 per cent yearly and for sub-Saharan\nAfrica the annual debt growth rate has been estimated to be\nas high as 7.7 per cent. This is equivalent to $199 billion,\nwhile debt-servicing arrears total some $45.8 billion, which\nis equivalent to over 20 per cent of the total debt stock.\nFor sub-Saharan Africa, therefore, the ratios of debt to\ngross national product and debt to export are almost three\ntimes the registered average for all developing countries,\nmaking it the most impoverished region in the world.\nThere is more than ever before an urgent need for the inter-\nnational community to find a lasting solution to this\nproblem.\nAgainst the background of such difficulties, it is\nregrettable to note that, in real terms, aid flows to Africa as\na whole have also been on the decline in spite of the\nsubstantial increase by a few countries in their levels of aid\nto Africa. Equally noteworthy is the failure of direct\nforeign investments to increase appreciatively enough to\nrelieve Africa\u2019s financial crisis and stimulate economic\ngrowth.\nLet me, en passant, recall that the Tokyo International\nConference on African Development served as a forum to\nraise international public awareness and renew commitment\nto Africa\u2019s development. The successful implementation of\nthe Tokyo Declaration will depend largely on the common\npolitical will of African Governments and their\ndevelopment partners.\nFrom a global perspective, it is predicted that the\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round will link economies more\nstrongly through an increased flow of trade and finance\nbased on trade liberalization and a strengthening of the\nmultilateral trading system. While the liberalization of\ntrade as a result of the Uruguay Round may lead to a\nsubstantial increase in world trade and income, the impact\non developing countries could be less noticeable. Many\nAfrican countries may find themselves among the least to\nbenefit, partly as a result of the removal of certain\npreferential trade arrangements.\nOn a different but more positive note, it is gratifying\nto note that the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee\nfor the elaboration of an international convention to\ncombat desertification in those countries experiencing\nserious drought and/or desertification, particularly in\nAfrica, has completed its mandate and that a Convention\nhas been adopted. The three regional implementation\nAnnexes have also been concluded. The cumulative\neffects of drought and desertification on our environment\nas well as on the socio-economic development of our\ncountries have been amply demonstrated. But if this\nConvention is to make a difference, it must be provided\nwith the necessary resources to ensure its effective\nimplementation.\nThe correlation between drought and desertification\nand rapid population growth is well known. That is why\nwe welcomed the International Conference on Population\nand Development that has just ended in Cairo. It\ndemonstrated the importance of population policy as an\nessential ingredient of social and economic development.\nWe fully support the Programme of Action adopted by\nthe Conference and will continue to work closely with\ninternational, regional and national agencies, including\nnon-governmental organizations, to implement it, taking\ninto account our national priority strategies on population\npolicy. Similarly, the Yokohama Strategy and Plan of\nAction which issued from the World Conference on\nNatural Disaster Reduction constitute a clear reflection of\nour collective determination to develop and strengthen our\nexisting capacity for natural disaster prevention, reduction,\npreparedness and mitigation.\nWe very much welcome the World Summit for\nSocial Development to be held in Copenhagen in March\n1995. While the Conference will address three core\nissues - enhancing social integration; alleviating and\nreducing poverty; and expanding productive employment -\nit will none the less attract a number of social and\ndevelopmental issues of relevance to world social\nprogress and global development. For those of us in the\ndeveloping world, the Conference will afford the\n17\n\n\nopportunity to address once more our socio-economic\ndevelopment needs while drawing attention to existing\nsocial ills in our societies and finding solutions to these\nproblems.\nIn the same vein, the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen to be held in Beijing will give us the opportunity\nto evaluate the advancement of women in light of the\nobjectives of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the\nAdvancement of Women to the year 2000. It will also\nprovide fresh guidelines to ensure that the targets set are\nachieved. Indeed, the twenty-first century holds many\nchallenges for mankind, but the most important and\npressing will be the elimination of gender discrimination.\nIt is now clear that the resolve to employ international\nmachinery for the promotion of the economic and social\nadvancement of all peoples is gaining ground, and that, in\nthe process, the United Nations provides the most\nappropriate forum. In order to fulfil this purpose\nefficiently, the ongoing consultations for restructuring and\nrevitalizing the United Nations system, notably that of the\nGeneral Assembly, should be vigorously pursued. My\ndelegation will continue to lend its unwavering support to\nthese laudable efforts. The creation of the Office of\nInternal Oversight Services confirms once more the\nimportance of the effective management of the\nOrganization\u2019s limited resources. Urgent attention should\nalso be given to strengthening cooperation and coordination\nbetween agencies of the United Nations system, the United\nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions.\nFinally, I should like to reaffirm my Government\u2019s\ncommitment to the work of the United Nations and the\npreservation of international peace and security. Gambia\nwill continue to give full support to the international effort\nto address the social, economic and environmental problems\nfacing mankind. The joy we share with other nations as\nMembers of the United Nations is matched only by our\nrespect for each Member of this commonwealth of nations.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish, on behalf of the people and the\nGovernment of El Salvador, to express sincerest\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its current session.\nIt will certainly result in a positive outcome to the\ninternational community\u2019s efforts to find a solution to the\nmajor challenges of today\u2019s world. We are certain that\nyour skills and your diplomatic experience will enable us\nto realize the noble principles and objectives enshrined in\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\nWe wish to express our appreciation to the\nAmbassador of Guyana, Mr. Samuel Insanally, for the\n11\n\n\ndynamic and successful work that he accomplished during\nhis term as President of the Assembly at its forty-eighth\nsession.\nIt is with particular pleasure that we reiterate our\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, for his work at the head of the Organization, and\nespecially for his efforts to cooperate with and to assist the\npeople and the Government of El Salvador in the process\nof consolidating peace.\nMay I begin with a brief personal reference. This is\nnot the first time that I have had the honour of being here\nat the United Nations. We had the privilege of\nparticipating in the difficult and fruitful negotiations that\nculminated in the New York Accord at midnight on 31\nDecember 1991 which cleared the way for the signing of\nthe Peace Accords in Mexico on 16 January 1992. Later,\nin May of this year, as President Elect I had the opportunity\nto reiterate to the Secretary-General our total political will\nand firm commitment to complying strictly with all the\npeace agreements before us. Today for the first time I am\naddressing the General Assembly as President of the\nRepublic of El Salvador, pursuant to the mandate given by\nthe people of El Salvador, and this fills us with satisfaction\nand pride.\nIn the field of international policy in recent years with\nthe profound changes that have taken place in Eastern\nEurope and the end of East-West confrontation we are\nbeginning to structure a new international order which has\nnot yet been consolidated. None the less, new trends have\ntaken shape at the global level in the political, economic\nand social spheres permitting great progress to take place\nwhich, in spite of the grave problems that persist, allow us\nto look to the future of mankind with optimism.\nWith the end of the cold war the concept of security\nceased to rest primarily on the arms build-up, and that has\ncurbed the rise in military expenditures. Democracy as a\npolitical system has been strengthened and continues to\nexpand and gain strength at the world level. The global\nconcept of development has also been closely linked to\ndemocracy, peace, respect for human rights, the protection\nof the environment, development and human security.\nIn the economic sphere changes have been geared\ntowards the liberalization and globalization of the economy,\ngenerating a trend towards privatization which will reduce\nstate interference in the activities of society and will foster\nthe efficient use of resources for the collective benefit.\nIn the social sphere policies are being geared\ntowards the training of human resources to foster personal\nfulfilment and combat the marginality in which a large\npart of the world\u2019s population lives. This situation is\nclearly reflected in the Human Development Report 1994.\nWe consider it appropriate to make a brief reference\nto the efforts being made by the world Organization in\nthe quest for solutions and in the establishment of\nmechanisms to resolve problems of a general nature,\ncreating greater opportunities for integral development\nwhich can promote the greater well-being of the human\nperson.\nIn this respect the following are all events of\nprofound significance and broad scope: the holding of\nthe World Summit for Children, dealing with the rights of\nthe child; the United Nations Conference on Environment\nand Development; the World Conference on Human\nRights; the recent World Conference on Population and\nDevelopment; and the decision to hold in 1995 the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women and the World Summit for\nSocial Development.\nWe support and are following with interest these\ninternational gatherings because the subjects that have\nbeen examined in the past and will be examined focus on\na profound analysis of the variables and concepts related\nto human development; their interrelationships; the\nobstacles in the way of the desired objectives; and the\nagreement of Governments to meet those objectives in\naccordance with legislation, domestic programmes and\nnational resources.\nWe cannot fail to mention the successes won by the\nUnited Nations in the search for international peace and\nsecurity. The dynamic participation in conflict\nresolution - resolution of conflicts of an internal nature,\nincluding those related to the process of decolonization,\nas well as conflicts of an international nature - constitutes\nclear evidence of the fact that when States have the\npolitical will it is possible to arrive at rational solutions to\nexisting problems.\nIn this respect we wish to affirm that, with a view to\ndemocratic plurality and the principle of universality that\ninspired the Charter of the United Nations, we reiterate\nour support for the admission of those emerging States\nthat accept and comply with the norms of this\nOrganization.\n12\n\n\nAs an example of the successful work of the United\nNations it is possible to mention South Africa, which is in\nthe process of consolidating democracy under a multiracial\nGovernment; the solution of the conflict in our own\ncountry, El Salvador, which for a long time lived the\ntragedy of armed confrontation; the process of peacemaking\nin the fraternal Republic of Guatemala and the\nestablishment of the United Nations mission to supervise\nthe process that will restore harmony to the Guatemalan\npeople; the fact that Mozambique is approaching the\nholding of free elections to choose, democratically, its\nauthorities under the monitoring of the United Nations; the\nfact that Cambodia is now in a difficult period of transition\ntowards the consolidation of democracy and reconstruction;\nand, in general, all those cases where the presence of the\nUnited Nations through peace-keeping forces means that the\nwork of monitoring, observation and separation is being\ndone to avoid military confrontation.\nWe note with concern that in spite of the effort made\nand resources devoted to promoting development at the\nworld level the situation in most countries has not improved\nin the economic and social spheres and, in particular, in\ndeveloping countries where extreme poverty, marginality,\ndeficiencies in health services and education, unemployment\nand inequalities in income are, inter alia, the characteristics\nthat prevail.\nWe believe that the objective of universal peace to\nachieve a more human world will be possible only if we\nhave the conviction and the political will to establish a new\nmodel of development in which the ultimate goal must be\nthe improvement of the living conditions of the human\nperson: a new concept of cooperation, based on the\ndemocratization of international relations, without\npreconditions of any type, but with shared responsibilities\nfor the reduction of poverty, the generation of opportunities,\nthe creation of jobs, social integration and the openness of\nmarkets.\nWe are sincerely pleased by the continued compliance\nwith peace commitments signed by the Government of\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the\nsigning of the Washington declaration by Israel and Jordan,\nwhich constitute vital advances in the peace process in the\nMiddle East.\nWe hope that these events will constitute\nencouragement so that other States that are directly\ninvolved and have interests in that region will become fully\ninvolved in the peace process that has begun, in order to\nestablish a just, lasting and permanent peace for the\nbenefit of the peoples of the region.\nWe wish to express our concern at the conflict that\nhas caused so much bloodshed to the people of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina and we sincerely hope that a negotiated\nsolution will be found, involving respect for human rights\nand peaceful coexistence among the different ethnic\ngroups of that important region.\nThe grave situation in Rwanda is also of concern to\nus and we hope that the struggle of that people will soon\nfind a solution. We hope that that nation will find\nsolutions to the problems afflicting it and we urge the\ninternational community to give its priority attention to\nthat conflict.\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, we cannot fail\nto make reference to the situations in Haiti and Cuba.\nOur Government welcomes the last-minute solution\nreached by the United States and the de facto government\nof Haiti, which made it possible to avoid a major armed\nintervention that would have greatly harmed the Haitian\npeople. Once more it has been demonstrated that\nnegotiation remains the right way to resolve differences,\nto ensure peaceful coexistence among peoples and to\npreserve international peace and security.\nIn respect to the situation in Cuba, El Salvador\nconsiders that it is the responsibility of that country\u2019s\nGovernment to create the proper conditions so that the\nCuban people can freely exercise their individual political\nand economic rights. None the less, as a contribution\ntowards avoiding the deepening of the economic and\nsocial crisis and the increase in tension resulting from\nimmigration, as well as making it viable for Cuba to be\nreintegrated into the American community of nations, we\nbelieve that a frank and open dialogue between the Cuban\nGovernment and the countries of the region that are\ninterested in helping resolve differences through political\nmeans should be encouraged.\nWe welcome with interest the Cuban Government\u2019s\ndecision to invite the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights to visit the country, as well as the\nannouncement of its adherence to the Treaty the\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America.\nWe would like to mention two important conferences\nin the Central American regional sphere. As developing\ncountries, we understand social problems, especially those\nof us who have experienced armed conflicts, the result, in\n13\n\n\npart, of the lack of social opportunities and appropriate\nprogrammes to create them. We know that the dimensions\nand the scope of sustainable development imply major\nresponsibilities and make it necessary that there be greater\nsolidarity, cooperation and harmonization among the\ncountries of the Central American subregion.\nFor this reason, next October, in Nicaragua, we will\nhold a Central American ecological summit in which\nenvironment problems and the relationship between\nenvironment and development in our countries will be taken\nup. At the end of that month, we will hold, in Honduras,\nan international conference on peace and development, at\nwhich we will evaluate the progress made and the obstacles\nremaining in promoting the economic and social\ndevelopment of our peoples. We are also considering the\nneed for the material and financial resources that are\nindispensable if we are to improve the economic and social\nconditions of our peoples.\nIn this connection, we are working to enhance and\nstrengthen our democratic institutions in order to guarantee\ncivil, political, economic and social rights, promoting the\ncreative participation of civil society in the development\nprocess. We are committed to promoting human\ndevelopment to meet the basic needs of our population and\novercome critical poverty. The efforts are based on a\nstrategy of sustainable development that gives priority to\ninvestment in the social sphere.\nIn the Central American region, our fundamental\ninterest is to raise the standard of living of our peoples in\norder to consolidate the progress we have made in the\nfields of democratization and peacemaking. We are\nconfident that the international community, which is united\nin support of the peacemaking process in Central America,\nwill not fail to attend the conference and give us its support\nand resolute cooperation so that Central America can be a\nregion of peace, freedom, democracy and development.\nPermit me to provide a summary of the specific\nsituation in our own country, El Salvador, to describe the\nadvances, the obstacles and the new challenges on the\ndifficult path towards consolidating peace and democracy.\nIt is important to emphasize that our Government\u2019s\nendeavours are firmly directed towards the implementation\nof the last stage of the agreements aimed at definitely\nconsolidating peace, national reconciliation, the\nstrengthening of the democratic model and the\nreconstruction of our country.\nAt the same time, we are focusing on resolving the\nnew challenges confronting Salvadorian society in the\npost-war period, particularly with regard to public safety,\nthe struggle against drug trafficking and organized crime,\nthe eradication of corruption, improving and strengthening\nthe judicial system in order to achieve prompt and\ncomplete justice, and full respect for human rights. We\nare also adopting measures aimed at reducing extreme\npoverty, improving the education and health systems,\nimproving protection of the individual, protecting the\nenvironment and creating new opportunities. All this is\nbeing done in order to achieve greater well-being for the\nSalvadorian people as part of our major objective:\nachieving social peace.\nWith regard to implementation of the peace\nagreements, significant progress has been made this year\nin the area of public safety. We have given resolute\nsupport to the national civil police, and we will continue\nto do so in order to strengthen its efficiency and\neffectiveness by providing the necessary resources. We\nhave also deployed the national civil police in all the\ncountry\u2019s departments, and we need to increase the\nnumber of police in order to confront post-war problems\nof public safety.\nIn the field of human rights, we are able to point\nwith satisfaction to a considerable improvement in the\nrespect and enjoyment of the fundamental rights and\nfreedoms of Salvadorians. None the less, we must\nrecognize in all honesty that, although some occurrences\nmay be felt to have political underpinnings, most\nincidents have been linked to common crime. This is a\nsocial phenomenon that is on the rise in the post-war\nperiod.\nIn connection with those cases that allegedly have\npolitical motivation, we reiterate our Government\u2019s\npolitical will to support resolutely the strengthening of our\nnational institutions that protect human rights, especially\nthe attorney general for the defence of human rights, in\norder that, before the mandate of the United Nations\nObserver Mission in El Salvador comes to an end, it will\nbe fully able to play its proper role in this field.\nDuring a recent visit of the independent expert of the\nUnited Nations Human Rights Commission, our\nGovernment submitted to him a proposal on the needs\nand requirements of the various national institutions, in\norder to improve the way they function in promoting and\nprotecting human rights. We hope that this proposal will\nbe supported by the members of that Commission.\n14\n\n\nIn the field of the administration of justice, we would\nlike to underscore the election, by consensus among the\ndifferent political forces represented in the legislative\nassembly, of the new Supreme Court, which is composed\nof judges who have nothing to do with or answer to any\npartisan politics, thus ensuring its independence and\nimpartiality.\nThe implementation of the commitments relating to the\ntransfer of land, for programmes to reintegrate former\ncombatants and for human settlements has not been brought\nto a standstill, although there have been some delays owing\nto the lack of documentation and information on the\npotential beneficiaries, as well as to financial constraints.\nI take this opportunity to recall that the international\ncommunity\u2019s offer of assistance in support of the peace\nagreements gave rise to great expectations in our country.\nA portion of the assistance has been provided, for which we\nare very grateful. But some of it has not yet materialized,\nand this puts the Government in a difficult situation and\ncould cause unnecessary social tension.\nThe Secretary-General is aware of this situation and in\nhis most recent report (S/1994/1000) to the Security\nCouncil on the situation in El Salvador observed that it was\nimperative that the Government and the international\ncommunity find ways to finance the deficit of over $80\nmillion as soon as possible, in order to implement certain\nprogrammes stemming from the peace agreements and to\ncarry out outstanding commitments. Because of the delays,\nthe Government of the Republic and the FMLN agreed on\n19 May 1994 on rescheduling the most important\noutstanding agreements. This shows that the political will\nexists to continue and complete the fulfilment of the peace\nagreements.\nIn the social sphere, our objective as a Government is\nto create conditions that provide equal opportunities for all,\nfrom the time of conception, to enable everyone to achieve\na higher level and quality of life. The strategy of our social\nprogramme is simultaneous implementation of short- and\nlong-term programmes, combined with an economic policy\nthat stimulates investment and job-creation. This stems\nfrom our conviction that there can be no economic\ndevelopment without social development, and vice versa,\ngoing hand in hand with steady progress in the fields of\npolitics, justice and public safety.\nHence, in order to improve the living conditions of the\nneediest, we are carrying out social-support programmes for\nhuman development that include arrangements for rapidly\nbringing people into productive jobs. These programmes\ncover training, production incentives, care for mothers,\nchildren and the elderly, basic infrastructure,\nenvironmental health, recreation and sports.\nWe know that only long-term programmes can tackle\nthe root causes of poverty. The Government has decided\nto undertake vast, profound reforms in the areas of health\nand education, to make them primary sources of\ninvestment in sustainable human development and social\nmobility.\nWe believe that these reforms, backed by greater\nbudgetary appropriations for health and education, will\nmake it possible drastically to reduce infant mortality,\nbring quality education to the remotest corners of our\ncountry and reduce illiteracy to the minimum by the year\n2000.\nWe are convinced that one cannot speak of health\ncomprehensively without considering the environment;\nmost of the diseases that affect the poorest people are\ncaused by contamination of the soil, aquifers and the air.\nOur Government is committed to the protection and\nrecovery of the environment, for there can be no\nsustainable development if we do not protect our natural\nresources and halt the destruction of our environment.\nThe Government\u2019s social reforms include reform of\nthe social security system; this seeks to create conditions\nfor private participation in order to broaden coverage\nrapidly, with mechanisms by which individuals can pay\ninto the system. We are improving social security to\navert the suffering felt by many workers, who are doomed\nin their old age to being a burden on their families after\na lifetime of work.\nSince 1989 El Salvador has been making major\nchanges to free and stabilize the economy, with notable\nresults. Economic growth has been more than 5 per cent\nfor each of the last three years. Inflation will stand at\nabout 10 per cent this year and is estimated to fall into\nsingle digits next year. In the external sector, our current\ninternational reserves equal more than four months of\nimports, and the fiscal deficit, despite the demands\nimposed by the peace agreements, will be around\n2 per cent of the gross domestic product in 1994.\nThese encouraging results enable us to look to the\nfuture with optimism. Our goal as a Government is\nequitably to transform growth into economic development,\nmaintaining stability and generating trust in the productive\n15\n\n\nsector. Hence, through sound economic policy we are\nseeking to stimulate domestic savings; here, reforms in the\nsocial security system will play a crucial role in the\nmobilization of resources.\nWe firmly believe that our country is rapidly\nbecoming an attractive place for foreign investment. An\nimportant element in this connection was the adoption of a\nnew labour code, agreed by workers and management and\nendorsed by the International Labour Organization. This\nrepresents fundamental progress.\nIt is clear, then, that El Salvador enjoys peace and\ndemocracy and is engaged in dizzying change. Although\nthe progress has been great, we cannot deny that the road\nahead of us is greater still. Progress makes us work even\nharder to broaden our opportunities and create social well-\nbeing.\nThis is an appropriate time to reiterate to the\nSecretary-General the gratitude of the Government and the\npeople of El Salvador for the careful attention he has given\nto consolidating the process of peace in El Salvador. We\nwish also to express our thanks to the international\ncommunity, which continues to stand by our side to bolster\nour democracy and the process of reconciliation of the\nSalvadorian people.\nWe can affirm with great satisfaction that our\ncountry\u2019s peace agreements are being implemented\nsatisfactorily in accordance with the aspirations of the\nSalvadorian people, and that they can be an example for the\nsolution of other conflicts. The achievement of peace\namong Salvadorians was the result of the unshakable\nresolve of our people, the support of the international\ncommunity and the effective work of the United Nations\nand the Secretary-General.\nIn conclusion, we want to express our confidence that\nby the end of this forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly the world\u2019s peoples will have found formulas for\nunderstanding and cooperation, so that mankind, under the\nbanner of solidarity, will be successful in meeting the great\nchallenges of the coming millennium.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Kazakhstan delegation, first\nof all, I should like to congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on\nhis election to the office of President of the forty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly and express our\nconfidence that his competence and experience will\ncontribute to the fruitful work of the session.\nI should also like to thank his predecessor,\nAmbassador Insanally, for the able stewardship, efficiency\nand tact he demonstrated during the forty-eighth session.\nMay I also express our special gratitude to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ntireless efforts to consolidate peace and stability and to\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations in the life of the\ninternational community.\n19\n\n\nOur world, multifaceted and contradictory, is rapidly\napproaching the end of the second millennium. I hope that\nthe confrontation by force which existed throughout the\ndecades of the cold war and its underlying concept that\nhistory is an evolving process of struggle between the\ncompeting systems are now definitely a part of the past.\nThe end of the bipolar era triggered the release of\nenormous political energy, which earlier had been directed\ntowards ideological competition. Today, the world is\nsearching for new institutional structures, non-\nconfrontational approaches to the solution of global\nproblems and a more efficient utilization of human, material\nand technical resources.\nLooking into the future, full of hope, we should not\nrule out the possibility of meeting new challenges. Indeed,\na common set of global problems that existed before has\nbeen replaced by numerous other problems no less complex\nor immense.\nIn our opinion, the United Nations has never\nexperienced such an important period in its nearly half\ncentury-old history. The beginning of the 1990s and the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Organization can and should\nbecome a truly historic milestone that will determine the\nnew tasks of the United Nations and considerably\nstrengthen its role in the life of the succeeding generations.\nEach important turning-point in the history of this\ncentury has manifested itself in social and political changes\nin the life of States. Today the transition from one era of\ninternational life to another is related to the disintegration\nof the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR),\nthe revolutionary transformations in the countries of Eastern\nEurope and the entry into the family of nations of a number\nof newly independent States, among them my native Kazakhstan.\nFor us, three years of freedom have been three years\nof achieving real political and economic independence. The\nRepublic, having become a Member of the United Nations\nand other international organizations, having signed the\nHelsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris and a number of\nother international instruments, has de jure completed its\nentry into the world community. From the very first day,\nour country has striven to ensure the actual implementation\nof its commitments to deal with common global issues,\nsuch as respect for human rights, the strengthening of\ndemocracy and the rule of law, economic freedom and\nsocial justice, the development of a market economy and\nthe strengthening of international security.\nKazakhstan accords priority to the issue of the non-\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. In December 1993, the\nParliament of our Republic ratified the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-\nnuclear State. At the coming 1995 NPT Review\nConference, we intend to join the position of those States\nthat favour an unconditional extension of the NPT for an\nunlimited period of time. From this rostrum I declare that\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan, deeply committed to the\nstrengthening of its national sovereignty and security and\nthe process of political and economic reforms in society,\nis genuinely interested in international stability and the\ndevelopment of cooperation with all States. That is our\nconsistent policy, not subject to any changes dictated by\nshort-term experience. I should like to emphasize in\nparticular that we intend to achieve our objectives while\ntaking existing realities into account and effectively using\nthe geopolitical location of Kazakhstan as a kind of link\nbetween Europe and Asia, between East and West.\nIn this context, we think that the initiative of the\nPresident of Kazakhstan, Mr. N.A. Nazarbaev, to convene\na Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building\nMeasures in Asia, put forward for the first time from this\nrostrum two years ago at the forty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly, has a special significance. Its purpose\nis to develop fundamental principles and areas of\ncooperation in the context of strengthening peace and\nstability and promoting the economic prosperity of Asian\nStates.\nToday the idea of this Conference is being put into\npractice. Thus, representatives of more than 20 countries\nof the region, as well as representatives of the United\nNations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (CSCE), the Organization of the Islamic\nConference (OIC) and the League of Arab States took\npart in the two meetings of experts convened by\nKazakhstan in Almaty last year to discuss this initiative.\nAs a follow-up to the Almaty meetings on this\nConference, the Permanent Representatives of 25 United\nNations Member States, as well as the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General and\nrepresentatives of a number of international organizations,\nmet twice in New York. A third meeting at the level of\nsenior officials is to be held in Almaty at the end of\nOctober.\nConfidence in the possibility of the step-by-step\nestablishment of this new international structure is\nconfirmed by the fact that the creation in Asia of different\npolitical and economic unions, associations and groups,\n20\n\n\nclosely interrelated and influencing one another, is\ndependent on a common interest in the strengthening of\npeace and stability, without which the economic prosperity\nof Asian countries is impossible. The deep-rooted\nprocesses of economic integration on the Asian continent\nshould logically and inevitably lead to the formation of an\nAsian common market, on the one hand, and political\ncoordination and integration, on the other. Therefore, we\nthink that the political will of the States of the region\ntowards the purposeful and careful management of these\nprocesses should speed up the creation of global economic\nand political structures, similar to those in Europe.\nThis confidence has prompted the President of our\ncountry to put forward a new proposal to establish the\nEuro-Asian Union (EAU) as a catalyst of integration\nprocesses and as an instrument for the prevention of\nconflicts in the post-Soviet era. The opportunities to\novercome the economic and social crisis, and inter-ethnic\nand inter-State conflicts, and to ensure external and internal\nsecurity and stability through the proposed mechanism of\nunification have been received with understanding by\npoliticians and leaders of different States.\nSince the creation of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS), stability and security as the basis\nof economic and social reforms have come to the forefront.\nAs for economic aspects, they are in fact a dominant part\nof the EAU integration processes. The first step is the\ncreation of a common economic space by the Central Asian\nStates \u2014 Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan \u2014\nsupported by the appropriate agreements. Appropriate\ninter-State bodies, such as the Central Asian Bank, have\nalready begun to function. The proposed union is open to\nall States.\nDuring the transition period, the proposed EAU most\nadequately reflects the interests of the States of the region,\nregardless of their size, population, economic and other\nindicators. It provides an opportunity to demonstrate their\nwillingness to cooperate on an equal basis, as well as their\ncommitment to reforms in the interests of all the nations of\nthe region.\nIn putting forward these initiatives, Kazakhstan\nassumes that the problems they seek to resolve are pressing\nfor all countries of the world, and for such an authoritative\nOrganization as the United Nations. Our certainty is also\nstrengthened by the fact that the Kazakhstan initiatives are\nharmonious with the principles of the United Nations\nCharter and with key provisions of the broadly supported\nreport of the Secretary-General \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, and\nparticularly with his idea of the need to strengthen\npreventive diplomacy and the peacemaking activities of\nthe United Nations and deepening cooperation in these\nareas between the United Nations and regional\norganizations. The foreign-policy approaches of\nKazakhstan were the basis for our decision to join the\n\u201cPartnership for Peace\u201d programme of the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO).\nKazakhstan, as a member of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS), strives to implement its foreign\npolicy initiatives in practical terms and, accordingly, takes\ninto account and respects the legal rights and interests of\nother CIS States. The true interests of the multi-ethnic\npopulation of Kazakhstan lie not only in the maintenance\nbut also in the expansion of common economic, political,\nmilitary and strategic partnership and interaction within\nthe CIS. Our Republic maintains special relations with\nthe Russian Federation, all the Republics of Central\nAsia \u2014 Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,\nTurkmenistan, and other CIS States. Certainly, the most\nimportant direction for Central Asian interaction is our\ncommon interest in strengthening peace, stability and\nsecurity, both in regional and global dimensions.\nIn a situation threatening peace in the region or on\nthe Euro-Asian continent, Kazakhstan, together with the\ncountries of Central Asia and Russia, is ready to put into\noperation an established machinery of joint consultations\naimed at coordinating its positions and undertaking\nmeasures for the elimination of the threat.\nA vivid example of this is our joint endeavours to\nsettle the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border. Thus, at\nthe meeting of the Presidents, Prime Ministers and\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan\nand Uzbekistan held at Almaty last July the situation on\nthe Tajik-Afghan border was discussed and a joint\nstatement was adopted. Guided by the need to maintain\npeace and ensure a favourable environment for successful\neconomic and political reforms and greater independence\nof their countries, the Foreign Ministers of the three\nStates appealed to the conflicting parties to stop hostile\nactivities and settle existing problems by political means\nthrough negotiations. The participants in the meeting\npointed to a close interrelation between the stabilization\nof the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and internal\npolitical developments in Tajikistan, and they supported\nefforts to deepen the inter-Tajik dialogue and the active\nrole of the United Nations and the Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe.\n21\n\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s efforts towards integration at the regional\nand interregional level need the support of international\norganizations and the leading countries of the world. The\nprerequisites for such support exist and are being created.\nThey include commitments on a bilateral and multilateral\nbasis and the resolutions of the United Nations General\nAssembly on assistance to countries with economies in\ntransition, as well as our participation in cooperation with\nthe CSCE based on one of the components of the concept\nof global security, namely, the economic dimension.\nKazakhstan attaches great importance to the expansion\nof United Nations activities in social and economic fields\nand supports vital initiatives relating to reforms in this area\nthat are being undertaken within the United Nations and, in\nparticular, in the Economic and Social Council.\nThe report of the Secretary-General of the United\nNations \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d is to play the key\nrole in these issues. We support the fundamental ideas of\nthe report, and we believe that the discussion of this\ndocument at the current session of the General Assembly\nshould be marked by our common aspiration to increase the\nefficiency of United Nations activities in the social and\neconomic fields to ensure proper coordination of efforts of\nthe related United Nations agencies and to set new priorities\nin accordance with today\u2019s global, political and socio-\neconomic realities. The main purpose of these endeavours,\nwe believe, should be to preserve and develop the spirit of\nglobal partnership born at Rio two years ago and to ensure\nthe environmentally safe, sustainable development of the\nwhole world.\nAs a young State endeavouring to resolve difficult\ntasks of socio-economic and democratic reform and to\nensure its efficient participation in the international division\nof labour, Kazakhstan welcomes United Nations efforts\nwith regard to the integration of countries with economies\nin transition into the world economy and promotion of their\naccess to world markets, particularly through assistance to\nthe newly independent land-locked States of Central Asia,\nof which Kazakhstan is the largest. We view this as a\nmanifestation of the comprehensive approach by the United\nNations in the field of socio-economic policy and deem it\nto be the most productive way to meet the challenges of\nglobal sustainable social and economic development.\nIn this connection I should also like to indicate the\nhigh value Kazakhstan places on its cooperation with the\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European\nBank for Reconstruction and Development, the European\nUnion, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment and other international organizations\nthrough their programmes of technical assistance. At the\nsame time, we would like to see this cooperation acquire\nmore dynamism and practical efficiency, which would\ncreate a favourable climate for market reforms in\nKazakhstan and other countries with economies in\ntransition and for their better access to world markets and\nthe flow of foreign investments to these countries.\nIn this context it is a matter of concern to us that,\naccording to some forecasts, the gap in the levels of\nfactual and required assistance will sharply increase when\nunemployment in the States of the former Soviet Union\npeaks. This is expected as a consequence of the closure\nof unprofitable State enterprises. Against that\nbackground, the current level of Western assistance to our\nmarket reforms will not be enough to make progress\ntowards the implementation of a second \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d.\nAnother priority of socio-economic development in\nour country is its activity in the field of environment. It\nis no accident that Kazakhstan has singled out\nenvironmental issues, since it is itself exposed to such\nenvironmental disasters of a global and regional nature as\nthe Aral Sea crisis, the degradation of a vast area around\nthe Semipalatinsk nuclear-test grounds, the severe\ndeterioration of the Caspian Sea ecosystem and the\ndangerous increase of its water level, which threaten the\nlife and economic activity in a large coastal area. All\nthese things seriously hamper the process of social and\neconomic reform in Kazakhstan. A great contribution to\nthe solution of the Aral problem is being made by the\nInternational Fund for the Salvation of the Aral Sea,\nheaded by Mr. Nazarbaev, President of the Republic of\nKazakhstan. The Central Asian Inter-State Council on the\nAral Sea has been established, and a programme of action\nfor the coming three to five years has been elaborated to\nimprove the environmental conditions of the Aral Sea.\nHowever, the States of the region have very limited\nfinancial and technical resources. In this regard, I should\nlike to appeal again to the world community, the donor\ncountries and the specialized international agencies to join\ntheir efforts to fight this truly global, environmental\ndisaster in the Aral Sea. In this connection, Kazakhstan\nproposes to hold in Almaty or in the city of Aralsk a\nspecial international conference on the Aral Sea problem\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, and to consider\nthe possibility of establishing a special structure within\nthe United Nations system to deal with this problem.\n22\n\n\nWhen we speak about the balanced and sustainable\ndevelopment of society we cannot leave out the issue of\nhuman rights. If an individual is poor and deprived of the\nelementary means of life, his political rights are\nmeaningless. A comprehensive approach to this problem\nwas demonstrated by the World Conference on Human\nRights at Vienna in 1993, which analysed and reviewed the\noverall activities of the United Nations in the field of\nhuman rights. Pursuant to the recommendations of the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session called for the\nestablishment of the post of United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. On behalf of the\nGovernment of Kazakhstan, let me congratulate Mr. J.\nAyala Lasso on his election to this high and responsible\npost and assure the world community that my country will\nfully abide by the recommendations of the World\nConference on Human Rights and support United Nations\nactivities in the field of the international protection of\nhuman rights.\nWith regard to social and economic issues, I should\nlike to highlight the recently concluded Cairo International\nConference on Population and Development. Kazakhstan\ntook an active part in that Conference and believes that its\noutcome will be yet another practical contribution to United\nNations efforts to ensure global sustainable development.\nIn this connection, we also expect significant results from\nsuch major forthcoming international forums as the World\nSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen, the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women in Beijing and the United\nNations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) in\nIstanbul.\nKazakhstan supports the joint endeavours of Member\nStates to reform the principal organs of the United Nations,\nespecially the Security Council.\nGuided by Article 24 of the United Nations Charter,\nwhich states that the Security Council, in carrying out its\nduties under its primary responsibility, acts on behalf of all\nMember States, Kazakhstan favours the enlargement of the\nSecurity Council to ensure equitable geographical\nrepresentation and the effective and efficient functioning\nand transparency of the Security Council.\nFor many years now we have been witnessing a\nsignificant deterioration of the financial situation of the\nUnited Nations. Without going into the details of this\ndifficult issue, I should like to note that the current session\nof the General Assembly is not an ordinary one, because it\nwill have to adopt a new scale of assessments for the\napportionment of United Nations expenses for the period\n1995-1997.\nAs a cornerstone of the whole financial system of\nthe United Nations, the scale of assessments has always\nbeen among the most important aspects of the functioning\nof the Organization. The adoption of the new scale of\nassessments this year is also important in that the new\narrangement will fully reflect the considerable increase in\nthe membership of the United Nations and solve to the\ngreatest possible extent problems related to the\ncontributions of a group of new Member States.\nSince the creation of this problem Kazakhstan has\ndemonstrated realism and a balanced approach and has\ntried to take into consideration the interests of other\nMember States. We hope that the principle of the\ncapacity to pay and of the need to improve the\nmethodology of the scale by eliminating its most\ndistorting elements will be taken fully into account in the\ndetermination of the new scale of assessments. This\nwould undoubtedly help to improve the Organization\u2019s\noverall financial situation.\nWith regard to the financial standing of the United\nNations, I should like to refer to the question of\nimproving administrative and financial management in the\nsystem. Kazakhstan has welcomed concrete steps in this\nfield and supported the creation of the Office of Internal\nOversight Services, and we deem it appropriate that such\nefforts be continued.\nTen years ago, in this Organization, the former\nrector of the University for Peace, Mr. Robert Muller,\nsaid the following very true words:\n\u201cA jubilee is an occasion for reflection and not for\ncelebration\u201d.\nI believe that today, on the eve of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, we are all adopting\nthis very approach in evaluating the Organization\u2019s past,\npresent and future.\nIn this context, I should like to note with gratitude\nthe great efforts of the Preparatory Committee and the\nSecretariat in respect of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations. They are making a concrete contribution\nto the commemoration of this forthcoming historic event.\nKazakhstan too is preparing to commemorate the\nevent in a fitting way. It has set up a national committee,\n23\n\n\nwhich is scheduled to arrange a variety of ceremonial\nevents, as well as to issue collectors\u2019 stamps and coins\ndevoted to the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\nThe importance that Kazakhstan attaches to the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations is reflected also in our\ninitiative concerning the holding of a special session of the\nGeneral Assembly within the framework of the event. In\nour view, this could be the occasion for a thorough, useful\nand interesting exchange of views on the most significant\naspects of the activities of the United Nations and on it\u2019s\nrole.\nThe forthcoming anniversary inevitably brings to mind\nanother historic international date \u2014 the fiftieth anniversary\nof the end of the Second World War. Kazakhstan\nwholeheartedly supports the initiative to declare 1995 the\ninternational year of the commemoration of the victims of\nthat war.\nIn conclusion, I should like to express my firm belief\nthat the United Nations will come to its anniversary\nrevitalized and fully able to realize the rich potential\nembodied in the aspiration to peace and humanism that was\nenshrined in its Charter 50 years ago.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with pleasure that I begin this speech by conveying to you. Sir, our most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Your election not only reflects the trust placed in you personally but also bespeaks the regard of the international community for your country,\nCote d\u2019Ivoire. We wish you success in the pursuit of your mission.\nI take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Samuel Insanally, on the effective manner in which he conducted the affairs of the General Assembly at its last session.\nI also wish to note the sincere efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to consolidate peace and to reduce the tensions that beset many parts of the world.\nIt is with great pleasure. Sir, that I convey to you the best wishes of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahad bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, and his hope that at this session the General Assembly will successfully deal with international developments, benefiting from the opportunities provided by the principles and other foundations upon which contemporary international relations rest.\nThe Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques has always been willing to play a positive role in the international arena, and to contribute to achieving our common goals of security, stability and prosperity. The principles and other foundations of our present international order derive their legitimacy and strength from the tenets of the United Nations Charter, which are inherent in international legality. The most important of these principles are:\trespect\tfor\tthe\tsovereignty and\nindependence of nations; the inviolability of international borders; the establishment of justice and equality between nations; rejection of the use of force in the settlement of conflicts; safeguarding human dignity; and ensuring security and prosperity for all mankind. Based on its adherence to Islamic shari'a, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to the principles of the United Nations Charter, and has endeavored throughout the Organization's history to implement those principles in practice.\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council, whose current session my country has the honor of chairing, bases itself on the principles of the United Nations Charter. We are convinced that the international community's success in serving the cause of international peace and security will depend on the commitment by its members to the United Nations Charter and on the strength of their political will to apply the resolutions of international legality.\n\nWhile the firm unified international stand in confronting Iraq's aggression against the State of Kuwait in 1990 was vindicated when the aggression was reversed and international legality was restored, the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains unresolved. Serb aggression against the Bosnian people continues. This is because the aggression has not been dealt with in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the principles of international legality. It is incumbent upon this Organization, and in particular the Security Council, to move swiftly and effectively to demonstrate that aggression is bound to fail, whether in Kuwait, in Bosnia or in any other part of the world.\nEven a cursory glance at the current international situation would be sufficient to highlight the need for an effective United Nations role and for implementation of the Charter in order to deal with the chronic hotbeds of tension that are widespread and that continue to threaten security and stability in many parts of the world. This requires us to strengthen further the role of the United Nations as an effective vehicle for creating the proper conditions for world peace and stability.\nWe in the Gulf Cooperation Council recognize the prominent role played by the Secretary-General in fashioning a new approach for the United Nations based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms of international legality. We welcomed the Secretary- General's proposals in his \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", and we look forward to his agenda for development. The ideas contained in those two reports are bound to make an important contribution to the efforts of the General Assembly to enhance the role and effectiveness of the United Nations. Success in achieving this aim will rely to a great extent on the degree of support by Member States for the principles and principles of the United Nations. The most important of these are: the\tmaintenance of\ninternational peace and security; peacemaking through the deterrence of aggression; the elimination of threats to the security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations; and the promotion of cooperation in the service of international development.\nUnder the United Nations Charter, the Security Council, the body most directly concerned with the maintenance of international peace and security, has the primary responsibility for dealing with international problems. As we pursue reform of United Nations organs, it is therefore crucial that the Council be made more capable and better equipped to carry out its mandate under the Charter.\n \n\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council attaches great importance to a number of regional and international issues. We greatly appreciated the important role played by the United Nations following the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. That role clearly reflected the international community's expectations regarding the responsibilities of the United Nations. It also highlighted the ability of the Security Council to confront aggression and reverse its effects. We hope that this solidarity will help guarantee that no repetition of this aggression can occur. This can be achieved only through complete and total implementation of all Security Council resolutions on the matter. The Iraqi Government continues to defy international legality and to attempt to deceive international public opinion through limited implementation of some of the requirements of Security Council resolutions 661 (1990) and 687 (1991) pertaining to the issue of weapons of mass destruction. The true objective of these Iraqi efforts is to circumvent Security Council resolutions, which contain a number of requirements accepted by the Iraqi Government and which together form an interrelated legal structure. In its last review of the sanctions imposed on Iraq, the Security Council decided to continue the application of those sanctions; this demonstrates that the efforts of the Iraqi Government to deceive the world community have not borne fruit.\nIraq has yet to meet the essence of its obligations, which lies in full and irrevocable recognition of the State of Kuwait and of its borders. To do this it must officially accept Security Council resolution 833 (1993), which demarcated the international borders between Kuwait and Iraq and provided international guarantees for those borders under the cease-fire agreements set out in Security Council resolution 687 (1991), which was accepted by the Iraqi Government. And in view of the fact that the Iraqi Government has repeatedly violated its international and legal obligations, we feel it is necessary to insist that Iraq's recognition of Kuwait and its borders should be irrevocably stated, in conformity with the constitutional measures applied in Iraq and based on the international guarantees contained in the United Nations Security Council resolution 833 (1993). Furthermore, Iraq must comply with its commitment to release all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees. While we welcome Iraq's participation on the committee dealing with prisoners and detainees, we hope that its participation is a genuine attempt to settle this humanitarian issue and not merely a symbolic move to appease international public opinion.\nThe Government of Iraq is also expected to pay full compensation for all the damage caused by its aggression. It must refrain from committing or sponsoring any acts of terrorism or subversion. All of the above requirements represent a series of interrelated international legal obligations, that must be complied with in their entirety.\nThe States of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), while reiterating their commitment to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, wish to voice their concern over the continuing suffering of the Iraqi people, the sole responsibility for which lies with the Iraqi Government which rejects the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991) which deal with the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.\nThe GCC States have actively participated in the Middle East peace process since its inception at the Madrid Peace Conference. The GCC States contributed to advancing the bilateral talks between the Arab States and Israel. They have also participated effectively in the multilateral talks. The Arab delegations' commitment to and participation in this process gave a clear indication of their sincere intention to work towards a just and comprehensive peace in the region. The multilateral talks are an integral part of the peace process launched in Madrid and complement the bilateral talks and not a substitute thereto.\nThe signing of the Declaration of Principles between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Israeli Government in Washington in 1993, raised hopeful expectations, since it represented the first step towards the achievement of a just and permanent settlement of the Palestinian problem. While the Gulf Cooperation Council notes with satisfaction the concrete progress made on the Palestinian-Israeli track and the important steps taken to expand Palestinian self-rule and to transfer institutions to the Palestinian National Authority, it calls upon the international community, and in particular on the co-sponsors of the peace process, the United States of America and the Russian Federation, to ensure that Israel places no more obstacles in the path of the Palestinian National Authority as it assumes its responsibilities.\nWhile we welcome the progress achieved on the Jordanian-Israeli track, we wish to voice our deep concern over the lack of clear progress in the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. The issue of the occupied Golan Heights is clear and governed by the principles of respect for international borders. Security is not attained by the occupation of another nation's territory by force, but through the establishment of peace, which can only be realized in this situation by the total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights. The Lebanese-Israeli track is governed by United Nations Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which clearly calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Lebanese territory. We call for the complete and unconditional implementation of the said resolution.\nThe question of Al-Quds Al-Shareef is at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and permanent peace cannot be achieved in the Middle East without a just settlement of this issue. The settlement must take into account the resolutions of international legality, and in particular United Nations Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which calls for Israeli withdrawal from all territories occupied in 1967, and United Nations Security Council resolution 252 (1968) regarding Al-Quds Al-Shareef. Israel is thus required to refrain from taking any measures that would demographically change the status of the city of Al-Quds or prejudice future negotiations pertaining to its final status. Any permanent and comprehensive settlement must also address the issue of the return of Palestinian refugees and the issue of settlements erected by Israel in the occupied territories in violation of international law and the Geneva conventions.\nConcrete progress on the various bilateral tracks on the various aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict is bound to lead inevitably to similar progress with regard to the issues addressed in the multilateral talks and lay the groundwork for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the Middle East.\nWe in the GCC are convinced that the success of the Palestinian National Authority in implementing the Declaration of Principles depends on the support it receives from the Palestinian people, as well as on the political and economic support it receives from the international community. It was on the basis of this conviction that the GCC States participated in the international donors conference held in Washington, D C. in October of 1993 and pledged substantial financial assistance. The Gulf Cooperation Council States have also contributed financially to the establishment of a Palestinian police force and administration to enable it to assume its duties. We have also announced, along with our Arab brethren at the 102nd session of the League of Arab States, our full support for the Palestinian self-governing authority.\nIn the context of their pursuit to help the Middle East region enjoy its legitimate share of security, peace and stability, the GCC States have focused great attention on efforts to rid the region of all weapons of mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical or biological. To achieve this objective, we call on all countries in the region, including Israel, to refrain from producing, possessing or stockpiling any such weapons.\nThe GCC States note with great concern the continued occupation of the three United Arab Emirates islands - Abu Moussa, the Greater and Lesser Tumbs - by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The GCC States, motivated by a desire to have the best possible ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran, have repeatedly urged the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond to the call of the United Arab Emirates to settle this problem by peaceful means through serious bilateral negotiations.\nThe Government of Iran, however, has not responded to these calls so far. We therefore call for referring this matter to the International Court of Justice, which is responsible for settling disputes among nations.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the plight of the Bosnian people is worsening as a result of the war of extermination and ethnic cleansing waged by the Serbian forces with the support of Serbia and Montenegro. In spite of the optimism generated by the Muslim-Croat agreement to establish a federation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and their acceptance of the peace plan proposed by the international Contact Group, and welcomed by all of us the Serbian forces continue to challenge the international peace-keeping forces of the United Nations, in total disregard of United Nations resolutions. In so doing, the Serbian forces have been emboldened by the inability of the international community, and in particular the States of the European Community which have a special responsibility vis-a-vis this tragedy, to implement the necessary sanctions and impose the required punishment, to stop the Serb aggression. The Serb forces have rejected the proposed peace plan and escalated their attacks against Bosnia and Herzegovina, which makes it patently clear that their intention is to undermine all the peaceful efforts undertaken by the United Nations.\nWe listened with keen interest to the speech by President Alija Izetbegovic, which gave a graphic description of the dangerous situation in his country. In the light of this we are concerned that the hasty adoption by the United Nations Security Council of its resolution 943 (1994), which provides for relaxing the United Nations sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, could preclude a just settlement and lead to rewarding the aggression. It is incumbent upon the international community, and the Security Council in particular, to take the necessary action to remedy this tragic situation. This action must include declaring the entirety of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe haven, and providing for the deployment of international observers equipped with a clear mandate, and sufficiently credible powers, in these safe havens and along the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They should also include the recognition of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Serbia and Montenegro before any consideration is given to the gradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on them. United Nations forces must also protect the areas of safe haven and provide for their defense. The failure of the United Nations to provide the required protection for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina makes it necessary to lift the arms embargo so as to allow it to exercise its legitimate right to self-defense as enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.\nSomalia continues to be in the grip of a situation of instability and political chaos coupled with acts of violence and bloodshed. In spite of all the efforts deployed to extricate this nation from its plight, instability and lack of security still plague this troubled land. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has tried on a number of occasions to contain the conflict in Somalia, to bring about national reconciliation between the various factions and which has provided humanitarian assistance and relief to the fraternal Somali people, calls upon all factions to listen to the voice of reason and logic, to put the interests of the Somali people above all else and to work towards national reconciliation.\nThe feelings of optimism and jubilation triggered by the victory of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan and the restoration of that country's independence and identity are now overshadowed by feelings of disappointment and bitterness as a result of the continued infighting between the various Mujahideen factions. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has endeavored, under the direction and guidance of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd bin Abdulaziz, to put an end to the fratricide among our Afghani brethren. These efforts were crowned when all factions were assembled in 1993 at the House of God in Makkah, and an agreement was signed to restore unity, security and stability to the nation of Afghanistan. We continue to urge all factions of the Afghani Mujahideen immediately to put an end to the infighting by complying with the \\\"Makkah Agreement\\\" in letter and in spirit, so as to move in the direction of reconstruction and development and, thereby, to enable their nation to resume its proper place in the international community.\nThe conflict over Jamu-Kashmir continues to cast its shadow over relations between the two neighbors, India and Pakistan, and represents one of the elements of instability in this part of the world. My Government continues to watch with concern the bloodshed there. We wish to voice the view that there is a need for a solution to this chronic problem. It has become clear that violence against the Kashmiri people, and the use of military force will achieve nothing but the further deterioration of the situation in Kashmir. It will also feed the flames of instability in the region. A peaceful solution to this problem lies in the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and in dialog and understanding. It is in that way that an end may be put to yet another hotbed of tension and instability in the world.\nAmong the other conflicts in Central Asia, the conflict between two Member States of the United Nations, the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia, resulted at one stage in the occupation by Armenia of parts of Azerbaijan. As this occupation constitutes a violation of the principle of the inadmissibility of the use of force in the resolution of disputes, it is incumbent upon Armenian forces to withdraw from Azerbaijani territory and to transfer this issue to the negotiating table for the purpose of arriving at a peaceful and just settlement which would safeguard the legitimate rights of the Azerbaijani people.\nSuch a review of the hotbeds of tension and crises in our world must not cause us to lose sight of the important and positive developments which the world witnessed over the past decade and which should give us cause for hope in a better future for mankind. We continue to have great expectations as a result of the positive developments in the aftermath of the cold war, and the emergence of solutions to pressing problems in Cambodia, the Middle East and Northern Ireland. The historic change in South Africa has brought down the curtain on the system of apartheid and brought forth a new South Africa based on justice and equality. We welcome these positive developments which are bound to contribute to the strengthening of the international tendency to move towards compliance with the principles of international law, respect for the resolutions of international legality, the renunciation of the use of force in favor\nfavor of dialog as a means for resolving problems and disputes.\nA general overview of international economic issues and the role played by the United Nations to strengthen international cooperation shows that the success of the Organization in dealing with economic issues and promoting international development, is also tied to the commitment of its Members to the United Nations Charter.\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations is a commendable example of the international community's success in addressing a number of sensitive issues with unprecedented results. We are witnessing the emergence of the World Trade Organization, which we hope will embody our vision of an institutionalized global economic system. The Marakesh conference of the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has succeeded in fulfilling the aims of the Bretton Woods Conference.\nWhile we appreciate this important development, we must state our concerns over the increase in protectionism and the resulting tensions between trading partners. This development contradicts the premises of the Uruguay Round regarding the importance of allowing market forces to play their natural role in economic affairs in a manner which allows nations to benefit from comparative advantages and from the optimal utilization of resources. This can only be achieved through serious international efforts to ensure free trade. We also wish to state our concern over the increase in protectionism in the guise of protecting the environment, and in particular the increased taxation on petroleum.\nAt this point, I wish to emphasize the importance the Gulf Cooperation Council attaches to the protection of the environment, which is reflected in the adoption by our emerging industries of the highest standards of environmental protection. We are concerned that petroleum, which is our principal export commodity, is already heavily burdened by taxation, and yet it is now being targeted for further taxation while other, more polluting fuels are receiving subsidies from Governments. Coal is a case in point: according to studies published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Energy Agency, coal subsidies in industrial States amount to more than twice the cost of comparable energy provided by imported petroleum. Furthermore, according to the same sources, tax reforms that take into consideration the carbon content of fuel could produce more than double the reduction in\ncarbon dioxide emissions targeted by the proposed carbon taxes without further taxation on petroleum.\nWe, the member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, are convinced that imposing additional taxes on petroleum will not contribute to the environment but will instead distort international trade. This would adversely affect not only the economies of oil-exporting nations, but also those of oil-importing nations. It would also undermine the development efforts of developing countries.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its sister States in the Gulf Cooperation Council have great respect for the United Nations Charter, for international legality and for the resolutions deriving therefrom. We have not, and will not, hesitate to work towards strengthening the role of the United Nations and enhancing its effectiveness to ensure international peace and security and promote international cooperation. We hope with all sincerity that all other Member States will share this view when dealing with the various issues before the Assembly at this session.\nWe are confident that the opportunity to achieve success still remains before us and that what is required is to heed the words of God Almighty:\n\\\"And say work; and soon Allah will observe your\nwork, and his messenger, and the believer\\\".\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at this forty-ninth session. I am\nconfident that with your long and intimate knowledge of the\nUnited Nations we shall come to a successful conclusion of\nthis session.\nSince we met a year ago, the world has witnessed both\npositive and negative developments. The latter deserve the\nparticular attention of this Assembly. Nevertheless, let me\nbegin by referring to some of the positive ones.\nOne major development is the progress that has been\nmade toward peace in the Middle East. The seemingly\nimpossible is turning into reality. The United Nations must\nnow be available to the parties concerned in the search for\na comprehensive settlement in the region. It must also\nassist in the process of peace building and reconstruction.\nThe Government of Finland welcomes the return of\nSouth Africa to the General Assembly, now with the\ncredentials of a free, democratic and non-racial Member\nState. South Africa has the full potential of becoming a\nstabilizing political and economic force in Africa. It has\nalready made a positive contribution to world security by\nabolishing, under international verification, its nuclear-\nweapons programme.\nIn the immediate vicinity of Finland, the withdrawal\nof Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia has put an end\nto one of the painful legacies of the Second World War. I\nam confident that the remaining problems in the relations\nbetween the Baltic States and Russia will be solved in the\nsame spirit as that which helped resolve the issues of troop\nwithdrawals.\nMy Government also welcomes the cease-fire in\nNorthern Ireland declared by the Irish Republican Army.\nWe hope that this will facilitate an early and lasting\nsolution acceptable to all.\nThere are also encouraging signs in the world\neconomy, particularly regarding the multilateral trade\nsystem. It is now urgent to implement the results of the\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade, including the establishment of the World Trade\nOrganization. Other issues on the trade agenda, such as\ntrade and environment, also need to be addressed.\nThese positive developments to which I have\nreferred have one thing in common: they would not have\nbeen possible without courageous leadership. They\nillustrate the fact that patient and visionary leadership is\nnecessary in solving problems facing the international\ncommunity.\nTurning now to negative developments, there are still\nmany conflicts that neither the parties concerned nor the\ninternational community have been willing or able to\nsolve. The abhorrent tragedies in the former Yugoslavia,\nRwanda and Somalia have caused suffering to millions of\ninnocent people. They are frightening examples of our\ninability to act when national leadership fails and\nintra-State conflicts threaten international peace and\nsecurity.\nThe Security Council has the primary responsibility\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\nbut it cannot - nor should it - act as a substitute for the\nMember States or their Governments. It is a dangerous\nand fallacious impression that the United Nations could or\nshould always step in to rectify irresponsible actions and\npolicies, nor can it be expected to be present forever in\nconflict areas. It is also obvious that the United Nations\nwill never be in a position to dispose of enough resources\nto meet all demands.\nWe must seek new ways and approaches. We must\nbe able to prevent fires before they start. Too often,\nconflicts erupt because of a lack of preventive action and\nmisperceived faith in the readiness and the ability of the\nUnited Nations to step in. It is clear that preventive\nmeasures should be given a greater role in the\nOrganization\u2019s work on conflict resolution.\nIn the present United Nations peace-keeping system,\npolitical oversight, planning and military command and\ncontrol need to be improved and the budgetary system\nstreamlined. Moreover, we are increasingly challenged by\ncomplex emergencies, which include political, military\nand humanitarian concerns. These cannot be addressed\nthrough traditional peace-keeping efforts alone. They\nrequire a comprehensive approach and sustained efforts\nby the States concerned, as well as the assistance of\nregional arrangements and organizations.\nToday, economic, social and humanitarian problems\ncan be discussed without the veil of ideology. We can\nnow address issues such as poverty, population, social\njustice and human rights without engaging in a contest of\ncompeting social systems. The linkage of world peace\n18\n\n\nwith economic and social development, with the rule of law\nand respect for the rights of the individual, is now\nincreasingly accepted. The concept of security has\nwidened. It now comprises not only military and political\nfactors but also, inter alia, the human aspect and the needs\nof the individual as well.\nWe have taken important decisions at Rio on\nenvironment, at Vienna on human rights and at Cairo on\npopulation policies. Next year we shall meet at\nCopenhagen for the World Summit for Social Development\nand in Beijing to enhance the empowerment of women. In\n1996 the second Habitat Conference will convene at\nIstanbul. Those conferences should lead to a better\nunderstanding, and ultimately acceptance, of the new\nconcept of sustainable human development. The Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Agenda for Development should complement the\nprocess, and outline the role of the United Nations in the\nlarger context of improved global governance.\nIn this wider perspective the promotion and protection\nof human rights is crucial. The results of the World\nConference on Human Rights held at Vienna must be put\ninto practice. I am convinced that the High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights will ensure that the promotion of human\nrights is included as an integral part of all activities of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn 1992 the Security Council, unanimously and at the\nhighest political level, stated that the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction constituted a threat to\ninternational peace and security. The Council thus affirmed\nthe fundamental norm first established by the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) a quarter of\na century ago. The almost universal adherence to the NPT\ndemonstrates that the world now shares a common interest\nin its continued existence. Finland believes, as do many\nother States parties, that the existence of the NPT must be\nsecured through its indefinite and unconditional extension\nnext year.\nI have referred to the challenges to the United Nations.\nPerhaps the greatest concern today is the lack of\ncommitment to the Organization by many of its Member\nStates. Without the full commitment of all of us, the\nUnited Nations cannot assume its role as a centre for\ninternational conciliation and cooperation. This is\ndemonstrated by the financial situation of the Organization,\nwhich is very critical. Member States - and I refer\nparticularly to those which face no constraints on their\ncapacity to pay - must change their attitudes and pay\nforthwith and in full their assessed contributions and their\narrears. Otherwise, this Organization will not be able to\nfunction.\nFinland has always paid its contributions in full and\non time. So have some others, but regrettably few. Now\nwe must all accept a strict budgetary and financial\ndiscipline. Breaches of this discipline must be sanctioned.\nPayment of interest on arrears should become standard\npractice and should be enforced. At the same time, of\ncourse, we must demand that the United Nations pursue\nits ongoing administrative and financial reforms.\nAs the United Nations embarks on its second\nhalf-century, the circumstances are essentially different\nfrom those which prevailed for most of the first 50 years.\nIt is therefore important to reshape our Organization to\nmeet the challenges of tomorrow, not those of yesterday.\nThe work done on the reform of the Security\nCouncil during the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly was very useful. We need now to continue\nthat work and to arrive at conclusions acceptable to all.\nWe need to ensure the continued efficiency of the\nSecurity Council, while making its composition better\nreflect today\u2019s realities, such as the increasing\nresponsibility, inter alia, of Germany and Japan, in world\naffairs.\nAs we approach the fiftieth anniversary of our\nOrganization, we should build on the solid foundation of\nthe Charter. Our priorities should be to focus on\nprevention and peace-building in securing peace and\nstability, and also on sustainable human development in\norder to bring about security at the individual level; and\nto restructure our Organization to achieve better global\ngovernance.\nThese priorities should guide our joint efforts as we\napproach the next millennium - \\\"United for a Better\nWorld\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "May I\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. I am convinced that your vast experience and\nyour leadership will contribute greatly to the success of\nthe session. At the same time, I wish to acknowledge the\nexcellent work of your predecessor, Ambassador Samuel\nR. Insanally of Guyana, during the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nI should like also to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ndedication to the cause of the United Nations.\nThe evolution of the world scene since the last\nsession confirms that we live in an age of historic\ntransition. The encouraging developments in South Africa\nand in the Middle East confirm that conventional\nparadigms of the international system are changing.\nNations have become so interdependent that force can no\nlonger act as the final arbiter. In relations between\nnations, rules, agreements and civilized norms have come\ninto play as much as traditional regulators.\nUntil the modern era we lived in what might be\ncalled a Hobbesian world, where conflict, rather than\ncooperation, was the defining characteristic of relations\nbetween nations. Basically, international relations were\nregulated through the mechanism of the balance of power.\nSometimes we had the hegemony of one Power, and\nsometimes several Powers acting in concert, but these\nwere only variations of what was essentially a struggle for\npower, a struggle for domination.\nThen, in the early part of this century, came the\nWilsonian vision, which called for a global organization.\nTo this vision we owe the United Nations. After the\nSecond World War - even at the height of the cold war -\nmankind envisaged a bolder world. The vision of a\nglobal welfare was presented, for example, by the\nSwedish scholar Gunnar Myrdal, who urged us to move\n\\\"beyond the welfare state\\\".\nNow, at the end of the twentieth century, the demise\nof the cold war offers us yet another vision of a new\nworld. The old order based on force is losing its grip on\ninternational relations. Gone are the days when defects in\nthe balance of power necessarily invited ambition or\n20\n\n\nadventure. The days of expansive and proselytizing\nideologies have passed. A new order based on peaceful\naccord, cooperation and interdependence is emerging.\n\nThis can best be characterized as a non-zero-sum\nglobal society. In today\u2019s world no country can remain\nunaffected by the havoc of another, whether caused by\nhunger, tyranny, environmental pollution or the proliferation\nof weapons. Similarly, every country can benefit from\nworld prosperity, world peace and a cleaner world\nenvironment. This new world, if successful in addressing\nthorny issues such as the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, will allow us to escape from the age-old\nsecurity dilemma.\nWhat can we do to solve such critical impending\nproblems as poverty, pollution, population, national\nconflicts, oppression and the arms race? Most of all, we\nneed shared values and common purposes. We first need\na sound understanding of the nature of these new problems.\nWe must recognize that these are problems that affect us all\nand require our concerted efforts.\nIn this new era genuine world peace cannot be\nachieved without our properly addressing the issues of\nsocial and economic development.\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on an agenda for development as a timely and\nappropriate initiative. His report has moved the United\nNations to the foreground of discussions on development.\nGiven the importance of the political will of nations in\nthis endeavour, the United Nations system as a whole\nshould play a leading role by serving as a forum for nations\nto work out remedies for economic and social problems\nwhich undermine peace and security in many parts of the\nworld. We hope that the current General Assembly session\nwill provide a much needed opportunity for more serious\ndiscussion on these vital issues. Taking advantage of its\nrecent experience in development, the Republic of Korea\nwill make its full contribution to the effort for global\neconomic and social development.\nIn June this year a variety of issues on development\nwere discussed at the World Hearings on Development. At\nthese Hearings special emphasis was placed on human-\ncentred development, the interrelationship between peace\nand development and the need for strengthening\ninternational cooperation. I hope that a concrete action\nprogramme will be worked out, based on the informative\nviews presented at the Hearings and at the high-level\nsegment of the 1994 substantive session of the Economic\nand Social Council.\nOur past experience has taught us that social\ndevelopment and economic growth are inseparable.\nMeaningful social progress necessarily includes\nsubstantial economic growth. At the same time, the\nsubstance of social development - the promotion of social\nwelfare, equitable redistribution and the protection of the\nenvironment - is crucial for sustainable economic growth.\nIn this context, I am convinced that the World Summit\nfor Social Development, to be held in Copenhagen next\nyear, will set a new landmark in the field of social\ndevelopment by producing effective and feasible action\nplans.\nEconomic and social development is closely linked\nwith environmental issues. During the past four decades\nthe world population has doubled, while the global\neconomy has grown eightfold. For the first time the\nEarth has begun to feel the heavy strains of human\nactivity. It has become evident that the planet can no\nlonger keep up with the pace of its exploitation. A\nbalance must be struck, and harmony sought, between the\nenvironment and development.\nTwo years ago the United Nations took a most\nimportant initiative by holding the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development. We\nshould uphold the goal set by this conference:\nenvironmentally sound and sustainable development. To\nachieve this goal, the advanced countries should play a\nleading role in protecting the environment. Support\nshould be given to developing countries in the form of\nfinancial contributions and the transfer of\nenvironmentally-sound technology. Developing countries,\nfor their part, should make efforts commensurate with\ntheir capabilities.\nAs a member of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment, the Republic of Korea has actively\nparticipated in formulating global regimes for the\nenvironment. We have joined international environmental\nagreements and contributed to the Global Environment\nFacility (GEF). My Government will continue its efforts\nand cooperation to attain both development and a better\nenvironment.\n21\n\n\nToday we are witnessing a massive exodus of people\nin many parts of the world, the consequence of armed\nconflict and natural disasters.\nWe are pleased that the United Nations capacity to\nprovide humanitarian assistance has been strengthened\nthrough close coordination between its relevant bodies.\nHowever, appeals for urgently needed resources are usually\nmet with a fraction of the targeted figures, thereby seriously\nhampering the effective implementation of humanitarian\nprogrammes. Once again, we need generous assistance\nfrom the entire international community.\nI am happy to report that, thanks to the recent public\ncampaigns organized by the Government and various non-\ngovernmental organizations in Korea, the Korean public has\nbeen alerted to the importance of humanitarian assistance.\nThis is demonstrated by the fact that we have been sending\nfinancial aid, medical personnel and supplies to such\ntroubled spots as Rwanda.\nOn human rights, more than a year has elapsed since\nthe Vienna World Conference on this important subject was\nheld in 1993. My Government is encouraged to see that\nsome of the provisions in its Programme of Action have\nalready been implemented.\nSince last year the Korean Government has been\npursuing in earnest a policy that we call \\\"new diplomacy\\\",\nwhich emphasizes the universal values of human rights,\nwelfare, liberty and democracy. Currently we are preparing\nto become a party to the Convention against Torture, and\nlast July the Third United Nations Workshop for the\nAsia-Pacific Region on Human Rights Issues was held in\nSeoul. Among the outcomes of the Workshop was\nacceptance of our proposal to hold the Workshop on a\nregular basis. That agreement is an expression of the\ncollective will of all the Asia-Pacific countries, which has\nhelped us to move one step closer to the ultimate\nestablishment of a regional human rights institution.\nAnother critical task for global peace and security is\npreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nboth nuclear and biochemical. Most urgently, we must deal\nwith the problem of nuclear proliferation. The Republic of\nKorea supports the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) at the Review\nand Extension Conference in 1995. The Treaty has made\nan enormous contribution to international security as the\nmainstay of the non-proliferation regime. The legitimacy\nof the NPT should be reinforced through renewed efforts on\nthe part of the nuclear Powers and through increased\ninternational cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear\nenergy. At the same time, the effectiveness of the NPT\nregime should be enhanced by strengthening the\nsafeguards system of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA).\nThe negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban Treaty\n(CTBT) at the Conference on Disarmament are also very\nimportant. A universal and verifiable CTBT will\nundoubtedly serve as a major instrument in strengthening\nthe non-proliferation regime and advancing nuclear\ndisarmament. The recent changes in the world order\nrequire a rationalization of disarmament agendas and new\nworking methods. The multilateral disarmament\nframeworks must meet these requirements. In view of the\never-increasing importance of the Conference on\nDisarmament as a negotiating forum, its membership\nshould be expanded.\nIn keeping with the spirit of the United Nations\nCharter, efforts for disarmament and security measures\nshould also be encouraged on the regional level. In this\nregard, the Republic of Korea welcomes the productive\ndiscussions on confidence-building measures at the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nRegional Forum last July in Bangkok. A security\ndialogue for the North-East Asian subregion would\ncomplement this region-wide framework.\nA major challenge to the NPT regime is the North\nKorean nuclear problem, which poses a serious threat not\nonly to the Korean peninsula, but also to the Asian--\nPacific region and the world as a whole. The suspicions\nsurrounding the North Korean nuclear programme should\nbe completely cleared by securing transparency of its\nnuclear activities, past and future, as well as the present.\nFor this, North Korea should fully cooperate with the\nIAEA in the implementation of the safeguards agreement\nand implement the Joint Declaration on the\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nIf North Korea fulfils its obligations in good faith,\nwe will do all we can to assist the DPRK in the peaceful\nuse of nuclear energy. Depending on the resolution of\nthe nuclear issue, the Republic of Korea stands ready to\nmake its technological and capital resources available for\nNorth Korea\u2019s overall economic development in the spirit\nof mutual prosperity.\nThe post-cold-war international situation presents us\nwith opportunities for a new world as well as multiple\nchallenges to our efforts for peace and development.\n22\n\n\nTherefore, it is all the more imperative that the role of the\nUnited Nations be increased.\nOne of the most remarkable changes in the aftermath\nof the cold war is the strengthened role of the United\nNations in peace-keeping. As regional conflicts have come\nto replace the bipolar confrontation of the cold war, United\nNations peace-keeping operations have expanded\ndramatically, both in number and mandate.\nGiven the limited resources for United Nations\npeace-keeping activities, more effort should be made for the\neffective use of preventive diplomacy. The decisions on\nUnited Nations involvement in actual conflicts should be\nmade selectively and with proper priorities. Continued\nefforts should also be made to address the modality of\nintervention and the means of securing the necessary\nresources.\nThe Republic of Korea remains firmly committed to\nUnited Nations peace-keeping activities. As part of its\nongoing support, the Republic of Korea sent an engineering\nunit to Somalia last year. Last month we dispatched a\nmedical unit to Western Sahara, and in a few days Korean\nmilitary observers will arrive in Georgia. Korea also plans\nto join United Nations efforts to arrange stand-by forces.\nThe new diplomacy of my Government puts emphasis\non globalism. Through active engagement in global affairs,\nKorea seeks to play its due role within the United Nations\nframework. It is in this vein that the Republic of Korea has\npresented its candidature for a seat on the Security Council\nfor the 1996-1997 term. We look forward to the\nencouragement and support of other Member States for this\neffort.\nWe support reform of the United Nations. Reforms\nare needed in order better to cope with the new challenges\nfaced by the world body. As United Nations membership\nhas increased from 51 in 1945 to 184 in 1994, an\nenlargement of the Council seems in order. The key\nquestion is how to increase the number of seats without\ncompromising the Security Council\u2019s effectiveness.\nCreation of a third category of Council members, coupled\nwith the expansion of non-permanent membership, may be\nan answer.\nFor the United Nations fully to assume its role in the\nnew international environment, its financial difficulties\nshould be duly addressed. It is also imperative that the\nefficiency of the Organization and its management be\nenhanced to guarantee the effective use of available\nresources. In this regard, my delegation welcomes the\nestablishment of the Office of Internal Oversight Services,\nand looks forward to the active role of the\nnewly-appointed Under-Secretary-General for Internal\nOversight Services.\nThe Republic of Korea feels a particular sense of\naffinity with the United Nations. Both Korea and the\nUnited Nations were born in the wake of the Second\nWorld War. Upon creation, both entertained great\nexpectations: the United Nations hoped for global peace;\nKorea hoped for national integrity and prosperity. They\nboth experienced disappointment, however, as their\nexpectations were crushed by conflict and division: the\ncold war and East-West division for the United Nations;\nthe Korean War and South-North division for Korea.\nNow, at last, the United Nations has risen from its\nunhappy past with new hopes; the world body is no\nlonger held hostage to the paralysing cold war vetoes.\nThe Republic of Korea has also overcome socio-political\ndifficulties and economic underdevelopment. But the\ndivision on the Korean peninsula still remains. It is the\nardent wish, and also a firm belief, of the Korean people\nthat the shackles of national division will soon be broken\nas the South and the North work together in the spirit of\nreconciliation and cooperation.\nMy country\u2019s unique relationship with the United\nNations makes the upcoming fiftieth anniversary all the\nmore meaningful to us. The National Committee of the\nRepublic of Korea for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the\nUnited Nations was established last April. This\nCommittee is preparing a number of programmes, with\nspecial emphasis on enhancing the awareness of the role\nof the United Nations among the new generation. We\nalso plan to actively participate in the programmes\nsponsored by the United Nations. In this regard, I am\npleased to note that a leading Korean corporation is\nparticipating as a global sponsor in the preparation for the\nUnited Nations fiftieth anniversary.\nNext year the United Nations will celebrate its\ngolden anniversary. It will be an occasion for us all to be\nreminded once again of the goals set forth in the Charter\nof the United Nations. The new world which was\nenvisaged by the founding fathers of this body is yet to\ntake shape. But we must be aware that we now stand at\na critical juncture in history, and that a rare opportunity\nhas been handed to us.\n23\n\n\nWe have to reach for a peaceful and prosperous world\nbased on interdependence and cooperation between nations.\nSuccess will depend on our ability to understand the nature\nof the new global environment, which is fundamentally\ndifferent from the old one, and on our determination to\nmeet the challenge.\nWe have to associate ourselves with the forces that\nwill shape the future. United, and only by being united,\ncan we build and thrive in this new world society.\n"

        "file_text": "First, it gives me great\npleasure to congratulate the President on his unanimous\nelection. Like other colleagues who have preceded me,\nI am confident that he will guide us through this session\neffectively. Allow me also to place on record our\nappreciation for his predecessor, Ambassador Insanally,\nwho presided over a very hectic and productive session.\nThe end of the cold war has not led us to the end of\nconflicts. Instead, it has given rise to many internecine,\nintra-State ethnic and religious conflicts, bringing\ndestruction, chaos and suffering in their wake. With the\nmajor Powers preoccupied with their domestic economic,\npolitical, social and other problems, the world has had no\nchoice but to turn to the United Nations for help. Firstly,\nthere is no alternative. Secondly, there is the expectation\nthat, freed of the past super-Power rivalry that had\nimmobilized the United Nations, the United Nations will\nnow be able to fulfil the aims of its founding fathers to\ncreate a better world.\nIn the last few years, with these demands for United\nNations action increasing manifold, the United Nations\nhas had to grapple simultaneously with many trouble\nspots around the world. In its first 42 years of existence\nuntil 1988, the United Nations launched only 13 peace-\nkeeping operations. But in the short space of the last six\nto seven years, it has seen 21 peace-keeping operations.\nPeace-keeping expenditures have also risen dramatically\nfrom the 1986 figure of about $350 million to $3.4 billion\nprojected for 1994.\nInternational relations have for a long time been\nconducted in an inter-State system, with the overriding\nprinciple being respect of the sovereignty of independent\nnations. The main focus of the United Nations Charter\n14\n\n\nwas and is on how the international community can respond\nto threats to peace and security issues between\nnation-States, as opposed to crises within a State. The\nworld community and the United Nations in particular have\nrelatively little experience to draw upon in managing\nintra-State conflicts and intra-State peace-keeping. The\ndilemmas faced by the Security Council in dealing with\nSomalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Rwanda, just to name a few,\ndemonstrate that the United Nations is still evolving its\napproach on how to respond to these challenges.\nThese new challenges of dealing with intra-State\nconflicts, it would appear, will continue to be with us. The\n1994 United Nations Development Programme report on the\nHuman Development Index indicates that 79 of the 82\nglobal military conflicts since 1991 were intra-State in\nnature. Can the United Nations, which represents the\nworld\u2019s conscience, avoid getting involved in such\nconflicts? On the one hand, the United Nations is criticized\nfor not intervening in Rwanda in the earlier stages of the\ncivil war. It is argued that if it had, we could have avoided\nthe immense humanitarian disaster we now see in that\ncountry. On the other hand, others maintain that the United\nNations is not ready to shoulder the implied responsibility,\nafter getting involved in intra-State conflicts, of nursing a\ncountry back to the political stability and economic health\nwhich is, of course, necessary to prevent a repetition of\nfamine, chaos and other troubles.\nMember States are coming round to recognizing that\nthere are political, financial and institutional limitations to\nthe United Nations. We cannot realistically expect the\nUnited Nations to resolve all forms of civil wars within\nnational boundaries. For now, we have reverted to the\nmore onerous but perhaps sensible approach of responding\nto situations on a case by case basis. Inevitably, however,\nthe United Nations will need to establish guidelines and\ncriteria, either formal or otherwise, to decide where United\nNations involvement will be necessary and when it will be\neffective.\nThe Security Council already appears to have taken\nsteps in this direction. In a May 1994 statement, it agreed\nthat the existence of a threat to international peace and\nsecurity, and of a clear political goal reflected in a precise\nmandate, are factors which should be considered when\nestablishing new peace-keeping operations. Other factors\nshould include, inter alia, whether a cease-fire exists and\nwhether the parties have committed themselves to a peace\nprocess intended to reach a political settlement.\nSignificantly, the Security Council also asked that it be\ninformed of the likely availability of resources for the new\noperations. These are but preliminary guidelines. It will\nbe necessary to build upon, refine and modify them to\nbest meet the evolving peace and security challenges of\nthis new era.\nIn many cases of intra-State conflicts, it is probably\nmore effective to address the underlying causes of conflict\nand provide a foundation for socio-economic\ndevelopment. The root causes of many conflicts are\nsocio-economic: the distribution of scarce resources and\nthe lack of development. Hence, we may do better to\nconcentrate on development aid, education, good\ngovernance and basic infrastructure-building to lay the\nbuilding-blocks to create a civil society. Where\nappropriate, these measures should be accompanied and\nsupplemented by preventive diplomacy. Peace-keeping\noperations are a palliative, not a substitute for solving the\nroot causes of conflicts.\nAt a time when the United Nations is called upon to\nundertake and adapt to new and complex leadership roles\nin international peace and security, the persistent financial\nproblems faced by our Organization have clearly to be\naddressed and overcome. The crucial point is that, having\ndecided to launch a peace-keeping operation, Member\nStates cannot allow it to fail, especially owing to lack of\nresources. The very credibility of our Organization would\nbe questioned if we were to mandate the United Nations\nto take on new peace-keeping operations, and then watch\nthem falter and fail because Member States are unwilling\nor unable to provide the requisite resources.\nUnfortunately, the Secretary-General had to again\nwarn the Presidents of the Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly in July this year of the dire financial\nsituation of the United Nations, especially in peace-\nkeeping. Unless we do something, these warnings will be\nrepeated year after year. With the many multidimensional\nchallenges facing the United Nations in the post-cold-war\nera, it is difficult to envisage how the United Nations will\nbe able to carry out its functions effectively if it has to\nlive from hand to mouth in this manner. It is time\nMember States seriously addressed the issue of financial\nresources and tackled it firmly once and for all.\nThere is only one solution to the financial crisis of\nthe United Nations: Member States must pay their\nassessments in full and on time. Without our payments,\nthe United Nations simply cannot function.\nMany Member States have failed to honour the legal\nand binding obligations that require them to pay their\n15\n\n\nassessments in full and on time. Obligatory and legitimate\npayments are unconditional and incumbent on all Member\nStates. In fact, individual Member States have no reason\nto withhold or threaten to withhold contributions to the\nUnited Nations, as each Member State has the opportunity\nto present and argue its case for or against any United\nNations activity. Each Member State also has the chance\nto scrutinize the budgetary implications of each decision\nand consequently to negotiate a consensus with other\nMember States as is the practice for all budgetary matters.\nBut this is by now a tired mantra. In order to\nencourage timely payments, Member States should consider\nproposals already being discussed in United Nations circles,\nsuch as a system of charging interest on late payments,\nthough with due consideration for the difficult situations of\nthe least developed countries. We would also like to\nsuggest that Member States use the symbolic event of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to clear their\narrears and start with a clean slate financially. Member\nStates could undertake a joint commitment to pay up all\ntheir outstanding contributions to the United Nations before\nthis symbolic day in 1995.\nThe Security Council has a particularly critical role in\nthe United Nations. The Charter confers upon it the\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\npeace and security. As spelt out in the Charter, the\nmembership dues of a State Member of the United Nations\nare one of the few and most basic of the obligations of\nUnited Nations membership. Now, if a permanent member\nof the Security Council cannot even meet this basic\nobligation, how can it meet the heavy and serious\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and\nsecurity on behalf of all Member States? We must\nestablish the principle that the permanent members of the\nSecurity Council, with their privileged positions, should not\nbe in arrears. They should in fact set an example for the\nrest of the United Nations membership in meeting their\nfinancial obligations. For the same reason, permanent\nmembers must continue to bear special responsibilities in\nthe financing of peace-keeping.\nI hope Member States will consider our proposals\nseriously. I believe these proposals can lead to concrete\nresults in improving the financial situation of the United\nNations and even lay the basis for the United Nations better\nto manage the difficult challenges of this new era.\nSingapore is fully committed to working together with the\nSecretary-General and Member States to resolve the\nfinancial crisis of the United Nations.\nIt is expected that, with the rising costs for peace-\nkeeping operations, one of the most heated arguments in\nthe years ahead will be the apportionment of peace-\nkeeping expenses among Member States. Singapore will\nstrive, together with other Member States, to work out\nobjective political and economic criteria for improving the\nscale. It is clear that any ad hoc, arbitrary or voluntary\nmeasures in this regard will have little chance of success\ngiven the fact that this is a highly sensitive issue. There\nmust be a process of debate and discussion, however\nprotracted it may be, before we can arrive at a consensus\non a new scale. Singapore, for its part, is ready to pay\nmore in peace-keeping expenses provided, first, that this\nis the outcome of an overall reform of the peace-keeping\nscale and, secondly, that the problem of those who are in\narrears is seriously addressed.\nWe have come a long way since the founding of the\nUnited Nations 49 years ago. It is now time for us to\nrededicate ourselves to the goal of creating a better world,\nas envisaged by our Charter. What better time than now,\non the eve of our fiftieth anniversary, for us to place the\nUnited Nations on a sound financial footing and lay the\nfoundation for it to embark on its programmes and\nactivities for the next 50 years?\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I am happy to express to you, Sir,\nmy personal congratulations on your unanimous election to\nthe responsible post of President of the General Assembly.\nWe are all the more pleased because your human qualities\nand professional skills are certain to make a valuable\ncontribution to the success of this session of the General\nAssembly and because you represent C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and\nAfrica, a brother continent of Latin America, whose hopes\nand aspirations we share. Our thanks go as well to your\ndistinguished predecessor, the representative of Guyana,\nSamuel Insanally, who so skilfully presided over the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nFrom this rostrum, the rostrum of world peace,\nwhich has seen a succession of the most notable\nrepresentatives of all the nations, I address the peoples of\nthe globe on behalf of 5.5 million Hondurans.\nHonduras has emerged from the remarkable culture\nof the Mayas, who, in centuries past, invented the zero\nand developed mathematics, cultivated architecture,\npredicted eclipses, and produced an extraordinarily\naccurate calendar.\nThe ruins of Cop\u00e1n bear eloquent and beautiful\ntestimony to the greatness of a civilization that strove to\nkeep a written record of all that it did. Today, on the eve\nof the twenty-first century, we can barely decipher the\nwisdom contained in their petroglyphs. I am speaking,\nthen, on behalf of a people whose roots go deep down\ninto history, a people that after some centuries brought\nforth such world-class Central Americanists and\npan-Americanists as Francisco Moraz\u00e1n and Jos\u00e9 Cecilio\ndel Valle.\nLike the Maya, the people of Honduras are deeply\npeace-loving, and their democratic calling has evolved\nunblemished. In the midst of the Central American war,\nHonduras remained at peace. None the less, it was not\nspared the harsh consequences of the great Central\nAmerican crisis that devastated the region during the last\ntwo decades and from whose aftermath we still suffer.\nNotwithstanding the many virtues of the Honduran\npeople, we are still afflicted by economic, social, cultural\n\n\nand health problems that hamper development, obstruct the\nfull exercise of human rights and immerse many families in\ndire poverty.\nExactly eight months ago today, I took on the\nleadership of the destiny of Honduras through the freely\nexpressed will of our people. We are preparing the country\nfor the titanic struggle against corruption, the hard battle\nagainst poverty and the fight against illiteracy, for\nstabilization of the economy and for conservation of the\nenvironment.\nPeace and development require, above all, shelter,\nsustenance, land and jobs for all. They require universal\njustice, hope for everyone and promising prospects for\nevery woman, man, girl and boy.\nIn the face of all the challenges of the present, we\nhave opted to implement a moral revolution capable of\nstraightening out the administration of the State and of\ntransforming the country peacefully and democratically.\nThe driving principles and values behind that moral\nrevolution are larger than my people and Honduras\u2019s\ngeographical dimensions. The moral revolution, behind\nwhich I throw myself wholeheartedly, permeates our links\nwith other States and the international legal community.\nThe moral revolution means good government,\neconomic growth with equity, transparency in the\nadministration of the State and decency in the taking of\nimportant decisions and in daily work; it is political\ndemocracy, national identity, lush forests and healthy\nchildren; it is economics with a human face, the theory and\npractice of integration with the fraternal countries of\nCentral America, international solidarity and support for the\npeaceful settlement of conflicts; it is, in short, a clear and\nresolute step towards mankind\u2019s next millennium.\nOn the global level we are witnessing the last rites of\nthe cold war. We have seen the last of the after-effects of\nthe Second World War, effects that lingered on into this\ndecade. We are witnessing the globalization of markets and\nthe resurgence of ethnic groups crying out for their own\nidentity. We are seeing the unilateral actions of some\nStates give way to multilateral operations framed by the\nlegislation of this great world gathering. We see that\ncolonialism has come crashing down like, in the words of\nour national anthem, a black-feathered bird, and that\ncooperation among free, sovereign and independent nations\nis growing day by day.\nWe are participants in the historic transformation of\ndemocracy from a national value into a universal one,\nfrom something practised intermittently in certain\ncountries into a standard form of behaviour for States.\nAll this heralds a new dawn for mankind. But all\nthese triumphs, however grand, are still not enough.\nThe differences between North and South necessitate\na far-reaching dialogue in order that mankind may not be\ntorn asunder yet again. International cooperation for\npeaceful development must take place soon and to a\ngreater degree than that seen during times of war or\nconflict.\nCentral America is emerging, still licking its\nwounds, from the savage blows of two decades of deep\ncrisis and bloodshed. A quarter of a million dead is the\nhuge and tragic price that Central Americans paid for the\ncold war. Billions of dollars were poured into destruction\nand military confrontation between brothers. Now,\nunfortunately, only scant resources are being invested in\nbuilding new democracies and new economies.\nThis is a challenge for Central Americans and the\ninternational community alike. Our region is replacing\nthe agenda of war with that of peace and sustainable\ndevelopment. Our region - and in this respect my country\nis a trail-blazer - is bringing down the curtain on an era\nof confrontation and bringing it back up on one of unity\nand solidarity. In the era just past we had a lot of help;\nbut for the one that is opening up we can see very little.\nAlthough our own efforts are the engine of our\ndevelopment, international cooperation can strengthen us\nand speed up our progress. For this reason we call the\nattention of the international community to the fact that\nall those who contributed to our destruction have a moral\nobligation to cooperate in our reconstruction and to help\nundo the reversals the region suffered because of the two\ndecades of crisis.\nMy Government and people view with profound\noptimism the positive turn of events that has taken place\nin the conduct of Governments. Louis XIV considered\nhimself the State: \\\"L\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi.\\\" Hegel envisaged\nthe State as God\u2019s path towards the Earth, perfect reason\nwhich never errs. That led to the doctrine of raison\nd\u2019\u00e9tat as the motivating force behind the conduct of\nGovernments. Now, in the post-cold-war period, a new\nmotivating force is emerging: humanitarian reason. This\nchange is symbolized by our passage not only from one\n2\n\n\ncentury to the next, but, indeed, from one millennium to the\nnext. It is, in effect, a thousand-year leap: from\ngovernmental policy based on the interests of the State to\ninternational relations inspired by humanitarian concerns.\nIn this period of radical transition for mankind, there\nare lights at the end of the tunnel: the collapse of various\nbarriers, the weakening of racial segregation, the casting off\nof shackles that had kept different nationalities artificially\nbound together, the worldwide spread of democracy, and\nthe emergence of d\u00e9tente as a feature of inter-State\nrelations. These trends augur well for the building of a\nnew world order based on peace, mutual support and broad\ntolerance. The growing realization that reason must prevail\nover force should prompt our national leaders to convert\nthose rays of hope into great beacons for the maintenance\nof peace, security, democracy and, hence, sustainable\ndevelopment.\nMy country and people regard the development of the\nnew international economic order with stoicism as the\nworld becomes divided into blocs based on economic and\nstrategic interests. The nation-State is suffering a crisis of\nidentity and threats to its sovereignty. We are witnessing\nnew geopolitical formations in which power is being\ntransnationalized and the struggle for hegemony is passing\ninto another dimension. The new structure of the world\neconomy is marked by the supranational nature of decision-\nmaking in the field of finance and international trade.\nIf this emerging new international economic order is\nnot managed prudently, if we do not infuse it with\nhumanism and morality, we run the risk that in the short\nterm the already-existing rift in the world between poor\nnations and rich nations - what we used to call the North\nand the South - will widen further. The following words of\na Honduran poet speak eloquently to this: \\\"The poor are so\nmany that it is hard to forget them - so many that they\ncould be the pallbearers of a celestial body.\\\"\nIt is vital to have a more equitable new international\norder. Now more than ever, justice in the South is a\nprerequisite for peace in the North. The industrialized\nStates need to demonstrate their readiness to respond to the\neconomic proposals of the developing countries, which\nrepresent two thirds of the Earth\u2019s people.\nThese thoughts should serve merely to stimulate our\nimagination in the quest for solutions to prevent the\ndeterioration of our political, economic and social systems.\nIn the process of globalization, under the banner of\ndemocracy in the political field and the market economy in\nthe economic field, we have been making intense efforts\nat the regional and subregional levels to reduce political\nand economic differences among countries and regions on\nthe basis of the norms and institutions that should guide\nour collective life towards a basic model, one fashioned\nin accordance with the principles that underpin this world\nOrganization.\nThe United Nations must therefore pursue the\nanalysis and discussion of the major issues that call for\nthorough reflection in this process of political, economic\nand social globalization. Indeed, there has been a marked\nincrease in recourse to the United Nations as an\ninstrument to prevent, avert or halt international conflicts,\nand in order to legitimize the right of intervention in the\ncase of conflict between a State and its population or a\nState and the international community - but always in\nsearch of peace, freedom and democracy.\nThe manifest resolve of the States Members of this\nOrganization to work in concert towards this objective has\nbeen remarkable and vigorous, but it should be borne in\nmind that good intentions are of little use unless\nsupported by the political will to take the difficult\ndecisions required by situations such as this. Let the\napologists of violence and those who are nostalgic for\npower have no doubt that our political will to avert\nregional conflicts is unswerving, and that our political\naction is designed to promote stability, legitimacy and the\ndevelopment of effective democracies.\nWe share the concern and the distress at the events\noccurring in the sister country of Haiti. There is a\npressing need to put an end to this grave situation, which\nis an affront to human dignity and to the self-\ndetermination of peoples. My Government supports a\npeaceful settlement of the problem and is ready, within its\nlimitations, to take part in a United Nations peace-keeping\nmission once democracy is restored to that fraternal\ncountry.\nJust as we felt great satisfaction at the signing, last\nyear, of the historic mutual recognition agreement\nbetween the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO), we are gratified by the decision of\nthe State of Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan to sign the\nWashington Declaration of 25 July 1994. It reflects the\naspirations of the two peoples and Governments and seeks\nto find formulas for mutual understanding that will put an\nend to their substantial differences.\n3\n\n\nMy Government was particularly pleased to see a\nbleak chapter of human history in South Africa end with\nthe coming to office of a new Government led by President\nNelson Mandela. Today we look forward to seeing the\naspirations to freedom, peace, democracy and development\nwhose fulfilment that great leader desires for his people\nbecome a reality.\nSimilarly, though with a sadness that I cannot conceal,\nI must say that events in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the\ntragedy of Rwanda cause us considerable distress and\nanguish. These fratricidal conflicts should impel us to act\nurgently to eliminate armed aggression, genocide and the\npractice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" once and for all. We cannot\ncontinue to waver in implementing Security Council\nresolutions. Although this Organization has never played\nas big a leadership role as it is playing now, it is also true\nthat compliance with its resolutions in the framework of\noperations to maintain international peace and security has\nbeen put into question.\nMy Government deeply regrets the resulting tragic\nevents that have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and\ncaused a massive exodus of refugees. We therefore urge\nparties in conflict to act in a spirit of reconciliation, certain\nthat the international community will continue to extend\nhumanitarian assistance to them.\nIn the case of Cuba, the Government of Honduras\nagrees with the overall objective of restoring democracy to\nthat country, in the framework of the inter-American\nsystem. However, we believe that the policy pursued by\nthe Government of the United States of America is not\nconsistent with the need to remedy the critical political,\neconomic and social conditions prevailing in that brotherly\ncountry, and we sincerely hope that dialogue between the\nparties will prevail in this dispute.\nThe countries of the Central American region have\ncontinued to pursue policies based on resolutions adopted\nat presidential Summits, with a view to creating a new\neconomic, social and political structure for the benefit of\nCentral Americans. In this regard, at the recent fifteenth\nmeeting of Central American Presidents, held in the\nbrotherly Republic of Costa Rica, new circumstances\nprompted us to adopt an integral strategy for sustainable\ndevelopment in the region, a national and regional strategy\nwhich we call the \\\"Alliance for Sustainable Development\\\".\nThis is a Central American initiative in the political, moral,\neconomic, social and ecological fields, whose agenda will\nbe further enriched with the holding of the environmental\nSummit in Managua, Nicaragua, on 12 and 13 October, and\nthe International Conference for Peace and Development\nin Central America, to be held on 24 and 25 October this\nyear in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The International\nConference will be a good opportunity for the\ninternational community, as it did a decade ago in the\nmidst of a tragic confrontation, to express its solidarity\nwith a region that has turned war into reconciliation,\nconflict into human progress and totalitarianism into\ndemocracy. It would be terrible indeed if the world that\nextended its hand to us in those difficult times were to\nfail now to help us enjoy the dividends of peace.\nWe participated with similar enthusiasm and\noptimism in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads\nof State and Government in Cartagena de Indias, Republic\nof Colombia. As everyone present knows, there was\nbroad discussion there of aspects of trade and integration\nas elements in Ibero-American development. We\nattended that important meeting with the political resolve\nto tackle the problems that are besetting our countries and\ncausing dangerous economic and social imbalances, thus\nrequiring a search for concerted responses that will enable\nus to develop machinery to tackle the challenges of the\nfuture more effectively.\nIn accordance with this commitment, my\nGovernment believes that, although dialogue has been\nstrengthened, it is even more important to pursue the\npolicies adopted at that forum. In this context, we\nreaffirm our fullest support for the joint initiatives, which\nare based on the principles of representative democracy,\nthe defence and promotion of human rights, respect for\nsovereignty and the principles of non-intervention and the\nself-determination of peoples.\nOn a different tack, I should like to inform this\nworld forum that the degradation of the environment is a\nmatter of constant concern to us. In this regard, my\nGovernment attaches the highest priority to the search for\na solution to this problem. Mechanisms have been\nestablished to implement the resolutions adopted at the\nEarth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June\n1992.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to promoting a\nbalanced and integrated approach to sustainable\ndevelopment, as set forth in the Rio Declaration on\nEnvironment and Development. It is important that the\nAssembly expand on that idea and build an awareness of\nthe world\u2019s environmental unity so that a new relationship\nbetween mankind and nature can emerge, allowing us to\nwork together for its conservation and survival.\n4\n\n\nRegarding this sensitive matter, our National Congress\nis currently seized with the Conventions on Biological\nDiversity and on Climate Change, with a view to translating\nour words into deeds through their speedy debate and\nadoption.\nMy Government wishes to raise one other issue today,\nwith a sense of full responsibility and an awareness of the\ngravity of the effects of the crisis faced by developing\ncountries and the risks involved for the stability of the\nworld economy. We must acknowledge the importance of\nthe signing of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as well as the\nagreement creating the World Trade Organization, with a\nview to strengthening the multilateral trade system. We\ntrust that these instruments will help to ensure the\nliberalization and expansion of international trade for the\nbenefit of the developing countries.\nBut if in pursuing this goal the industrialized nations\ndo not act in accordance with the changes taking place in\ninternational economic relations, efforts within the\nframework of South-South cooperation will have to be\nstepped up. This is becoming not merely an alternative, but\na fundamental challenge to our capacity to act in these\nnegotiations, which can stem only from the coordination\nand support that impart resolution, continuity and\neffectiveness to the actions of the group of developing\ncountries.\nIn the context of what the United Nations means to all\nof us, my Government has attached the greatest importance\nto and has followed with great interest the process of\nreform of the Charter of the United Nations, particularly\nwith respect to the Security Council.\nIn the prevailing international circumstances and given\nthe role the Security Council has been called upon to play\nin the maintenance of international peace and security, the\nreforms that the membership is calling for, in accordance\nwith the purposes and principles of the Organization, should\nbe studied thoroughly and adopted with meticulous care.\nAny reform in the membership of the Security Council\nneeds to take into account the criteria established in the\nrelevant Articles of the Charter. It is essential to respect\nthe principle of equitable geographical representation, which\nwould permit us to increase the number of permanent and\nnon-permanent members democratically and to consider\nwhether or not it would be desirable to create a new category -\nthat of semi-permanent member - as has been suggested in\nthe open-ended working group on the restructuring of the\nSecurity Council established by the Secretary-General.\nIn this process of change, in addition to the\nprinciples that I have outlined we need to consider what\nbasic indicators would enable us to set the number of\nmembers at the right level. This is also true of the study\non the veto right, currently enjoyed by the five permanent\nmembers; my Government feels that this right should not\nbe granted to any category, whether permanent or semi-\npermanent. Thus, Honduras is not opposed to the\nestablishment of new categories provided this is done in\naccordance with the principle of the sovereign equality of\nStates and equitable geographical distribution.\nWith faith in God, in truth and in justice, I shall now\nreturn to my country to continue building the society we\nhave chosen and contributing to the attainment of the kind\nof world to which we all aspire. May everything work to\nthe good of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, Mr. President, to\ncongratulate Mr. Essy on his election and to wish all\nparticipants in this Assembly success in their work. My\nappreciation also goes to the Secretary-General for his\nable leadership of our Organization.\nAt this year\u2019s session the General Assembly will\ndeal with numerous issues of vital importance for the\nwhole of humanity. In the desire continuously to enhance\nthe role of the United Nations as a universal organization\nof irreplaceable character, every Member State must make\nits utmost contribution to the establishment of a better and\nmore prosperous world and to improving relations\nbetween the peoples on this planet, in the spirit of the\nCharter of the United Nations. In that spirit, my country,\nthe Republic of Macedonia, is prepared, with all of its\nmodest forces, to contribute to achieving these aims,\nwhich are of universal interest, and to improving the\nfunctioning and the role of this Organization. I would\nlike to assure the Assembly that our delegation will make\nits full contribution to that end.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nIn the Republic of Macedonia, hopes run high that\nthe work of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly will result in the adoption of the \\\"agenda for\ndevelopment - and we deem development the most\nimportant issue facing humanity on the threshold of the\nnew millennium. We are convinced that the work of this\nsession will also have a positive effect in overcoming\nacute crises and conflicts in the world. In short, we are\nprepared to make our full contribution to the\nstrengthening of the role and the importance of the United\nNations for peace and security in the world, economic\nprogress and the prosperity of humanity.\nThe last decade of this century has shown very\nacutely the problem of economic and social development\nin the world. On the one hand, there are the hopes of\nhumanity, rightly directed towards the world of highly\ndeveloped countries as a guarantor of economic progress,\nsocial safety, human dignity and a healthy environment.\nOn the other hand, underdeveloped countries are facing\nthe elementary issues of survival and escape from\npoverty, economic despair and insecurity.\nThe countries in transition, including my own, are\ngoing through a painful period of trying to find their own\nplace in the world of market economies and democracy\nand are additionally burdened by their own devastated\n29\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\neconomies, social problems and threats of new, regressive\nand undemocratic situations.\nThis controversial picture of the world shows the full\ncomplexity of international economic and social\ndevelopment and thus raises the question of a possible way\nout of such a situation. I am quite certain that the majority\nof the world sees the solution neither in various new\nideological concepts nor in new regional and political\ndivisions along such lines - and even less in ideas leading\nto a division of responsibilities and rights among countries\nbased on false altruism and utopian blueprints.\nA solution is possible only if we acknowledge the\ninterdependence of economic and social development. This\nis a fact to which no nation today can remain indifferent,\nregardless of its size and level of development. It is more\nthan obvious that the economic problems of the\nundeveloped world constitute a serious threat to the\ndeveloped countries. Furthermore, it is more than clear that\na solution to the problem of underdevelopment cannot be\nsought in the form of social assistance or gifts. On the\ncontrary, the very essence of global economic and social\ninterdependence teaches us that by helping the undeveloped\ncountries solve their problems developed countries are in\nfact helping themselves. Thus, the inferior position of the\nunderdeveloped should be redressed through mutual\nresponsibility and by opening the prospects for economic\ndevelopment and democracy under the best possible\nconditions on the world market.\nIn that sense, the successful end of the Uruguay\nRound of negotiations and the establishment of the new\nWorld Trade Organization in early 1995 are indeed\nencouraging. I am convinced that the new General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will stimulate the\nfurther liberalization of world trade and enhance the world\ntrade system, because the reduction and elimination of\nbarriers in world trade will provide a chance not only for a\nrealistic way out for the underdeveloped and countries in\ntransition, but also for the global growth of world trade and\neconomic cooperation as well.\nIt is no less important that the United Nations and its\nspecialized institutions aim their efforts at increasing\ninternational financial support for development and at\ntackling such acute problems as arrears and debt servicing.\nThese would be very concrete and positive steps towards\novercoming the problems of underdevelopment.\nThe comprehensive character of these problems must\nbe regarded with a very keen awareness of two global\naspects as well: protection of the environment and\ndemographic processes. Without these two aspects, a\nuniversal programme for economic and social\ndevelopment cannot be envisaged nor can any future for\nhumanity. Global economic interdependence strongly\nemphasizes the importance of regional and world\neconomic integration processes. Their outlook and\nadvantages are unquestionable and they should be assisted\nand encouraged by the United Nations. My country\nviews its support of such policies as increasing the\npossibility of and prospects for its own development as\nwell as the development of other developing countries and\ncountries in transition.\nDespite all the worthwhile efforts being made, I\nregret to note that the Declaration issued at the World\nConference on Human Rights in Vienna is not being\ncarried out as expected. The world is still faced with\ncrude and massive violations of human rights. The\ntragedies in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda are\ndistressing confirmations of this fact. There are many\ncountries where the economic, social and cultural rights\nof the people are being violated. Policies of racial, ethnic\nand religious discrimination are widespread. We have\nbeen witnesses to \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and genocide. And,\nwhat is most regrettable of all, these are all used as\nreasons for waging wars, murdering innocent people on\na massive scale and destroying towns and villages.\nThe region of the Balkans where my country is\nsituated is one such unfortunate example. The war in\nBosnia and Herzegovina continues. All the efforts of the\ninternational community, the Security Council and the\nmost influential countries of the world cannot convince\nthe Bosnian Serbs that peace is the only solution. It is\ntrue that the forces of peace are growing. However, the\nfeeling of uncertainty in the region is still present, and\neven spiraling. It is difficult to foresee a settlement of\nthe situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia that\ndoes not include full mutual recognition of the newly\nindependent States and the establishment of diplomatic\nrelations between them.\nThe sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro have\nseriously burdened economic conditions in the\nneighbouring countries, in a region where economic ties\nhad already been severed and economic assistance from\nthe international community is urgently needed.\nInsecurity in the South Balkans is also growing. The\nRepublic of Macedonia is being exposed to the classic\neconomic aggression of a unilateral economic embargo\nintroduced by Greece in February this year in order to\n30\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\nimpose its will in matters concerning Macedonian national\nidentity. Serious tensions have also been caused by the\nmost recent developments in Greek-Albanian and\nGreek-Turkish relations. These are all elements of great\nconcern to us.\nDue attention to this situation is being devoted by the\nrelevant responsible international factors and, within this\nframework, by the Security Council. I should like to\nreaffirm the positive role and contribution of the peace-\nkeeping forces of the United Nations deployed on a\npreventive mission in Macedonia, a very successful action\nundertaken in the interests of peace and deserving wider\nsupport.\nWith its peaceful policy and position, the Republic of\nMacedonia is a factor for stability in the region. We are\nsparing no effort to demonstrate that, even in a region as\nturbulent as ours, other solutions are viable; that peace is\nguaranteed by human and minority rights; that cohabitation,\ntolerance and mutual understanding between various ethnic\ngroups is possible; that relations between States become\nmore stable when the principles of the inviolability of\nborders are respected through cooperation on an equal\nfooting; and that problems can be resolved successfully\nonly through dialogue and political means. For us, a way\nout of the historical frustrations and war myths in the\nBalkans is possible only through the implementation of the\nprinciples of the new European model of open borders,\nintegration and cooperation.\nThat is why, today, the Balkan region needs the\nsupport of the international community on a number of key\nissues: an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\nprevention of a spillover of that war, and the establishment\nof permanent foundations for peace; the strengthening of\ndemocratic processes in all countries and in the region as a\nwhole, and, especially, an increase in awareness of human\nrights and the rights of national minorities; support for\neconomic reform in these countries, in view of the fact that\nmost of them are now in transition, and, most important,\ntheir incorporation into collective security mechanisms.\n\n\nThe worst threat for the Balkans is the emergence of\nnew divisions and regrouping along religious or ethnic\nlines. The Balkans cannot remain as a living relic of bloc\ndivisions in Europe and the world, since if it does it will\nbecome an open threat to peace and stability on the\ncontinent and in the world. This can best be avoided\nthrough preventive action by the international community\nin this region, not only in the form of monitoring\nmissions but through concrete policies which get the job\ndone.\nAllow me to conclude by expressing our hope that\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly will serve\nto strengthen the role of the United Nations, in the\ninterest of peace and security in the world, in the interest\nof harmony in global economic and social development,\nin the interest of the survival and protection of planet\nEarth and in the interest of humanity."

        "file_text": "Each\nyear\u2019s session of the General Assembly provides us with an\nopportunity to take a panoramic view of the world\u2019s great\nquestions and to reflect on the prospects for its future.\nFor my part, I am honoured to be speaking for the\nfirst time in this Assembly as President of the Republic of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. This experience is all the more stirring for\nme since I am returning to this lofty site of modern history\nwhere I participated in numerous sessions when I was my\ncountry\u2019s young Ambassador in Washington to the great\nAmerican nation. My vivid memory of those years is of\nhaving all alone represented my country on the day of its\nadmission to the community of sovereign nations through\nthe Security Council. That was 34 years ago.\nI am equally proud that you, Mr. President, a worthy\nson of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and of Africa, are presiding over this\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My pride is\nshared by the entire people of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on behalf of\nwhich I extend warm congratulations on your noteworthy\nelection to this prestigious post.\nThis election attests to the confidence and esteem\nwhich you enjoy in this forum thanks to your qualities as\nan experienced diplomat and to your great knowledge,\nacquired over more than two decades, of international\nrelations, in particular in Geneva and New York. It also\nexpresses recognition of the balanced pragmatism with\nwhich, for 34 years now, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has been\nconducting its foreign policy.\nI am therefore convinced that you conduct the work\nof this session with competence and skill.\nMr. President, allow me to thank your predecessor,\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, for the outstanding work\nhe accomplished throughout his mandate, as well as all\nthe members of his General Committee.\nFinally, on behalf of my delegation and in my\npersonal capacity, I should like to pay a well-deserved\ntribute to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General\nof our Organization, for his courageous action and his\ntireless efforts for peace and for understanding among\npeoples. We should like to assure him once again of our\nfull confidence and of our total support in his quest for\npeaceful solutions to the problems the world is\nexperiencing.\nMay I also take this occasion to voice, on behalf of\nall citizens of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, our deepest, most sincere\ngratitude to the eminent representatives of the States\ngathered here for the outstanding demonstration of\nfriendship and solidarity shown toward my country at the\ntime of the death of President F\u00e9lix Houphouet-Boigny.\nThe tribute to his memory in this very Hall, on 9\nDecember last, and the moving expressions of sympathy\non the day of his funeral, 7 February 1994, will remain\nforever enshrined in the collective memory of the citizens\nof C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n14\n\n\nI am gratified to take this opportunity solemnly to\nassure the international community of my determination to\npursue the policy of openness and the search for peace\nbegun by my illustrious predecessor.\nThe end of the Cold War had given rise to hope for\nfruitful relationships based on peace and on shared\neconomic and social development. Now there is general\nastonishment at the fact that the world, which the United\nNations is destined to serve, has entered a stage of\nuncertainty. No one imagined that the fall of the Berlin\nWall, whose symbolism marked the beginning of those\ngreat changes that we have been witnessing since 1989,\nwould expose such serious defects, which today are making\ntheir appearance in the most untenable forms in human\nrelations. In fact, we are ashamed at the idea of being\nwitness to political, ethnic and religious tensions and armed\nconflicts that we believed belonged to a bygone age.\nThe painful examples of the former Yugoslavia, of\nAngola, Burundi, Liberia, Rwanda and Somalia show us the\nintensity of the tragedies that we are experiencing.\nAs concerns Liberia, the implementation of the\nCotonou Agreement of 25 July 1993 is encountering\ndifficulties on the ground. Indeed, aside from the\ndifficulties which occurred in the establishment of\ninstitutions and the formation of the transitional\nGovernment, this Agreement has come up against the\nsensitive issue of the disarmament of the factions. That\ndisarmament was the precondition for the elections\noriginally planned for 7 September 1994.\nUnfortunately, out of a force assessed at approximately\n60,000 troops, only 3,000 soldiers of the United Liberation\nMovement for Democracy (ULIMO) and the National\nPatriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) have laid down their arms\nsince the first days of the disarmament operations. Since\nthen, the proliferation of factions and mutual distrust have\nfrozen the positions. We hope that the agreement just\nconcluded in Ghana on 12 September 1994 will experience\na better fate, leading to general elections and to the exercise\nof democracy in Liberia.\nIt is well known that C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has made great\nefforts for years now to find a peaceful solution to this\nconflict, which has repercussions of all kinds in the\nsubregion, especially in my country.\nAs to the tragedy in Rwanda, despite the burden of the\nLiberian conflict on our economy, we are ready to\nparticipate, as long as we receive the necessary logistical\nsupport, in the efforts of the international community to\nrestore peace in that ravaged country. Here we should\nlike to hail the courageous initiative undertaken by France\nto render humanitarian assistance to all those who have\nfallen victim to this tragedy.\nOther actions, particularly those undertaken by our\nOrganization and other Member States within the\nframework of the United Nations Assistance Mission for\nRwanda (UNAMIR) also deserve our encouragement.\nConcerning all hotbeds of tension, be they on the\nAfrican continent or elsewhere in the world, we launch\nthe same appeal for peace, tolerance and understanding.\nAs my illustrious predecessor, the late F\u00e9lix Houphouet-\nBoigny, used to say, a hungry man is not a free man.\nThese social and political difficulties that have arisen in\na number of States are caused for the most part by\nmisery, extreme poverty, hunger, fear, injustice, exclusion,\nignorance and intolerance. That is why, now that the\nCold War is over and the fiftieth anniversary of our\nOrganization is fast approaching, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire would\npropose to this Assembly that 1995 be proclaimed the\nInternational Year of Universal Solidarity.\nEvery man and woman should not only eschew\ntribal, religious, political and ideological hatreds, but\nshould also contribute individually and collectively to the\ncampaign against hunger, disease, ignorance and in favour\nof the implementation of the ideal of shared welfare.\nWhile the world continues to rend itself apart,\nseveral particularly positive events are genuine sources of\nsatisfaction and give grounds for hope.\nIn this regard, it gives me great joy to extend, on\nbehalf of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, a warm and fraternal welcome to\nthe South African delegation. As I did in Tunis during\nthe thirtieth Summit of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU), I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate\nto President Nelson Mandela our sincere congratulations\non his outstanding and historic election to the presidency\nof a democratic and multi-racial South Africa.\nAnother reason for satisfaction is the Middle East,\nwith the signing in Washington on 13 September 1993 of\nthe Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement between Israel and\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), whose\nimplementation began with the arrival in Palestine of\nPresident Yasir Arafat and the formation of the first\nPalestinian Government.\n15\n\n\nMay I here hail the Israeli and Palestinian builders of\nthis process, as well as all those who encouraged this event,\nwhich was welcomed unanimously. We also extend our\nbest wishes for the success of this great and noble\nenterprise and we hope that this highly sensitive region of\nthe Middle East will enjoy a just and lasting peace.\nNow more than ever, the world needs peace to release\nthe energies mankind needs to flourish. That is why\ndemocracy, perceived as one of the ways to guarantee\nfreedom, promote private initiative and the participation of\nall citizens in development, is something I particularly\ncherish.\nIn this regard, my Government and I have decided, as\na priority in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, to promote genuine political\npluralism and the strengthening of democratic institutions,\nwhile guaranteeing their proper functioning, for in our times\ndemocracy is irreversible and is an imperative for all of\nhuman society - and our prestigious universal Organization\nitself is no exception.\nHence, discussions begun several years ago on the\nrestructuring of some of its bodies, in particular the\nSecurity Council, seem to us timely in providing broader\nrepresentation for Member States without, however,\ndamaging its effectiveness.\nMoreover, in October 1995, the international\ncommunity will commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\nour Organization. This will provide an opportunity to\nproceed to a review - in our judgement, positive - of this\ninstitution to which mankind owes so much. It will also be\nthe time to recall that the founding fathers had risen up\nagainst the injustice of unequal development. They foresaw\nits tragic consequences which, unfortunately, we note today.\nEfforts to establish greater justice in international\neconomic relations have not yielded the expected results,\nand there is now an exponential increase in the gap between\nthe developed and the developing countries. While the\nformer continue to enjoy continually rising standards of\nliving and welfare, the latter, on the contrary, are now\nexperiencing a more serious deterioration of their\neconomies - if not generalized impoverishment. The\ngrowth rates noted in some of these countries cannot\nconceal or substantively reverse this deplorable trend.\nThe frontiers of poverty in Africa, as elsewhere, can\nbe made to recede only if the international community and,\nin particular, the United Nations rethinks the machinery for\ninternational cooperation and firmly commits itself to\npromoting development in these countries.\nThe economic and financial crisis Africa continues\nto experience since the beginning of the 1980s has led to\na setback in growth in nearly all of the countries of the\ncontinent. Nearly all these countries\u2019 economic\nparameters and indicators are today negative despite all\nthe bold recovery and economic restructuring measures\nthat have been undertaken.\nThat is why we call for ever closer solidarity\nbetween North and South, by which I mean a real\npartnership taking into account their genuine interests in\nan international economy of sharing.\nDid not the international community very early on\ngrasp this need for complementarity and solidarity by\nadvocating as long ago as 1974 a new, more just and\nequitable international economic order?\nFaced with geopolitical upheavals and new\nformations of economic blocs, and given the severe trials\nwhich have struck them specifically, the African States\ndemonstrated their joint will to integration by signing the\nTreaty creating the African Economic Community on 3\nJune 1991 in Abuja. The Treaty entered into force on 3\nJune 1994, and this demonstrates our determination to\ncope with these problems.\nHowever, all our efforts will be in vain without a\nfavourable international economic environment and\nsubstantial support by the international community.\nFor its part, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, sorely tried by the\neconomic crisis of the past few years, has, since 1981,\nengaged in several successive programmes of structural\nadjustment. These sacrifices, which followed 20 years of\nsustained economic growth, clearly highlighted the need\nto make further use of the abilities of our nation in the\ncreation and implementation of a development policy.\nThe economic reforms undertaken under the aegis of\ninternational institutions have called for significant efforts\nby the rural sector on which our development was based,\nwithout granting it social investments on a proportionate\nbasis.\nThe change in parity of the CFA franc, which took\nplace at the beginning of this year for 14 African\ncountries, is aimed at guiding the national economy\ntoward exports in order to achieve an economic take-off.\n16\n\n\nThis return to growth cannot be accomplished without the\nappropriate integration of the concerns of the various social\ngroups.\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is considered one of the African\ncountries that have made the most significant human\ninvestment during the first years of independence. On the\naverage, almost 7 per cent of its gross national product has\nbeen devoted to education. In our subregion, it remains the\ncountry with the greatest number of personnel with higher\neducation in all areas of economic activity. It is therefore\nincumbent upon us to proceed to an appropriate use of our\nhuman resources as the sine qua non for new growth and\ndevelopment.\nThat is why it is important that increased efforts be\nmade and that the appropriate means be provided to\nstrengthen the campaign against the terrible scourges\nafflicting various regions of Africa that are dangerously\njeopardizing the future of our societies. Malaria, the\ntraditional affliction of our continent, and AIDS, which\nappeared a decade ago and whose brutal force is well\nknown, are today the most significant of the epidemics\ncrippling Africa, which nevertheless aspires to development\nand makes no secret of its determination to succeed.\nIf we look at the past three decades, we see an African\ncontinent that has gone from a period of growth to one\ncharacterized by a constant decline in productivity, a\ngeneral exacerbation of the problem of poverty and the\nweakening of social parameters - in short, a progressive\ndeterioration of the economic situation.\nThe international community, it must be said, has not\nabandoned Africa. On the bilateral level and in multilateral\nbodies, policies have been devised to cope with the specific\nsituations experienced by the countries of our continent.\nThese efforts are commendable, for they are a concrete\ndemonstration of an all-important human solidarity.\nBut the world is changing, and Africa knows that it\nmust, through its own abilities, win its own place in world\ntrade and play an outstanding role commensurate with its\nimmense potential. It is aware today more than ever of its\nassets as well as of the challenge posed by its nearly\nmarginal position in relation to other regions of the world.\nIt will know how to take advantage of the many\nopportunities open to it by relying first and foremost on the\nwill of its peoples, their intelligence and creativity, and\ntheir capacity for reflection and initiative, in order to\nparticipate in the drafting and implementation of long-term\ndevelopment policies. It will also rely on the rest of the\ninternational community, its indispensable partner, to\ncreate new forms of active, mutually beneficial solidarity\nimplemented in full respect for the dignity of all\nparticipants.\nOf course, problems remain. Some, linked to the\nrecent past, such as the problem of debt, seem to be\nobstacles to the development of new initiatives. The\ninternational community and friendly countries must\nunderstand that indebtedness, which is designed\nspecifically to ensure a country\u2019s development, should not\nbe turned against it and transformed into a deliberate\nrestraint on its growth. Solutions to this problem have\nalready been put forward; all have the potential to\npromote a return to growth and renewed forms of\ncooperation.\nBut Africa must turn its attention to new challenges.\nIt must, for example, consider how to preserve and\nprotect its environment in order to ensure present and\nfuture generations an adequate and healthy framework in\nwhich all forms of life can develop in harmony. It must\ntake advantage of the great potential of recent agreements\non the organization of world trade in order firmly to\nintegrate itself into the flow of global exchanges. As the\ncontinent most blessed with reserves of raw materials, it\nmust master the technology to adapt them to its needs.\nThat will be the basis for its true resurgence. It has long\nbeen aware of all these imperative needs. Through\nsuccessive steps, particularly by regrouping on the\nsubregional and continental levels, it has begun to acquire\nthe means necessary to its reawakening.\nAfrica will succeed. It will succeed in warding off\nthe dark fate that seems to loom over it. It will succeed\nin ridding itself of underdevelopment in order to be a\npositive participant in the immense task of building a\nprosperous future for all humanity.\n"

We welcome the agreements\nreached between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO), as well as subsequent agreements\nreached between Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of\nJordan. We hope that this initial move, whose\nmomentum must be maintained, will augur well for a\ncomprehensive, permanent and enduring peace in the\nregion as a whole.\nWe have now entered a new era of renewed hope.\nAs the United Nations approaches its golden jubilee, it\nhas become increasingly evident that the majority of the\nnations and peoples of the world believe that the world\nOrganization is essential and are reposing renewed hope\nand confidence in it. In the aftermath of the cold war, we\nare witnessing a transition towards a new pattern of\ninternational relations. With the uncertainty of the\nhistorical process that is establishing a new world order,\nthe United Nations has once again become the eminently\nrelevant, perhaps even the indispensable, Organization\nthat its founding fathers wished it to be.\nThe emerging new international system and the\nuniversality of the membership of the United Nations, as\nwell as the abundant good will it has garnered, offer it the\nunique opportunity not only to establish new guidelines to\naddress international challenges but to ensure that the\ncoming new world will be permeated with the values of\ncollective security, peace, democracy, social justice and\ncooperation for mutual benefit. This is also a favourable\ntime for the United Nations to raise global awareness,\nfashion a common world outlook, probe new frontiers and\ncreate new standards, particularly in the realms of\nsustainable and equitable global development; conflict\nprevention, management and resolution; human and\ndemocratic rights; and social justice.\nThose great tasks, my delegation is convinced, will\ninevitably require commensurate changes in the structure\nand functional modalities of the United Nations system\nitself, if it is to cope with the challenges of the new\ninternational order. The institutions and agencies that\nreflected the exigencies of the last half-century must be\nmodified or yield to new ones that mirror not only the\noptimism and needs of the present but also the hopes and\naspirations of the future. The international system must\nturn \u2014 obviously, at a gradual and measured pace \u2014\ntowards a fairer and more equitable representation of its\nconstituencies in all the organs of the system, and\nespecially in the Security Council. This may indeed be\nthe most opportune time to review structural issues with\nnew vision and boldness, the ultimate purpose being to\ninstil and build into the system a dynamism that will\nenable it to respond and adjust promptly to changing\nglobal realities.\n20\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nFurthermore, we feel that the United Nations must\nplace significant emphasis on the creation of a reliable early\nwarning system that would enable it to avert disasters and\nconflicts. An active, rather than a reactive, role on the part\nof the United Nations can go a long way towards reducing,\nif not preventing, human suffering and towards mitigating\ndisasters and conflicts at reduced cost to the international\ncommunity.\nSecondly, all available evidence on the structure of the\nUnited Nations emphasizes the need to restructure it on the\nbasis of equilibrium between the forces of centralization\nand decentralization. Certain problems, such as the\nenvironment, population and disarmament, may necessitate\ncoordinated international action and centralized authority.\nOthers, including the breakdown of political systems and\nregional inter-State conflicts may be better and more\ncorrectly understood and solved by regional actors,\ninstitutions and approaches. There is thus an imperative to\nset in motion a dynamic arrangement balancing\ncentralization and decentralization to create the desired\njuridical basis for a new world order underpinned by a\npolitical culture of peace, justice, economic well-being and\na healthy environment. Playing such a catalytic role should\nbe the major preoccupation of the United Nations. Only\nsuch an environment can make the Organization an\neffective actor that protects and promotes peace,\ndevelopment and human rights.\nThe situation in the Horn of Africa is far from\nsatisfactory, although it may be improving day by day. I\nmust perhaps emphasize here that the impoverishment that\nstalks the region as a whole is largely man-made and\ncannot be attributed to the vicissitudes of nature, as is often\ndone. Decades of war and civil strife have sapped the\nenergy, productive capacity and problem-solving\nmechanisms of the populations, leaving them easily\nsusceptible to even minor imbalances in rainfall patterns\nand natural calamities.\nHence, international emergency assistance and, even\nmore, development assistance will remain vital for years to\ncome in overcoming the consequences of decades of war\nand turmoil. We in the Government of Eritrea, along with\nour regional partners, realize that reliable and sustainable\neconomic development will lie in effective regional\ncooperation hinging on durable peace and stability. It is in\nthis spirit that we and our partners are prepared to pool our\nresources to secure regional peace through mechanisms of\nclose consultation and coordination for conflict prevention\nand resolution, and by broadening areas of economic\ninteraction and cooperation.\nIt is against this backdrop, and within the framework\nof a regional approach, that we have attempted to address\nthe quest for collective security in our region. In Somalia\nthe countries of the region, under the chairmanship of\nPresident Melles Zenawi of Ethiopia, have done much to\nrestore normalcy to the country by bringing the warring\nfactions to the negotiating table. This regional effort has\ncomplemented and acted as a vital linkage to international\nintervention at a number of crucial junctures.\nIn this connection, we believe that this is an\nauspicious moment for the United Nations to decide to\nfocus in the period ahead only on the provision of\nassistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the\ndevastated country of Somalia. The opinion advanced by\nsome in the last few days that the extension of the\nmandate of the United Nations Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM) is vital for and will enhance political\nreconciliation is, we are convinced, seriously flawed.\nIndeed, all evidence from the country indicates that such\naction is likely to complicate or delay the process. On\nthe other hand, the Inter-Governmental Authority on\nDrought and Development (IGADD) should take upon\nitself, and be encouraged to continue, the political\nreconciliation it has facilitated in the past.\nIn the Sudan, the countries of the region have\napplied the same regional approach and have proposed\ndifferent frameworks of conflict resolution to facilitate a\ncomprehensive political settlement that takes into account\nthe best interests and welfare of both sides. Here, too,\nthe international community should encourage and support\nthe regional efforts undertaken under the auspices of\nIGADD.\nSome of the major problems that have existed for\nmany years are still with us and, indeed, there are now\nnew ones. Thus, the crisis in the former Yugoslavia does\nnot appear to be any nearer to solution. The events in\nRwanda are a tragic reminder of human folly and have\netched an indelible mark on the collective conscience of\nhumanity. These events no doubt reinforce the necessity\nfor preventive measures and perhaps the need to make a\nfresh assessment of the conventional limitations of the\nUnited Nations in peace-keeping.\n"

        "file_text": "As we who are gathered here deliver our statements, a small and impoverished Caribbean nation is being subjected to military occupation. The inconceivable deal struck with the generals responsible for the coup d'etat - yesterday threatened as murderers, but today turned into complacent partners - ignores the decisions of the international community and the will of the Haitian people. The fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter - indeed, the authority of the Security Council and of the United Nations itself - are among the victims of this unfortunate event, as they have been totally ignored in actions carried out allegedly on their behalf.\nHistory is repeating itself. It was the guns of invaders and the boots of foreign occupants that installed in Haiti the various dictatorships of this century and trained and supported those who are still perpetrating tyranny on their people. How, then, can we trust them to promote democracy in the future?\nCuba has always supported and promoted efforts to restore the constitutional order in Haiti with the unconditional and unrestricted return of President Aristide and has rejected the attempts to resort to foreign intervention as a means of resolving the conflict. At the appropriate time, Cuba denounced the Security Council's decision to go along with the violation of the Charter by some of its members and to join in their interventionist designs. Now that we are faced with a fait accompli, we can do nothing except reiterate our Government's position: those who are today applauding the invasion could become tomorrow's victims.\nIt is clear that an essential component of this tragedy is the manipulation to which the United Nations - an organization born under the pretext of the sovereign equality of its members - has been subjected.\nCuba reiterates its firm rejection of the attempts to adopt unilateral decisions on issues of vital importance to all peoples and of the abuse of the anachronistic privilege of the veto, granted by the Charter to a group of States with permanent membership of the Security Council.\nIt is urgent to ensure that democracy prevails in international relations and in the United Nations. We must ensure respect for the Charter and put an end to its systematic violation by the most powerful.\nOn this the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations it is imperative that the Organization be democratized without any delay. The time has come for this institution to stop catering to the interests of a handful of big Powers.\nMr. Mishra (India), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nThe President of the Assembly, a distinguished son of the African continent whose election to the presidency honours us all, is well aware that Somalia is still fresh in our minds. The tragedy of hunger and starvation in that sisterly nation has continued, even if television newsreels no longer show the horrible pictures that served as a prelude to the so-called humanitarian invasion sponsored by this Organization.\nIn spite of such invasions, Haiti and Somalia will continue to be poor countries. The evils of the third world are not resolved through military occupations, which are merely used to serve selfish interests.\nIn both cases, which have already become dangerous precedents, the Security Council acted under pressure from a big Power, which monopolized the implementation of these actions and even prevented the majority of Member States from voicing their views. In both cases, under the alleged authority of the Security Council, neutrality and impartiality, essential principles of that body, were violated.\nThese are examples of the Security Council's illegitimate foray into areas beyond its mandate: intervention based on vague arguments of humanitarian protection, or the authorizing of one or several States to take unilateral punitive actions, under Chapter VII of the Charter, in operations of invasion, occupation and intervention.\nIn fact, what is at stake is the sovereignty, self- determination and political independence of countless countries, mainly but not only of the third world.\nAttempts are being made, at the expense of the suffering of a number of peoples, and without their consent, to openly give carte blanche and a predominant role to the Security Council regarding issues alien to its mandate and on which this Organization has no prerogative whatsoever.\nThere is no doubt that the specific functioning of the Security Council deserves careful consideration, and that this body must become democratic, with an enlarged membership more representative of the countries of the third world. Poor and small countries are rightly entitled to be present on the Council and to demand that it follow equitable and transparent procedures in its activities. There should be permanent members from Latin America, Africa, and the developing countries in Asia. Membership should not be the preserve of large economic Powers associated with the West.\nThe Security Council cannot arrogate to itself powers that have not been invested in it, nor overstep the Organization that created it and to which it is accountable. The General Assembly must assert its control over the actions of the Security Council and demand that it respect the Charter.\nThere should also be greater response to the interests of the developing world in other areas of the Organization. The crucial problems of its peoples are not and cannot be resolved with invasions nor with allegedly humanitarian military operations. Nor can they be resolved with emergency assistance programmes whose only aim is to mitigate the most alarming consequences of structural underdevelopment.\nIf the international community and the United Nations, its most representative organization, do not adopt the timely measures and programmes required to develop the third world, we will be using this forum to debate the causes and consequences of the arrival of underdevelopment in the first world.\nThe growing concerns of industrialized countries over immigration issues is quite illustrative, as confirmed by the debates undertaken in the recently concluded International Conference on Population and Development.\nIt is clear that concepts regarding cooperation imposed from the North are prevailing, with flashy titles but devoid of any practical meaning for the solution of the problems brought about by poverty, and tending to mutilate the right to development for which peoples of the world are clamouring. Although concepts such as sustainable development, human development or sustainable human development may contain defensible ideals from a theoretical point of view, they are actually being used to corrode the commitments achieved during long years of efforts aimed at facilitating international cooperation for development on a just and democratic basis.\nUnacceptable conditions and interference in the domestic policy of States are thus being imposed, and attempts are being made to fix strategic priorities for development in countries that, though poor, are sovereign and independent. Hence, the right to development proclaimed by this Organization is being subordinated to the interests of the large transnational economic powers, which are actually continuing to dictate the rules and practices of international economic relations.\nThe United Nations agenda for development must not be allowed to replace the International Strategy for Development and other important instruments that were the result of the efforts of the developing countries to defend their interests and on which they exhibited great flexibility and the ability to compromise.\nNor should the United Nations continue to be allowed to be used for the imposition of neo-liberal economic models, bringing backwardness and misery to millions of persons in exchange for short-term economic growth benefiting only the elitist minorities in third world countries and their partners in the affluent North.\nThe fundamental approach, in Cuba's view, should be focused on comprehensive economic growth based on justice and equity to meet pressing social needs. International economic relations must be restructured on the basis of effective, just, equitable and non-discriminatory cooperation with the countries of the South.\nPoverty is not a predestined fate, let alone a human right, no matter how hard the rich countries try to prove otherwise. As long as universal respect for human rights continues to be manipulated by a handful of rich nations, the have-nots of the South will continue to play the role of the accused, with the affluent societies in the North playing the parts of judge and jury.\nAll attempts to impose as universal dogmas systems of government designed by the privileged nations of the first world, regardless of the different social, economic, historical and cultural realities of the third world, are unacceptable and doomed to failure.\nWe must also put an end to hypocrisy.\nIt would be unforgivable for us to remain indifferent to the tragedy of humankind while wasting our efforts on elitist concerns. War, xenophobia, neo-fascism and racism are proliferating in our midst; the degradation of women and children is increasing; unemployment is on the rise; the environment is deteriorating and the culture of entire populations and nationalities is being crushed. Millions of human beings are afflicted by poverty and starvation; they are denied access to basic medical care and education. Yet the United Nations has done very little indeed to deal with these issues as what they really are: clear violations of human rights.\nCountries that are struggling, on the basis of equity and justice, to attain their development are really working in favour of the human rights of their peoples; countries that prevent us from developing are violating the human rights of our populations.\nThe Association of Caribbean States was recently established as a means of responding to the globalization of the international economy and of strengthening cooperation among the States, countries and territories of our region. We, the peoples of the Caribbean, are conscious of the fact that only by closely reconciling our interests can we become competitive markets. That new organization, brought into being by urgent needs, contributes, together with the Ibero-American Summits, to promoting the indispensable economic integration and joint analysis of common strategies in an environment that links us through history and culture.\nAs an integral part of that community of Latin American and Caribbean nations, Cuba has decided to sign, at the appropriate moment, the Tlatelolco Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in our region.\nIt is well-known that warships armed with nuclear weapons are anchored both in the portion of our territory illegally occupied by the United States and in neighbouring Puerto Rico. Without renouncing our demand for their withdrawal, we subscribe to the noble aims of Tlatelolco. We do so as testimony to our will to join with the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean, as a gesture towards our brothers in the region, and out of a desire to broaden our mechanisms for reconciliation and dialogue.\nAt the Ibero-American Summits, held since 1991, Latin peoples south of the Rio Bravo have for the first time met exclusively among themselves to discuss issues of common interest. Meanwhile, another Summit has been convened in, of all places, Miami. All the Governments in America except the one I represent have been invited. It is said that three main issues will be discussed: free trade, collective security and the promotion of programmes to alleviate extreme poverty.\nWe will have to determine which of the two Americas stands to reap the greater benefit from the Miami Summit. If positive results for Latin Americans were to emerge from the meeting, Cuba would sincerely welcome its convening, even if we were not present. It could become an excellent opportunity to demand of our neighbour to the North fair treatment in trade and financial relations, as well as in the transfer of technology, and to request the Host Country to fulfil its obligations in the field of international cooperation. It remains to be seen how a Government that has cancelled its meagre aid programmes to the region could raise the necessary funds to alleviate poverty among the countries convened.\nLet me now say a few words regarding my homeland. On two consecutive occasions this forum, by an overwhelming majority, has demanded the elimination of the economic, trade and financial blockade imposed upon my country by the Government of the United States. In both cases the United States has replied with silence.\nIt is not, as some would have it, a matter of victory for the blockaded nation and defeat for the blockading nation. Our friends or the Governments that fully support our policies were not the only ones that voted to put an end to this irrational siege. The simple fact is that the great majority of the world is witnessing an action that has no legal justification, moral virtue or ethical principle - an action that violates not only Cuba's sovereignty but also the most basic precepts of international coexistence. It is a policy rejected by all countries that espouse the rule of law and mutual respect in relations between States.\nIn this complex and convulsed world that is supposedly pluralistic, free and democratic, the United States is trying to deny my country, Cuba, its rightful place as a sovereign nation. It is as if two centuries of relations between the two countries meant nothing. What is worse, it is as if the cold war had frozen forever on our tiny spit of land and sun, merely because we had committed the \\\"sin\\\" of wishing to be free and truly independent a scarce 90 miles from the most powerful country on the planet.\nMy homeland has been subjected to hardships probably greater than those suffered by any other country. With the collapse of socialism in Europe, our markets and our sources of raw materials and financing disappeared overnight. The process of overcoming domestic difficulties and reforming the economic and administrative structures conceived at a certain stage of our socialist project was also disrupted by the reinforcement of the policy of isolation and strangulation that our people had already been stoically facing for years.\nIn the midst of this dangerous combination of elements; despite forecasts, since 1989, of a Cuban collapse, my country has not collapsed, nor will it collapse. We have survived all kinds of strategies, from those promoting terrorist and subversive actions from abroad to those of exerting pressure in different directions in order to reinforce the blockade, which, as I said, this Assembly has rejected for two consecutive years.\nThis does not mean that the plight of my people is no longer harsh and complex. In recognition of the proven patriotism and national dignity of the Cuban people, this world forum should issue an unequivocal appeal for justice and reject once and for all the cruel hostility to which Cuba has been so long subjected.\nThe unequal struggle forced upon us for so many years has not mitigated our love of peace. Cuba still aspires to negotiated solutions to its disputes with any country, provided that those solutions are based on sovereign equality and mutual respect. This Organization is well aware of that. We are a mature and flexible people: civilized and faithful to agreements based on equality and sovereignty.\nThe series of bilateral meetings recently held in New York led to partial solutions to the age-old dispute between\nCuba and the United States. The spirit of seriousness and respect that prevailed in those negotiations and the will on the part of both sides to find solutions made it possible to conclude a mutually satisfactory agreement that, if fully implemented, will lay the foundation for the normalization of migratory relations between the two countries.\nWe desire peace with all our neighbours: peace with dignity. Our sovereignty, our independence and the socialism that we freely chose will never be bargaining chips at any negotiating table, nor will we ever demand concessions of such a nature from any country.\nWe are increasingly opening ourselves to the world, without demanding or acceding to conditions. A great Power, however, is blockading us - and is blockading its own people and the sons and daughters of my people who live on its territory, preventing them from assisting and rejoining their families. Such cruelty has no parallel in the history of wholesale violations of human rights.\nWe do not beg, for our national hero, Jose Marti, the centennial of whose death in our struggle for true independence will come next year, taught us that mankind can never be ruled by cowardice and indifference. And, as he instructed,\n\\\"We ask the world, certain of its reply, whether the sacrifice of a generous people that is immolating itself in its efforts to open up to the world will meet indifference or hard-heartedness from mankind, for whose sake it is acting.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "Once again\nI am proud and honoured to have the opportunity to address\nthis assembly of nations and to convey to representatives\nfraternal and cordial greetings from the Government and\npeople of Saint Kitts and Nevis. The convening of the\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United\nNations provides the Governments of all Member States\nwith an important opportunity to reaffirm their\ncommitment to the cause of peace, democracy and the\npursuit of a higher quality of life for our peoples.\nI wish to join other representatives by extending\nwarmest congratulations from the Government of Saint\nKitts and Nevis to you, Mr. President, on your election to\npreside at this session of the General Assembly. I assure\nyou of my Government\u2019s continued support and\ncooperation.\nAllow me, Sir, to thank the outgoing President, His\nExcellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, for the astute and most\nable manner in which he conducted and guided the affairs\nof this body during its forty-eighth session despite\nunprecedented trials and numerous challenges. His\nresolve and his successes give credence to his\ncommitment to the planting of seeds of cooperation and\ngoodwill in every corner of the globe to ensure that our\nchildren and grandchildren may feast on harvests of\npeace, equality, freedom and democracy.\nThe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, has faced many problems of great\ncomplexity during the past year. I wish to congratulate\nhim on the outstanding manner in which he has been\ncarrying out the mandate of the Organization.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis shares the\ncommitment to democracy, respect for human dignity and\nthe protection of human rights. Our people enjoy the\n1\n\n\neffective workings of the democratic process and the\nsafeguards provided by its institutions. We are determined\nto do all that we can, in our time, to ensure that future\ngenerations too will be able to exercise their democratic\nfreedoms in an atmosphere of political stability.\nThere is an ever-increasing thirst for democracy\nthroughout the world. In our hemisphere, military regimes\nhave been giving way to democratically elected\nGovernments.\nNowhere has this process been more dramatic than in\nHaiti, where, in 1991, the people, in free and fair elections\nunder the keen scrutiny of the international community,\nchose Jean-Bertrand Aristide as their President. For almost\nfour years the will of the people of Haiti and the resolve of\nthe international community have been callously frustrated\nby the military, who usurped and have held on to power.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is in full agreement with the\nresolute action taken by the United States, with the support\nof the international community, to ensure compliance with\nSecurity Council resolution 940 (1994). The multinational\nforce has been carrying out its work with dedication,\nprofessionalism and restraint. While there have been some\nuntoward incidents, we must not be deterred. We must be\nprepared to stay the course for the benefit of the people of\nHaiti and for the growth of stable democracy in this\nhemisphere.\nThe process of establishing democracy will not end\nwith the return of President Aristide; it will have just\nbegun. In order to support the process, it is absolutely\nessential that the international community be ready to\nmobilize significant financial and technical resources to\nensure the rebuilding of Haiti\u2019s economy and institutions -\ninstitutions destroyed by decades of neglect and\nmismanagement. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands ready to\nassist in the long and arduous task of helping the Haitian\npeople rebuild their economy.\nFor many years the international community struggled\nto bring democracy to the majority of the people of South\nAfrica. Today South Africa can be held up as a beacon of\nhope and a testament to the triumph of democracy. Last\nyear my delegation welcomed the announcement of the\nholding of non-racial and multi-party elections - something\nfor which my Government had been calling since joining\nthis Organization 11 years ago. We have successfully and\nemphatically closed the final chapter of the brutal and\nunjust system of apartheid, and a new and democratic South\nAfrica has emerged from its ashes.\nHowever, despite the successes, the new South\nAfrica is still on the threshold of unprecedented\nchallenges. The journey is long and arduous, but the\ncountry\u2019s leaders and its people have a wonderful\nopportunity to right historical wrongs while at the same\ntime charting a new and purposeful course in their future.\nThe amalgamated voice of the people of South Africa has\nbeen heard, not only within that country but the world\nover. They have put their faith in the democratic process.\nAs South Africa sails the fresh and often tumultuous\nwaters of representative democracy and attempts to\ninstitutionalize social justice, St. Kitts and Nevis reiterates\nits commitment to join with the international community\nto give that country and its people the requisite support to\ndevelop lasting democratic and social institutions to\nensure that democracy does work and is seen to work for\nevery single citizen.\nThe contrasting realities of our world are quite real\nand apparent. Whenever we believe that we have solved\none major problem, another presents itself elsewhere.\nThis notwithstanding, we can all be pleased at the current\nmovement towards peace under way in the Middle East.\nNot long ago the prospect of peace in any form seemed\npractically impossible. However, today the peace process\nseems to be gaining a firm foothold in that region. The\ninternational community must be ready to give unreserved\nsupport to that process and afford it more durable\nmechanisms for success.\nMy Government welcomes the consolidation of\npeace and the efforts at cooperation between the\nGovernment of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization. No one could have predicted that so much\nwould have been possible, and in so short a time. The\nrapidly changing face of Middle East politics augurs well\nfor the overall peace process, quality of life and stability\nof the entire region. In this spirit, my delegation applauds\nthe joint Declaration officially ending the state of\nbelligerency between the State of Israel and the\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan. This historic event marks\nyet another bold and positive step on the road to ensuring\na lasting peace in the Middle East. My Government calls\nupon the countries in the Middle East to give peace a\npractical chance.\nAs prospects for peace continue to flourish in the\nMiddle East, the tranquillity of the Gulf region is once\nagain being threatened by an Iraqi troop build-up near the\nKuwait border. It is time for the people of Kuwait to feel\nsecure within their own borders. It is time for full\ncompliance by Iraq with Security Council resolutions\n2\n\n\npertaining to the aggression against Kuwait. It is time for\nKuwait nationals detained in Iraq to be returned to their\nhomeland. It is time for Iraq to pursue peaceful policies\nwith its neighbours. Once again the Government of\nSt. Kitts and Nevis urges the Government of Iraq to respect\nthe finalization of the demarcation of the boundary between\nKuwait and Iraq, which was accomplished by the Iraq-\nKuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission on\n20 May 1993, and to respect and abide by Security Council\nresolution 833 (1993), which guarantees the inviolability of\nthe boundary between the two States. It is the fervent hope\nof the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis that international\nsupport for this resolution will act as a deterrent, both now\nand in the future, against conflict between Kuwait and Iraq\nand will at the same time help enhance stability and\nsecurity in the region.\nThe constantly changing realities of the present world\nsituation call for Member Governments to harden traditional\nattitudes while making genuine attempts to search for\npragmatic solutions requiring different and unprecedented\napproaches and compromises. It was against this backdrop\nthat at the last session of the General Assembly my\nGovernment called upon the warring factions in the\nYugoslavian conflict to come to the negotiating table.\nWe note with great satisfaction that the leaders of\nCroatia and Bosnia and Herzergovina have managed to\narrive at a peaceful settlement of disputes. However, my\nGovernment abhors the wanton murder, \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\"\nand systematic persecution of innocent people which still\ncharacterize the brutal conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThese atrocities and the flagrant and consistent violation of\nhuman rights are an affront to everything we as human\nbeings hold sacred. The international community must\ncontinue to express its just indignation at the atrocities in\nthis arena of conflict. At the same time, we must pursue\nall initiatives to find a just and lasting solution, preferably\nat the negotiating table.\nLast year my delegation commended this body for its\ntireless efforts to keep the international community from the\nbrink of nuclear warfare and called upon all countries\nsignatories to the Treaty on non-proliferation to continue to\nabide by it and to urge those who had not yet become\nparties to it to do so. We repeat this plea today. We also\nlook forward to an indefinite ban on all nuclear testing.\nI must reiterate, however, that we should not stop\nthere, but should aim also for the non-proliferation of all\nweapons, including chemical, biological and conventional.\nIn this regard, St. Kitts and Nevis also supports the\nmoratorium on the export of land-mines, and goes even\nfurther by calling for a ban on their manufacture as well\nas their export. Land-mines continue to cause tremendous\nmisery and untold hardship for many populations world-\nwide long after conflicts have ended. In most cases the\nvictims of these land-mines are poor farmers and innocent\nchildren.\nIt is our sacred and solemn responsibility as world\nleaders to ensure a safe world for our nation\u2019s children.\nMy delegation therefore congratulates the United Nations\non its consistent efforts to fulfil its humanitarian missions\nin the many different theatres of tragic suffering\nworld-wide. The humanitarian catastrophe which has\nbeen unfolding in Rwanda threatens to destabilize the\nfragile economic and political balance of its neighbours.\nThe scope and scale of this human disaster,\nunprecedented in the history of modern-day Africa,\nshould catapult us to seek a peaceful end to the crisis.\nReports on the revolting policy of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and\nindiscriminate massacres of women and children strike a\nfamiliar, mind-wrenching note in our collective psyche.\nAlthough its resources are minuscule, St. Kitts and\nNevis could not fail to make a financial contribution to\nthe United Nations relief effort in Rwanda. We must act\ndecisively to mobilize more resources from every possible\nsource to intensify the relief effort in that tragic country.\nWe, the Members of the United Nations cannot\npamper our consciences with pious speeches on what the\nUnited Nations ought to do to alleviate the suffering,\nwhile at the same time rendering the Organization\nimpotent by refusing to give it the necessary financial and\nmaterial capabilities it so desperately needs to carry out\nits functions more effectively.\nThe United Nations is being called upon with greater\nfrequency to respond to a greater variety of conflicts,\nsuffering and development needs. If the Organization is\nto be able to respond effectively, we must evaluate from\ntime to time not only our resources, but the way in which\nwe manage those resources, and ensure that there is\ngreater accountability in such management. In short, the\nUnited Nations, recognizing the responsibilities entrusted\nto it by the international community, must be more\naccountable to its Members. What we are suggesting,\ntherefore, is a more balanced relationship predicated on\nthe principles of responsibility and accountability. The\ndelegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the creation\nof the Office of Internal Oversight Services; its creation\nis not an end in itself, but a means to ensure that there is\ngreater accountability within the Organization.\n3\n\n\nWe must remain cognizant of the fact that the\nfundamental sovereignty of all States, large or small, is\nrespected equally by the United Nations. If necessary, the\nUnited Nations will protect the rights of the small against\nthe power of the large. It has institutionalized the rights of\nsmall and micro States to exist and to coexist with the big\nand powerful nations. All independent States, therefore,\nirrespective of their size and population, are equal under\ninternational law. Every effort should be made, therefore,\nto enable small States to participate more fully in the day-\nto-day decision-making process of the United Nations. One\nway to achieve this is through more equitable geographical\nrepresentation within the Secretariat, and I appeal for this\nto be implemented.\nAnother way in which the United Nations can be made\nmore globally inclusive is by bringing more Members into\nthe fold. Last year, my Government called upon the United\nNations to begin the process that would lead to the ultimate\nre-admission of the Republic of China in Taiwan into the\nUnited Nations.\nMy Government stands firmly behind that appeal and\nwe repeat this appeal here today. The Republic of China\nin Taiwan continues to adhere to the Charter of the United\nNations and to govern itself by the principles of\ninternational and humanitarian law. It has proven\nrepeatedly that it is a country committed to peace,\ndemocracy and development, not only for its 21 million\npeople, who are entitled to proper representation\ninternationally, but for all peoples, that their quality of life\nmay be improved. The Republic of China in Taiwan is a\nmajor international player in commerce, trade and\ndevelopment assistance, and would make a significant\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations.\nI would now like to turn our attention to the question\nof sustainable development and small States, and to\ncommend quite highly the efforts of the United Nations in\nbringing the reality and concerns of small island developing\nStates to the forefront of international focus.\nThe Declaration of Barbados is a step in the right\ndirection. It recognizes that small island developing States\nhave special and peculiar needs. We, in small island\ndeveloping States have been saying this for a long time.\nOur very survival as a people and as independent States is\ndependent on the sustainable development of our human\nresources and the maximization of our scarce material\nresources. These limited material resources are under\nconstant and severe stress despite our efforts.\nAlthough we recognize the Conference in Barbados\nas a giant step for small island developing States, the\ndiscussion must be taken much further, beyond\nconference halls and into communities, and translated into\npractical tangible benefits. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, for\ninstance, over the past ten years we have been engaged in\nprojects and programmes whereby we seek to create a\nsound and pragmatic balance between economic and\nsocial development, on the one hand, and environmental\nprotection on the other.\nHowever, existing problems and innovative attempts\nby small island developing States to improve their\nstandard of living very rarely receive consistent support\nfrom the developed world. Micro States like Saint Kitts\nand Nevis are being called upon to prove their viability\nwithin the international community. The irony lies in the\nfact that when we manage to raise our standard of living\nto a decent level, the international community withdraws\nor reduces its support under the pretext that our GNP per\ncapita is too high.\nI do not believe that we should have to reiterate the\nvulnerability index of small States like mine. Although\nSaint Kitts and Nevis does not produce or use any\nsignificant amount of material to damage the ozone layer\nor contribute to coastal erosion and rising sea levels, we\nare among those which suffer most as a result of their\nimpact. Small island States like mine suffer greatly from\nenvironmental and natural disasters, yet we lack the\ncapacity to respond to and recover from them. The\nobjective reality of our individual and collective\nexperience speaks volumes. We have seen how less than\na month ago, tropical storm Debbie \u2014 insignificant,\nreally, as a tropical storm, not strong enough to be a\nhurricane \u2014 devastated the banana industry in Saint\nLucia, thus wreaking havoc on that country\u2019s economy.\nWe need special attention. We need special regimes.\nAs I have done in the past, I appeal for greater equity\nwithin the international economic system. The time has\ncome for the developed world to rethink the outdated\npolicy of trying to make a single prescription fit all\ncountries. We need to develop a more durable, and\ncountry-specific approach, based on fairness, economic\ncircumstance and need. Above all, the concept of the\nvulnerability index must become part of the economic\nlanguage and armamentarium of all multilateral and\nnational development institutions.\nIndeed, the developing world should not view our\nsmall island Caribbean States as dumping grounds for\n4\n\n\nover-produced consumer items, but see us as developing\neconomies whose fragile banana and sugar exports need to\nbe protected.\nThe Declaration of Barbados underscores the fact that\nsmall island States have sovereign rights over their natural\nresources. The developed world, therefore, cannot claim\npaternity over our biodiversity under the pretext that their\ntechnology was used.\nFurther, on the issue of the environment, I would like\nto call upon the developed countries to de-link economic\nassistance, trade and investment from environmental\nprotection. In most cases, small island developing States\nare penalized for allegedly exploiting limited resources and\nfor so-called environmental degradation.\nI urge the international community to assist developing\ncountries to obtain the wherewithal to gauge the\nexploitation of resources and to do environmental impact\nassessments so as to ensure that the precarious balance is\nmaintained.\nSocial, economic and political advancement in small\ndeveloping countries should not be held to ransom by the\nindustrialized world as a way of punishing them for\nenvironmental degradation. The protection and preservation\nof the environment is a global responsibility and must\nengender a collective approach. The industrialized world\nmust take responsibility for much of the damage to the\nenvironment and work towards a framework for\ninternational cooperation and partnership in preserving it.\nDeveloping countries ought to be given assistance and\nbe presented with alternatives to destroying the forest or\ndepleting the limited resources at their disposal. While the\ninternational community moves ever closer to the\nrealization of economic blocs, special attention must also be\ndevoted to the fragile commodities export sector in some of\nthese countries, and the need for special regimes to be put\nin place to ensure the viability of most of these small\neconomies, which do not have the advantage of economies\nof scale and large consumer markets.\nI should like to repeat my fervent appeal to\nGovernments of developed countries and to multilateral\nagencies to become more supportive of and responsive to\nthe needs of small developing countries by providing the\ntechnical assistance, information-sharing, technology\ntransfer and investments, and to promote human resource\ndevelopment through education and training.\nI call on the international community to honour its\ncommitment made in Barbados in May 1994:\n\u201cThe international community should cooperate\nwith small island developing States in the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action ... by\nproviding effective means, including adequate,\npredictable new and additional financial resources in\naccordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21;\nfacilitating the transfer of environmentally sound\ntechnology, including on concessional and\npreferential terms as mutually agreed\u201d.\n(A/CONF.167/9, Annex I, Part Two, III.1)\nThis will ensure success in achieving our goal of\nsustainable development.\nThere is nothing more noble than the gift of life. At\nthe important and historic World Summit for Children of\n1990, participating Governments agreed to make the\nworld a much safer place for future generations of\nchildren. At the United Nations Conference on small\nStates, we decided to commit our efforts to the efficient\nuse of land resources, to work towards creating better\neducation and improved health care, and to exploit natural\nresources on a sustainable basis.\nIf we achieve this, we shall indeed be bequeathing\nto our children and their children a much safer world. It\nis against the backdrop of safeguarding our children\u2019s\nfuture that the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis\nparticipated in the International Conference on Population\nand Development in Cairo. We fully support the view\nthat the issue of population control must be addressed.\nAlthough we share the view that a population\nexplosion may eventually threaten the Earth\u2019s capacity to\nprovide in a sustainable manner, we do not believe that\nsimply trying to control population growth will by itself\nsolve the serious problems that we are facing today. My\nGovernment is of the view that a concerted attempt to\nredeploy much of the world\u2019s resources, to discover new\nresources and to use them more equitably would better\nserve the interest of development for all peoples.\nI cannot but remind us all that the international\nmenace of drugs and drug trafficking still looms large.\nThe danger and the trade are ever-increasing. We should\ncontinue to wage a determined and aggressive war on\ndrug trafficking and narco-terrorism, which seek to\nundermine and unravel the social and political fabric of\nour societies.\n5\n\n\nThe challenges facing the United Nations are\nmonumental, but not more so than those facing individual\nnations, large or small, or individuals in poor communities,\nas well as in affluent societies. We occupy a global\ncommon. Therefore, we must together find practical\nsolutions to the problems of hunger, poverty, war, crime,\ndevelopment and freedom in every corner of our world. If\nwe fail, none will be secure, none will be at peace, none\nwill be free.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly. We are pleased that the representative of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire - a nation for which Israel has high regard - has\nbeen elected to this distinguished post. I should like to\nexpress to the Secretary General our deepest appreciation\n13\n\n\nfor his contribution to world peace in general, and to peace\nin the Middle East in particular.\nA year ago, I offered a concept for a new Middle\nEast. Many applauded; more remained sceptical. What at\nthat time seemed lofty is today a reality. I feel I can\nsubmit today an invitation to a further journey in the new\nMiddle East.\nLast year was a year of remarkable events. The\nPalestinian people, as a result of our agreement, gained\nauthority in Gaza and Jericho; Jordan and Israel agreed, in\nthe Washington Declaration, to end the state of war and\nmove towards an agreement of full peace; voices of\npromise are exchanged between Damascus and Jerusalem;\nmultilateral meetings produced a network of regional\ncooperation; Morocco and Israel established formal\nrelations; and an agenda for a new Middle East will emerge\nfrom an unprecedented economic conference in Casablanca\nnext month.\nThe desire for peace is rooted in the millenniums of\nJewish existence. Generations prayed for it, and now a\nyoung generation in Israel is today engaged in making it.\nThe search for peace is shared by young people all over the\nMiddle East, Arabs and Israelis alike. We have to fulfil\ntheir hope.\nI am addressing this Assembly for the first time, not\nas a party to a controversy, but as a representative of a\ncountry that has shown a capacity to solve conflicts that\nseemed insoluble.\nThe United Nations should play an increasing role\nfacing the changing times. It can define new destinies. It\ncan adopt new means.\nAs the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth\nanniversary, it may adopt models for new endeavours by\nmobilizing builders to construct peace, not just by\ndeploying troops to keep it. Economic structures will offer\nmore than military deployment.\nGaza, as an example, has a new authority. It needs a\nnew economy. The United Nations can provide an answer.\nThe 7,000 years of Gaza are mainly a history of suffering.\nIts population density today is among the highest in the\nworld.\nThere is a role for the United Nations in Gaza, and it\nhas played one. It began by stationing troops - which were\nrecalled, unfortunately, on the eve of the Six-Day War.\nThen UNRWA came and supplied food, health and\neducation to the refugees. Then UNDP contributed\ngreatly to the construction of an infrastructure in the Gaza\nStrip.\nThe United Nations can help Gaza today become\nfree from want. It can introduce there the necessary\neconomic and proper social institutions. An enlarged\nallocation for Gaza, with the existing United Nations\nadministration, will produce immediate results and may\nmake Gaza a new model of United Nations endeavours.\nThe world is moving from military might to social\npriorities. It is time to turn from political confrontation\nto economic cooperation. In the Middle East, economic\ngrowth can compensate for political compromises.\nWe no longer live in a closed world. The intensive\nflow of information has opened the eyes of many people.\nNo longer can tyranny blind their perceptions. Iron\ncurtains can no longer bar the spread of the true story.\nKnowledge has finally overcome propaganda.\nThis current is profound and lasting. The sources of\nstrength and wealth are today universal rather than\nnational, intellectual rather than material. The size of the\nterritory, the number of its people, the wealth of its raw\nmaterials, no longer decide the fate of a nation. It is the\nscope of education, the level of science, applied\ntechnology and up-to-date information that make all the\ndifference.\nIntellectual sources are no longer partitioned by\ntraditional divides. Science has no territorial limits.\nTechnology has no national flags. Information can travel\nwithout visas. Armies cannot conquer wisdom. Borders\ncannot protect knowledge. The talent of creation is\nreplacing the strategies of destruction. Computers, not\nrifles, mark the difference. The hunting season in history\nis disappearing.\n\nThis does not mean an end to agonies. Starvation,\ndisease, terrorism, desertification, nuclear weapons,\necological damage and dangerous drugs overflow the\nboundaries of land and the boundaries of reason.\nViolence employs new tactics: it has not\ndisappeared. Confrontations in the future may not\nnecessarily be wars of conquest, but bloodshed of protest.\n14\n\n\nThe strong know that they will not be strengthened by\ndominating the poor, or by owning their deserts. The poor\ncannot, and will not, comply with their conditions, tolerated\nby the indifference of the well-off.\nExisting institutions were initiated in a different time.\nThey are based today on memories rather than on needs.\nMinistries of foreign affairs and defence were structured to\nconfront enemies. Now we face dangers more than\nenemies, but without our being organized to handle them.\nWe are not answering the need. Diplomacy and strategy\nshould be mobilized to face the undefined dangers. Disease\nwill not be overcome by traditional diplomatic d\u00e9marches.\nStarvation cannot be eliminated by guns. Deserts will not\nbloom beneath air raids. Remedies will not arrive of their\nown accord: they should be invented and introduced.\nIsrael is on the side of this tendency. We are\ncommitted to ending the conflicts. We are determined to\nuproot their causes. We do not intend to stop this\nmomentum or allow its interruption.\nFor the last five decades the mere existence of Israel\nhas served as a temptation to try and destroy it. For half a\ncentury we had to give security top priority. To this very\nday, we shed tears on the tombs of our children, who paid\nwith their young lives to overcome the menace. When\nwars became futile, suspicion succeeded fighting. The\nallegation was that Israel was trying to expand territorially\nand was unwilling to compromise geographically. Reality\nended this allegation as well.\nEgypt, first to negotiate peace, found an Israel willing\nto exchange land for peace. The Palestinians, next in line,\ngained jurisdiction over territories they had never controlled\nbefore. With Jordan, we agreed to delineate a permanent\nborder without one side encroaching on the land of the\nother. Syria was told at the outset of negotiations that the\nnature of peace would affect the depth of the withdrawal.\nLebanon was told that Israel had no demands on its\nterritory and no intention of compromising its integrity.\nNegotiations have not been easy. With the\nPalestinians, we negotiated on uncharted ground. Never\nhad the Palestinian people experienced self-rule. Today\nthey possess a territorial address and an administrative\nauthority. For the first time in their history, their children\u2019s\neducation is solely in Palestinian hands. In the coming days\nIsrael will hand over additional responsibilities to the\nPalestinian Authority. The Declaration of Principles will be\nfully implemented in the spirit and letter. We shall support\na Palestinian readiness to hold democratic elections.\nIsrael, as well as the Palestinians, may discover that\nPalestinian democracy and Israeli security are\ncomplementary. We have demonstrated that we are true\nin our moral choice not to govern the destiny of another\npeople.\nWe shall continue to negotiate with Syria. We are\nnegotiating out of conviction, not weakness, and we hope\nto conclude the negotiations with a settlement that will\nrespect the interests of both sides, without harming Syrian\ndignity or compromising Israeli security. Syria insists on\na narrow path for the negotiations, postponing meetings\nbetween the leaders and thus slowing the pace of\nnegotiations. Israel is ready for accelerated negotiations.\nWe address the Syrians by saying: \\\"Let us talk face to\nface. Let us negotiate, as proclaimed in Damascus, with\ncourage to attain a peace of honour. By ending suspicion,\nintroducing creativity and allowing flexibility, we can\ntransform a promising climate into a solid terrain.\\\" Syria\ndeclared its strategy for peace. We appreciate it.\nMilitary threats and territorial positions should be\ntransformed by security arrangements, diplomatic rapport,\nfull peace and economic endeavours. That will erode the\nmotivation for conflict. Without peaceful relations,\nbalances of power are meaningless. The range of\nunderstanding can serve as the only answer to the range\nof ballistic missiles.\nPresident Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher\nare relentlessly pushing for peace. European, Russian and\nmany other leaders are genuinely supportive. Important\nMiddle Eastern leaders are actively engaged in the same\ndirection. Still, much depends on direct negotiations.\nYesterday\u2019s enemies, tomorrow\u2019s partners, should become\ntoday\u2019s interlocutors.\nA peace treaty between Israel and Syria may\nproduce a historic result greater than just an agreement\nbetween two countries. It may well become the crowning\nof a comprehensive peace. It may become an opportunity\nfor the leaders of the region - Kings, Presidents, Prime\nMinisters, supported by the most prominent leaders of our\ntime - to gather and announce the end of the conflict and\nto proclaim full peace throughout the region.\nPeace can hardly emerge from stinginess. By\ndefinition, it calls for generosity. Peace is more than a\nmere ceremony. It requires ongoing maintenance; it\nawaits a passionate cultivation of new relations. We hope\nthat our neighbours, from Saudi Arabia to Lebanon, from\nDjibouti to Algeria, will become constructive partners in\n15\n\n\nit. Dark clouds are still hanging over the horizon - the\nshadows of missed opportunities.\nWe have to build a coalition to prevent subversive\nturbulence from undermining legitimate Governments and\nharassing the stability needed for the inflow of investment.\nAll countries of the Middle East face a choice: to remain\npolitically divided and economically stagnant or to become\neconomically advanced and politically just.\nA high standard of living for the people - all people -\nis the best promise for stability in our midst. Israel is\nwilling to participate in achieving it. There are sceptics, we\nknow, who do not believe that the Middle East is ripe for\na common market similar to the European one. They forget\nthat Europe did not do it in one leap. It started with a\nCommunity of coal and steel. We can start with a\ncommunity of water and tourism.\nNor do they believe that the Middle East is ready for\na free trade zone like the one in North America. Yet the\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement emerged in a short\nwhile as a success by linking geographic proximity with\neconomic growth. Those sceptics claim that generations are\nneeded to cement a new market in the Middle East. Well,\nthey can see what in 10 short years happened to Asian\ncountries, which attained unpredicted prosperity. They\nachieved it by adopting a market economy.\nThe profile of a market economy is clear. It is made\nof comprehensive education, open borders, free movement,\nscience-based industries and competitive trade. A market\neconomy is a fabric woven from political silk and durable\nthreads of welfare. The time is ripe for its rendezvous with\nthe Middle East.\nAt the end of October, under the presidency of King\nHassan II, we shall take the first step to implement a\nregional design. We shall try to establish instruments for\ndevelopment: a regional bank, channels for private\ninvestment and a framework for regional planning. The\nwealth of the Middle East should be convinced to remain\nat home. Over the last decade it has invested the better\npart of its fortunes abroad. Homebound wealth will attract\nforeign investment as well.\nWe should cut the enormous expense - $70 billion\nannually - of the arms race. The savings can be directed to\ndevelopment. The arms race can be reduced only by\nregional consent. No single country will do it alone.\nTo transform the region and make it a stable and\nattractive place we need the emergence of the region as\na whole, committed to a new future. Nature, and not\nonly politics, calls for it. The waters, the winds, the\nenvironment call for regional responsibility and\ncooperation, for desalinization plants, energy stations,\nhighways, railways, runways, piers, telecommunication\nnetworks, high-tech industries, tourism infrastructure,\nbanking systems, computer terminals and ecological\nconsiderations - a landscape that will meet the future will\ncreate a state of prosperity, and it is a regional challenge.\nThe Middle East was the cradle of civilization and\nhas a capacity to contribute. It experienced golden ages,\neconomically and culturally. It should be our collective\nambition to make it happen again and to make it happen\nsoon. Today, shortages can be bridged rapidly.\nComputers can carry children not only from grade to\ngrade but from age to age. The software of knowledge\nwill better replace the hardware of weapons.\nI have served my country since its birth. I have\nlearned that complex problems call for unconventional\nsolutions. I feel that over the past year we have won a\nlicence to build a new Middle East, to make it part of the\nglobe in its new age, free of wars, free of enemies, free\nof terrorism; a Middle East which will be nuclear-free,\nmissile-free, hunger-free, discrimination-free, tyranny-free;\na constituency of peace, a domain of freedom, a land of\nprosperity. There is a morning awaiting us after a long\nnight, calling us to direct our energies and our aims and\nour prayers towards that great opportunity.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to\ncongratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his election to guide the\nwork of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.\nHis election to that important post is testimony to his\npersonal credentials and to the important role played by\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in international affairs. I am confident that\nhis wise guidance and leadership will enable this session of\nthe General Assembly to deal successfully with the very\nimportant issues on its agenda.\nI should also like to commend the work of his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of\nGuyana, who demonstrated outstanding diplomatic skills\nand dedication in so ably steering the work of the forty-\neighth session of the General Assembly to a successful\nconclusion.\nAllow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for his untiring\nefforts in promoting international peace and security and\njustice.\nThe winds of change that are currently sweeping\nacross the world give us, more then ever before, new\nhope in the promise of a better future, a future in which\nscarce resources will be utilized to feed the millions of\nhungry mouths and to provide basic health care, safe\ndrinking water and a basic level of education to the needy\nrather than be again spent to build military might and to\nthreaten the world with a new era of confrontation - a\nfuture which will provide a safe and clean environment in\nwhich human beings can live safely, in dignity, respect\nand hope.\nThe recently held World Conference on Human\nRights, the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\nand the forthcoming World Conference on Women and\nWorld Summit for Social Development are clear\ntestimony to that hope.\nThis was the dream of our founding fathers, and it\nis also ours. With the end of the cold war and on the eve\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, let us\nnot hesitate to rededicate ourselves once again, with more\nvigour and more commitment, to the fulfilment of this\ndream.\nThe United Nations must be able to evolve and\npromote a stronger and more comprehensive system for\npreventive diplomacy and peacemaking. Let us not allow\npotentially dangerous situations to escalate into situations\nthat leave the international community with no alternative\nbut to take painful and expensive measures to enforce\npeace. Most important, the Organization must play a\nrevitalized role as the principal broker and promoter of\npeace and justice in the world.\nMy delegation welcomes the present process of\nrestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations. We\nare hopeful that the process of reform will take into\nconsideration the concerns of all States to protect their\nsecurity and maintain their sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity.\nThe establishment of effective measures of internal\noversight of the United Nations system is one of the\nuseful steps taken by the General Assembly. Special\n14\n\n\nattention must be given to all the issues involved in the\nchoice and recruitment of personnel if we truly intend to\nimprove the efficiency of the Organization, and we must\nemphasize quality rather than quantity so that the United\nNations system may remain non-biased, less-politicized and\nvibrant.\nFor Maldives, the United Nations has always been and\nwill always be the best hope for warding off challenges to\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States. The\nCharter of the United Nations, which we remain firmly\nbound to honour, recognizes the inalienable right of every\nnation to exist within secure boundaries and of the people\nof every country to live in dignity and peace. It therefore\nfalls to the world Organization to be the unequivocal\nguarantor of security and protection for those countries that\nlack the physical means to provide their own or that might\nsimply be overrun by more powerful States.\nOnce again at this session the United Nations General\nAssembly will deliberate the agenda item on the protection\nand security of small States. My delegation hopes that\nimportant item will once again receive the same attention\nand support it was given at the forty-fourth and forty-sixth\nsessions.\nMy delegation draws inspiration from the unwavering\nand renewed resolve of the international community with\nregard to important security and political issues, which was\nsignificantly demonstrated in the Gulf crisis, among others.\nThe inherent vulnerability of small States was never more\nclearly demonstrated than it was in the case of the\ninternational intervention in Kuwait in 1990. Who, indeed,\ncould have imagined that a fully sovereign State Member\nof the United Nations, economically strong and with\npowerful friends, would find itself at risk of being wiped\noff the world political map - and if a country like Kuwait\ncan be forced into such a precarious position, where is the\nsecurity of far smaller and economically weaker States?\nThe recent instances in which the United Nations took\nfirm and decisive action certainly highlight the importance\nand effectiveness of the collective-security system\nenvisaged in the Charter. In addition, they brought home\nto the international community the fact that a rapid-response\nsystem needs to be constantly in place if international peace\nand security are to be maintained. The Security Council\nSummit Meeting in January 1992 reaffirmed that body\u2019s\ncommitment to collective security as a valid principle in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. My\ndelegation believes that this is the time to give urgent and\ndeeper consideration to the overall question of collective\nsecurity. This is easily said, but the subject includes the\nquestion of improving the skill and ability to exercise\nforesight and act with dispatch, as well as of building up\nthe capacity and capability to move with greater\ncoordination.\nTrue success in accomplishing this challenging task\nfacing the international community will require sincere\ncommitment and dedication. This can be achieved only\nif every Member of the Organization exercises the\npolitical will to settle all disputes peacefully, without\ndiscrimination, and to assist the United Nations to move\nforward in that direction. The recommendations set forth\nin the Secretary-General\u2019s report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\",\non preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking\nand post-conflict peace-building, can serve as an\nextremely effective tool to achieve this end.\nMy delegation sincerely feels that as we study\ntogether every possible means of strengthening the\nstructure of the United Nations to make it more effective\nand responsive to a changing world the security of small\nStates must be given its rightful place when priorities are\nreviewed and special consideration given the task of\npreserving international peace, security and stability.\nOne of the most encouraging events in world history\nhas been the classic manner in which the Republic of\nSouth Africa, under the leadership of President Nelson\nMandela, has not only eliminated the policy of apartheid,\nthat most inhuman form of racial discrimination, but also\nestablished democracy with full respect for all the norms\nof national reconciliation. It is therefore with sincere\nsentiments of congratulation and good wishes that my\ndelegation welcomes the restoration of the Republic of\nSouth Africa to its rightful place in the family of nations\nand this Organization.\nI view the positive developments in the Middle East\nas a most valuable lesson on how sincere, determined and\ndedicated efforts based on peace and conciliation can\nyield rich dividends in dangerously volatile situations.\nI sincerely feel that the international community\nowes a debt of gratitude to the Governments of the\nUnited States of America and other States concerned for\ntheir most valuable contributions to the creation of the\nnecessary atmosphere for the ongoing peace negotiations\nin the Middle East, in which I fervently hope and pray\nthe inalienable rights of the people of Palestine will be\nrestored. I am convinced that the present trend of events,\nif pursued with patience and in good faith by all the\n15\n\n\nparties involved, will result in the establishment of a\nsovereign, independent State of Palestine, the settlement of\nthe issues related to the occupied Territories and finally the\nattainment by that region of a comprehensive and lasting\npeace based on the principles of justice and equality.\nTime and again Maldives has stressed the importance\nof continuing accelerated efforts to attain the United\nNations goal of completing the disarmament process. My\ndelegation firmly believes that success in preserving and\nmaintaining international peace, security and stability will\ndepend on progress in the field of disarmament.\nAdmittedly, there have been significant achievements in this\narea. However, the production, stockpiling and sale of\nweapons of war continue on an alarming scale throughout\nthe world.\nAlthough there is a convergence of views regarding\nthe dangers of nuclear arms, some countries seem to desire\nto acquire or retain nuclear-weapons technology. We\nbelieve that so long as this trend continues unabated it will\nindeed be difficult to improve the climate of security and to\npave the way for a safer world for generations to come.\nOne of the key disarmament issues confronting the\ninternational community is the question of a decision on\nextending the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons. We remain convinced that its unconditional and\nindefinite extension should be one of the cornerstones for\nbuilding a world free of all nuclear weapons. But this\nrequires that all the countries possessing nuclear weapons\nand nuclear-weapons technology take a responsible stand,\nsomething that can come about only through a sincere\ndesire to establish a genuine international non-nuclear\nregime. In our opinion, the apparent reluctance of some\ncountries to comply with the International Atomic Energy\nAgency safeguards system is not encouraging. We\ntherefore urge all those countries to join the international\ncommunity in the persistent effort to establish a safer\nworld.\nMy delegation also supports the concept of the\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of\npeace throughout the world. We feel that the failure to\npromote this concept in all regions of the world is a clear\nindication of the doubt and suspicion that still prevail in the\ninternational community. Unless we can overcome these\nuncertainties the chances of achieving global disarmament\nwill indeed be bleak.\nAs we begin yet another session of discussions,\nconsultations and debates on ways and means of uniting our\nefforts and resources to make the world a safer place for\nmankind and to alleviate the terrible human suffering in\nmany countries, we should, I firmly believe, pause to\nassess the tremendous responsibility we carry. As\nrepresentatives of individual countries, we have to\nconsider our national interests; united, we have an\nunshakable commitment to giving undaunted and\nunwavering support to the process of making the United\nNations as effective as is humanly possible, to prevent the\nevolution of such tragic, dangerous and explosive\nsituations as those in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nThe question of Bosnia and Herzegovina has yet to\nbe resolved. We condemn the continuing violence and\ngenocide there, and call upon the international community\nto take more decisive steps to implement the Security\nCouncil\u2019s resolutions in order to discharge fully the\nresponsibilities entrusted to us by the Charter and restore\nthe sovereignty and independence of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Let us not tolerate in our time any act of\ngenocide based on ethnic hatred or prejudice.\nSimilarly, my delegation is deeply concerned about\nthe tragic situations continuing in Angola, Somalia and\nRwanda despite the fact that the United Nations is still\nproviding humanitarian assistance to alleviate the\nsuffering of their peoples. While commending the efforts\nof the international community to help these countries,\nwhich are being torn apart by civil strife, we feel that the\nassistance should not be limited to meeting humanitarian\nneeds, but should extend beyond that to restoring peace\nand stability in those countries, giving them another\nchance to rebuild their national economies.\nAs I observe the world economic situation I cannot\nbut feel considerable dismay at the fact that, despite the\nrecent conclusion of the seven-year Uruguay Round of\nnegotiations, the developing countries have not been\nprovided with much impetus to maintain economic growth\nin the face of the increasing gap between themselves and\nthe developed countries and of persistent protectionism in\ntrade.\nThe situation adversely affects the least-developed\ncountries most as they lack the resources to overcome the\nodds stacked against them. I feel that further\nintensification of South-South cooperation has become\nmore necessary, in order to harness their resources for\npurposes of assisting the less developed of the developing\ncountries and encouraging developmental efforts on the\nbasis of collective self-reliance. The United Nations and\n16\n\n\nthe international developmental and financial institutions\nshould encourage and support this process.\nAt the same time, the North-South dialogue must not\nbe allowed to be marginalized, since it is essential for the\ngrowth of a world economy on a firm foundation of\npartnership to promote common interests and benefits.\nWithout this basic element, the chances of promoting a\nstable world economy indeed seem bleak.\nAfter decades of protracted studies, research,\ndiscussions and debates, and then the resulting experience,\nwe are today in a position to appreciate fully that\ndevelopment is not simple. It can be achieved only through\na process that encompasses numerous attributes of human\nlife; education, health, the environment, peace, the\neconomy, society and culture and national and international\nbehaviour all contribute to its achievement.\nThe reviews and expert opinions gathered on the\nAgenda for Development, together with the recent sessions\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development, indicate\nthat intergovernmental cooperation involving the various\nagencies of the United Nations, regional organizations and\nnon-governmental organizations must contribute to laying\nthe groundwork for development. I do not foresee any easy\nor quick means of achieving development goals. While\nfurther detailed consideration is given to this multifaceted,\nall-important question, I should like to add my voice on the\nneed to bear in mind the great diversity in the levels of\nprogress that Member countries have been able to achieve,\nand the wide variation in the extent of resources that they\ncan invest in this venture, which is an inherent right of\nevery nation.\nAs the representative of a small island State, I pay\ntribute to all those responsible for the planning and\norganization of the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, which was\nheld in Barbados this year. I believe that appropriate\nrecognition has now been given to the special\nenvironmental and economic circumstances of small island\nStates in the context of achieving sustainable development.\nOne of the most important outcomes of this Conference\nwas a re-emphasis on the dire need of small island\ndeveloping States for the development of human resources.\nBut assessment of the need is only a prelude to the\nimplementation of any programme of action. What is\nrequired is sustained effort by the developing States and\ntechnical and other input by the developed countries and\ninternational organizations. In view of the Programme of\nAction and Declaration emanating from the Barbados\nConference, as well as Agenda 21, I need hardly\nemphasize the urgent need to stimulate positive responses\nby the international community with regard to assisting\nthe island developing States to improve the\nsocio-economic standards of their peoples in order to\nembark on plans for sustainable development.\nAt the same time, we are concerned at the speed at\nwhich international conferences are being held and\nambitious programmes of action being drawn up without\nsufficient resources to implement them. I make this\nstatement because of the experience we have had\nfollowing the United Nations Conference on Environment\nand Development in Rio in 1992. The expectations which\nfollowed that conference have started to recede because\nof insufficient resources available to implement the\nprogramme of action. One of the most outstanding\nresults of the Conference was the creation of greater\nawareness of the environmental problems that the\ninternational community faces. At the same time, it is\ntragic to note that greater awareness of the predicament\non the part of those countries most susceptible to\nenvironmental damage only helps to increase\napprehensions of disaster and frustration.\nAs an island developing country, Maldives\nappreciates the tremendous achievement of the\ninternational community in establishing the rule of law on\nthe vast stretches of the high seas, which cover two thirds\nof the surface of the Earth. The fact that it took 12 long\nyears after its adoption for the Convention on the Law of\nthe Sea to enter into force is indeed a development that\nwill be written in letters of gold in the annals of world\nhistory.\nThe question of human rights should occupy a\ncentral place in our minds when we deal with all issues\nof global concern. The establishment of the post of\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is\ncertainly a most welcome step. But this step can have\nmeaningful results only if the necessary resources are\nprovided for the High Commissioner to carry out his\nmandate fairly and objectively, without any further\nfinancial burdens on the membership of this Organization.\nI would also like to emphasize here that, while the\nUniversal Declaration of 1948 may be the universal guide\nfor future work in this area, we must not attempt to lay\ndown rigidly uniform standards of human conduct and\nbehaviour for all societies without due respect for and\nregard to the diverse cultures and religions prevailing in\n17\n\n\nthe world. For it is the full understanding of this diversity\nthat reinforces the fabric of what we call international\nrelations and the unity of the membership of this\nOrganization.\nThe United Nations is being burdened with more and\nmore onerous responsibilities not only for the preservation\nand maintenance of international peace, security and\nstability, but for also assisting mankind in the realization\nof the goals of a safer world and a higher standard of living\nfor the generations to come.\nI remain convinced that if this universal Organization\nis to be successful in meeting the numerous challenges\nbefore it, every one of its Members must extend unstinting\nfinancial, technological, military and manpower-resource\nsupport to the Organization.\nWe cannot afford to be complacent, nor can we\ncondone any attempts to deflect the work of the United\nNations to any path other than that of right, justice and\nequality, as enshrined in the Charter.\nFor my part, I can only reiterate the sincere\ncommitment of the Government of the Republic of\nMaldives to supporting the United Nations and the\nprinciples of the Charter to the best of our ability. Only by\nso doing is there any hope of avoiding disastrous\nconsequences. What is more, the Government of the\nRepublic of Maldives implicitly trusts the United Nations\nas the guarantor of its security and as its protector.\n\n"

        "file_text": "On this solemn occasion allow me first to\nconvey to you, Sir, on behalf of the Cambodian delegation,\nheartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency\nof the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. Your election is very important because it is a\ntribute not only to your diplomatic skills, to someone\nexperienced in international affairs, but also to the tireless\nwork done by C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, your glorious country, for\npeace.\nI am delighted to take this opportunity to convey to\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally,\nour satisfaction at the exemplary way in which he\npresided over the work of last year\u2019s session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe wish also to congratulate the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on the\nmany efforts he has constantly made for peace and\nsecurity throughout the world since he has been at the\nhead of the Organization. The Kingdom of Cambodia\nreiterates its firm support to the Secretary-General.\n(spoke in English)\nIt gives me particular pride to be here today as the\nrepresentative of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The Royal\nGovernment under the First Prime Minister, His Royal\nHighness Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and the Second\nPrime Minister, Samdech Hun Sen, was installed as the\nlegitimate Government of Cambodia a little more than a\nyear ago, on 24 September 1993, through the foresight,\ngenerosity and courage of the Members of the United\nNations and the bravery of the Cambodian people in\nchoosing, through United Nations-sponsored elections, a\nliberal democracy, building up national reconciliation\nunder the high guidance of His Majesty King Norodom\nSihanouk.\nI have come here today to represent the Cambodian\npeople in expressing our warmest gratitude to the\nMembers of the United Nations for their wonderful gift of\nfreedom. After 23 years of war Cambodia is now at\npeace and able to start to move towards development,\nsocial justice and prosperity. This has not been an easy\ntask because our financial base is still very low. As a\nmember of the group of least developed countries,\nCambodia remains one of the poorest countries in the\nworld and a large proportion of its people are saddled\nwith crushing poverty. But, again, the United Nations is\nat our side. The Bretton Woods institutions are helping\nus to re-establish a solid fiscal base and the specialized\nagencies have almost all moved in to assist development\nand strengthen our institutions.\nIn the economic field, there has been some progress\nover the past few years. According to the 1992 report,\nthe inflation rate was estimated to be 300 per cent, but in\n1993 it dropped to 70 per cent. This year our local\ncurrency is very stable: 1 dollar is equal to 2,500 riels.\nBilateral donors have also been generous, and as\nassistance moves from the area of emergency\n10\n\n\nrehabilitation to that of reconstruction, achievements are\nbeginning to be noted.\nHowever, the most important of the Royal\nGovernment\u2019s priorities for reconstruction and rural\ndevelopment have unfortunately lagged behind other kinds\nof development. The constraints of distance, an\ninfrastructure ruined by two decades of war and a\ncontinuing insurgency have hampered efforts, but in our\nsecond year of office, the Government, together with our\nfriends, will tackle those problems. Infrastructure can be\nrebuilt, and our king, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, is\nleading the move for reconciliation with the insurgents, the\nso-called Khmer Rouge group, who do not recognize the\nUnited Nations-sponsored elections and continue to\nchallenge the legally elected democratic government, and\nabove all have rejected the cease-fire that has been\nproposed through His Majesty\u2019s tireless efforts.\nPlease allow me to reiterate, on behalf of all the\npeople of Cambodia, our deep and lasting gratitude to all of\nthe States Members of the United Nations and to the\nindividual bilateral donors who have so generously\nsupported reconstruction in our country, both through the\nUnited Nations and its institutions, and through their\npledges at the first and second ministerial meetings of the\nIntergovernmental Committees on the Reconstruction of\nCambodia (ICORC), held in Paris and Tokyo respectively.\nWith the assistance of the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) we have now developed our first\ncountry programme, which will be presented to the\nExecutive Board of UNDP on 6 October 1994.\nThe UNDP is also assisting us to reform the civil\nadministration within Cambodia.\nMany other specialized agencies of the United Nations\nare also doing excellent work within the country: the United\nNations Population Fund, the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund, the International Labour Organization, the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\nNations and the World Food Programme, to name a few.\nCambodia has itself been through the holocaust of\ntyranny, invasion and internal disturbances. Our National\nAssembly is now in the process of restoring Cambodia as\na judicial State where human rights, political pluralism,\nliberal democracy and, above all, freedom of expression are\nrespected, as envisaged in our Constitution. To this end,\nwe have been grateful for the support and encouragement\nof the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations, whose close cooperation with the\nCambodian Government has helped us in our task of re-\nestablishing law and confidence in the country.\nCambodia is the only country in the region to have\nasked the Secretary-General of the United Nations to\ndispatch a special representative for human rights. In\ncomparison with the twenty years of war and\ntotalitarianism under the previous regimes, progress has\nbeen made. We also appreciate the early visit of the\nnewly appointed United Nations Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, the Honorable Jos\u00e9 Ayala Lasso.\nBecause of our own terrible experiences, Cambodia\nfeels to the depths of its soul for the plight of the\nordinary people in Rwanda. We congratulate the\ninternational community for its intervention in Rwanda\nand we are pleased to see that the situation is now\nstabilized. In particular, we wish to applaud and\ncommend the French for the rapid action they took to\nhelp put an end to the killing and suffering of the\nRwandese people.\nOn the same basis, Cambodia wishes to call on the\nrival factions in the former Yugoslavia to stop their\nfighting and cooperate with the United Nations.\nCambodia is, of course, well acquainted with the Special\nRepresentative of the United Nations Secretary-General in\nthe former Yugoslavia, His Excellency Mr. Yasushi\nAkashi, and is full of admiration for, and confidence in,\nhis efforts to restore peace and security to the people of\nthat troubled region.\nAgain, from the Cambodian experience of using\ndemocratic elections as a catalyst for peace, we wish to\ncongratulate the people of South Africa and the new\ndemocratic government led by President Nelson Mandela,\non their move towards a normalization of the lives of the\npeople and on the return of South Africa to the world\u2019s\nembrace.\nCambodia fully supports the Geneva Declaration of\n12 August 1994 between the United States of America\nand the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and\nhopes that the Declaration will be fully and sincerely\nimplemented. Cambodia strongly supports the earnest\ndesires of the Korean people who, in the not-too-distant\nfuture, will bring their beloved country towards full\nreunification.\nCambodia welcomed the just initiative taken by the\ninternational community on the question of Haiti to avoid\n11\n\n\nbloodshed and to oversee the smooth transition to a\ndemocratically elected government. Cambodia calls on the\npeople of Haiti to work towards the national reconciliation\nand development of their country under the democratically\nelected president, Jean Bertrand Aristide.\nWe pray for an end to the senseless killing in\nAfghanistan, so that the Afghan people may be able to\nresume their normal lives and rebuild and develop their\nwar-torn nation.\nWe are pleased to see the political outcome in\nNorthern Ireland and hope that peace and happiness will\nsoon return to that beautiful land.\nThe situation in the Middle East has brought us great\njoy. The peace agreement between Israel and the\nPalestinian people is the most encouraging historical event\nof our time.\nThe recent accord between Israel and Jordan is\ndefinitely the right step towards peace, security and stability\nin that region. We encourage others to follow the example\nof this discussion for a peaceful world.\nCambodia is situated in south-east Asia, in the Asia-\nPacific region. As we have moved towards development\nand prosperity for the Kingdom we have welcomed the\nfriendship of the member countries of the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which invited\nCambodia to be a special guest for the second time at the\ntwenty-seventh annual ministerial meeting held in Bangkok\nin July 1994. At an appropriate time, Cambodia looks\nforward with great enthusiasm to full membership in\nASEAN. We will be delighted to see all 10 countries of\nour subregion one day join in the great ASEAN family.\nThis will be a positive development for harmony and\nsecurity in our part of the world. ASEAN has done a great\ndeal for Cambodia during our difficult years, and for this\nwe are eternally grateful to all of its six distinguished\nmembers: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,\nSingapore and Thailand. Cambodia also welcomes the\npositive developments around the continuing growth of the\nAsia Pacific Economic Community. To use the economic\nachievements of the most prosperous of the nations of our\nwider region as a springboard for further growth, peace and\nstability is something that Cambodia highly values.\n(spoke in French)\nIn addition to the constant efforts made by the\nCambodian authorities to rebuild our country after the\ndisastrous 20 years of war, Cambodia also aspires to\nrejoin the international community as a State of law.\nThe policy of neutrality and peaceful coexistence\nadvocated by His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk since\nthe period of Sangkum Reastr Niyum - People\u2019s Socialist\nCommunity - which lasted from the 1950s to the 1970s,\nremains the key to our foreign policy in order to promote\npeace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.\nCambodia is committed to development and peace\nfor the well-being of our people, and we heartily welcome\nthe important appeal by Mr. Clinton, President of the\nUnited States, for the elimination of anti-personnel land-\nmines throughout the world, as the sine qua non for\ndevelopment and lasting peace. Our people bear the scars\nof these deadly practices, and a sincere commitment from\nthe international community would save the lives of\ninnocent men, women and children throughout the world.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank sincerely\nall donor countries for their generous contributions to the\nCambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC).\nThe globalization of national socio-cultural policies\ncan be harmonious only if there is close and sincere\ncooperation between the industrialized countries and the\ndeveloping countries. Hence, we wish to pay tribute to\nthe international community for its support for the\nInternational Committee to Save the Temples of Angkor\nWat, in particular, the valuable work done by UNESCO\nand the \u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019extr\u00e8me orient. The temples\nof Angkor Wat, one of the seven wonders of the world,\nhave been designated the common heritage of mankind.\nCambodia is also concerned about environmental\nissues, and will be signing the Agreement to Combat\nDesertification in Paris.\nCambodia welcomes the convening of the World\nSummit for Social Development, to be held in\nCopenhagen, and the World Conference on Women, to be\nheld in Beijing next year. We give particular attention to\nthe development of our human sources, because of its\nimplications for the process of social stabilization.\nCambodia will actively participate in the work of these\nsummits.\n12\n\n\nCambodia welcomes the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations and has already set up a\nnational committee to participate in various events to be\nheld next year.\nBefore concluding, I wish to voice sincere gratitude to\nthe United Nations for the deployment of peace-keeping\nforces, and Cambodia takes this opportunity to inform the\ninternational community that it will make available its small\npeace-keeping forces at the request of this Organization.\nIn conclusion, Cambodia remains convinced that\nMember States will respond to emergencies and will meet\ntheir obligations. Cambodia is solemnly committed to\ncomplying with the United Nations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me join other representatives who have spoken before in congratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Your election to this high office is a demonstration both of the confidence that Member States have in you and of the respect they have for your beautiful country, Cote d'Ivoire. We are confident that under your wise guidance our deliberations at this session will achieve the desired results.\nI also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, Ambassador Insanally of Guyana, for steering the forty- eighth session to a successful conclusion. During his presidency, Ambassador Insanally undertook several initiatives aimed at strengthening the General Assembly and improving its relationship with the other organs of the United Nations. We thank him for his dynamic and imaginative leadership.\nMay I also extend our congratulations to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, on the untiring and visionary manner in which he is managing the affairs of the Organization.\nThe peace dividend expected after the end of the cold war, four years ago, is yet to be realized. On the contrary, the world has been faced with the escalation of new conflicts and in some cases the intensification of old conflicts. The disappearance of the great ideological rivalry between the East and the West has enabled the United Nations more constructively to play its central role of facilitating conflict resolution and maintaining international peace and security. The emerging international situation has however brought with it new challenges to which the international community should respond in a dynamic manner and within the framework of the United Nations Charter.\nKenya supports the ongoing efforts aimed at reforming the United Nations with a view to adapting to the new challenges, and hopes that these efforts will be intensified during this session of the General Assembly. We welcome progress already made in the reform of the economic and social sectors of the Organization as well as the revitalization of the working of the General Assembly. However, more needs to be done, particularly in the context of the new Agenda for Development. Furthermore, a great deal still remains to be done in reforming the Security Council to enhance its effectiveness, its transparency and its relationship with the General Assembly as well as Member States. The open-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council has been able to highlight, substantially, areas where the Security Council needs to be reformed. It is our hope that the Working Group will reach a consensus on this vital exercise before the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\nThe role of the Security Council has become critical in the new era. Kenya is cognizant, and appreciative, of the special responsibilities entrusted to the five permanent members of the Security Council. However, the circumstances which led to the creation of the present membership structure have changed. It is therefore crucial that the membership of the Council reflect these changes and incorporate regional interests for a more balanced distribution of seats.\nThe United Nations is currently involved in an unprecedented number of peace-keeping operations. This clearly underlines the growing confidence of the international community in the role of the United Nations. During the forty-seventh session, the Assembly adopted the Agenda for Peace, which emphasized preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. The most rewarding parts of this three-pronged strategy are the first two - namely, preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. This is especially true, when we consider that mobilization for peace-keeping is usually very slow. We are therefore convinced that the United Nations should invest more in preventive diplomacy and development to avoid the human catastrophes we have witnessed recently in many parts of the world, particularly Africa.\nWe happily welcome the victory of democracy in South Africa and the dismantling of apartheid. Kenya heartily congratulates President Nelson Mandela, his Government and the people of South Africa on the peaceful transition to a new democratic and multiracial South Africa. We are also delighted with the peaceful resolution of the territorial dispute between Chad and Libya. The positive developments in Mozambique and Burundi towards peaceful resolution of long-standing conflicts are indeed commendable. A comprehensive settlement of the Middle East conflict is now on a steady course with the ongoing implementation of the accord between Israel and Palestine and the recently concluded peace agreement between Jordan and Israel. We congratulate all the parties and encourage them to widen and intensify the peace processes.\nInternational peace and security can flourish only if peace and stability exist in individual countries. The fundamental responsibility of ensuring peace and stability lies with the individual countries themselves. The Charter of the United Nations clearly underscores that responsibility under the principles of sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States.\nWith the recent resurgence of problems based on ethnicity and of nationalism, sustained effort is required at the national level to forge national consensus. All nations have to build their democracies on the basis of their national circumstances, experiences, traditions and aspirations, but within the context of the universal values and norms of democracy, good governance and human rights.\nThe international community also has an important role to play in the support of national efforts towards the strengthening of democratic processes, sustainable development, peace and security. Very often, international conflicts are fanned by the struggle for the sharing of scant resources and public offices in the absence of a wide economic base to absorb competing interests. Development needs, therefore, have to be addressed from a wider perspective. The international community's support for institutional capacity-building and human resources development is pivotal to sustainable development, peace and security.\nOver the last year, the international community has witnessed the intensification of some perennial conflicts. The experiences of Rwanda, Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sudan and Liberia clearly demonstrate that there is no substitute for a political settlement negotiated between the parties to the conflicts. At the same time, the international community, particularly the United Nations, should be tireless in its efforts to assist parties to reach lasting solutions to these conflicts.\nIn this connection, regional bodies need to be strengthened, as their role in supporting development and facilitating solutions to national conflicts cannot be overstressed. The escalation of conflicts in one country has left neighbouring countries flooded with refugees and other spill-over effects, including the spread of banditry and illegal arms. Accordingly, we welcome the draft declaration on the strengthening of the cooperation between the United Nations and the regional organizations, and arrangements in the maintenance of international peace and security. Adoption of that declaration at this session of the General Assembly will be an important milestone towards strengthening the role of the regional bodies in the maintenance of international peace and security under the overall responsibility of the Security Council.\nThe magnitude of the Rwandese human disaster calls for extraordinary efforts in the mobilization of the United Nations system and the international community to stop the suffering of the Rwandese people and to restore normalcy to that unfortunate country. The decision to scale down the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda at that critical time contributed to the vacuum that resulted in the estimated loss of 1 million lives, with about 4 million people being internally displaced or fleeing as refugees. The experience of Rwanda calls for fundamental changes to United Nations peace-keeping operations to ensure an adequate, timely and effective response.\nWe take this opportunity to commend the neighbouring countries for accommodating so many refugees and offering logistical support for humanitarian operations. We also commend the countries, international organizations and non-governmental organizations that have been extending critical humanitarian support. We are encouraged by the assurance of the new Government that it will foster the reconciliation of the Rwandese people. This calls for the intensification of international effort aimed at restoring normalcy in Rwanda. Kenya, for its part, has continued to play a facilitating role in the supply of humanitarian assistance to Rwanda.\nOn Somalia, we strongly believe that the continued presence of United Nations peace-keeping personnel is critical in the pursuit of peace and security in the country if we are to avoid the deterioration of a situation that is already unacceptable. We note with concern the Secretary-General's report on the growing incidence of violence and attacks on United Nations soldiers as well as the inability of the Somali faction leaders to agree on a formula for the creation of an interim central authority. While we commend the efforts of the international community in the search for a settlement to the Somali conflict, we are greatly concerned about the failure of the faction leaders to utilize the opportunities afforded by the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) and the Organization of African Unity, as well as the neighbouring countries, to bring an end to the conflict.\nSomalia is a sister country with which we share an 800-kilometre border, family relations, and ethnic and cultural affinities. The very heavy influx of Somali refugees into Kenya has had a devastating effect on the most ecologically fragile parts of the country. The refugee burden on my country is still excessively high, with about 300,000 registered refugees. Kenya is cooperating closely with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in accelerating the resettlement and voluntary repatriation of refugees. Physical and social infrastructures have also been overextended due to excessive usage.\nThe national efforts aimed at mitigating the negative effects caused by the influx of refugees in the border region are constrained by the magnitude of the problem and the competing security, administrative and development commitments in the area. In this regard, while appreciating various forms of assistance from the international donor community, including the non-governmental organizations, to address the problem, Kenya further appeals to the United Nations and the donor community to assist in the financing of the rehabilitation of the physical and social infrastructure as well as the restoration of the region's ecosystem.\nThe border region security dimension is another issue of great concern to Kenya. Our people and our security personnel have been subjected to numerous acts of banditry by armed gangs crossing into Kenya from Somalia. For this reason, we are reiterating our request to the Secretary-General to reinforce the UNOSOM patrols along the Somalia side of the border so as to complement the efforts of Kenyan security personnel on our side of the border. We believe that the joint security efforts will significantly scale down the flow of armed gangs and individuals into the Kenyan side.\nThe problem in the Sudan has been of great concern not only to Kenya and the neighbouring countries, but also to the international community. After four rounds of negotiations in the past year, it has become apparent that the regional peace efforts spearheaded by Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Isaias Afewerki of Eritrea and Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, under the chairmanship of President Daniel T. Arap Moi of Kenya, within the framework of Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGAD), have so far not been able to bridge the differences between the parties to the conflict. We appeal to all parties involved in the conflict to be flexible in the search for a just and lasting solution. The international community has an important role to play not only in terms of humanitarian assistance but also in facilitating the settlement of the fundamental differences between the parties. In this regard, Kenya is very grateful to the Governments of Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the many others that have generously provided material and financial assistance to the process.\nOn Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are greatly concerned that despite many serious attempts at a negotiated settlement no solution is in sight. Kenya strongly appeals to the combatants to opt for a negotiated settlement for the sake of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nKenya is substantially involved in United Nations peace-keeping activities, having contributed military and civilian police personnel to various peace-keeping operations world wide. The enormous rise in the number and scope of peace-keeping operations demands that the ability of the United Nations Secretariat to cope with such large-scale operations be strengthened.\nWhile peace-keeping will continue to be a vital responsibility of the United Nations, the adequate financing of these operations, which now represents a substantial portion of the United Nations budget, is critical to their success. In this regard, we urge Member States to pay their assessed contributions in full and on time in order to enable the Organization to respond effectively to the enormous challenges posed by peace-keeping operations.\nThe budgetary system for the peace-keeping operations also requires improvement. Notwithstanding the fact that peace-keeping operations are temporary by nature, it is cumbersome to approve budgets for periods of one to three months and usually retroactively. The current practice of piecemeal budgets compounds United Nations cash-flow problems, leading to the stifling of the operations of the Organization. Consequently, troop-contributing countries continue to subsidize United Nations peace-keeping operations at great sacrifice, a situation which cannot be sustained, especially by developing countries.\nMy delegation is also concerned over the growing number of fatalities and injuries among United Nations peace-keeping soldiers and other personnel deployed by the Organization. In this regard, the ongoing efforts to elaborate a convention on responsibility for attacks on such personnel and measures to ensure that the culprits are brought to justice is a positive response by the international community to this problem.\nThe world's economy continues to reflect sharp contrasts between countries and regions, with the industrialized countries, China and the South-East Asia region showing slight to rapid economic growth rates. The situation in Africa, on the other hand, is still of great concern, as the region's economy continues to show no signs of tangible recovery. The continent remains highly vulnerable to adverse international economic policies as well as to natural calamities, such as drought and epidemics, owing to its limited capacity to develop institutions and systems to cushion populations from these types of calamities. This situation has been compounded by the persistent recurrence of drought, debt burden, a decline in financial flows, low commodity prices, and the implementation of painful but necessary economic reforms and the uncertainties associated with major political reforms.\nMy country and many other African countries have in the past few years undertaken fundamental reforms to create, among other things, an environment conducive to encouraging investment flows as a necessary ingredient for economic growth and development. This underscores the determination of the African countries to speed up the recovery and growth of the economies. However, the sustainability of these efforts requires increased international assistance to facilitate an early realization of the objectives of the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa. We hope that at this time, when many developing countries are implementing major structural reforms and the liberalization of trade policies, the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the setting-up of the World Trade Organization will lead to the elimination of all trade barriers and the expansion of international trade.\nThe mounting debt burden of the African countries, especially those of sub-Saharan Africa, continues to be a major constraint to economic growth and development. The problem of debt in Africa is worsened by the persistent low economic growth rates of the continent's economies. It is evident that the various measures taken by the international community on bilateral and multilateral bases to mitigate the situation, though welcome, have achieved limited results. Kenya believes that a lasting solution to the debt burden is a bold initiative for an effective reduction or cancellation of the bilateral and multilateral debt of the low-income countries, particularly in Africa.\nThe \\\"Agenda for Development\\\", as an instrument for the promotion of an action-oriented approach to economic growth and development parallel to the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" as presented by the Secretary-General, should be given paramount attention by this Assembly. The essence of it should be the recognition that development is a fundamental human right and that peace and development are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Kenya affirms, however, that the State continues to bear the primary responsibility for its development while recognizing the importance of the complementary role of the international community.\nKenya subscribes fully to the view that the new Agenda for Development should be people-centred. While recognizing the importance of overall economic development needs, action programmes must give appropriate priority to the education, training, health and welfare of the people. The Agenda should take into account the fundamental role of science and technology in socio-economic development, particularly for developing countries. Indeed, the new Agenda for Development should become an instrument for promoting a new consensus on international cooperation for development, rather than a process of negotiations for financial needs.\nKenya welcomes the finalization of the elaboration of an international convention to combat desertification. The degradation of fragile dry lands is increasing at an accelerated rate and claiming millions of hectares every year. The afflicted countries are fully aware of their responsibilities to fight this imminent threat, but their efforts will not bear fruit without the support of the international community. The mobilization of resources as called for in Agenda 21 remains critical. Commitments of new and additional financial resources to fund environmental projects, as agreed upon in Rio, should be honoured. My delegation welcomes the recent restructuring and replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility as a positive step towards the fulfilment of some of the Rio commitments.\nMy delegation welcomes the establishment of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, headed by an Under-Secretary-General. We hope that the establishment of this Office will lead to greater efficiency and the reduction of waste and mismanagement, which the international community can ill afford. We also hope that the United Nations will now foster greater transparency in the awarding of United Nations contracts and in the procurement of goods and services, taking into account the cost-effectiveness of obtaining such goods and services from sources closer to the recipient countries.\nAs a country that is host to one of the United Nations centres, Kenya wishes to reiterate its commitment to cooperating with the United Nations in its efforts to strengthen the United Nations Centre in Nairobi, the capacity of which remains underutilized despite its enormous potential. In this connection, Kenya urges that the permanent secretariats of environmentally-related conventions, including those on biodiversity, climate change and desertification, be located in Nairobi, taking into full account the need for utilization of the capacity of the new secretariats and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as well as the human-settlement secretariats based in the United Nations Centre in Nairobi. Indeed, this would be consistent with the wish of the General Assembly and the governing bodies of the two organizations concerned, which have called for the strengthening, harmonization, cost-effectiveness and enhancement of the efficiency of UNEP and other United Nations programmes.\nThe recently concluded International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo clearly underlines the resolve of the international community to coordinate actions and strategies on social development as envisaged in the United Nations Charter. The resolve of the international community to deal with the problems of population and development in accordance with the Cairo Programme of\nAction, which was adopted by consensus, gives us a strong basis for tackling population problems.\nKenya associates itself with the preparations and anticipated positive results of the forthcoming World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen. We hope that the Summit will come up with programmes and commitments which will effectively address the problems of poverty and social integration and lead to sustainable economic growth and broad-based social development. We are of the view that national action and international cooperation should give priority to the eradication of poverty, the elimination of obstacles to economic and social development, the expansion of productive employment, and the creation of a favourable international economic and social environment.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing, China, in 1995 offers a suitable opportunity to build on the successes of the 1985 Nairobi Forward- looking Strategies and to solidify the gains of women in all spheres of life. All necessary steps at the national, - regional and international levels should be taken to develop a political, economic, social and cultural environment conducive to the full integration of women into sustainable processes of development.\nKenya also looks forward to the successful outcome of the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II) to be held in Istanbul, Turkey, in 1996. In order to ensure broad-based national preparations for the Conference, the national Steering Committee has prepared a work programme incorporating the mobilization of action in the shelter sector so as to create public awareness. My delegation acknowledges the significant progress made in the preparatory process by the HABITAT II secretariat in Nairobi, under the direction of the Secretary-General of the Conference, Mr. Wally N'Dow. However, financial limitations are hampering elements of the preparatory process. We hope that these constraints will soon be overcome.\nAny durable international system must have a sound legal regime, backed by principles of respect for and compliance with the rule of law at domestic and international levels. The recognition by States of their obligation to abide by these principles is not only an indispensable requirement, but also forms the fabric of international norms and standards which guide lawful international behaviour.\nIt is in this context, therefore, that we hail the decision to hold an International Congress on International Law in March 1995 here in New York, under the framework of the United Nations Decade of International Law.\nIn 1989, Kenya joined the growing number of nations that have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A few weeks from today, on 16 November 1994, the world community will witness the entry into force of this Convention. This long-awaited event, which marks the culmination of a process started many years ago, is a significant milestone in the human endeavour to create a new legal order for the oceans.\nAfrican States do not possess the requisite scientific knowledge, technological capacity and management skills to be able to explore and exploit the marine living and non-living resources. The Convention, as well as Agenda 21, both of which furnish the basic blueprint for cooperation in marine and ocean areas, have laid emphasis on the significance of the development of manpower, technological capacity and training, particularly in the developing countries. We believe that these and other allied problems should be addressed to enable African countries to derive benefits from the rights and opportunities offered by the Convention. It is our hope that, following the successful conclusion and adoption of the agreement on the implementation of deep seabed mining, all States will now become parties to the Convention, in order to secure universal participation.\nIn conclusion, we feel confident that, as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, the international community has the requisite resources and talents to deal effectively with the global concerns and challenges facing it. In particular, the Organization will have to address the crucial issues of maintenance of international peace and security, sustainable development, the environment, humanitarian issues and reform of the United Nations. In conformity with the aspirations of the Charter expressed in the words \\\"We the peoples\\\", everybody throughout the world has high expectations of this Organization. We cannot and must not let them down\n"

        "file_text": " It is a pleasure for me to speak for the first time in the General Assembly and to convey to its members the warm greetings of the people and the Government of the Republic of Guinea.\nI should like to take this opportunity to convey to you. Sir, heartfelt congratulations on your notable election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty- ninth session. It is an honor to your country, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and to us the citizens of Guinea it is a fitting reflection of the trust that the international community places in the continent of Africa. I am convinced that your wisdom and your qualities as an experienced and competent diplomat will ensure the success of our work. My delegation assures you of its full support.\nI should also like to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who conducted the business of the forty-eighth session in such a masterly and intelligent manner.\nI want also to pay well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the tireless efforts he has made and the determination he has shown since his election to achieve the noble objectives assigned to the United Nations. His devotion to peace and the promotion of international cooperation at a time marked by many complex changes guarantees the Organization's victory over the challenges facing humanity.\nMy Government welcomes South Africa's long- awaited return to this Organization following the dismantling of apartheid and the holding of the first multiracial, pluralist elections.\nThe forty-ninth session is being held at a time that is very favorable for the strengthening of international \nrelations, thanks to more constructive dialog. However, a quick look at the international scene shows that we are still far from the ideal of peace. Indeed, as soon as the bells of peace announced the end of the cold war the evil spirits were awakened. Here and there warlords are stirring up tension, bringing tragedy to innocent victims - in particular, the elderly, women and children.\nIn Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Bosnia, Afghanistan and Angola - to refer to just some countries - killing, rape and destruction are going on. We are all concerned, yet we all seem to be powerless.\nIt is regrettable that most of this tragedy is being played out in Africa, a continent already sorely tried by economic crises, natural disasters and forced migration. My delegation believes that the international community as a whole, and this Organization in particular, should act with greater firmness and unity to put an end to this tragic situation.\nFor five years now, fratricidal conflicts have plunged Liberia into chaos and desolation. This conflict's damaging consequences for neighboring States have become unbearable. Despite the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States, the Organization of African Unity and the international community to secure the effective implementation of the many peace plans, the latest of which is the Akosombo, Ghana, plan, the crisis continues. My Government makes an urgent appeal to the international community to become more energetically involved in the quest for a final solution to this conflict.\nOther regions of the world too are experiencing the same difficulties that threaten international peace and security. The Government of Guinea encourages the United Nations to continue its efforts to restore peace, and urges the parties to various conflicts to demonstrate wisdom by choosing dialog.\nI am thinking in particular of the situations in the Middle East and on the Korean peninsula. Once again, only a proper political approach, taking account of the specific values of the parties concerned and of the political and material needs of the populations, will produce the conditions for lasting peace.\nI welcome the positive developments in the Middle East, exemplified by the peace agreement signed in Washington between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and also that signed between Israel and Jordan. These agreements constitute in many respects\nimportant milestones in the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, and they offer hope for a lasting and comprehensive peace in that region.\nBy the same token, the Government of Guinea encourages the two Korean States to continue their effort for the independent and peaceful reunification of their common homeland. I have every hope that the negotiations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States will lead the two parties to continue the dialog to bring about a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula and to improve relations between the two countries.\nThe tragic events that have shaken the political life of Haiti for three years now have captured the attention of the international community. My Government hopes that the efforts of the international community will make it possible to put an end to that crisis and to alleviate the suffering of the people of Haiti through the restoration of democracy.\nThe remarkable progress made through the bilateral and multilateral negotiations in the field of disarmament and arms control clearly underscores the determination of Member States to shield our planet from the specter of destruction. However, many perils still hamper our efforts to bring about collective security, which would encompass the related problems of development, environment and human rights. In certain sensitive regions, the trade in conventional weapons and their frequent use in conflicts, along with the trade in nuclear materials and the desire of some countries to possess nuclear weapons, add to our Organization's responsibilities and call for stringent verification measures. Objectives in this field should include a nuclear test ban and the promotion of the establishment of denuclearized or nuclear-free zones in all parts of the world.\nIn this brief overview of some of the major issues in the world, I wish to stress the importance of peacekeeping operations. I consider it useful to rethink the problems of such operations, whose motives and procedures for implementation seem very often to involve double standards. We believe that in order to give them the desired legitimacy and effectiveness these operations should be the subject of coordination and dialog in which all United Nations Member States take part, for collective security is the business of all nations of the world, be they large or small.\n\nAfrica's keen interest in the quest for ways and means to guarantee peace, security and stability on our continent is reflected in the mechanism for the prevention, settlement and management of conflicts established by the Organization of African Unity. This instrument is already functioning; it deals with all forms of crisis that might jeopardize African peoples' efforts at economic, social and cultural development. A peace fund has been set up to give financial support to the actions undertaken by this mechanism.\nWhile appreciating the efforts of the United Nations in the economic and social fields, we note with regret the absence of any significant results in the implementation of the measures adopted. Today we are concerned to see that inequalities in international trade are worsening and that debt-servicing, which is a burden on the meager resources obtained from structural adjustment, require bold action. Furthermore, the debt burden neutralizes the mobilization of funding for commodity exports, which are constantly depreciating because of inequitable terms of trade.\nIn my delegation's view, there can be no development if there is not an increase in income from commodities, whose prices, unfortunately, are not controlled by the developing countries. The quest for prosperity could be a danger, since it engenders a strong migratory flow from the South to the North.\nDespite the socio-economic changes carried out in our States to stimulate private initiative and cooperative movements and to improve living conditions, the African continent is still experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis. To this precarious picture we must add the resurgence of social problems, such as juvenile delinquency, illicit trade in drugs and narcotics, unemployment, the AIDS pandemic and the deleterious effects of persistent drought and other natural disasters. In this context, we support the recommendations and decisions of the international Conference held in Tokyo on African development. Furthermore, my delegation urges the international community to increase official development assistance and requests the United Nations to give greater support to the laudable efforts of the African countries in their economic-recovery policies, in keeping with Article 55 of the Charter.\nThe concept of development cannot be limited to the economic dimension alone. It must necessarily take into account social and cultural dimensions. As long as some are afraid of the progress of others, the myth of Sisyphus will prevail and part of our globe will be for ever harnessed\nto the yoke. Only dialog, tolerance and the elimination of poverty throughout the world will guarantee lasting peace and strengthen the unity and stability of nations.\nIn this regard we should stress the relevance of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Development. Highlighting the many aspects of development and its connection with peace, the environment, international security and human rights, it is a reference document in our quest for solutions to the many economic difficulties facing the developing countries. It has thus enriched our discussion on sustainable development.\nThe protection of basic human rights, the satisfaction of mankind's needs, and social justice are central to my country's concerns. My delegation welcomed the holding in Cairo of the International Conference on Population and Development, and we hope that the work of the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing in 1995, and that of the World Summit for Social Development, to be held in Copenhagen, will give in- depth consideration to other complex aspects of this important subject.\nIn my country, the Republic of Guinea, we have undertaken an ambitious program of political, economic, cultural and social restructuring. The process of establishing democratic and liberal institutions will be totally completed during the last quarter of this year with the holding of legislative elections. In order to pay the price of political and socio-economic liberalization, we need, in addition to substantial financial assistance, considerable support and understanding from the entire international community.\nMember States are preparing to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. This important event will offer an opportunity for us all to recall the very special circumstances that gave birth to our Organization and to pay a well-deserved tribute to the work of the founding fathers.\nMy country is making great efforts to prepare for this great event, and to this end a national organizational committee has been established.\nThe serious international problems to which I have just referred are a measure of the gravity of the challenges facing mankind, as well as the responsibilities of the United Nations. Our Organization has gained undeniable prestige, because of its increased burdens in managing world affairs. Nevertheless, in order to become\nmore effective, it needs to be restructured and revitalized. This applies to the Security Council and the other main bodies.\nReforms must be based on the principle of equality of Member States, and must reflect a balance in the decision-making process between the various bodies of the system. That is what is needed for the United Nations to succeed in its mission of maintaining international peace and security and promoting a balanced world economy.\nThe embryonic new international order, freed of all uncertainty and threats of instability, will emerge from such a development.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to join other\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. Your experience in international affairs, as well\nas your proven diplomatic skills, provide the assurance of\na successful conclusion of our deliberations.\nAt the same time, I wish to express our gratitude\nand sincere appreciation to His Excellency Ambassador\nSamuel Rudolph Insanally, for the distinguished manner\nin which he presided over this historic Assembly during\na particularly challenging forty-eighth session, ably\nrepresenting not only his country, Guyana, but the entire\n7\n\n\nLatin American and Caribbean region. We commend him\nfor his performance.\nOur Secretary-General continues his outstanding\nstewardship of the United Nations during these critical\ntimes, when this world body is increasingly being called\nupon to respond to crises of staggering dimensions. The\nBahamas appreciates his tireless efforts.\nAnniversaries are times of celebration and times of\nreflection. As this world assembly approaches its fiftieth\nbirthday, it is wholly appropriate that we should seek to\nevaluate our record.\nI believe that we can all agree that in our efforts to\nguide international relations in the 50 years since the end of\nthe Second World War, there have been both successes and\nfailures. We must surely build on the successes and\nredirect our energies to effectively reduce the number of\nfailures.\nThe credible success of this world Organization and its\nspecialized agencies in measurably improving the health,\nliteracy and education standards of the world\u2019s poor is no\nmean achievement. So also has been the success of this\nbody in seeking to ensure the environmental integrity of the\nplanet, in galvanizing the resources of the world to fight the\nillicit drug traffic, and in peacefully resolving disputes.\nWe can all be justly satisfied that the persistence of\nthis Assembly played a pivotal role in bringing to an end\nthe racist Government in South Africa. The victory of non-\nracial democracy in that torn land must give us hope even\nin the face of the most intractable problems. The Bahamas\njoins other Members in welcoming South Africa back into\nthe fold of the General Assembly.\nThe Bahamas fully supports the noble cause of the\nGovernment of South Africa as it begins the task of\nreconciliation and reconstruction. President Nelson\nMandela and the people of South Africa can be fully\nassured of my Government\u2019s hand of friendship.\nVictory in South Africa allowed us to dare to hope for\nan opening in Haiti. This Assembly knows very well the\nlong history of abuse of that poor Caribbean nation \u2014 a\nland in which the apartheid of wealth has flourished in a\ndestitute country. For many generations now, Haitian\nnationals have felt compelled to abandon their homes,\nfrequently in unseaworthy boats, in search of personal\ndignity and of economic and political liberty.\nMy country has frequently been their first safe\nharbour, and, while proud of our record of assistance, we\nhave been and remain ill-equipped to offer such refuge.\nMembers are aware of the tremendous burden that my\ncountry has had to bear in this regard. This refuge has\nbeen provided by the Bahamas in spite of the absence of\neither recognition or assistance from the international\ncommunity.\nTo say that our education, health and welfare\nresources have been stretched beyond capacity in our\nsmall island developing country is to greatly understate\nthe situation. When we add the extra costs attributable to\nthe necessary marine patrols associated with the\nmonitoring of undocumented persons, the full burden\ncreated in the Bahamas by Haitian nationals fleeing their\nhomes begins to become apparent.\nHence, the recognition by this body of the absolute\nnecessity for the world community to forcibly respond to\nthe brutality of the military dictatorship in Haiti is very\nmuch appreciated. The support given to the early\ninitiative led by the Caribbean Community to force a\nresolution of the crisis in Haiti has already borne fruit,\nand we commend the United States of America for its\nleadership in this important initiative.\nWe therefore join in welcoming the formation of the\nmultinational force authorized by the Security Council to\ntake all necessary action to restore the democratically\nelected government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\nNotwithstanding the tremendous costs that in recent years\nhave accrued to the Bahamas as a result of developments\nin Haiti, we have also agreed to lend manpower support\nto that force.\nToday\u2019s announcement that the coup leaders have\nresigned and will be leaving the country now paves the\nway for the desired return of President Jean-Bertrand\nAristide later this week.\nIt is especially important that the international\ncommunity now dedicate sufficient funding and expertise\nto the economic reconstruction of Haiti to achieve\ndemocracy in that land. It must continue to do so even\ntoday as Haitians await the announced departure of the\nfeared military from leadership and the return of their\nelected President. We who promote and encourage the\nadoption of democratic forms of government must also\naccept a degree of responsibility to service that\ndemocracy, especially in its infancy. The infant\ndemocracy that is struggling to be born in Haiti will\n8\n\n\nsurely die unless it receives the succour and support of the\ninternational community.\nSince the Second World War, the world community\nhas addressed the plight of political refugees. The\nincreased demand to assist persons fleeing political\npersecution is demonstrated in the ethnic purges and\nwarfare in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe dramatic exodus, during the first half of this year,\nof hundreds of thousands of persons across the seas on\nunseaworthy craft or down long roads across borders\ndramatically brought to the attention of the world\ncommunity the plight of undocumented persons seeking\nshelter outside of their homelands.\nThe burden borne by the Bahamas as a result of the\npresence of large numbers of undocumented Haitians is\nnow compounded by the more recent arrival of hundreds of\nCubans seeking to enter the United States of America. The\nBahamas Government is encouraged by recent efforts by\nboth the United States of America and the Republic of\nCuba to address this perennial problem of Cuban migrants.\nThe gravity of the Haitian crisis, the inhumanity of the\ngenocide in Bosnia, the cruelty of the murders in Rwanda\nand the ongoing war in Angola all are clarion calls to our\nOrganization and to the world that we must desist from\ntardy, piecemeal approaches and address in a timely and\ncomprehensive manner not only the effects but the very\nroot causes of these situations.\nNot least among these is economics, evidenced by a\ncrisis in development. Despair at the hopeless socio-\neconomic conditions of one\u2019s daily life has given rise, in\nthose so affected, to a basic pessimism and to the\nwillingness to risk even one\u2019s life for changed\ncircumstances. Where basic needs are unmet and survival\nis in jeopardy, there is little stake in the future and little\nreason to consider the sustainability of one\u2019s actions. The\nreal threat to our future security is therefore no longer\nmilitary aggression but deteriorating economic conditions.\nThe alleviation of widespread poverty while managing finite\nresources in the face of spiralling population growth will be\namong the major challenges of the twenty-first century.\nThe Bahamas, therefore, looks forward to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s revised \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d,\nhopeful that it will serve as an effective guideline for the\ncreation and implementation of measures commensurate\nwith the legitimate aspirations of Member States. We must\nnot lose ground in this session by becoming submerged in\nattempts to redefine development. We must, rather, focus\non the different levels of development that exist in our\nseveral countries. We must learn their effects and find\nsolutions for narrowing obvious disparities. These\nsolutions must include programmes specially suited to the\ndiffering levels of development of Member States.\nWe must therefore ensure that our quest for\nsustainable development is people-centred. We must\nconsider sustainable human development with a focus on\njustice, equality and democratic freedom as well as on\nmaterial well-being that incorporates equal opportunity for\nall. Inequity engenders violence, and violence fragments\nsociety.\nThe Bahamas, in spite of its apparent growth and\nstrong economic indicators, is still only a developing\nnation. However, unlike many other developing nations,\nthe Bahamas is continually frustrated in its efforts to\nsecure international resources and concessionary financing\nfrom multilateral institutions because of its reputed level\nof per capita gross national product.\nAs a small archipelagic country of a mere 260,000\npeople scattered over 100,000 square miles, burdened by\nthe cost of transportation and infrastructure replication,\nand with a very small minority of our residents in an\nextremely high income bracket whilst the overwhelming\nmajority of the population is at the opposite end of the\neconomic scale, we are advocating that this grossly\nmisleading per capita criterion for gross national product\nshould not be the only basis upon which resources and\nassistance are allocated to developing countries, such as\nthe Bahamas.\nIt is the view of the Bahamas that the entire system\nfor determining eligibility for development assistance\nshould be comprehensively reviewed, as it is clear that\nspecial consideration ought to be given to countries like\nthe Bahamas, with peculiar imbalances and vulnerabilities.\nFor its part, the Bahamas is engaged in a process of\nrefining its development indicators in an attempt to ensure\nthat data provided to international institutions are truly\nreflective of our economic-development reality. We\nexpect that the data so provided will also have an impact\nupon our budgetary assessments.\nThis comprehensive review, we believe, must\ninclude consideration of the vulnerability index identified\nin the Programme of Action of the Global Conference on\nSmall Island Developing States as the direction to be\nfollowed in the development of a measurement of the\n9\n\n\necological fragility and economic vulnerability of small\nisland developing States.\nIn this connection, I would remind the Assembly of an\nimportant message which was reinforced by the recent\nConference on Small Island Developing States, that is, that\nunless the peculiar difficulties of these States are properly\naddressed, those States will not have the wherewithal to\nproceed on a path to sustainable development.\nThe marine environment presents both an opportunity\nand a constraint with respect to the sustainable development\nand security of any island State. As a maritime nation, the\nBahamas attaches tremendous importance to the\nConvention, which has resulted in the creation of a new\nlegal regime for the oceans. Among its new achievements\nare the recognition of the legal status of archipelagos, the\n12-mile territorial sea, transit passage, the exclusive\neconomic zone, and the protection and preservation of the\nmarine environment and the resources of the deep seabed\nas the common-heritage of mankind.\nThe Bahamas was particularly pleased to join with\nother Member States in signing the agreement on seabed\nmining in July of this year, as that agreement modifies\nprovisions that had prevented many States from becoming\nparties to the Convention. The long awaited entry into\nforce of the Convention is therefore of extreme importance,\nas it provides a boost to our efforts to curb infringement on\nboth our national security and our national resources.\nWhile the socio-economic health of the world still\npresents challenges for the Organization, we have scored\nsome political successes in the recent past. These successes\ninclude, of course, the peace accord between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization signed in September of\nlast year, which led to self-rule in the Gaza Strip and\nJericho for the Palestinian people, and the signing of the\nWashington Declaration between Israel and Jordan last July.\nWe also applaud and encourage the dialogue now under\nway between Israel and Syria.\nIn spite of those successes, peace-keeping still\noccupies an important place in our activities. However, we\nmust ensure that peace-keeping operations are not\nconducted at the expense of other activities which are\nequally important, such as the development programmes of\nthe United Nations. After all, development is a prerequisite\nfor peace.\nFor small countries with limited resources, such as the\nBahamas, a major justification for membership in\ninternational organizations is the enhancement of national\ncapacity. It is therefore the duty of the United Nations to\nfacilitate the efforts of small countries to arrive at just and\nequitably sound solutions to differences within the\ninternational society of States, especially when they\ninvolve political and economic giants.\nIt is from this perspective that the Bahamas supports\nthe efforts of the Republic of China to entreat the\nOrganization to examine the merits of establishing an ad\nhoc committee to analyse comprehensively the current\nimplications and future ramifications of the preclusion of\nthe 21 million people in the Republic of China from\ncontributing to, and availing themselves of, all the\nbenefits deriving from membership in the United Nations\nand its affiliated agencies. Our Organization is expected\nto reflect universality and to demonstrate impartiality\nwhen forging international agreements for policy\ncommitments, for accessing resources and for action.\nThe Bahamas welcomes the report of the Open-\nended Working Group on the question of more equitable\nrepresentation within the membership of the Security\nCouncil. The Group\u2019s work thus far has been positive\nand constructive, and we trust that the momentum of its\ndiscussions will be maintained.\nThe report on the Security Council is of importance\nto all Member States. As its conclusions affect each\nMember quite directly, it is essential that the Council\nshould be seen to reflect as accurately as possible the\nwishes of the entire international community.\nAccordingly, it is imperative that the composition of a\nnew Security Council properly reflect regional diversity\nand thereby enhance the legitimacy of the actions of that\nimportant United Nations body.\nWe in the Bahamas look with great expectation to\nthe observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations. The preparatory period for this event is an ideal\ntime for reflection on targets and objectives which have\nalready been set by our Organization, some of which have\nnow been outstanding for many years. Turning fifty is an\nopportunity for the Organization to regain the confidence\nof our peoples. It will take hard work and determination\nto achieve the desired results so that over the next 50\nyears the United Nations will be known in all societies\nand across all levels of those societies as the real leader\nin the fight to bring dignity to mankind.\nIn the words of the great Johann Wolfgang von\nGoethe:\n10\n\n\n\u201cWe must not hope to be mowers\nAnd to gather the ripe gold ears\nUnless we have first been sowers\nAnd watered the furrows with tears.\n\u201cIt is not just as we take it,\nThis mystical world of ours;\nLife\u2019s field will yield as we make it:\nA harvest of thorns or of flowers.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "The unique role of the\nUnited Nations is to promote the well-being of people, the\nsecurity and development of nations and the protection of\nour common world. It was built on a resolve to maintain\npeace and security and to employ international machinery\nfor the promotion of the economic and social\nadvancement of all peoples.\nThe United Nations peace-keeping activities are a\nchallenge for all nations. For Denmark, it is a matter of\nthe highest priority. The United Nations can rely on\nDenmark to respond swiftly and efficiently to the needs\nof the Organization for troops, civilian police, customs\nofficials and personnel for humanitarian relief operations.\nWe have made organizational arrangements to make this\npossible, even at very short notice. A recent example is\nDenmark\u2019s decision to contribute civilian personnel to\nengage in a humanitarian effort and to promote human\nrights in Haiti.\nWe favour a combination of peace-keeping\noperations with humanitarian relief operations. The\n16\n\n\nestablishment of the United Nations stand-by forces will\nenhance the ability to respond quickly to emerging crises.\nDenmark is ready to participate with further elements and\nis establishing an international brigade for that purpose.\nPeace-keeping has its own special features. They are\ndifferent from traditional military training. Peace-keepers\nmust consistently act in full accordance with their role and\nmandate. As has recently been said, patience, persistence\nand pressure are key elements of peace-keeping missions.\nSeventy-three nations today contribute troops, military\nobservers or civilian police to the many ongoing operations.\nThe number of troop-contributing nations is increasing.\nThis has placed emphasis on the need for training.\nDenmark stands ready to share its vast experience and\nknowledge in peace-keeping training and requirements.\nThe cooperation between the Baltic States, the Nordic\ncountries and the United Kingdom on a Baltic\npeace-keeping battalion is a good example of such\ncooperation. At present, a Lithuanian platoon is serving in\nthe Danish battalion in Croatia.\nKeeping the peace worldwide is costly. Funds are\nlimited, as is the number of trained and equipped troops.\nIn the future we must utilize preventive diplomacy. In\nMacedonia, we have seen the positive effects of the first\nexample of preventive deployment.\nCommunication between the Security Council and the\ntroopcontributing countries is imperative. Further progress\nis needed on this, for instance in the form of regular\nconsultations between the members of the Security Council,\nthe troop-contributing States and the Secretariat.\nPeace-keeping involves the important question of\nsafety and security for United Nations and associated\npersonnel. Peace-keepers act as a neutral force. They must\nbe ensured the highest possible standard of protection.\nAttacks cannot be tolerated. We strongly support the\nefforts of the United Nations to draft a legally binding\ntreaty in this field.\nThe \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) led to discussions\non a more active role of the United Nations in peacemaking\nand peace-keeping. It is to be hoped that the \\\"Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\" (A/49/935) will inspire an equally important\ndiscussion on the role of the United Nations in\ndevelopment. Development policies must correspond to\nprevailing social, economic, environmental, religious and\nethnic problems.\nWe cannot fight tomorrow\u2019s battles with yesterday\u2019s\nweapons.\nMy Government is proud to host the World Summit\nfor Social Development in Copenhagen in March 1995.\nThe challenge of the Summit, the first of its kind, is to\ncreate new foundations of peace through development. It\npresents a unique chance to overcome the North-South\ndivide through new approaches. We must eradicate\npoverty and enable all people to earn a livelihood. We\nmust promote social integration by fostering just, safe and\nstable societies with the full participation of all people.\nDiscrimination in all its forms must be eliminated and\nhuman rights respected, and conditions for children and\nyoung people must be improved.\nAs a link to the Beijing Conference on Women, the\nSummit must make a strong commitment to achieving full\nequality between men and women and to enhancing the\ncontribution of women to social progress and\ndevelopment.\nProgress has been achieved in the preparatory\nprocess for the Summit, but this process is still marked by\ndifficulties. Time for preparation is running short. The\nSecretary-General is making untiring efforts to promote\nthe Copenhagen Summit and to secure its success. It is\nessential that Member States support the\nSecretary-General in his endeavours in order to keep up\nthe momentum of the process. The Summit represents an\nopportunity for world leaders to commit themselves and\ntheir Governments to a better and more just world.\nMembers may rest assured that, as hosts of the\nSummit, we will spare no effort to make it a success.\nWe are very much looking forward to welcoming Heads\nof State or Government in Copenhagen.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights in 1993\nwas a turning-point in United Nations activities for the\npromotion and protection of human rights. It is gratifying\nto see one of its central recommendations implemented in\nthe form of the establishment of the post of High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. Steps should now be\ntaken to increase substantially the resources for the United\nNations human rights programme. We must enable the\nHigh Commissioner to discharge his mandate in full.\nHuman rights are a vital element in preventing and\nresolving conflicts. We must therefore develop new\napproaches to monitoring human rights. One such step\n17\n\n\ncould be to set up a team of human rights monitors to assist\nthe High Commissioner.\nFreedom of expression is a basic human right. The\nfatwa against Salman Rushdie and others constitutes a\nflagrant violation of this right. We urge the Iranian\nGovernment to dissociate itself from this threat.\nIncreasingly we realize that our actions or our\nnegligence as individual nations affect other nations and\ntheir populations. All nations have a common future that\nwe must protect from nuclear disasters, environmental\ndegradation and weapons of mass destruction.\nChernobyl taught us how important this aspect of\nsecurity is. It is of great concern to my Government that\nmany nuclear facilities in Central and Eastern Europe and\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States are operating at\ncritically low levels of safety. We must improve this\nsituation.\nThe Rio de Janeiro Conference in 1992 put renewed\nemphasis on environment and development. Denmark\u2019s\nresolve to abide by the Rio principles is strong. Our\ninternational development assistance of 1 per cent of gross\nnational product (GNP) is guided by the principles of\nsustainable development. This will provide additional\nfinancial resources to developing countries and countries in\ntransition in order to assist them in meeting objectives of\nsustainability.\nOur common future also calls for taking steps towards\ndisarmament, arms control and confidence-building\nmeasures. It implies reducing weapons of mass destruction,\nchemical and biological weapons as well as weapons to be\nused in outer space. We have reached a time that is\nconducive to these aims and to allowing the role of the\nUnited Nations to be enhanced.\nReform of the United Nations is necessary. Denmark\nsupports a strong Security Council. We agree that the\nCouncil needs to be adapted to today\u2019s world and that it\nneeds to be enlarged. In enlarging the Council, priority\nshould be given to additional seats for non-permanent\nmembers, allocated under the principle of equitable\ngeographical distribution. A small number of new seats\ncould be allocated as permanent seats.\nWe entrust the United Nations with mandates to secure\nworldwide peace, security and development, but we fail to\nensure the Organization the necessary financial means. It\nis not tenable, for instance, that troop-contributing nations\ncannot be reimbursed, and I simply fail to understand\nhow some Member States can advocate United Nations\nactions, including peace-keeping operations, and then\nrefuse to pay the bill.\nDenmark welcomes the withdrawal of the last troops\nof the former Soviet Union from Estonia and Latvia on\n31 August, in accordance with concluded agreements.\nThis is truly a historic event. It is of significance to\nfuture relations between the Baltic States and Russia, to\nstability in the Baltic area and for European security. The\nagreements must now be fully implemented by all parties\nin order to keep up the momentum.\nAs for the former Yugoslavia, important results have\nbeen reached since the establishment of the Contact\nGroup. The decision by the authorities of the former\nRepublic of Yugoslavia to close the Serbian-Bosnian\nborder and to accept international surveillance is a direct\nconsequence of pressure by the international community.\nThe continued negative reaction to the peace plan of\nthe Bosnian Serbs must lead to their further isolation.\nSanctions remain one of the most efficient instruments in\nour policy of isolation. We therefore welcome the\nadoption of resolution 942 (1994) by the Security Council\nlast week.\nAgainst that background, we welcome the deferral of\nthe question of lifting the arms embargo. Denmark firmly\nbelieves that the arms embargo should not be lifted, as\nthis would entail risks of the conflict\u2019s spreading. It\nwould disrupt the peace negotiations, which combine the\nefforts of the United Nations, the European Union, the\nUnited States and Russia, and it would make the\ncontinued presence of the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR) impossible.\nUNPROFOR is playing an indispensable role in\nattempting to keep the peace and at the same time\nalleviate the plight of the people. With 1,400 troops,\ncivilian police and monitors in the former Yugoslavia,\nDenmark is one of the largest troop contributors to\nUNPROFOR. We remain committed to our participation\nin this operation.\nWe believe that a strict and effective sealing off of\nthe border between Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia\nand Herzegovina will be a new and decisive element. At\nshort notice Denmark sent observers for the Mission of\nthe International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia\n(ICFY) to monitor that border.\n18\n\n\nDenmark continues to make substantial contributions\nto the humanitarian relief work in the former Yugoslavia.\nCoordination by the United Nations and the European\nUnion is progressing favourably. Denmark is placing both\npersonnel and financial means at the disposal of that\nenterprise.\nWe strongly condemn the renewed \\\"ethnic cleansings\\\"\nwhich the Serbs have systematically carried out. The\npersons responsible for these atrocities must be brought\nbefore the international tribunal set up for the punishment\nof crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.\nIn the Middle East political will and hard negotiations\nhave created a historic breakthrough. Denmark warmly\nwelcomes the signing of the Declaration of Principles\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO) in 1993 and the Declaration signed between Israel\nand Jordan in 1994. The Gaza-Jericho Agreement was the\nnext important step. International support is now needed to\nkeep up the momentum.\nThe holding of fair and free elections in Gaza and the\nWest Bank will represent significant progress. We\nencourage the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli\nGovernment to ensure speedy implementation of the\nelection process.\nProgress should also be achieved in the negotiations\nbetween Syria and Israel and between Lebanon and Israel.\nWe welcome the clear political will of all parties to\ncontinue their efforts to bring about such progress. They\nall stand to gain significantly from peace, and the United\nNations continues to have an important role to play.\nThe tragic events in Rwanda revealed the weakness of\nthe United Nations and of the international community. It\nwas demonstrated that we were not able to provide an\neffective and timely response. The challenge remains to\ncreate stability and ensure Rwanda the proper conditions for\ndevelopment. This will require an international effort on a\nconsiderable scale, which can be successful only if it is\nfirmly rooted in Rwanda and the countries of the region.\nOn the African scene it is heartening to see the\nRepublic of South Africa reinstated in its seat in the\nAssembly. It is now fully participating in the work of the\nUnited Nations. South Africa has proved to the world that\na peaceful transition from repression to democracy is\npossible. It has set an example. This also confirms that\nthe United Nations has a role to play in bringing about\nfundamental reforms in a repressive society.\nDenmark has been a staunch supporter of the forces\nof democratic change in South Africa. We will continue\nour considerable financial support to the consolidation of\ndemocracy.\nThe best contribution of Member States to the\nUnited Nations is to reconfirm their will to implement the\nCharter, to accelerate the reform process and, indeed, to\npay their dues. The United Nations is, and must continue\nto be, a vital instrument in the service of the peoples of\nthe world.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to\nextend to you, also on behalf of the Indonesian delegation,\nour congratulations on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. We are\ngratified that the stewardship of this session is entrusted to\na seasoned diplomat and statesman, representing a fraternal\nAfrican country with which Indonesia has traditionally\nenjoyed close relations of friendship and cooperation.\nMay I also express our deep appreciation to your\ndistinguished predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador\nInsanally of Guyana, for so capably guiding our work\nduring a most eventful year.\nI join other members in paying tribute to the\nSecretary-General for his determined efforts to resolve\nvarious conflict situations across the globe and his\nendeavours to make the United Nations a more efficient\nand effective instrument of global governance in these\nchallenging times.\nWe meet at a time of pervasive change and transition,\na time in which global problems appear less susceptible to\neasy solutions, earlier concepts and approaches less relevant\nand existing institutions less effective. It is also a time of\ncontradictions and paradoxes in which resurgent hopes are\nnurtured amidst deepening anxieties and bright new\nopportunities are overcast by unprecedented challenges in\na world that is coalescing and fragmenting at the same\ntime.\nThe euphoria which permeated the international\ncommunity at the end of the cold war has dissipated and is\nbeing replaced by a growing sense of uncertainty, disquiet\nand disillusionment. With the sobering experience of the\nGulf war and the horrendous incidence of \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\" and violence in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia\nand Rwanda, there is far less certainty now on how best to\nrespond to the demands and vicissitudes of a world of\ndeepening interdependence among countries and the\nglobalization of ever more intricate and inter-linked\nproblems of peace, security and development. Our greatest\nchallenge, therefore, is how collectively to fashion a more\neffective system of global governance to manage the\nmassive changes that are transforming the shape and\nsubstance of international relations in the decades ahead.\nIf the pursuit of this basic objective is to succeed,\nthere can be no doubt that it should be based on the\nrecognition of the United Nations as its centre-piece and\nprincipal mechanism. The United Nations is the only\nuniversal institution we have today, and any system of\nglobal governance, to be viable and to achieve common\nacceptance by the world community as a whole, must be\nfirmly rooted in the principles and purposes of the United\nNations Charter and organized on the precepts of\nsovereign equality, common interest and benefit, equitably\nshared responsibility and joint commitment to global\ncooperation.\nIt is therefore vitally important that the effectiveness\nand dynamism of our Organization be ensured and\nmaintained. Since the United Nations was founded\nalmost five decades ago, the world has changed almost\nbeyond recognition, and international problems have\nbecome immensely more complex. The United Nations\ntoday bears a heavier load of responsibilities than it has\never borne. Ironically, at this time it is also saddled with\na deepening financial crisis. This paradoxical situation,\nin which the United Nations is expected to deal with a\nmultitude of problems while woefully strapped for funds,\ncannot continue without adverse consequences for the\nworld community.\nJust as important is the need to ensure that the\nUnited Nations system remains faithful to the democratic\nprinciples on which it was founded and attuned to the\nrealities of the times. We therefore believe that the\nprocess of reforming the United Nations system should go\nbeyond merely improving its procedures and practices and\nshould, inter alia, take into account such essential aspects\nas the representation of Member States at all levels of the\nsystem and their effective participation in decision-making\nprocesses. The General Assembly should play a central\nrole in shaping that process at the same time as its work\nis being continually rationalized.\nOn the question of an increase in the membership of\nthe Security Council, my delegation has clearly defined its\nposition on various occasions in the past. The last review\nof the Council\u2019s composition was undertaken nearly three\ndecades ago. Since then there has been a tremendous\nincrease in the number of United Nations Members, thus\nrendering the enlargement of the Council a matter of\nurgency. Such an increase should take into account the\nprinciple of equitable geographic representation and\naccommodate the interests and concerns of the developing\ncountries, which comprise the overwhelming majority in\nthe Organization. Furthermore, my delegation supports\nthe proposal to increase the number of permanent\nmembers of the Security Council. In this respect, it is\nour view that, while the principle of geographic\nrepresentation is important, it should not be the only\ncriterion to determine eligibility for new permanent\n19\n\n\nmembers. We believe that other objective criteria are\nequally important: political, economic and demographic\nrealities; a country\u2019s capability and record of contributing\nto the promotion of peace, security and economic\ndevelopment, both regionally and globally; and the\ncommitment of States to assume the responsibilities\ninherent in such a status. In these endeavours our goals\nmust remain the promotion of transparency, legitimacy,\naccountability and efficiency.\nIn the economic and social fields, as well as in\ndevelopment cooperation, it has been said that the United\nNations system operates without sufficient coordination and\ncoherence. However, in addressing this concern, we do not\nsee the particular merit of a proposal for the establishment\nof an economic security council at this time. Rather, the\nEconomic and Social Council should be further\nstrengthened and should be allowed to assert its full role as\nenvisioned in the United Nations Charter. In this regard, I\nthink it would be productive to invite the Ministers\nresponsible for finance and development planning, or other\nrelevant Ministers, to participate in the deliberations on\nimportant development issues at the Economic and Social\nCouncil\u2019s high-level segment meetings. The United\nNations should also continue to strengthen its coordination\nwith the Bretton Woods institutions so as to achieve\nincreased policy coherence and to enhance development\ncooperation.\nAlthough the demise of the cold war has reduced the\nthreat of nuclear war, it has not eliminated the danger posed\nby nuclear weapons. Nuclear disarmament remains an\nimperative. It is hoped that with further success in the\ncritical area of limiting and reducing armaments, the\nquantitative growth of nuclear weapons will soon be\ncurbed. Recent encouraging developments include a\nsignificant reduction of the world\u2019s two largest nuclear\narsenals as a result of the successful conclusion of the\nTreaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic\nOffensive Arms (START II) and of the fact that a\nmoratorium on nuclear tests continues to be observed by\nmost of the nuclear-weapon States.\nIn this context, the importance of a comprehensive\ntest-ban treaty as a major step towards nuclear disarmament\nand as an urgent measure to protect the environment cannot\nbe overemphasized. For this reason, the Conference on\nDisarmament has been given a clear and explicit mandate\nto negotiate a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing.\nUnfortunately, lack of political will on the part of some\nnuclear-weapon States has created obstacles to progress in\nthis vital work. It is essential that serious and concerted\nefforts be undertaken in the Conference on Disarmament\nin conjunction with the broader multilateral endeavours in\nthe Amendment Conference on the partial test-ban Treaty\nto ensure the conclusion of a universal and effectively\nverifiable treaty within a fixed time-frame. Such a treaty,\nwe believe, would serve as a truly credible instrument of\na nuclear non-proliferation regime.\nThe convening of the 1995 review and extension\nConference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\nprovides a unique opportunity to make a sober assessment\nof its implementation. It is beyond doubt that the\nquestion of the extension of the NPT is linked to such\ncritical issues as nuclear disarmament, the dissemination\nof nuclear know-how for peaceful purposes, security\nassurances to non-nuclear States and the establishment of\nnuclear-weapon-free zones. Hence, the issues we face\nnext year should not be oversimplified to a mere choice\nbetween limited and unlimited duration or between\nconditional and unconditional extension of the NPT. The\nlongevity of the Treaty will ultimately depend upon the\nresolution of these multifarious issues and the sincerity of\nthe nuclear-weapon States in fulfilling their obligations.\nRegional and subregional organizations continue to\nmake substantial contributions to the cause of\ndisarmament and peace. In the Asia-Pacific region, the\nRegional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) was launched last July in Bangkok,\nreflecting the desire of the countries of the region to\nensure a peaceful and stable political and security\nenvironment for their peoples. This forum is unique\nbecause it was not established in response to a crisis but,\nrather, as an exercise in preventive diplomacy to manage\nstrategic change in such a way that a stable relationship\namong the major Powers as well as among the regional\nPowers will evolve gradually and peacefully over the next\ndecade. At the same time ASEAN is intensifying its\nefforts to realize its blueprint for a zone of peace,\nfreedom and neutrality with a South-East Asian nuclear\nweapon-free zone as its component part. Its realization\nwould be a major step towards stable peace in the region\nand a significant regional contribution to global\ndisarmament and non-proliferation.\nAlthough the Asia-Pacific region now enjoys relative\npeace, it is by no means free of tension and the anxiety\nof potential conflict. Among the actual and potential\nproblems that the region must face is the persistence of\ninter-State disputes, especially territorial disputes and\noverlapping claims of sovereignty which could intensify\nif their potential for conflict were not effectively\n20\n\n\nmanaged. That was why in its Manila Declaration of 1992,\nASEAN stressed that its Treaty of Amity and Cooperation\nshould serve as a basis for the establishment of a code of\ninternational conduct in the area and thus called for the\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the non-use of force.\nThe positive response of the major Powers and of the\ncountries of the region towards the Treaty serving as such\na code of conduct at the first meeting of the ASEAN\nRegional Forum makes it even more necessary to promote\ncooperative efforts among countries that have overlapping\nclaims of sovereignty in the South China Sea in order to\nensure the peaceful development of the area.\nAs regards the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula,\nthe agreement reached last August between the\nGovernments of the United States and the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea was a major step towards a\nresolution of this problem. We continue to believe that this\ncomplex issue can be resolved only through the exercise of\nmutual restraint and through sincere and sustained dialogue\nand negotiations.\nIn the Middle East, the pursuit of peace continues to\ngather momentum and promises to herald a new era. The\nhistoric Declaration of Principles signed between the\nPalestine Liberation Organization and the Government of\nIsrael over a year ago has been followed by the Accord\nsigned in Cairo last March, which laid down the modalities\nfor transition to Palestinian self-government in the Gaza\nStrip and Jericho and thus paved the way for the triumphant\nreturn of President Yasser Arafat to these areas. Yet\nanother breakthrough is the signing of the Washington\nDeclaration between Jordan and Israel which ended the\nstate of war between them and opens the way for the\nconclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty.\nWhile my delegation welcomes these positive\ndevelopments, we are also acutely conscious of the\nformidable challenges that still lie ahead. Palestinian\nautonomy should now be widened to include the economic,\nsocial and cultural aspects of national life, and Palestinian\nself-rule should now be extended throughout occupied\nPalestinian territories. Furthermore, the international\ncommunity should expedite its promised assistance to the\nPalestinian Authority in rebuilding the necessary\ninfrastructures. It is also self-evident that progress on the\nother tracks of Arab-Israeli negotiations is a sine qua non\nfor a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question\non the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\n338 (1973) and 425 (1978). The ultimate guarantee for\npeace is Israel\u2019s withdrawal from all occupied territories,\nincluding the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the atrocities, senseless\nkillings of civilians and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" perpetrated by\nthe Bosnian Serbs have continued unabated. The pleas of\nthe Bosnian Government for effective international\nintervention or at least the lifting of the ill-conceived\narms embargo have gone unheeded. The savagery of the\nconflict has few historical precedents and the ambivalence\nof the international community has contributed to its\nperpetuation and the ever-present threat of a spill-over.\nBy rejecting the latest peace plan proposed by the Contact\nGroup, the Bosnian Serbs have dealt a serious set-back to\ninternational efforts to end the conflict.\n\nThe carnage cannot just go on. It is incumbent upon\nthe Security Council to unequivocally pronounce itself on\nthe non-applicability of resolution 713 (1991) concerning\nthe imposition of an arms embargo on Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Furthermore, in the face of the continued\nintransigence of the Bosnian Serbs, the Security Council\nmust take strong and determined measures in order to\nensure the realization of the peace plan. Concurrently,\nthe international community should consider devising a\nmechanism for negotiations, including the convening of\nan appropriately structured international conference, to\ndeal with the wider aspects of the conflict in and around\nthe former Yugoslavia, leading ultimately to a\ncomprehensive solution that would enable the people in\nthat region to live securely in peace, free from aggression,\ndomination and external interference.\nEarlier this year, the people of South Africa finally\nput an end to apartheid by holding the first-ever\nnon-racial elections and by subsequently installing the\nfirst, democratically elected government under President\nNelson Mandela. We have all joyously welcomed this\nhistoric event as well as South Africa\u2019s resumption of its\nrightful place in the community of nations. Indonesia\nlooks forward to developing close and mutually beneficial\ncooperation with the new Government and the people of\nSouth Africa.\nElsewhere in Africa, however, we were deeply\nanguished to witness in Rwanda the rampage of violence\nwhich has triggered an exodus of refugees to\nneighbouring countries and has brought about a\nhumanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions. With the\nend of fighting and bloodshed and the establishment of\nthe new government in Kigali, we hope that the parties\nconcerned will resume the process of national\n21\n\n\nreconciliation based on the Arusha Agreement, which\nindeed provides an appropriate framework for the purpose.\nThe situation in Somalia continues to be marked by\nrecurrent outbreaks of violence and a deterioration of the\nsecurity situation. We remain convinced that a solution to\nthe civil strife in that country can only be achieved through\nsustained dialogue among all the parties, under the auspices\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU). In this context, we hope for the early\nconvening of the national reconciliation conference in\naccordance with the Declaration of last March by the\nleaders of Somalia.\nThe entry into force of the United Nations Convention\non the Law of the Sea next month represents the\nculmination of efforts begun over two decades ago to create\na new order for the oceans. The Convention, which\nIndonesia ratified in 1985, will make a significant\ncontribution in promoting the peaceful uses of the seas and\nin ensuring their equitable utilization.\nI do agree with the report of the Secretary-General\nentitled \\\"An Agenda for Development\\\" (A/48/935) when it\ncites the economy as being the engine of progress and of\ndevelopment as a whole. If I may carry the metaphor a\nlittle further, it may be appropriate to say that at present the\nworld economy is a flawed engine that has stalled but is\nbeginning to warm up again. It is flawed by the\nimbalances and inequities that have distorted one of its\nmost important parts, the relationship between the\ndeveloped and the developing economies. It has broken\ndown in a long and devastating recession, but in recent\ntimes it has shown signs of recovery.\nHowever, the aggregate statistics of world economic\ngrowth often conceal as much as they reveal. As aptly put\nby the 1994 World Economic and Social Survey, the world\neconomy remains a complex mosaic of sharp contrasts, in\nwhich most developing countries are often too weak and\ntoo vulnerable to be able to compete successfully in the\nworld market, thus risking their further marginalization and\ndecline into extreme poverty. Hence, apart from the need\nto sustain non-inflationary, global economic growth, the\nurgent imperative continues to be the eradication of poverty\nand the acceleration of the socio-economic development of\nthe developing countries on a sustained and sustainable\nbasis.\nIf the engine for global progress and development is\nto carry mankind to a brighter future in the next century,\nthen its parts must be brought into a more balanced,\nsynergistic relationship and its functioning be made more\neffective and efficient. We have no alternative but to\nforge a new partnership for development involving all\nnations, developed and developing. It is therefore crucial\nthat we bring to full realization General Assembly\nresolution 48/165 on the \\\"Renewal of the dialogue on\nstrengthening international economic cooperation for\ndevelopment through partnership\\\". By adopting this\nresolution, the international community has acknowledged\nthe indispensability of the principles of genuine\ninterdependence, of mutual interest and benefit, and of\nequitably shared responsibility, in a new spirit of global\npartnership.\nAs a necessary corollary to this North-South\npartnership, South-South cooperation has become even\nmore compelling, for the developing countries are called\nupon to shoulder an increasing share of the responsibility\nfor world growth and development. We look forward to\nthe report of the Secretary-General on this issue and also\nto the deliberations leading to the adoption of \\\"An\nAgenda for Development\\\".\nAs many advocated during the World Hearings on\nDevelopment in June this year, as well as at the High-\nLevel Segment Meeting of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, the Agenda should be action-oriented and should\npresent an overall policy and priority framework for a\nbalanced and comprehensive approach to development.\nIt should reflect universal recognition and acceptance of\nthe United Nations as the only Organization capable of\ndealing with issues of development as well as with issues\nof peace and security. It will also be necessary for the\nagencies, bodies and programmes of the United Nations\nto be organized in such a way as to enable them to\nimplement the Agenda in an effective, efficient and\ncoordinated manner, without necessarily creating a new\nbody for this purpose. Obviously, there will be the need\nto generate the required political will in support of the\nAgenda. We look forward to seeing \\\"An Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\" serve as a fitting complement to \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\".\nOne of the most important recent developments in\nthe international economic sphere is the completion of the\nUruguay Round with the signing of its Final Act in\nMarrakesh and the agreement to establish the World\nTrade Organization (WTO). Indonesia and the other\ndeveloping countries have accepted the Uruguay Round\npackage, in spite of the heavy obligations and challenges\nthat it entails, because they anticipate that considerable\nopportunities for increased market access and indeed for\n22\n\n\nworld economic growth and prosperity will now be\nforthcoming. They also expect that the Uruguay Round\npackage will provide the long-sought assurance of a\nrule-based and non-discriminatory multilateral trading\nsystem, free from the arbitrariness of unilateral action. Yet,\nwe must confess to being concerned at the possibility of a\ntardy and long-drawn-out process of implementing the Final\nAct. Such an eventuality will negate much of its original\nintent and rob it of its positive impact, as was, regrettably,\nthe experience with the Tokyo Round. Furthermore, the\nattempts to overload the WTO work programme with social\nclauses in our view represent protectionism in a thin guise\nand tend to nullify the few remaining comparative\nadvantages of developing countries. For this reason we feel\nstrongly that the process of ratification and implementation\nof the Uruguay Round agreements should not be linked to\nnew issues that have little or no relevance to the\ndevelopment of a new international trading regime. All\nnations are called upon to marshal their political will and to\naccept inevitable shifts in comparative advantage without\ntransferring the burden of adjustment to weaker economies.\nHad relationships between developed and developing\ncountries been more equitable, we would not today be faced\nwith the problem of developing countries staggering under\ntheir external debt burden. While aggregate debt indicators\nhave undoubtedly improved, mainly in response to various\ndebt-relief measures, the external debt crisis still persists\nespecially in the least developed countries where debt ratios\nhave significantly worsened and continue to hamper the\nprospects for economic growth and development. A\ndurable solution to the perennial debt question can only be\nsecured through a development-oriented strategy formulated\nwithin the framework of shared responsibility and genuine\npartnership. Thus, rather than taking a one-sided view of\nthe causes of external debt, there is an urgent need for all\nsides involved to adopt a coordinated approach.\nAs Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement,\nIndonesia has given the highest priority to resolving this\ncrisis. President Soeharto took the initiative of conveying\na memorandum on the debt of developing countries to the\nChairman of the Group of Seven on the eve of their Tokyo\nSummit last year, inviting the G-7 to engage in dialogue on\nthis issue. We are encouraged that the G-7 responded\npositively to the Non-Aligned Movement on this issue in\nTokyo and then again last July in Naples, where, inter alia,\nit urged the Paris Club to pursue its efforts to improve the\ndebt treatment of the poorest and most indebted countries\nand, where appropriate, to reduce the stock of debt as well\nas to increase concessionality for those countries facing\nspecial difficulties. Moreover, Indonesia has also recently\nhosted a ministerial meeting of non-aligned countries on\ndebt and development, involving the most heavily\nindebted least developed countries. The meeting called\nupon the international community, particularly donors and\ninternational financial institutions, inter alia, to adopt a\ncommon set of principles for future debt negotiations,\nwhich include a once-and-for-all arrangement for settling\nall outstanding debts, and the application of debt\nreduction to all categories of debt, including multilateral\ndebts. A report of the meeting has been submitted to the\nSecretary-General for possible consideration at this\nsession of the General Assembly.\nAs a firm believer in the rights of peoples to\ndevelopment, including social development, Indonesia is\ndeeply committed to participating actively in the World\nSummit for Social Development. The World Conference\non Women in 1995 equally deserves total support from\nthe international community. Indonesia is committed to\nthe adoption of a conference declaration calling for de\nfacto as well as de jure equality between men and\nwomen, the integration of gender concerns into\nsustainable development, and a programme of action to\nachieve those goals.\nAs we prepare ourselves to commemorate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Organization next year, I sense that\ndespite the frustration of our hopes after the end of the\ncold war, we are about to open a window on a future that\ntruly does not belong to the nations of the North or the\nSouth, the West or the East, but to undivided humanity.\nPerhaps the advent of wisdom is always a gradual\nprocess. First we came to the realization that the human\nrace could not survive in a state of cold war against itself;\nthat our problems are global and systemic in nature, and\nthus that truly effective solutions to these problems should\nbe integral and so comprehensive they must be carried out\nby a global partnership.\nWithout that partnership, we should now realize, our\nbright hopes are unattainable. As we work to complete\n\\\"An Agenda for Development\\\" so as to match it with \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\", we are actually etching the fine\ndetails of our common vision of a better and more unified\nworld. It is said that the future belongs to those who\nhave a clear vision of it. That may be so, but only if we\nare faithful to that vision, persevere in its pursuit, and\nthereby prove ourselves worthy of it.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to convey the greetings of\nPresident Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada and of the people of\nBolivia to the Heads of State and Government in attendance\nat this the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly; to\nthe Foreign Ministers; to the President of the General\nAssembly, Mr. Amara Essy, and to his predecessor,\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, as well as to our dear friend\nVice-President Sergio Abreu; to Secretary-General Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali; and to the whole of the international\ncommunity, so worthily represented here.\nAs the highest forum of the peoples of the Earth, this\nnoble Assembly constitutes the ideal setting to reflect on\nand debate the issues of our day.\nBolivia is striving to enter the twenty-first century\nwhile bringing about substantial changes based on the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\nDuring its first year in office, the Government of\nPresident S\u00e1nchez de Lozada devoted its efforts to\ncarrying through the reforms needed to make the State an\neffective instrument for our society\u2019s democratic\ndevelopment, centred on the well-being of our people.\nThus, our reforms have been based on the concept of\ncomprehensive development, combining human and\neconomic development, social equity, and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nNow that Bolivia has thus completed the reform of\nits political constitution, it is putting into effect changes\nthat will enable it to consolidate democracy and economic\ndevelopment, in conditions of fairness and social justice.\nMy country has embarked on a dynamic policy of\nparticipation by the people, a process of educational\nreform, and a recasting of the shareholding and\nproductive structures of public enterprises through an\ninnovative concept of capitalization.\nDuring the second phase of its programme, the\nBolivian Government is planning to implement new legal\nprovisions to increase investment and production in order\nto provide more and better job opportunities, and to find\nconcrete solutions to the problems of poverty and the\nmarginalization of broad sectors of society. It is in this\nconnection, in the context of our Government\u2019s policy,\nthat the participation of the people is of particular\nsignificance.\nOn the subject of sustainable development, my\ncountry has proposed the holding of a meeting of\nPresidents of the hemisphere; that meeting is now\nscheduled for 1996 in Bolivia.\nThe future of our peoples and their material and\nspiritual well-being can only be the work of their own\nhands, as they are both the subjects and the objects of\ndevelopment. It is therefore most encouraging that - not\nonly within our country but within the United Nations\nsystem as well - there is a conviction that a central role\nfalls to organized participation, both individual and\ncollective, as an essential factor for change in a creative\nand positive direction.\nMechanisms for popular participation will make it\npossible to imbue the liberty, independence, sovereignty\n26\n\n\nand progress of nations with vitality and social content. It\nis a matter of appraising the role of all social sectors:\nworkers and entrepreneurs, women, indigenous and rural\ncommunities, the marginalized, the young, the elderly, the\ndisabled and all those who have the right and duty to\ncontribute to building a better future.\nIt is with that conviction that the Bolivian Government\nhas contributed actively to the preparatory work for the\nforthcoming World Summit for Social Development, to be\nheld in Copenhagen in 1995, and the Fourth World\nConference on Women, in Beijing the same year.\nIn that same spirit, the International Decade of the\nWorld\u2019s Indigenous People will be inaugurated at this\nsession of the General Assembly. My country is confident\nthat the observance of this Decade will be not merely\nsymbolic, but essentially a practical and concrete endeavour\nin its objectives and its scope. To that end, the meeting of\nrepresentatives of Latin American and Caribbean\nGovernments, grass-roots peasant organizations and\ninternational agencies, held in the Bolivian city of\nCochabamba last June, framed a series of recommendations\nto be included in the strategy of the Decade. Those\nrecommendations have also been brought to the attention of\nGovernments and the United Nations system. We hope to\nreceive a prompt and positive response so that the\nlegitimate claims of indigenous peoples will not be lost in\nthe labyrinths of international bureaucracy or the oblivion\nof another 500 years of solitude.\nResolving age-old problems surely calls for a great\ncapacity to understand the values, customs and ways of life\nof other cultures. Bolivia hopes that the International\nDecade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People will provide an\nopportunity for the international community to fully\nunderstand the topic of the coca leaf, a form of vegetation\ntraditionally grown in Andean regions. The cultural and\nmedicinal uses of the coca leaf need to be re-evaluated in\norder to distinguish it clearly from the social problems\nbrought about by the abuse of one of its derivatives in the\ndeveloped countries, which creates a growing demand\nassociated with an international cycle of crime.\nLet me take this opportunity to declare formally, once\nagain, that the Government and the people of Bolivia are\nearnestly and firmly committed to international efforts to\nfind the best-suited mechanisms to guarantee the success of\nthe policies delineated within the framework of the changes\nrecommended in General Assembly resolution 48/12,\nadopted at the last session.\nLess than two weeks ago, on an initiative of\nPresident S\u00e1nchez de Lozada, the most representative\norganizations of Bolivian society, together with the armed\nforces and the police, took a historic step when they\ndebated the problems of the coca leaf in a framework of\npluralistic participation and cooperation. The main\nconclusions of that meeting, which I take the liberty of\nsummarizing to this great forum of nations, stressed the\nurgency of combating drug trafficking through a world-\nwide strategy of shared responsibility; the need to adopt\nas a primary goal the fight against the dire poverty\naffecting over two-thirds of Bolivia\u2019s population; and\nsupport for initiatives aimed at the comprehensive\ndevelopment of coca-producing areas.\nBolivia is grateful for the international community\u2019s\nwillingness to draw a perfectly clear distinction between\nthe positive aspects of the native coca leaf and the grave\nharm done by dint of the external demand for cocaine.\nWe trust that this positive attitude will make it possible in\nthe near future to address this problem without prejudice.\nBut the international agenda at the end of the\ncentury encompasses other equally complex issues that\nhave recently been brought to light by the end of the cold\nwar, although their roots can be traced back to centuries\nof accumulated injustice.\nThe Republic of South Africa has given the world\ninvaluable lessons in its struggle against apartheid and for\ndemocracy. My country is joyful at the outcome of that\nprocess and, on behalf of Bolivia, I welcome President\nNelson Mandela to the General Assembly.\nDeeply moved as well by news of the tragedies in\nRwanda and in other regions of the world, Bolivia\nexpresses its solidarity with peoples which, through\nviolence and catastrophe, are showing us what we sow\nwhen problems are not resolved in timely fashion,\nproblems such as hunger, poverty, mass migration, the\nvarious forms of injustice inherited from colonial times\nand the plundering and lawless acts carried out even\ntoday by Powers large and small against other States.\nBolivia welcomes the advances achieved through\ndialogue in the Middle East, and we trust that in the\nfuture dialogue will become the principal instrument in\ndealing successfully with international disputes and\nconflicts. The Bolivian people hopes for a just and\nlasting peace between Israel, Palestine and the Arab\npeoples. May the deliberations of the General Assembly\ncontribute to consolidating that process.\n27\n\n\nThe situations in the former Yugoslavia and in other\nareas are a direct consequence of actions in the service of\nmisguided geopolitical interests aimed at social and political\ndestabilization of foreign territories, We hope that the\nsenseless repetition of such practices, which have had such\nwoeful effects in Central Europe, Asia and Africa, will not\nlead to similar disasters in other regions. Furthermore, the\nGovernment and the people of Bolivia condemn policies of\n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in the strongest terms and call upon the\ninternational community to take resolute and clear measures\nto put an end to those actions and to punish those\nresponsible for them.\nLatin America stands unconditionally in support of\ndemocracy and against the illegal use of military means and\nforce, in accordance with the recent declaration of the\npresidential summit of the Rio Group, the resolutions of the\nOrganization of American States and of the United Nations\nand the numerous proclamations of Parliaments and popular\norganizations from all over the continent.\nDemocracy, of course, cannot be left undefended.\nBolivia has had the bitter experience of long dictatorial\ninterruptions in its institutional life. Consequently, Bolivia\nstands today with the people of Haiti and its legitimate\nGovernment, and it supports the immediate return of\nPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the restoration of the\ndemocratic regime.\nHistory has shown that peace, justice and respect for\nthe principle of self-determination can be guaranteed only\nwhen there are consolidated democratic institutions capable\nof defending and promoting human rights. Solidarity\ncannot be left at the rostrum. My country reiterates its\nwillingness to help, within its available means, in the\nprocess of restoring Haitian democracy to the extent the\nlegitimate Government of that country deems our help\nuseful.\nThe ending of the cold war must apply also to Latin\nAmerica and make it possible, through dialogue and\nunderstanding among the parties concerned, for Cuba to be\nreintegrated into the inter-American community.\nAll States of the world must contribute to ensuring\npeace, brotherhood and the timely solution of problems that\nare as yet unresolved. To that end, action must be taken to\nenable peoples to develop, since economic backwardness\nand its social effects are at the root of the crises and\nconflicts we face.\nWe therefore attach high priority to the themes of\nthe \\\"Agenda for Development\\\". Economic\ncomplementarity, the transfer of technology, trade, the\nopening up of economies, foreign investment and co-\noperation should be our instruments for strengthening\nsolidarity and friendship among peoples and\nGovernments.\nIn this spirit, Bolivia strongly supports Latin\nAmerican unity and subregional integration, hemispheric\nagreements, and any opportunity that may present itself\nfor exchanges between nations.\nThese aims - cooperation and complementarity,\nfriendship and solidarity - must serve as the basis of the\nnew international order. For that reason, the observance\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter in\nSan Francisco should provide an opportunity to make\nsubstantive progress in adapting the United Nations to the\nnew realities and demands of the world community.\nGovernments on all continents must demonstrate the\nability to save future generations from the scourge of war.\nWe must make human rights, individual and collective,\nfully effective. International justice must become possible\nand be assured, and social progress within the broadest\nconcept of freedom must be promoted.\nIn international relations in the third millennium, law\nmust cease to be the instrument of the stronger, serving\nto entrench injustices, and must become the sole and\neffective means of resolving disputes, rectifying the errors\nand excesses of past generations as often as may be\nnecessary.\nOn the subject of respect for the rules of inter-State\nrelations, Bolivia welcomes the entry into force of the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\nwelcomes the fact that 1998 is to be the International\nYear of the Oceans. Convinced that recovering our\ncountry\u2019s access to the sea is an inalienable right of\nBolivia, the Government of President S\u00e1nchez de Lozada\nis working to secure for the Bolivian people, during the\ncurrent decade, a real solution to the unjust land-locked\nsituation with which it has had to contend for over\n100 years. My country believes in the force of\nconvictions, in the force of international solidarity, in the\nforce and the evolution of law, and in the possibilities of\nfriendly negotiation with a view to overcoming disputes.\nDemocracy must find clear expression in inter-State\nrelations. Participation by countries large and small in\n28\n\n\nthe resolution of issues that affect all of them must be\nequitable and not, as is sometimes the case, mere words.\nThis presupposes, among other things, a change in the\norganization and composition of the Security Council so\nthat with its permanent and non-permanent members, it will\nbe representative of the realities and requirements of\nappropriate participation, reflecting the obvious emergence\nof new centres of power in different parts of the world. It\nwill also be necessary to strengthen the role of the General\nAssembly and to restore the United Nations its central role\nin the resolution of the major economic problems of the\nplanet, a task which, for the present, remains the exclusive\npreserve of the super-Powers.\nThe right to development is an objective necessity,\nalthough exercise of the right still seems remote for the vast\nmajority of the world\u2019s population. We must assume an\neffective commitment to give that right the same priority\ntreatment as is given to the human rights of individuals.\nIf the present generation is unable to defeat growing\npoverty and secure employment opportunities for the\nalready vast global army of the indigent, it will be\nimpossible to ensure the peace and well-being in the\ndeveloped regions of the world. Population growth, mass\nmigrations and globalization will take their toll, with a\nnegative effect on the dignity, the peaceful co-existence,\nand the hopes of all mankind for a better life.\nOver the centuries, the Andean peoples of Bolivia\nhave wisely been guided by three fundamental rules which,\nin the Quechua language, are: \\\"AMA SUA, AMA\nLLULLA, AMA KHELLA\\\", meaning \\\"Do not steal, do not\nbe idle, do not lie\\\".\nIf those three rules were also applied in relations\nbetween States and nations today, they would have to be:\n\\\"Do not unjustly exploit the fruits of your neighbours\u2019\nwork. Do not complacently enjoy your splendid life-style\namid universal poverty. Do not make promises of\nsolidarity and understanding that you are not prepared to\nkeep.\\\"\nI feel sure that the ability of all of us to live together\nwould be infinitely enhanced were we to be guided by such\nrules.\n"

        "file_text": "I would be disloyal to the\nfeelings of the delegation of the Republic of Equatorial\nGuinea if I did not from the outset join with the preceding\nspeakers in expressing my best wishes to you and\ncongratulating you on your well-deserved election to the\nPresidency of this General Assembly. I wish you every\nsuccess and assure you of the complete cooperation of my\ndelegation. Please convey my congratulations also to the\nother members of the General Committee, whose work is\nnot always given due recognition.\nWe also commend the work accomplished by\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who presided\nover the last session of the General Assembly. And I wish\nto express special appreciation to His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our distinguished Secretary-\nGeneral, for his deep commitment to the search for viable\nsolutions to the problems and difficulties confronting\nmankind today.\nThis forty-ninth session of the General Assembly is\nbeing held at a time when the international community is\nexpressing its concern at the bleak panorama that the\nworld offers us, and more than ever is proclaiming its\nright to preserve peace and the socio-political and\neconomic stability of the world. This session of the\nGeneral Assembly, therefore, must not disappoint these\npressing aspirations of the human community, which has\nevery reason to continue to consider the United Nations\nas the hope of mankind.\nIt is illogical and inconceivable to the peoples of our\nworld that after the fall of the ideological borders that\nshaped the bipolar world, we should again be confronted\nwith new burdens and contradictions. My country is\ndeeply concerned at the negative effect of the wave of\nviolence in many parts of the world today. In record\ntime, we have seen evidence of many sources of tension\nand conflicts that wipe out many years of United Nations\nefforts. Everywhere panic and uncertainty prevail, owing\nto the intolerance and arbitrariness that are real threats to\nworld peace. None the less, it would seem that we all\nwant to close our eyes and act as though we did not know\nthe causes of this instability. For the Republic of\nEquatorial Guinea, the causes are all interdependent:\npoverty, inequality in relations among nations,\nunemployment, ignorance, and political and religious\nintolerance.\nThis forty-ninth session of our General Assembly\nmust therefore reflect deeply in order to find a global\nsolution to these common denominators of all our\ncountries. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea wishes to\nreaffirm here, from this rostrum, the confidence that it has\nplaced in the United Nations and our conviction that this\nOrganization is the ideal framework for resolving the\ndifficult, delicate and complex problems confronting the\ninternational community.\nIn this grim international panorama, my country, the\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea, is endeavouring to\npreserve internal peace and political stability, and to\nmaintain a strict policy of good-neighbourliness and\ncooperation with the other countries of central Africa. In\nthis framework, we have been strengthening the internal\nsocio-political structures that make it possible to\ncoordinate an integral, democratic system that guarantees\nthe individual and collective freedoms of our citizens.\nIndeed in 1991, the Government began a transition on the\nbasis of established constitutional provisions and has been\nestablishing the political environment conducive to\npolitical pluralism and a multiparty system. A number of\n14\n\n\nlegal regulations now govern the exercise of pluralist\ndemocracy in my country. May I mention, among them:\nthe law of political parties, the law of freedom of\nassociation and expression, our trade union law, the law of\nfreedom of the press and printed matter, the law of\nfreedom of religion, the law of complaints and petitions,\nand all the other laws that govern the electoral process.\nTherefore, the fact is that Equatorial Guinea today is\na free, democratic and independent country where peace\nand stability prevail. With only 400,000 inhabitants, we\nhave 14 political organizations that operate freely and\ndemocratically and constitute the pluralist expression of our\npeoples. None the less, as everyone knows, there are some\nwho, because of their concealed interests, have attempted,\nand continue to attempt, to thwart the will of some of our\npolitical leaders in our democratic process. This is the root\ncause of the disinformation campaign that is being waged\nagainst my country.\nAllow me to dwell a moment on this point. Because\nmy country is being subjected to a systematic international\ncampaign of disinformation through certain very well-\nlocalized media. Hence a negative image is being projected\nof my country, in total disregard of the efforts that have\nbeen made since 1979 by His Excellency Mr. Obiang\nNguema Mbasogo, the President of the Republic of\nEquatorial Guinea, to restore the respectability and honour\nof my country after 11 long, bloody years of the\ndictatorship of Macias Nguema, who was overthrown\nwithout anyone helping us. Regarding this campaign of\ndisinformation, there is a saying that I would like to\nreiterate here: \u201cThe truth is one, but untruth is manifold\u201d.\nEverything depends on the colour of the lens through which\none looks. There are some who, because of their own\nunconfessed interests prefer to continue to look at us\nthrough a dark lens; but we ask the international community\nto assess our actions in a neutral and objective way, without\nallowing itself to be influenced by third parties. We ask\nthat you view us through a clear lens that will allow you to\nsee the reality.\nPlease do not misunderstand me. We are not against\nthe contribution of the international community to the\nefforts of the people and Government of Equatorial Guinea\nfor democracy and the promotion of human rights and\nfreedoms, but we do believe that these objectives cannot be\nachieved by promoting and instigating ungovernability,\nanarchy and civil disobedience in the developing countries.\nWe see some countries now using the international\ncommunity\u2019s demand for respect for human rights and\ndemocracy to mask activities that are aimed at\nsubjugating developing countries such as Equatorial\nGuinea. None the less, we would like to point out that in\nthe course of this year, certain donors, such as France and\nSpain and the United Nations Development Programme,\nhave made a positive contribution to our democratic\nprocess by giving moral, technical and economic support\nto our efforts to consolidate democracy. They have done\nexcellent work.\nWe believe that the escalation of domestic tensions\nin many African countries today has a common cause:\npolitical intolerance, fuelled and promoted by foreign\nintervention in a country's domestic jurisdiction.\nHowever, as the saying goes, \u201cThe master\u2019s eye makes\nthe horse fat\u201d \u2014 in other words, however they may be\nassessed or distorted from outside, the realities in each of\nthe countries in those regions exist independently of the\ninterpretations placed on them.\nWe in Equatorial Guinea believe that development\nand democracy can be promoted only in an atmosphere of\npeace. We therefore feel that the United Nations should\nput emphasis on its efforts at preventive action rather than\nthose designed to restore peace or serve as a buffer.\nMeasures such as the dispatch of evaluation or inquiry\nmissions to individual countries can be more effective in\navoiding conflicts like those currently taking place in such\nfraternal and friendly countries as Angola, Rwanda,\nLiberia, Somalia, the former Yugoslavia and so on.\nInterventions after the fact have been shown to have\nlimited effectiveness.\nSome peace-keeping missions and operations in\ncertain conflict areas have also undergone a qualitative\nchange. It is therefore urgent to redirect the mechanisms\nthrough which the Organization functions and adapt them\nto the changes in today's world.\nWe believe that in an increasingly complicated\nworld, and with limited resources, international relations\nmust be complementary. In this sphere the role of the\nUnited Nations has become even more decisive. It is\nhardly useful for some to attempt to monopolize the\nsolution to the world's problems if we do not all feel\nsincerely involved. As an earlier speaker in the general\ndebate noted, there can be neither peace nor justice if\ndiscrimination exists in international relations.\nMy country hopes that the new world scene will\nwitness the implementation of procedures for sincere\ninternational cooperation on behalf of those countries that\n15\n\n\nneed it most, those countries that are struggling not just to\nmaintain the quality of life but often for their very survival.\nThe poverty and misery in all the countries on Earth calls\nfor action by others to remedy their plight.\nUnited Nations efforts in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security contrast with the limited\nprogress achieved in economic and social development.\nThe global chasm separating rich and poor is steadily\nwidening. We need the solidarity of the industrialized\ncountries, on mutually agreed terms, if we developing\ncountries are to find a definitive solution to our external-\ndebt problem, the burden of which is another obstacle to\nprogress and greater social development.\nIt would be most promising if agreement could be\nreached on the mechanisms to solve this economic,\nfinancial and socio-economic problem. One such\nmechanism might be a re-examination of the idea of\nconverting external debt into investment and into projects\nwith proven social impact.\nThe preservation of the environment and the fight\nagainst drug trafficking are questions that demand\nconsideration. The 1972 Stockholm Declaration established\nthe foundations for some universal principles for the\nprotection of the global environment and efforts to control\npollution and combat desertification and deforestation.\nReality, however, called for new initiatives, which\nculminated in the Rio Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment. We hope that the results of that Conference\nwill be of benefit to all and help ensure mankind's the\nsustainable development and future well-being.\nI should, however, like to emphasize the obligation of\nthe developed and industrialized countries \u2014 which bear\nthe greatest responsibility for the deterioration of the global\necosystem \u2014 to those countries that today are being asked\nto make the sacrifice of limiting their legitimate right to the\nuse of the riches nature has bestowed on them. Fitting\ncompensation must be forthcoming, particularly through the\nfunding of alternative projects and technological\ncooperation.\nWithin its modest financial means, the Republic of\nEquatorial Guinea has been and remains ready to take\naction to improve its national environment as its\ncontribution to the task of preserving nature throughout the\nworld. The Government of Equatorial Guinea is also\ngiving its constant attention to the struggle against the\nAIDS pandemic, and, thanks to the deep awareness of the\npeople of Equatorial Guinea and the assistance we are\nreceiving from international agencies, we shall spare no\neffort to control it effectively. From this rostrum we are\nappealing to the international community to join us in our\nefforts to speed and support work in these sectors.\nFor all those reasons, we hope that the United\nNations will continue to enjoy the full support of all of us\nin working to achieve a better world in the coming 50\nyears.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate Mr. Essy on his\nelection to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly and to express our appreciation of the\ngreat responsibilities he will be shouldering, together with\nthe Secretary-General, in preparing for the commemoration\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United\nNations.\nI also take this opportunity to salute, on behalf of my\ncountry, Syria, the long and arduous struggle of Africa\nagainst the system of apartheid in South Africa. This\nstruggle, recently crowned with the establishment of a\nunited, democratic and non-racial Republic of South Africa,\nis a triumph not only for Africa but also for humanity and\nthe international community as a whole. It is especially a\ntriumph for the United Nations as it is one of its most\nimportant achievements. This great accomplishment will\nremain forever a source of inspiration and optimism for us\nall that all forms of racism are inevitably doomed to\nextinction.\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations will raise fundamental questions about the\nrole and achievements of the Organization and the\nobstacles it has faced and continues to face. In our\nopinion, the most important question will focus on the\nreform and restructuring of the United Nations to make it\nmore democratic and thus more capable of responding to\nthe major changes that have taken place on the\ninternational scene, particularly since the end of the cold\nwar.\nIt seems that none of the Member States objects in\nprinciple to the idea of introducing reforms to the United\nNations, including the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil\u2019s membership. However, the question that could\ntake years before any agreement is reached on it is that\nwhich relates to the nature of the required reforms, the\ncriteria for choosing the new members of the Security\nCouncil and, first and foremost, the right of veto:\nwhether to expand it or abolish it altogether from the\nCharter.\nMore than two-thirds of the current Members of the\nUnited Nations did not participate in drafting the Charter\nof the United Nations, either because they were\nlanguishing under colonialism or because, after\nindependence, they were thrust into the cold war, for\nwhich the United Nations was an important arena. In this\ncontext, developing countries pose the following question:\nIf colonialism is truly a thing of the past and if the cold\nwar is indeed over, what other reasons are there to\nprevent the developing countries from actively\nparticipating in the restructuring of the United Nations\nand from taking the share they are democratically entitled\nto in the Security Council\u2019s membership?\nWe hope that the answer will not be a negative one\nand that the cold war will no longer be waged in new\ninnovative forms and under different pretexts. That\nwould be in no one\u2019s interest and would serve no useful\npurpose, either in the short or in the long term. Today\u2019s\nworld, North and South, East and West, faces\nunparalleled challenges that require the cooperation of all\nMember States in facing up to them. Those challenges\nmay initially appear to be of a minor nature, but they may\nwell grow and spread like a plague.\nIn many continents, dozens of civil wars have been\nspawned from the womb of the cold war. The causes of\nthese wars are many: national, ethnic, religious and\ntribal. Their victims are hundreds of thousands, while the\nrefugees and displaced persons they uproot are in the tens\n17\n\n\nof millions. The number of those who live below the\npoverty line in the world today has reached almost one fifth\nof the inhabitants of the globe. About 90 per cent of those\nlive in developing countries.\nA phenomenon that seems truly odd and surprising is\nthe spread of organized crime to countries where such a\nphenomenon was never known before. Organized crime\nnow has its own international networks, its secret\ntransnational organizations are estimated to be in the\nthousands. Such organizations have the ability to break the\nmost rigorous of laws by all the illegitimate means\navailable to them, including the smuggling of nuclear\ncomponents and their scientific designs.\nThe indispensable international cooperation needed to\nmeet such varied challenges cannot achieve the desired\nresults if certain of its principal parties take to evoking the\nspirit of the cold war by calling up the past instead of\nlooking forward to the future or if they act under the\ninfluence of some racist background that inspires their\npropaganda or election campaigns. It is no exaggeration to\nsay that such elements and subjective motives have already\nplayed a role in obstructing international efforts to address\na number of serious crises, particularly those in which\nhuman suffering has reached levels that defy description\nand stymie the imagination, as in the cases of Bosnia,\nSomalia and Rwanda, not to mention Afghanistan, where\nthe shortsightedness of the conflicting parties has\noverwhelmed all wisdom and prudence.\nOn the other hand, however, we must commend the\nUnited States of America for resorting to political dialogue\nwith the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and with\nCuba instead of continuing to pursue its policy of\nconfrontation against them. These are positive measures\nwhich we hope will continue and expand to encompass\nother issues, in the forefront of which is that of Lockerbie\ndisaster and Libya, so that political dialogue will become\nthe most appropriate option inresolving disputes between\nStates. In the same vein, we hope that the United Arab\nEmirates and Iran will be able, through amicable dialogue,\nto reach a satisfactory solution to the question of the\ndisputed islands that would preserve the rights of both\nparties and consolidate friendly relations between the two\nneighbours.\nSyria was one of the first States in the Middle East to\nsign, as early as 1968, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In doing so, Syria was\nprompted by its conviction that the possession of such an\noverkill weapon by any State in our highly sensitive region\nwould be a major cause for concern, not only to the\npeoples of the region, but also to the world at large. At\nthe time, Syria expected that its early signing of the NPT\nwould be an incentive to Israel, sooner or later, to sign in\nturn and would dissuade it from possessing nuclear\nweapons. Regrettably, we were to discover that our\nexpectations were not justified. Israel, as yet, has neither\nadhered to the NPT, nor agreed to open its nuclear\ninstallations to international inspection.\nOnce again, and on the occasion of the Paris\nConference on Banning of Chemical Weapons in January\n1989, Syria took the initiative to call for making the\nMiddle East a region free of all nuclear, chemical and\nbiological weapons of mass destruction within the\nframework of the United Nations. However, Israel did\nnot respond to this call nor did it respond to any of the\ncalls of the United Nations, the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency or those of the Conferences of the Non-\nAligned Movement or the Islamic Conference.\nThis is an issue that has become of the utmost\nimportance and gravity, particularly in the light of the\nongoing peace process in the Middle East. It is not\nacceptable for any one party to have a privileged or\nexceptional position at the expense of others in regard to\nsensitive and decisive matters that relate to regional\nsecurity which ought to be based on co-equality and\nmutuality.\nThe forthcoming conference of the States Parties to\nthe NPT scheduled to review the extension of its tenure\nwhich is about to expire, affords a rare opportunity for all\nStates in the region to demonstrate their peaceful\nintentions.\nThe accession by all States in the Middle East to the\nNPT is a vital step towards transforming the Middle East\nto a region free of all weapons of mass destruction. From\nthis rostrum, and in this context, the Syrian Arab\nRepublic calls upon Israel to accede to the NPT and to\nplace its nuclear installations under the inspection of the\nAtomic Energy Agency so that the States of the region\nmay be able to agree to extending the Treaty. This, if it\nis done, will be an important step towards the creation of\na climate of confidence which in turn will contribute to\nbuilding peace and security in the Middle East.\nThree years have passed since the convening of the\nMadrid Conference and no just and comprehensive peace\n18\n\n\nin the Middle East has materialized. This is a fact that\ncannot be cancelled out by the achievement of some\nprogress on some tracks.\nOur region is the cradle of human civilization and\nmonotheistic religions. Succeeding generations of its\npeoples have become accustomed to repel invaders. It is\ntime for the region to enjoy peace and stability. This\ncannot be achieved through half-measure solutions or\nthrough the trickle down of droplets of peace, nor can it be\nachieved through agreements which encroach on the\nnational dignity or compromise the interests of a nation.\nSyria accepted the initiative of the United States in\nwhich the United States undertook to work towards the\nachievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the\nregion, on the basis of international legality, Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978)\nand the land-for-peace formula including a political solution\nto the question of the national rights of the Palestinian\npeople. The United States also confirmed that in pursuance\nof its previous positions rejecting the extension of Israeli\nlaw to the Syrian Golan Heights, it did not agree to the\nannexation of any part of the territories occupied in 1967.\nIn the light of the complexities of the Arab-Israeli\nconflict and the suspicions of the Arab parties regarding\nIsrael\u2019s intentions, Syria took two important decisions\nwhich complemented one another.\nThe first decision was our commitment to coordinate\nwith the Arab parties participating in the peace process.\nThis was prompted by our conviction that the other Arab\nparties would benefit from such solidarity as well as from\nthe position of Syria and its various potentialities. We are\nalso convinced that the comprehensiveness of the solution\nwould be a guarantee to all parties should they respond to\nthe requirements of peace.\nThe second decision was that the peace option was a\nstrategic one. By so doing we misled no one: neither our\nown people nor any of the others, as to the truth of our\nintentions, so that they may act accordingly.\nIn this context, we were absolutely convinced that\nthese two important decisions were going to be in the\ninterest of all parties participating in the peace process.\nThese two decisions, we believed, would also facilitate the\ntask of the two sponsors, the United States and the Russian\nFederation, in achieving full peace in the region in return\nfor full withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied in\n1967.\nRegrettably, the peace process did not continue on\nthe right track towards achieving its desired objective.\nThere are many reasons for that. However, we see no\npoint in elaborating on them now. Nor do we want to\ndigress and elaborate on the current position of those\nparties which have strayed from Arab coordination.\nSuffice it to refer to an essential point that was revealed\nin their public statements. The point is that they have\nnow begun to question the usefulness of what they have\ndone. The fact is they have become unable to contribute\nto the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in\nthe region.\nIn fact, the optimistic trumpetings by Israel about\ngreat progress achieved in the peace process is not true,\nexcept from Israel\u2019s point of view. The agreements\nreached so far have achieved nothing but what Israel\nwanted from the land-for-peace formula while the Arab\nparty that signed those agreements with Israel still awaits\nIsrael\u2019s response to its demands.\nThe most important characteristic of Syria\u2019s policy\nunder the leadership of President Hafez al-Assad, is the\nreconciling of principle and reality. Principles that cannot\nsurvive on the ground are bound to decline. On the other\nhand, living the reality without adhering to one\u2019s\nprinciples leads to decline.\nSyria wants peace, and realizes that all parties have\na stake in this peace. It realizes also that peace has\nobjective requirements, and it is prepared to fulfil those\nrequirements that are agreed upon. Syria means what it\nsays and adheres to what it means. The land-for-peace\nequation must be implemented in both its parts. The\nreturn of the entire Golan is not open to compromise,\nunjustified delay or a misplaced testing of intentions. On\nthis basis, Syria supports a genuine peace - a peace that\nlives and flourishes without artificial obstacles or arbitrary\nconditions. Putting on the peace process a greater burden\nthan it can bear does not help to achieve peace; rather, it\nposes a threat to the process. The peace process should\nnot be weighed down with issues that fall outside its\nframework.\n19\n\n\nIt is regrettable that, as a result of its strong influence\non the media, Israel has managed to distort information and\nturn facts on their head, to the extent that those in some\ncircles of Western public opinion now claim that Syria used\nthe Golan Heights to launch offensives against the Israelis,\nwhereas, in fact, the opposite was the case. Israel uses the\npretext of security in an attempt to justify its occupation of\nthe Golan Heights and its refusal to withdraw therefrom.\nIt was Israel, not Syria, that started the armed clashes in the\nperiod between 1949 and 1967.\nUnited Nations records and resolutions on this matter\nadopted by the Security Council during that period will\ndemonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt that Israel was\nresponsible for opening fire for the purpose of expelling\nSyrian farmers from their land and preventing them from\nreaping their harvest. It was natural that the Syrian side\nshould have defended its own citizens and land by\nresponding every time they were fired upon.\nThe records to which I have referred are supported by\nmemoirs published by senior United Nations officers who\nwere entrusted with the task of supervising the truce\nbetween Syria and Israel during that period. Among those\nofficers are General Odd Bull and General Karl van Horn.\nHills and mountains are no obstacle to today\u2019s sophisticated\nweapons. In any case, the Golan Heights are directly\nopposite the Galilee Mountains, which are within Israel and\nare higher than the Golan Heights.\nAnyway, whether or not the Israeli public are aware\nof the truth of what I have just said, the United Nations\nCharter states the basic principle of the non-acquisition of\nterritory by force. This principle has been confirmed in\nmany Security Council resolutions. The current peace\nprocess cannot be completed without Israel\u2019s withdrawing\nfrom the entire Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon.\nWe believe that our position is just. We have a right\nthat we shall never relinquish. As President Assad has\nsaid,\n\\\"Relinquishing any part of a nation\u2019s territory\namounts to relinquishing the entire country and its\npeople\u2019s free will.\\\"\nWe want a just peace that restores everyone\u2019s legitimate\nright - the comprehensive peace after which the peoples of\nthe region aspire and under which they will be able to\nenjoy security, stability and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "At the\nvery outset I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Amara\nEssy, on your election to the high post of President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its current session. I view this as a\nsign of recognition of your country\u2019s authority in the\ninternational community.\nThe United Nations is approaching its fiftieth\nanniversary, and the entire world has grown older along\nwith it. What is the world like nowadays? Has it become\nbetter? Has it become wiser? And, most important, what\nwill the present generation leave behind to its successors?\nNo State, no people can be indifferent to these\nquestions. Here in the United Nations we must find\nanswers to them. This is particularly important for\nRussia. We are trying to understand what kind of world\nwe want to live in, and exactly what kind of world we\nshould spare no effort to build.\nThe new Russia was born in 1991 as a democratic\nState. Its birth was witnessed by the entire world.\nFor several years now we have been engaged in a\ntremendous, and painstaking task, the essence of which is\nto remove the legacy of totalitarianism and the cold war.\nFreedom has come to Russia. The people have\nobtained fundamental civil rights long denied them.\nProfound economic reform is in progress in Russia. A\nfree market economy is being put into effect. Thus, each\nof our new success stories reinforces Russian democracy.\nRussia has decisively drawn a final line under the\nSecond World War. Our forces have been withdrawn\nfrom Germany, Central Europe and the Baltic States. Of\nits own accord, and at great effort, Russia has removed\nany threat to the security of other States.\nFurthermore, our country, through its own efforts,\nhas promoted the end of confrontation in Europe, setting\nup new security structures there, not only for a select\nnumber, the chosen but for all. The Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) should\nbecome a powerful driving force in that process.\n1\n\n\nWe expect there to be more understanding on the part\nof our partners with regard to the problems of security in\nRussia. We count on their ability to overcome the old\nsuspicion inherent in a world divided into blocs, suspicion\nthat is now unjustified.\nRussia is undergoing changes and regaining its\nidentity, but in every respect it remains a great Power.\nRussia is ready for equal cooperation within the framework\nof the international community, which should in turn accept\nan active, open Russia.\nWe would like nuclear weapons and other kinds of\nweapons of mass destruction to cease to exist. Efficient\ncontrol over the non-proliferation of the technologies for\ntheir production is imperative.\nRussia needs a world without wars and armed conflicts\nand without environmental calamities. We favour the\ndevelopment of international economic ties without\ndiscrimination. Russia stands for a world capable of\ncombating terrorism, drug-trafficking and other types of\ninternational crime.\nTo make such gigantic changes possible, efforts by all\nthe Members of the United Nations will be required. There\nis no room for either soloists or supernumeraries.\nNaturally, we cannot do without new relations between\nthe two major nuclear Powers. I am convinced that the\nentire world has a vital stake in the establishment of a\nstrategic partnership between Russia and the United States.\nI am ready for a serious and fruitful dialogue with President\nBill Clinton, who today gave an optimistic forecast of our\ninteraction.\nRussia\u2019s economic and foreign-policy priorities lie in\nthe countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States\n(CIS), the former Republics of the Soviet Union. Russia\u2019s\nties with them are closer than the traditional relations of\ngood-neighbourliness; we have, rather, an extraordinary\nblood relationship. In virtually all the CIS countries today\nthere is a growing desire for closer cooperation and a\ngenuine, rather than merely proclaimed, integration. Its\nfoundation will be good will and mutual benefit.\nAttempts to use the contradictions between the CIS\nStates for selfish ends are extremely short-sighted.\nConflicts in a number of CIS countries threaten not only\nthe security of our State, but also security at the regional\nand global levels.\nWe are acutely interested in the active participation\nof the world community in settling these difficult\nproblems. However, the main peace-keeping burden in\nthe territory of the former Soviet Union sits is being\nborne by the Russian Federation.\nOur efforts have not been fruitless. A solid truce\nhas already been established in Moldova. The peace\nprocess in Georgia is developing; hope of stopping the\nbloodshed in Nagorny Karabakh is already emerging and\ninitial agreements on Tajikistan have also been reached.\nEverybody knows how difficult life is for millions of\nRussians in newly independent States; it is not a time for\ncomplacency. Once they were in their own home, but\nnow they are guests - and not always welcome ones.\nWe cannot remain indifferent to the fate of our\ncountrymen. I an not referring to special rights or\nprivileges. But the people in Russia will not understand\nif I do not state here and now that the democratic States\nhave to prove through their actions that guaranteeing\nhuman rights is indeed the cornerstone of their foreign\npolicy. And in this area neither a selective approach nor\ndouble standards are permissible.\nTwo years ago the General Assembly adopted the\nDeclaration on the rights of national minorities. At this\nsession we propose to come to an agreement on the\nprinciples of that Declaration being embodied in the\nlegislation of all United Nations Member States.\nRussia makes no distinction between settling its\nproblems and the problems of others. That is why we\nparticularly highly value what is done within the United\nNations.\nThe world is now at a crossroads. The tragedy of\nthe struggle of two opposing blocs is finally over. The\ndelicate balance based on power, fear and mutual\nintimidation has disappeared for ever.\nBut the world is still not stable. The changes that\nare taking place entail not only hopes for a better future,\nbut also profound anxieties.\nIt is not only Russia that is trying to respond to the\nemerging challenges. To a certain degree, the united\nGermany, Japan, the United States and other countries of\nthe West face the same problem. The same applies\nequally to many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin\nAmerica.\n2\n\n\nThe fundamental changes in international relations are\naccompanied by the emergence of new problems. More\nand more countries see strengthening the effectiveness of\ninter-State structures as the solution. At the same time, this\ndoes not always prevent an increase in the activity of those\nwho hold separatist and nationalist aspirations.\nA veritable floodgate of regional and local conflicts,\nnational, tribal and religious enmity and economic, social\nand political confrontations has been opened wide. The\nbleeding wound in Bosnia has not healed. It is a tragic\nparadox that in the wake of the cold war in Europe hotbeds\nof war have flared up there anew.\nThe unprecedented tragedy in Rwanda resounds\npainfully in the hearts of all people. This has proved to be\na defeat for us all.\nBut let us look around. Are there not other parts of\nthe world where more refined and civilized unlawful actions\nare being taken against national and cultural minorities?\nAre their rights and their security not threatened? Have\nracism and anti-Semitism disappeared? Is there no longer\nany discrimination against those who are categorized as\nnon-indigenous?\nWhen aggressive nationalism is made into State policy\nit is a grave danger for all mankind.\nThese problems are all the more urgent today because\nthe threat of local conflicts has not waned.\nEach of these conflicts could cause a veritable\navalanche of geopolitical changes all over the world.\nThe cold war is over, but its material infrastructure -\nthe mountains of arms and the military-industrial complexes\nof the developed countries - still remain. The spread of\nnuclear weapons could make them into instruments of\nterror. Huge amounts of weapons have been dumped onto\ninternational markets. Unfortunately, vested interests\nfrequently prevail over the awareness of the danger implicit\nin this process. In fact, this is nothing but an arms race\nthat has simply been transferred to the developing countries\nthrough the market.\nThe worsening ecological crisis and the proliferation\nof AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and other\ndangerous diseases are also realities at the close of this\ntwentieth century.\nThe lessons of history can be learned only with great\ndifficulty. Obsession with the idea of supremacy is\nextremely dangerous. The pathological failure to accept\nsomething different has time and again resulted in\nnumerous ethnic and religious problems and conflicts.\nThe fear of open political territory wind up once again\nwith a \\\"cordon sanitaire\\\" or \\\"iron curtain\\\".\nLet us be honest: equality, partnership, mutual\nbenefit and cooperation still remain, to a large extent,\nwords used to cover State egotism. Such a situation\nindicates an urgent need to develop a solid system of\nsecurity on the basis of principles and mechanisms of\ncooperation on the part of everyone, and a need for the\nreform of international institutions. Such a system should\nbe in keeping with the new conditions that now prevail\nand should function under the auspices of the United\nNations.\nAs a specific contribution towards the establishment\nof such a system, I would propose the following\nmeasures.\nFirst, we must speed up the negotiations on the\nconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty.\nRussia advocates the signing of this treaty next year,\nwhen we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations. We should also give thought to further steps to\nlimit Russian and American strategic nuclear weapons in\norder to make it possible eventually to renounce the\ninherited \\\"balance of terror\\\" based on mutual nuclear\ndeterrence.\nSecondly, we must extend non-proliferation measures\nto cover weapons of mass destruction. Next spring, when\nthe Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons takes place, it is\nessential to adopt a decision to the effect that the treaty\nshould be open-ended and of unlimited duration. No one\nhas the right to deny this. In this context, we believe that\nthe non-nuclear-weapon States will need to be given\nadditional and more precise security assurances. We\npropose the holding in the near future of a special\nmeeting of the Security Council, at the Foreign Minister\nlevel, to coordinate and adopt a new resolution on\nso-called \\\"positive\\\" security assurances.\nThirdly, we should launch a multilateral debate on\nthe issues with regard to the regulation of the\ninternational traffic in weaponry and military equipment.\nMoreover, there is an urgent need for all nuclear-weapon\nStates to participate in the process of the control and\n3\n\n\nlimitation of nuclear weapons. We propose that a treaty on\nnuclear security and strategic stability be elaborated by the\nfive nuclear-weapon States. Such a treaty could provide for\ncessation of the production of fissionable materials for\nmilitary purposes, for prohibition of the recycling of\nfissionable materials for weapons purposes and for further\nelimination of nuclear weapons and the reduction of their\nmeans of delivery.\nFourthly, it would be advisable to open discussions on\nregional programmes to strengthen peace and security.\nRegional security systems are being formed even now: I\nam thinking particularly of the treaty on collective security\nbetween the members of the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates (CIS) of the former Soviet Union. We believe that\nat the present stage that the United Nations could direct its\nefforts towards coordinating the process of building up\nregional security systems.\nFinally, the experience of recent years demonstrates\nthat the renunciation of the arms race is a complicated and\nhighly expensive process. Conversion of the military\nindustry gives rise to extremely difficult economic and\nsocial problems that have to be dealt with, particularly as\nthey relate to the elimination of chemical and\nbacteriological weapons. In this context, it is important to\npool the efforts of the international community. Such\ncooperation among States would help to enhance the level\nof mutual trust. In 1996, it might be possible to hold a\nconference, under the auspices of the United Nations, on\ninternational cooperation in the field of conversion.\nImplementation of these measures will enable us to\nsubstantially stabilize the situation in the world. However,\nfrom the long-term point of view, these measures will not\nbe sufficient.\nThe former purely military understanding of the\nconcept of \\\"security\\\" has today become obsolete. The\nrange of problems faced by mankind is much wider than it\nwas. The modern definition of security is inseparable from\nthe notion of stable development.\nThe world is urgently in need of a strategy for the\ntwenty-first century - a strategy of mutual responsibility.\nThe most important points of reference for such a strategy\ncould be defined as follows:\n- Stable economic and social development, not\nonly for individual regions and States but,\nindeed, for the entire planet as a single entity.\nPeople themselves must assume the\nresponsibility of carrying out this immense task;\n- The renunciation of diktat by the powerful\nvis-\u00e0-vis the weak. Any country, whether large\nor small, should be aware of its responsibility\nfor the maintenance of order based on law and\nmorality;\n- The unconditional recognition of human rights,\nincluding the rights of national minorities. In\nview of the great diversity of cultures,\ntraditions and the historical experience of\ncountries and peoples, fundamental human\nrights are a universal value and we cannot\npermit them to be devalued;\n- Strengthening the ecological security of\nmankind. The world is now facing a most\nserious crisis because of the deficit of\nresources, deterioration of the natural\nenvironment, and many other negative trends.\nCommon sense and the instinct for survival tell\nus to stop exploiting our depleting resources to\nthe detriment of nature, society and mankind.\nRussia supports the programme on Global\neducation and observation to preserve the\nenvironment. Moreover, this programme is\nentirely consistent with the strategy of shared\nresponsibility. We intend to participate\nactively in its implementation.\nAt the same time, I should like to emphasize that\nonly a profound understanding, on the part of each\nparticipant in international cooperation, of his or her\nindividual responsibility can engender a common sense of\nresponsibility for the world situation.\nTo paraphrase a well known expression we could\nsay that the United Nations is a good idea whose time has\nfinally come. I should like in particular to note the great\npersonal contribution of the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to the cause of\nadvocating peace and settling regional conflicts.\nIf the United Nations is to achieve maximum\neffectiveness in the twenty-first century, it must undergo\na well-thought-out reform.\nObviously, changes will be required both at\nHeadquarters and in the functioning of the specialized\nagencies. Also, it will be impossible to avoid changes in\n4\n\n\nthe Security Council, which should remain sufficiently\ncompact and an effective functioning body. This is\nespecially important because, according to the Charter, the\nSecurity Council bears primary responsibility for supporting\nand maintaining world peace and security.\nWe have to strike a new balance of law, morality and\nforce in world politics. The United Nations could play a\ndecisive role in these efforts in accordance with the Charter.\nRussia stands ready, as provided in Article 43 of the\nCharter, to enter into an agreement with the Security\nCouncil to make available national military contingents for\nUnited Nations operations. If a sufficient number of other\nStates follows this lead, then it could be possible to go\nahead with the realization of the concept of United Nations\nstand-by forces.\nThe Military Staff Committee has already been\nformally in existence for several decades. According to the\nCharter its function is \\\"to advise and assist the Security\nCouncil on all questions relating to the Security Council\u2019s\nmilitary requirements\\\". Let them finally do just that.\nThe pertinent task now will be to work out a strategy\nof peace-keeping, conflict and crisis prevention and, if\nnecessary, operations on peace enforcement.\nThrough specific actions, Russia has shown support\nfor United Nations efforts aimed at setting up efficient\nmechanisms of response to humanitarian emergencies. We\nstand ready to cooperate with all countries anxious to\nreinforce the capability of the world community to produce\na rapid humanitarian response.\nBecause the problems we are increasingly\nencountering are multifaceted, they require adequate\nsolutions. The question is not about who should enjoy\nmore rights - the United Nations, the regional structures or\nStates. The future world system can be truly durable only\nif it is possible to find efficient and effective mechanisms\nto address problems at all levels - national, regional and\nglobal. Sharing responsibility will make it possible for the\nUnited Nations to remain flexible and a pragmatic and\neffective structure and enable it to focus its efforts on the\nsolution of the genuinely key problems faced by mankind.\nRussia believes that these are all fundamental issues\nthat have a direct bearing on the fate of the world\ncommunity. Both the authority of the United Nations and\nthe future of world politics as a whole will depend on the\nway these issues are dealt with.\nPeople have always sought stability, happiness and\nprosperity. But history provides evidence of the fact that\nthese goals cannot be achieved with the help of brute\nforce alone. Once again we become acutely aware of this\nfact now that we are approaching a sacred date for\nmankind: the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the\nSecond World War and the restoration of peace.\nLet us remember with gratitude those who gave their\nlives for this great victory. Let 1995 become the\nuniversal year of commemoration of the victims of the\nSecond World War.\nFor the sake of those living and those who have not\nyet been born, we must preserve peace and establish\nstability on our planet. Mankind should finally feel that\nit is at home, a home which is both kind and reliable.\nOur civilization has always been varied. It is\nprecisely in the variety of cultures, traditions and values\nthat the possibility of development is basically found.\nAt this time, we have reached a stage when different\ninterests and aspirations of peoples can be achieved only\nthrough cooperation among them.\nThe world community should make every possible\neffort to ensure that its policies are embodied in the new\nthinking about the influence of States, national pride and\npatriotism.\nThe United Nations is a child of the world. Fifty\nyears ago when the Second World War was in progress,\nit became abundantly clear that the future of mankind is\nto be found in the realm of cooperation and tolerance\nrather than aggression and hatred.\nCooperation and tolerance are prerequisites for the\nnext century.\nThis is the most important condition for there to be\na worthy future for our planet.\nThis is a unique opportunity that has been given to\nthe human race.\nI believe that the United Nations, in fulfilment of its\ngeneral responsibility, will not allow us to pass it up, and\nI hope that the great dream of peace to which all peoples\nand States aspire to will take its due place in the life of\nour planet.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a special pleasure and\nhonour for me to extend to my brother, Amara Essy, my\ndelegation\u2019s warmest congratulations on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. He is a highly esteemed and valued friend to\nmany of us, and we can rest assured that his vast\ndiplomatic and political experience, coupled with his\nproven leadership qualities, will guide this Assembly\nthrough a very productive and successful session.\nThe Assembly is also most grateful for the\nexemplary and skilful manner in which Ambassador\nInsanally successfully conducted the affairs of the\nforty-eighth session during his tenure as President.\nWe must also recognize the dynamic and resourceful\nmanner in which the Secretary-General has guided the\nSecretariat of the United Nations during this period of\nmomentous internal and worldwide change. That the\nordinary citizens of the world and its many poor have a\nhumane and sensitive advocate in the halls of power of\nthe United Nations is a great stabilizing factor. We wish\nthe Secretary-General well in his unending efforts to bring\npeace and development to all corners of our troubled\nworld.\nAs our Organization moves towards its fiftieth year,\nthere is an air of concern for the state of the world, its\n24\n\n\npeople and the United Nations itself. Building upon our\nemphasis last year on the rights of the individual, the\npurview of the international community has expanded to\nencompass the right of the individual to a better economic\nand social life. The population Conference at Cairo\nhighlighted the pressures of population on economic growth\nand development, and marked specific areas for action, with\ntargets and goals, and next year\u2019s Copenhagen conference\non social development will explore widespread poverty and\nunemployment, and the critical issue of social integration.\nWe have come to realize that these problems cannot be\nsolved in isolation by any of the principal actors - -\nindividuals, States or even the international community.\nOnly by cooperating and working together to reinforce the\nspecial attributes of each can we begin to arrest the\npervasive social disintegration, endemic conflict and world\ndisorder that threaten our security and our future.\nFortunately, in the United Nations, whatever its limitations,\nwe have a truly international Organization at the centre of\nall these issues, which needs only proper use and\nreinforcement to reverse these corrosive trends.\nAs we review the developments of the past year in the\nlight of the triumphs and tragedies experienced by the\nworld body and by the international community, the picture\nwhich emerges is one of persistent conflict and pervasive\npoverty. Happily, some perennial points of antagonism,\nsuch as South Africa and Palestine, have witnessed\nextraordinary developments. For some, the dramatic accord\nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and\nIsrael, negotiated entirely by the Palestinians themselves,\ncontinues to be viewed with a measure of astonishment.\nTrue enough, the accord will not satisfy everyone, and\nconditions remain on future progress, but after so many\ndecades of having a minimal voice in their destiny and of\npaltry changes in their condition, the Palestinians have\nmade the first real breakthrough towards a Palestinian State.\nEfforts towards political and democratic institutionalization\nand administrative refinement, accompanied by widespread\npolitical participation and empowerment, are evolving\nslowly and may demonstrate to the international community\nthe level of support lent by Palestinians to the direction\nimplied by the accords. The substantial international\nassistance pledged and envisaged to underwrite the requisite\nstability and progress must be forthcoming in order to meet\nthe urgent needs of the Palestinian governing authority, and\nto achieve the goals of a functioning and efficient\nPalestinian entity.\nThe Palestinians have suffered long and hard under a\nharsh and often difficult occupation, enduring numerous\nfalse starts and misdirected illusions. They have now\nembarked on the road to self-determination and should\nreceive the total support of the international community.\nBut the eventual realization of a full Palestinian State\nmust be clear, and any measures tending to render the\noccupied territories merely \\\"self administered\\\" Bantustans,\nsupplying labor to Israel\u2019s more developed economy,\nmust be resisted by all means.\nNot only the continent of Africa, but the entire world\nmust take pride in the remarkable progress unfolding in\nSouth Africa. Under the inspiring and extraordinary\nleadership of President Mandela, South Africa has\nbecome an exemplary model for the international\ncommunity of national reconciliation and unity. During\nthe recent dramatic period in its history, South Africa was\nlikewise fortunate to have had a visionary in the person\nof Mr. de Klerk, who was aware of the role of timing and\nrecognized the need for change. While there have been\nmany players in the struggle against apartheid, certainly\nnone are more deserving of praise and recognition than\nthe majority people of South Africa themselves. South\nAfrica cannot fail to appreciate that all of Africa, and in\nfact the world, shares in its joy. We can only urge\nPresident Mandela and his country to continue to work\ntogether to advance the task of restructuring South Africa\nso that it truly realizes its undoubted greatness.\nBy now the world is painfully aware of the fate of\nRwanda, torn apart by sheer hatred and intolerance, by\nleaders bent upon exploiting ethnic differences for selfish\ngains. Employing all manner of fear, intimidation and\npropaganda, they succeeded in stirring up nearly an entire\npeople to turn against another, until the eventual human\ncarnage, in so compressed a time span, was no doubt\nunequalled in human history. Even now, the intransigent\nleadership of the millions of suffering Hutus, eking out a\nbare existence in the volcanic soils of eastern Zaire or the\nother surrounding countries, refuses to acknowledge the\nplight of their people, dissuading them with threats and\nviolence from returning to their country. Their actions\ncannot be pardoned; the perpetrators of this insane\nepisode must be brought to justice and punished.\nOtherwise, their implacable goal of rearming and\nreturning one day to the battle field promises a long night\nof recurring horror for Central Africa. Regrettably, by\npaying no heed to the early signs of pending troubles, and\nby seeking ways to severely limit its involvement, the\nworld body lost the opportunity to play a significant part\nin preventing this tragedy. Worse still, the difficulty in\nassembling and suitably equipping a United Nations\npeace-keeping force has not helped to instil in those who\n25\n\n\nhave fled the confidence needed to return, and in those who\nhave remained the confidence needed to stay.\nAll this leaves the new Government of Rwanda in the\nthroes of a critical dilemma, requiring immeasurable soul\nsearching. For a country from which nearly one-third of\nthe population has fled - in the case of Rwanda some 2\nmillion people - the numbers are so large and\ndisproportionate as to deny the Government a large measure\nof the legitimacy it badly needs. Something very serious\nmust be done to bring the two peoples together in\nmeaningful national reconciliation, with a Government that\nreflects this. Certainly the spirit and intent of the Arusha\nAccord remains even more valid today in the light of what\nhas taken place.\nNote must also be taken of the valiant efforts of the\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR),\nfacing terrible odds in a situation of such frightening chaos.\nDespite its small numbers, its attempts to alleviate the\nsuffering and protect the vulnerable undoubtedly saved\nmany lives and provided a measure of sanity in a sea of\nmadness. The world body should recognize with pride and\ngreat appreciation what has been done by the personnel of\nUNAMIR and its illustrious leader, General Romeo Dallaire\nof Canada.\nOne reason for pessimism in Central Africa is the fact\nthat many of the factors that led to breakdown in Rwanda\nare also present in Burundi. There the ominous rise in\nkillings, coupled with the accelerating pace of rearmament,\nshould cause extreme concern to the world community.\nWith the army at the epicentre of power, and with weapons\ncalling the shots, so to speak, government and politics could\nremain tense and unstable. However, we are strongly\nencouraged by the recent indications of an emerging\npolitical consensus, as evidenced by the installation of a\nnew president. This is a positive trend which we hope will\nmanifest itself in all aspects of political, economic and\nsocial activity.\nThe plights of Angola and Liberia are likewise grave;\nboth are locked in a destructive state of shooting\nnegotiations. In both, the humanitarian situation is again\nregressing and a cease-fire is nowhere in sight; the gun is\nagain the preferred method of voting. Fortunately, progress\ntoward peace and an elected national Government is still on\nits course in Mozambique, where the leadership seems to be\nserious about ending the prolonged and destructive state of\nconflict and engaging for the first time in building a\ndemocratic State through national elections, scheduled for\nOctober this year.\nThe United Nations Observer Mission in\nMozambique (UNOMOZ) is determined to fulfil all\ntargets and tasks on schedule and believes in the\nprospects of success for the people of Mozambique. Its\nstrong\nIn Haiti, the long-anticipated international\nintervention, sanctioned in Security Council resolution\n940 (1994), has taken place. A multinational force has\npeacefully secured the country, thanks in large measure to\nthe good deal of prudence shown, and the intense\ndiplomatic efforts undertaken, by the United States. We\nare pleased that the junta has deemed it unwise to oppose\nthe world, and instead has agreed to relinquish power in\norder to facilitate the return of the democratically elected\nPresident, Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\nIn other areas, Djibouti remains saddened by the\nstatus quo in the bilateral discussions between the two\nGulf neighbours, Iran and the United Arab Emirates,\nconcerning the three islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb\nand Abu Musa. We believe there is an urgent need for a\nrenewed and serious effort to resolve this dispute through\nall possible peaceful avenues, including its referring it to\nthe International Court of Justice.\nBosnia remains a high-profile international\nflashpoint. Despite the warning of dire consequences, the\nBosnian Serbs have rejected the final compromise\nproposal of the five-nation Contact Group, which awards\nthem 49 per cent of the country, over two-thirds of which\nthey have taken by force. In the weeks since the\nrejection, nothing has been done to punish the Bosnian\nSerbs, as it had been intimated would be done. In fact,\nthe Serbs continue to apply consistent pressure on the\nBosnian Government and the United Nations, targeting\nSarajevo and its airport, blocking United Nations food\nconvoys and strangling safe areas such as Srebrenica and\nGorazde. Even \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" has resumed. One\nshudders to think what would have happened immediately\nif it had been the Muslim party that had rejected the\nproposal.\nThis inaction reflects the blatant unwillingness of the\ninternational community to take any meaningful action\nagainst the culprits, let alone punish them. This only\nencourages further intransigence. The Serb reaction to\ndifficult situations consists in resorting to wild, radical\nbehaviour, eliciting retreat and concessions by the\npeacemakers. One can never say what they will do\ntomorrow, which means their word today has no intrinsic\nvalue. To have rewarded Belgrade with a loosening of\n26\n\n\nthe sanctions in the absence of a viable and comprehensive\npeace agreement or concrete proof of compliance is to\nmistake the form of this family dispute for its substance\nperhaps because there is none. And what is the benefit for\nthe Bosnian Government, which agreed to the peace plan?\nWill steps be taken to remedy the onerous military and\nhumanitarian imbalance? Will Serbia-Montenegro\nrecognize Bosnia within its current borders or agree to\ncooperate with the International Tribunal? The proper\ncourse of action, in the absence of any semblance of sanity\nand settlement, is to lift the arms embargo against the\nBosnian Government. What else?\nI would now like to address the question of Somalia.\nThe return to a functioning civil society in Somalia is, if\nanything, even more remote, as meaningful inter-faction\ntalks have ceased, security is evaporating, the dream of\nnational reconciliation fading and the United Nations\nOperations in Somalia (UNOSOM) focused on the process\nof withdrawing. The only certainty in Somalia is political\nuncertainty. As a neighbour that has observed and knows\nall too well Somalia\u2019s convulsive history, Djibouti can only\nbe distressed at the continuing problems and utter\nhopelessness.\nWhat is to be done? For too long the United Nations\nhas sought voluntary disarmament, conferences of national\nreconciliation, interim government and hopefully, in the\nend, a government elected by the people. Creating pressure\nfor this process is the looming departure of UNOSOM\nscheduled for 31 March 1995, when operations may be\nclosed down. Although we anticipate that the people will\nultimately have the final say through elections, at present it\nis the warlords and their factions that have been given a\ncomprehensive veto. On the assumption that they are the\npowers that be in Somalia, considerable time has been spent\nattempting to gain their agreement in the hope of eventually\nreaching the people through them. But clearly the faction\nleaders desire the political process to stop with them\nwithout flowing through to the people. So at their door\neverything stops, and the people are never given a say or an\ninput.\nThe obvious plan of the faction leaders is undoubtedly\nto induce the United Nations to believe conditions are\npropitious for withdrawal and then to settle scores among\nthemselves until someone is victorious. But in the process,\ncan we discount the possibility of a return to conditions of\nstarvation and famine, the kind of Somalia that existed prior\nto the arrival of the United Nations? What will be the\nimmediate and long-term consequences or implications of\nleaving Somalia in anarchy to the forlorn women, children\nand innocent population of Somalia and to its neighbours,\nwhich are already weighed down under an incessant flow\nof refugees? Will there be a Somali State in the end?\nPerhaps yes, perhaps no. It is hard, however, to preclude\na positive eventuality, however far-fetched that may seem\nat present.\nClearly, what is absent from the whole process is the\nvoice of the people in the selection of true, legitimate\nleadership and government to counter the present\nabdication of power to bands of gun-holders. We must\nfind ways of directly giving voice to the people, leading\nstraight to legitimate government. Solidifying these steps\nwould then be the job of ample United Nations forces on\nhand, drawing upon this Organization\u2019s experience in\nCambodia, Mozambique and elsewhere. Certainly, the\nthought of leaving Somalia with nothing in place and so\nmany lives at risk is both abhorrent and unacceptable, a\ncase where it will be interpreted that a \\\"failed State\\\" has\nbeen abandoned by the United Nations. Walking out of\na society in a mess before reconstituting it as a\nfunctioning entity will undeniably mark a precedent in the\nhistory of the United Nations and will certainly represent\na far cry from the hopes, promises and commitments\nenshrined in the Charter.\nAlthough I have briefly explored situations in a\nnumber of world trouble spots, the sad fact is that others\nappear to be gathering wind in their sails, ready to burst\nforth. Consequently, demands for expanded United\nNations involvement can be expected to rise, and the\nquestion that must again be asked, based upon recent\nexperiences is: Could the Organization cope? More and\nmore we see peace-keeping patterns of an ad hoc nature,\nstruggling under the lack of equipment, logistics,\nintelligence and manpower, poor coordination and\ncommunications. But the fault can hardly be laid at the\nfeet of the United Nations if its urgent requests for\nmaterial and human resources are not met or are met\nslowly or inadequately. With no force or equipment of\nits own, and therefore required to begin each operation\nfrom scratch, the resulting delays have severely hampered\ntimely United Nations reaction - leading, for example, to\ngenocide in Rwanda. And all this says nothing of the\ndifficulties stemming from ever-dwindling resources.\nSuch a state of affairs must be a cause for concern,\nas the United Nations will increasingly be forced to limit\nits responses to diplomatic initiatives, such as we have\nseen in Haiti. In place of classic peace-keeping, we will\nwitness a growing reliance upon ad hoc multinational\nintervention, the so-called posse response, but that too has\n27\n\n\nits limitations - for we are concerned with whether there is\nto be meaningful collective security. If United Nations\npeace-keeping withers, and in its place we are forced to\nrely on ad hoc interventions, then we need to ask under\nwhat basis that involvement will be forthcoming. In view\nof these developing trends, the United Nations may be\nforced to rely more upon simply letting conflicts run their\nnatural course, as in Somalia.\nWhat this situation amply demonstrates is that the\nUnited Nations needs a well-trained, mobile, standing force\nwith rapid deployment capability. Delayed deployment of\nundermanned and under-equipped units, as was the situation\nin Rwanda, fails to inspire confidence. The availability of\na rapid reaction force may at least address a good number\nof probable conflict situations, often serving as a deterrent\nsimply by virtue of being in a position to act quickly.\nIt is fashionable these days to say that we live in an\ninternational world, a \\\"global village\\\" in which nations can\nno longer avoid the effects of developments in their\nneighbours or the world. For Djibouti, this fact has a\nparticularly telling impact, for we have been forced to\ngrapple with the effects of years of past instability, warfare\nand massive national disintegration in the Horn of Africa,\nas in Somalia at present. From the financially debilitating\nincursion of heavily armed militia to the equally draining\ncost of demobilization that we face right now; to the flood\nof refugees, the care and cost of which has overwhelmed\nour infrastructure and health, educational and housing\nservices; to the crippling loss of vital markets, as in\nSomalia, for our services; coupled with the devastation\nbrought by the seemingly unending drought and pestilence,\nDjibouti has inevitably been slowly moving towards\nnegative growth and development in the last few years.\nYet, whatever the extent of our difficulties arising\nfrom these circumstances, Djibouti has steadfastly sought to\nremain a good-neighbourly State, contributing, to the extent\npermitted by our meagre resources, to regional stability and\npeace efforts.\nMoreover, recognizing the need to further involve the\npeople of Djibouti in the complex process of development\nand governance, we have an overhauled our political\nstructure and institutions.\nStill there remains a disturbing predicament facing\nDjibouti and other countries like it in the world, namely\nthat countries which are relatively stable, moderate and\ndemocratic and which are contributing, and participating in\ninternational efforts, to bring relief, reduce tensions, halt\naggression and conflict tend to be overlooked by the\ninternational community. Despite the drain on our\nmeagre resources because of refugees and market losses,\nand despite our continuing positive contributions to\nregional and international peace efforts, it seems that the\ngeneral calm and freedom prevailing in my country are\nlulling the world into believing that there are no really\npressing concerns or needs or for assistance. Too often,\nlittle attention too often is paid to a nation, it seems, until\nit is too desperate and near collapse, or until it is\nperceived by the international community as a source of\nnew danger to peace and security, thereby qualifying it\nfor aid and assistance. This makes little sense, and is\nindeed a mockery of the preventive measures that are\noften-mentioned but seldom instituted. We deserve better,\nbut we remain quite confident that both our efforts and\nour urgent needs for critical resources will be recognized\nby our friends and development partners.\nDjibouti, and all the countries of the Horn, have\nbeen subjected to the ravages of destructive natural\ncauses, well beyond our individual power to cope with\nthem. Such is the inexorable drift of the Sahara\nsouthward, or the severe drought conditions leading to\nfamine which now plagues the Horn. Overall, an\nestimated 20 million people are at risk in 10 countries,\nfacing farms that are parched, rivers that are dried up, and\npestilence. Anticipating possible mass starvation resulting\nfrom the lack of rain and water, food stocks were made\nready, only to be virtually depleted by a sudden\nemergency elsewhere, as in Rwanda. A pervasive air of\nhopelessness and apprehension now grips the nations of\nthe Horn, the urgency of which merits the immediate\nconcern and attention of the international community.\nAdding to the difficulties arising from natural causes,\nnations just as often face social forces over which they\nhave little control. Domestic macro-economic policies in\nmany industrialized countries, seeking to combat inflation\nor balance international payments, often have drastic\neffects on the demand for third-world products and on\ncommodity prices. The result, as one analyst explains, is\nfrequently declining terms of trade, sharply increased\ninterest rates, reduced exports, massive increases in\ncurrent account deficits, interest and debt-service\npayments, all at a time of reduced aid and other capital\nflows. External payment restraints, in particular, have\naffected levels of domestic production in both industrial\nand agricultural sectors, at times even production for\nexport, leading to inflation, acute financial crises and\nmounting debt.\n28\n\n\nMany third world countries simply lack the economic\ncapacity and flexibility to react in the short term. In the\nlong run, everyone benefits from greater coherence and\nefficiency in the international economic system. Clearly the\nworld\u2019s economic and financial system requires much more\norder, predictability, coordination and fairness.\nAlong these lines, I feel it is imperative to refer again\nto the issue of the restructuring and revitalization of the\nUnited Nations in the economic, social and related fields -\nin particular the relevant General Assembly resolutions\nbearing particularly on the vital field of operational\nactivities for development, and the General Assembly\u2019s\nimportant coordinating role. As the most truly\nrepresentative body of the world\u2019s people and States, the\nGeneral Assembly needs to return to its original role as\ncontemplated by the founding Member States and set forth\nin the Charter. It must provide a more decisive lead in\nstrategy and policy, in reviewing, in critiquing and\napproving the operation of the total system.\nLikewise, as opposed to the extreme decentralization\ncurrent in United Nations economic activities and\ninstitutions - each one a separate entity unto itself, often at\ncross purposes - we must also return to the original role\nforeseen in the Charter for the Economic and Social\nCouncil as an economic security council. The Economic\nand Social Council must remain open to receive and\naddress the concerns of Africa, which should not be\nhampered in its effective and beneficial participation in the\nCouncil and its subsidiary bodies. In this regard, we\nwelcomed the Secretary General\u2019s report \\\"An Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\" which provided the opportunity for a\ncomprehensive review of world economic and social\nproblems, particularly in Africa. Africa\u2019s development\nconcerns have been well documented in General Assembly\nresolution 48/214 on the United Nations New Agenda for\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, which we hope\ncan serve as a basis on which the international community\ncan act in solidarity in mobilizing new and additional\nresources to solve the pressing problems of the poor. For\nif we are to address constructively the questions of\neconomic growth and development, of the formulation of\ntruly beneficial international macro-economic systems, we\nneed to begin to take those confidence- building measures\nthat will bring the North and the South closer and\nstrengthen the concept of partnership.\nIn the area of collective security, there remains\nthe imperative need to expand the Security Council and to\nmake it more transparent and democratic through an\nincrease in its membership and by making it more\naccountable to the General Assembly. There should be\nperiodic reviews of the Council\u2019s structure and functions\nin line with international developments. A more equitable\ngeographical representation is critical, along with an\nincrease in permanent representation for developing\ncountries.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate\nMr. Essy on his election as President of this, the forty-\nninth, session of the General Assembly. The Estonian\npeople wish him all the best in this post.\nToday is a day of national mourning in my country.\nLate last night, amid stormy autumn winds, the passenger\nand car ferry Estonia, sailing from Tallinn to Stockholm,\nsank at high sea. Nearly 100 people have been saved, and\nrescue efforts are continuing. But most of the over 850\npeople who were aboard the Estonia are presumed to be\ndead. I should like to thank the President and all those who\nhave expressed their sorrow and sent condolences.\nIn this painful loss, we can draw some solace from\nthe global teamwork we have seen in the rescue efforts.\nLast night demonstrated beyond a doubt that the Baltic\nSea is a sea of cooperation. Swedish, Finnish, Danish\nand Estonian rescue units worked together, and we had\noffers of help from Russia, the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) and countless others. On behalf of\nmy Government, I thank all of those who helped us with\nthe rescue effort. The spirit of international cooperation\nsets a fine example for all of us here today.\nToday my country comes before this forum for the\nfirst time in half a century unfettered by the problem of\nthe presence of foreign troops on our soil. The role the\nUnited Nations played in helping to remove the last\nvestiges of the Second World War was not small. It is\ntherefore a special privilege for me to speak here today.\nIt is also not insignificant that this new era in the\nhistory of Estonia, Latvia and Germany coincides with the\nupcoming fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\nUnited Nations. These two events would seem to call for\nsolemn reflection on the past or at least a joyous\ncelebration of the moment. But most of all, this new era\nrequires new approaches. Post-war security - be the war\nhot or cold - still hangs in a delicate balance. Because it\nis up to all of us, collectively, to decide which way the\nscales tip, I wish to focus on the future, on how we in\nEstonia are approaching this new era, and on some of the\nideas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations that\nwe believe deserve special attention in the next few years.\nOn 31 August, we marked the withdrawal of troops.\nThe celebrations and commemorations of this event\nsymbolized the end of one era and the beginning of\nanother. The withdrawal of the troops has had a\ntremendous effect in bringing us closer to normalization\nof relations with the Russian Federation, and we sincerely\nhope that the problem of officers who were demobilized\non our territory against the spirit and the letter of the\ntroop-withdrawal treaty will be solved. The troop\nwithdrawal was also a major step towards achieving\nsecurity in the Baltic region. But the problem of Baltic\nsecurity has not yet been solved - far from it.\nOne dimension of moving towards bona fide security\nundoubtedly lies in trying to improve relations with the\nRussian Federation. The potential for good will is in the\nair, and it is our duty, on both sides of the 1920 Tartu\nPeace Treaty, to seize the moment and make that peace\nagain. We might call this policy towards Russia one of\npositive engagement. This would involve, among other\n24\n\n\nqualities, mutual respect for sovereignty, mutual respect for\nnational security interests, mutual refraining from verbal\nand other confrontation, and mutual respect for international\nnorms of behaviour, particularly in the area of human\nrights.\nWe are willing to expend considerable energy to repair\na relationship that has been historically so complex. To do\nso is not only in our own interest and in that of Russia, but\nin the interest of regional, European and therefore global\nsecurity as well. I would emphasize, however, that in order\nfor this policy to be successful, it must be mutual. If, on\nthe other hand, our efforts are not reciprocated, then we\nmust be prepared to expend our energy in different ways.\nLately, we have noted with great concern talk of\ncreating new spheres of influence. We hear continuing use\nof the phrase \\\"the near abroad\\\". We observe similar\nattitudes in discussions about the enlargement of the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union. We\nare already well past the initial stages of building a\nEuropean security structure. A viable framework, based on\nshared values, that includes Central and East European\nStates is nearly in place. It is not only late but unacceptable\nto ponder the plans of architects who speak of spheres of\ninfluence and to consult contractors who wish to build on\nsand or, worse, on a slippery slope.\nThere are some specific ways in which the United\nNations can take advantage of the historic opportunity it\nfaces to encourage principled behaviour. One of them is to\nrender peace-keeping more effective by strengthening\npeace-keeping mechanisms, including the dissemination of\nbetter and more timely information to all Member States in\norder to garner the support necessary for any collective\naction. Rather than abdicating responsibility, whether due\nto benign neglect, expediency or funding problems, and\nallowing large States to act unilaterally, it means holding all\nStates in all regions to the same standards. It goes without\nsaying that in lending its name to any peacekeeping\noperations, the United Nations must stand by the\nfundamental principles of neutrality and multilateralism.\nThe United Nations should never become a mask behind\nwhich one country tries to assert dominance over another\nby means of peace-keeping.\nLet me add that Estonia is actively developing its own\npeace-keeping force, to be put, perhaps next year, at the\ndisposal of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nAnother area in which more effective mechanisms and\nmore stringent standards are needed is that of human rights,\nas reflected in the Vienna Declaration and plan of action\nof last year. I would stress the importance of the newly\nestablished Office of the High Commissioner for Human\nRights taking on this task. We wish High Commissioner\nAyala Lasso success in this most important and\nchallenging endeavour.\nWe believe the High Commissioner can be\ninstrumental not only in improving the effectiveness of\nthe United Nations human rights mechanisms, but also in\nholding this body to strict standards. We believe that all\nStates should be measured according to the same human\nrights standards. I could not agree more with the\nobservation made by Russian Federation President Boris\nYeltsin two days ago in this forum that\n\\\"neither a selective approach nor double standards\nare permissible.\\\" (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings,\n5th meeting, p. 2)\nIndeed, exceptions cannot be made on the basis of the\nsize of a nation, its cultural heritage or the political\ndelicacy of the situation. The standards that are applied\nto one country must be valid for all others - in other\nwords, there should be no elastic rulers.\nIn this regard, allow me to remind the Assembly of\nan open letter - an appeal, really, to morality in foreign\npolicy - which was signed by a host of political\nluminaries and published in September of last year in The\nWall Street Journal. I quote from the letter, entitled\n\\\"What the West Must Do In Bosnia\\\":\n\\\"Even if, like Kuwait in August 1990, all\nBosnia (and not just Sarajevo) were seized, it would\nbe essential for the democracies to make clear, as\nthey did in the case of Kuwait, that violent border\nchanges and ethnic cleansing will not stand. If the\nWest does not make that clear, it will have nothing\npersuasive to say ...\\\".\nSadly, the message in that letter remains applicable\ntoday. If the world\u2019s democracies, led by the United\nNations, do not speak out for morality in the area of\nhuman rights, we will lose our ability to influence the\ncourse of events. Democracies must be willing to stand\nby the principles upon which our States and societies are\nbased. It is our sincere hope that non-selective\napplication of human rights standards will become the\nrule, not the exception.\n25\n\n\nA third way the United Nations can take advantage of\nthis moment is to consider the global changes that have\ntaken place since 1945. Then, in the immediate post-war\nperiod, the composition of the Security Council was\nestablished by drawing a sharp distinction between the\nvictors and the vanquished. Times have changed. We\nmust now take into account the positive role that some\nStates in particular play in the international arena. And I\nhave in mind here Germany and Japan, States that have\nmore than demonstrated their commitment to democracy\nduring the last 50 years. Estonia strongly supports granting\nGermany and Japan permanent-member status in the\nSecurity Council as a recognition of their accomplishments\nand an acknowledgement of their stabilizing role in world\naffairs.\nI would turn now briefly to Estonia\u2019s vision of its\nfuture role in the United Nations. Now that the issues\nwhich had hitherto demanded our intense attention have\nbeen more or less solved, we are freer to devote more\nenergy to wider issues that affect all of us. I am speaking\nhere of global phenomena such as terrorism, organized\ncrime, drug trafficking and smuggling of radioactive\nmaterials as well as health and social issues and\nenvironmental problems. These are issues that know no\nborders, and dealing with them requires a collective effort\non our part.\nOn this, the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, we face an enormous challenge. The war\n- I mean the Second World War - is finally over. But the\nreal battle - to safeguard human and civil rights for all\npersons, to strengthen security for all States, to preserve a\ncontinent undivided - this battle has only just begun. With\nintelligence, perseverance, goodwill, and a little luck, the\nnations gathered here can unite in the battle to make the\nnext 50 years more constructive than the last.\n"

You assumption of this important post brings pride\nand hope to Africa, which sees this session as a special\nopportunity for drawing the international community\u2019s\nattention to the economic and social problems it has been\nfacing in recent years.\nMy delegation assures you of its full cooperation and\nsupport, which we also offer to the other members of the\nBureau. To them also I address my congratulations. I also\nwish to pay tribute to your distinguished predecessor,\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, who so ably and in so\nmasterly a fashion presided over the Assembly at its forty-\neighth session.\nIn this new era in international relations the world\nfaces two contradictory situations: one, unforgettable\npictures of national reconciliation and faith in the future,\nthe other, a vision of the horror of peoples and nations\nripping each other apart, even to the extent of annihilating\none another. The international community keeps on\nswinging back and forth between pride and dejection and\nbetween great hope and deep despair.\nThe actual progress made in ways of handling and\nsettling certain disputes nevertheless strengthens our belief\nin the principles and covenants set forth in the Charter of\nour Organization. For example, we welcome the\nencouraging developments in Mozambique, which is now\nabout to hold its first multiparty elections. Similarly, the\nnegotiations in Lusaka between the Angolan Government\nand UNITA are beginning to bear fruit. Moreover, the\nclear efforts by those involved to smooth out the\ndifficulties of applying the settlement plan in Western\nSahara give us grounds for some optimism about the\noutcome of that dispute.\nMy delegation would also encourage those who are\ninvolved in the nuclear problem in the Korean peninsula\nto continue their talks with a view to arriving at a\nnegotiated solution, which would help to promote stability\nand peace in the region.\nWith the same end in mind, Madagascar hopes there\nwill be a peaceful settlement, on the basis of Security\nCouncil resolutions, of the problems between Kuwait and\nIraq, with a view to establishing a mutually beneficial\natmosphere of security and cooperation in the region.\nThe much-acclaimed return of a united, non-racial\nand democratic South Africa to the community of nations\nis one of the major events of the last decade of this\ncentury and a subject of enormous pride for us all.\nMadagascar welcomes the establishment of a non-racial\nregime in that great country and firmly believes that\nreorganizing South Africa on a democratic basis opens up\nnew prospects for cooperation and development\nthroughout the region.\nThanks to the political courage of the Israeli,\nPalestinian and Jordanian leaders, the Middle East has\nnow begun a process of historic reconciliation that\nseemed impossible just a short time ago. The Malagasy\nGovernment is following closely the ups and downs of\nthe implementation of the Declaration of Principles on\nInterim Self-Government Arrangements in Gaza and\nJericho signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization and the Agreement between Israel and\nJordan on the Common Agenda. The United Nations\nshould encourage all the parties to use the relevant\nresolutions with a view to establishing a comprehensive\nand lasting peace in the Middle East region.\nWith the disappearance of a world balance based on\nfear of a nuclear holocaust there came hope for a world\nfree from the scourge of war and favourable to the\nstrengthening of international cooperation. Unfortunately,\nrecent events in the international arena show that the new\ninternational order is indeed precarious.\n7\n\n\nToday we are seeing a reappearance of armed conflict\nin almost all parts of the world. Several countries are now\nplunged in fratricidal wars resulting in human tragedy and\npolitical chaos. Underlying these tragedies we see, inter\nalia, intolerance, xenophobia, the problem of minorities and,\nabove all, the absence of democratic practices in the\nsettlement of disputes. Somalia, Liberia, Rwanda and the\nformer Yugoslavia are tragic and dangerous situations\nwhich threaten not only the equilibrium of their regions but\nalso international peace and security.\nOther situations which are too often ignored could\ndegenerate into serious crises. The problem of borders in\ncentral and eastern Europe, the disturbing situation in the\nIndian subcontinent and the flow of refugees in Africa, Asia\nand even in Europe are all situations that show how fragile\ninternational security is.\nThe efforts on the part of the United Nations to\nresolve regional and subregional disputes must be supported\nby greater world-wide cooperation in disarmament. In this\nconnection my delegation attaches high priority to\ncontinuing initiatives and concerted actions by Member\nStates to put a stop to the uncontrolled movement of arms\nand to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nMy delegation hopes that the consensus at the last\nsession on multilateral negotiations on a comprehensive\nnuclear-test-ban treaty will lead to the conclusion of a\nuniversal treaty so as to improve the prospects for the 1995\nConference of parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons.\nBroadening the activities of the United Nations in\nregard to peace-keeping and in regard to full achievement\nof the development goals calls for greater effectiveness in\nthe United Nations machinery if the Organization is to live\nup to the expectations of the international community.\nAs for the role of the United Nations in the\nmaintenance and restoration of peace, recent experience\nclearly shows the need for reform with a view to\nstrengthening the United Nations capacity to prevent\nbreaches of the peace on the one hand, and on the other\nhand to carry out peace-keeping operations on the ground.\nLessons can be learned from the difficulties\nencountered in Somalia, the tragedy of Rwanda, and the\nsorry experience of the former Yugoslavia. Those United\nNations missions that were to some extent successful\nbenefitted from the following factors: broad support from\nthe international community; the consent of the parties to\nthe dispute; and non-violent and impartial intervention\nforces. A peace-keeping operation per se should be\naccompanied by diplomatic efforts and economic and\nsocial assistance and should also tackle the underlying\ncauses of the conflict. In any event, preventive\ndiplomacy is the best means of averting the eruption of\npotential conflicts.\nThe use of regional machinery for the settlement of\ndisputes would improve the conduct of peace-keeping\noperations and would, for example, avoid delay in\nmobilizing humanitarian assistance. After all, who is\nbetter placed than the States of a region to react to a\npotential threat there, particularly if the region already has\nan adequate structure for the prevention of conflicts?\nExamples of this are the system of collective security in\nEurope and the mechanism for the prevention,\nmanagement and settlement of disputes in Africa. Yet\nthis Organization should not just unload its problems on\nto regional mechanisms; rather, it should offert h o s e\nmechanisms the necessary support by providing a clear\nand precise mandate and by making adequate financial\nand logistic resources available.\nNever before have circumstances been so favourable\nfor realizing the aspiration of the majority of Members of\nthis Organization to an enlarged Security Council that\nprovides equitable representation. Many proposals\nconcerning this topic are now being discussed by the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s Open-Ended Working Group.\nMadagascar, which, as is demonstrated by its\nConstitution, is deeply committed to democratic\nprinciples, believes that the democracy that is advocated\nin many countries should apply in the international system\ntoo. Madagascar is open to any proposal that would not\ndamage the effectiveness of the Security Council. At the\nsame time, we emphasize the need for democratic\nrepresentation reflecting contemporary realities.\nThe Government of Madagascar does not\nunderestimate the special responsibility of States that are\npermanent members of the Security Council, especially in\nthe area of contributions to peace-keeping operations.\nHowever, any reform that is undertaken should win the\nsupport of all Member States so that they will have the\nnecessary trust in it and be able to participate effectively\nand on an equal footing.\nThe same principles apply to development problems,\nin that political stability at the national, regional and\ninternational levels determines whether development\n8\n\n\nobjectives can be met. There can be no peace without\ndevelopment, as can be seen in various parts of the world\nwhere serious conflicts and political troubles have been\ncaused by economic hardship. Against this backdrop, the\nimperative of the universality of peace and development\nforcefully tells us to take note of how the world economic\nsituation is developing.\nThe crisis that has affected the world economy for\nmore than a decade is worsening, despite a slow and fragile\nrecovery in some developed countries. This crisis continues\nto make a negative impact on the development process in\nthird-world countries: erratic fluctuations in rates of\nexchange, an increase in interest rates and an unprecedented\ndeterioration in the terms of trade - to mention only the\nmost notable effects of the past year.\nThe gap between North and South grows wider while\nthe inequalities between the regions become increasingly\nstriking. Poverty and extreme poverty are daily being\ningrained in the countries that are now referred to as the\nfourth world. The situation in Africa has become alarming.\nThe crisis there is magnified by the negative effects of\nnatural disasters and civil and ethnic wars.\nProblems such as the crushing weight of external debt,\nstagnation, if not a reduction, in official development\nassistance, financial and trade restraints and a continuing\ndrop in commodity prices are - today as yesterday -\nsymptoms of a crisis in development.\nAlongside this crisis, a serious change is taking place\nat the cost of developing countries, particularly poor\ncountries. In the present restructuring of the world\neconomy the interdependence that is preached has\ncontradictory effects. While the countries of the North\nenjoy protectionism in all its forms in their markets,\nliberalism is becoming a requirement for developing\ncountries. Equally, there is talk of the interdependence of\nproblems but sectoral approaches alone are still used.\nEconomies in the industrialized countries are becoming\nincreasingly integrated, while we note increasing\nmarginalization of the economies of the poor countries.\nWhile the industrialized countries increase their\nindependence in raw materials through the development of\nmicro-electronics, the developing countries are suffering the\nbacklash, and their already-fragile economic position is\nbeing weakened further. These are new challenges that we\nhave to take up in the international arena.\nFaced with these paradoxes and contradictions,\nwhich keep us deadlocked, and with economic stagnation\nin third-world countries, we have to ask how we can get\nout of this situation. It is clear that only by combining\nour efforts at all levels - national, regional and\ninternational - shall we be able to produce a lasting\nsolution.\nAs to the national level, I should like to cite the case\nof my own country. The Government of Madagascar has\nmade development the principal objective underlying its\nactivities at the national and international levels. Thus\ndiplomacy is put at the service of development and,\nwithout any ideological considerations, is focused on the\nestablishment of relations with all States on the basis of\nrespect for the great fundamental principles set forth in\nthe various international legal instruments.\nWhile continuing to implement its structural-\nadjustment programme, Madagascar has made important\npolitical changes in the shape of democratization,\ncharacterized by the blossoming of a multi-party approach\nand the creation of the conditions necessary to the\npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In\nshort, we are working towards the advent of a state of\nlaw that responds to the deeply felt aspirations of our\npeople.\nThis democratization of our political life is\naccompanied by economic reform based on liberalism\ndesigned to promote active participation by our people in\nthe development of the country. In this context, our\nGovernment is trying to create a climate of trust in our\ninstitutional framework, and we are trying to draw up\nclear rules for production and investment in order to\nguarantee the necessary political support at the national\nand international levels.\nThe Government of Madagascar would like to thank\nthe friendly countries and international institutions that\nhave understood the importance of the changes now under\nway and that intend to support them and to increase their\ncontributions to satisfy our most urgent needs and, in the\nlong term, help to strengthen our democratic process and\npromote real, self-sustaining development.\nWhen we use the term \\\"immediate needs,\\\" we are\nthinking of a set of relief mechanisms designed to deal\nwith the precarious situation of our principal social\nsectors because of the demands of the structural\nadjustment programme.\n9\n\n\nAs for the economic recovery and development\nprogramme, I should like to recall that the Government of\nthe Republic of Madagascar is prepared to conclude\nagreements with the Bretton Woods institutions. It is our\nardent hope that, above and beyond their current demands\nfor adjustments to achieve financial equilibrium and\nbalanced budgets, those institutions will take new measures\nto reorient that programme towards true recovery\naccompanied by an economic take-off and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nAt the regional level, developing countries have come\nup with guidelines and goals and have now buckled down\nto implementing them. In the case of Africa, I would recall\nthe Lagos Plan of Action and Final Act, the African\nAlternative Framework for Structural Adjustment\nProgrammes (AAF-SAP) and the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. Four\nyears after the launching of the new Programme of Action,\nwe have to say that the expected results have not yet been\nachieved and that Africa, one of the worlds least-developed\ncontinents, has not received the hoped for assistance and\naid from the rich countries. Because of their own efforts to\nimplement measures for rehabilitation and recovery, often\ninvolving considerable sacrifices, the African countries\ndeserve a more positive response from the international\ncommunity.\nIt is crucial to problems of debt, commodity\ndiversification and the provision of adequate financial\nresources if African States are to be assured not only the\nconditions required for true economic and social take-off,\nbut also the success of the structural and political reforms\nnow under way, free from social upheaval and the danger\nof a decline in security and stability.\nThe United Nations has an important role to play in\nfinding appropriate solutions to development problems.\nThe persistent nature of the problems we customarily evoke\nhere in the Assembly every year shows once again the\ninadequacy of the policies and measures adopted so far -\ndespite the adoption of several international instruments for\ncooperation, such as the Declaration of the eighteenth\nspecial session of the General Assembly, the International\nDevelopment Strategy for the Fourth United Nations\nDevelopment Decade, the Cartegena Commitment of the\neighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development (UNCTAD VIII), the Rio Declaration on\nEnvironment and Development and Agenda 21.\nThe problems we are facing can no longer be dealt\nwith adequately on an ad hoc basis or constantly subjected\nto adjustment measures. What is required is structural\nreform of the international economic system, which,\ndespite profound changes, is still unjust and perpetuates\nrelations of dependency. In other words, it is very\nimportant to define new strategies and agree on new\nparameters and mechanisms that can reverse the inequities\nin international economic relations today.\nThis is a task for the United Nations, which, because\nof its universality and its democratic principles, remains\nthe only forum that can tackle these problems with an\nintegrated approach, taking into account the political\nimplications of decisions made by those principally\ninvolved in development, including financial, monetary\nand international trade institutions.\nThe Agenda for Development, the indispensable\ncorollary to the Agenda for Peace, launched two years\nago by the Secretary-General, should give to the\ninternational community new guidelines as it seeks to\nattain development objectives. The elaboration of that\nAgenda should be given special attention.\nThe Agenda\u2019s first objectives should be to eliminate\npoverty, meet peoples\u2019 basic needs and improve their\nstandard of living. It should seek to promote effective\nimplementation of existing commitments and agreements\nand take into account the goals of forthcoming\ninternational conferences in the field of economic and\nsocial development. Instead of talking about requirements\nor conditions, it should set forth practical and realistic\nways of meeting the challenges with which we are faced.\nIn this connection, the attention of the international\ncommunity should be focused on questions of debt,\ndevelopment financing, commodities, international trade,\nenvironment and development.\nSupport for economic and technical cooperation\nbetween developing countries and the strengthening of\nregional and sub-regional integration initiatives should be\nan integral part of the new Agenda.\nExperience has shown the resumption of\ndevelopment through renewed international cooperation\ncannot succeed without the political will of States,\nespecially the rich ones. Although such cooperation\ndepends on many variables, and is affected by many\ndifferent circumstances, it can no longer disregard the\nprinciples of justice, equity and equal but differentiated\nparticipation.\n10\n\n\nAt this crucial moment in its history, the Organization\nmust learn from the past so that it can consolidate its\nachievements, meet today\u2019s challenges and develop a plan\nfor the future of the United Nations.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will be\nthe time for drawing up a balance sheet, for making the\nOrganization, the Member States and the people of the\nworld face up to their respective responsibilities. This\nhistoric moment will make clear the gap between hopes and\nreality, between commitments fulfilled and promises\nforgotten.\nEfforts to restructure the Organization and give it a\nsecond wind will be successful only if there is a true\nresolve to arrive at a world consensus for development, in\nall its aspects, as the foundation of peace and a source of\nhope for all mankind.\nFor its part, Madagascar is prepared to work with\npeace-loving and justice-loving States to build a better\nworld.\n"

Given your long association and\nintimate knowledge of the United Nations, we are sure\nyou will provide the necessary direction on the many\nimportant issues that we are about to take up during this\nsession.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to place on\nrecord our deep appreciation and gratitude to His\nExcellency Mr. Samuel Insanally for the excellent manner\nin which he conducted the proceedings of our last session.\nHis innovative and vigorous pursuit of discussions on the\nreform of the United Nations, the restructuring of the\nSecurity Council and the hearings on development have\nset the stage for the current discussions.\nWe should like to pay a tribute to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his distinguished\nleadership. We appreciate his tireless efforts to steer the\nUnited Nations in bold and new directions.\nWe had the opportunity to welcome President\nMandela and to hear his historic and enlightened address\nin this Hall. We welcome the end of apartheid and South\nAfrica's return to the family of nations.\nIn the Middle East, the transition of the Gaza Strip\nand Jericho to Palestinian self-government, the return of\nPresident Yasser Arafat and the signing of the\nWashington Declaration between Jordan and Israel clearly\ndemonstrate the increasing desire for peace in the region.\nWe applaud the parties for the brave decision to embark\n16\n\n\non the difficult path to peace. It is our hope that all parties\nwill join the process towards peace and reconciliation,\nbased on the relevant Security Council resolutions. It is our\nhope that the international community will support the\nPalestinian people in bringing about economic development\nin the self-rule areas.\nThe situation in the Gulf warrants our close attention.\nThe international community must reject any threat against\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. We urge\nall parties to abide by and fully implement the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions.\n\nThe problems in Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nHaiti and many other parts of the world still demand the\ncareful and urgent attention of the United Nations. These\nconflicts severely test the international community's\ncapacity and resolve to deal with humanitarian needs and\nconflict resolution.\nWe welcome the continued reduction of nuclear\nweapons and the turning-away of such weapons from their\nprevious targets. We support the extension of the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons beyond 1995 and\nthe proposal for the negotiation of a comprehensive test\nban. We urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nto continue negotiations in earnest and to comply with the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards\nagreement; thereby avoiding suspicion and doubt.\nMy delegation supports the proposal for both the\nreduction and the clearance of anti-personnel mines. The\nmanufacture of, trade in and deployment of such weapons,\nwhich cause indiscriminate and mindless death and\nmaiming, are unconscionable. We urge all parties to\nparticipate in the United Nations Register of Conventional\nArms. The scope of the exercise should be expanded to\ninclude not only trade but also manufacture and stockpiling.\nThe arms trade should cease to provide an opportunity for\nprofiteering on the part of any State.\nFor several years now we have been talking about\nrestructuring the United Nations. The discussions continue,\nbut, so far, little, if any, substantive reform has taken place.\nIn our humble view, reform of the United Nations must\nreflect the perceptions and expectations of all Members.\nFor many of the larger Member States, the United Nations\nis a forum in which to project and promote national\npolicies. But in the case of the developing countries \u2014 in\nparticular, the smaller Member States \u2014 the United\nNations guarantees independence and sovereignty and\nprovides an opportunity to participate in international\ndialogue. The United Nations also provides both the\nintellectual and the material input required for social and\neconomic development in many developing countries.\nIt is clear that the General Assembly \u2014 the only\nforum in which all Members of the United Nations are\nrepresented \u2014 must be the main focus of our attention.\nThe relationship between the General Assembly and other\nUnited Nations organs must be reviewed and put in\nproper perspective. The General Assembly itself must be\nable to appreciate and understand the work of the\nspecialized and other agencies of the United Nations and\nto provide direction. It must also organize itself in such\na way that it can deal more effectively with its business.\nRoutine and symbolic resolutions must be dealt with\nefficiently, allowing the Assembly to focus on new and\nmore important challenges.\nThe relationship between the General Assembly and\nthe Security Council is particularly intriguing. It is a\ncommon mistake to think that these two bodies function\nlike the legislature and the executive of a government.\nThis myth has been perpetuated by decades of Security\nCouncil paralysis and by the artificial prominence\nachieved by the General Assembly through the passing of\nineffective but symbolically important resolutions. The\nreality is that there is only one body of authority in the\nUnited Nations \u2014 the Security Council. The Council's\ndecisions are binding on all Members. They carry the\nsanction of international law. The Assembly is explicitly\nforbidden to interfere in the work of the Council unless\nrequested to do so.\nThe case for reform of the Security Council is\noverwhelming. The Council must be expanded to reflect\nthe new realities of international relations and to make it\na more representative body. It is also important that the\ndeeper structural flaw be redressed and the Council be\nmade more accountable.\nThe financial position of the United Nations\ncontinues to be a matter of concern. The sudden and\nquantum jump in expenditure on peace-keeping\noperations \u2014 now more than three times greater than\nexpenditure on development \u2014 is becoming difficult to\nsustain. There are large-scale arrears in contributions.\nWe do not object to peace-keeping operations, but it is\nclear that the finances of the United Nations must be put\non a sound footing. Financial expenditures reflect the\n17\n\n\ndirection and priorities of the United Nations, as well as the\ncommitment of its Members.\nThe Secretary-General, in his report entitled \u201cAn\nAgenda for Development\u201d, states:\n\u201cDevelopment is a fundamental human right.\nDevelopment is the most secure basis for peace.\u201d\n(A/48/935, para. 3)\nThese statements provide, in brief form, the best rationale\nfor recommitment to development in the post-cold-war era.\nLike peace, development is not a new issue before the\nUnited Nations; the United Nations and its agencies have\nbeen engaged in international development for decades.\nWhat is alarming today is that the gap between the\nstandards of living of developed and of developing\ncountries \u2014 the rich and the poor \u2014 is growing. The\nconcern arises not because the well-to-do are doing better\nbut because the poor are doing worse. It is no longer just\npoverty but the destitution of one fifth of the world's\npopulation that must be addressed.\nPoverty saps the human spirit. It replaces hope with\ndespair, creativity with dullness, admiration with envy, and\ncompassion with indifference. Poverty weakens the body,\nmaking it susceptible to sickness and disease. Poverty\nclouds the mind, making it difficult for people to\nunderstand the circumstances of their deprivation, and\ngenerating bitterness against those they perceive as the\ncause of their misery. What is unfortunate is that in this\nday and age, given the advances that mankind has made in\nscience and technology, commerce and industry and civil\nand social thought, poverty need not exist.\nConsiderable efforts have been made to put into proper\nperspective the major development issues of our time. The\nWorld Summit for Children, the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development, the Eighth United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD\nVIII), the World Conference on Human Rights and the\nrecently concluded International Conference on Population\nand Development not only generated a remarkable\nconvergence of views but also resulted in commitments to\nredress global concerns in the participants' respective areas.\nWe have no doubt that the international community will\napproach the World Summit for Social Development and\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in\n1995, with the same resolve and determination.\nWe have all committed ourselves to accepting the\nconclusions of the major conferences, including the various\nprogrammes of action and the prescribed targets. All\ncountries are working hard to translate the commitments\ninto action, but the resources available are insufficient for\neffective and lasting intervention. It is a matter of great\nconcern that, in fact, the resources made available for\ndevelopment are declining.\nThe future of global development clearly hinges on\nthe provision of additional resources \u2014 additional\nresources in the shape of increased official development\nassistance for both multilateral and bilateral programmes;\nadditional resources from international financial\ninstitutions; additional resources through direct foreign\ninvestment and trade; and additional resources generated\ninternally through the creation of financial markets and\nthe expansion of the revenue base.\nWhile there seem to be many avenues for increasing\nthe transfer of resources, the reality is that they have\nyielded little for most least-developed countries.\nInternational banking and investments are highly selective\nand, by their nature, will not be attracted to the least-\ndeveloped countries, many of which have a small\neconomy and a poor infrastructure. The creation of\ninternal financial markets and the expansion of revenue\nare hampered by the low level of savings and the limited\ncash flow in the economy. The capacity of the least-\ndeveloped countries to compete in international trade is\nalso limited. Clearly, without increased official\ndevelopment assistance many least-developed countries\nwill fall further behind \u2014 and their situation is already\nprecarious.\nIt is ironic that resources for international\ndevelopment should decline when the United Nations\nagencies are embarking on a major thrust for poverty\nalleviation and sustainable human development. We urge\nthe donor community to continue supporting the United\nNations funding agencies. Although the trend towards\nbilateral cooperation is understandable, the donor\ncommunity should draw on the advantages of working\nthrough the United Nations agencies, given their long\nexperience and commendable performance in many areas.\nThese agencies must regain the confidence of the donor\ncommunity through greater efficiency and better\ncoordination.\nCredit is an essential form of input in any major\ndevelopment effort. The crushing debt burden of many\ndeveloping countries and the manner in which future\ncredit requirements will have to be met must be clearly\ndealt with in our dialogue on development. Our\n18\n\n\ndiscussions must include the role of the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, which must be made to work in harmony with\nthe efforts of United Nations agencies.\nBhutan long ago accepted that development must be\nparticipatory and environmentally sustainable. To this end\nBhutan has committed itself to maintaining 60 per cent of\nits land mass under forest cover, including 20 per cent as\nnational parks. All development activities have been built\naround this approach. We have been fortunate to receive\nthe generous assistance of, among others, India,\nSwitzerland, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria,\nNorway, Kuwait, Germany, Australia and the United\nKingdom. Considerable support has also been made\navailable from the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF),\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United\nNations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),\nthe World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations\nVolunteers (UNV), the Food and Agriculture Organization\n(FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World\nBank and the Asian Bank. We have never taken the\ninvolvement of any of our development partners for\ngranted, and we take this opportunity to express the sincere\ngratitude of the people and the Government of Bhutan to all\nof them.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is a time\nfor celebration. There is much that the United Nations has\nachieved for which we should all be proud. Yet it is also\na time for reflection and self-assessment. The success of\nthe next 50 years of the United Nations will depend largely\non our ability to meet the challenges of global human\ndevelopment.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to your\nhigh office.\nAs the United Nations approaches its fiftieth\nanniversary, its global agenda is more comprehensive than\never before. Norway welcomes this. We need and\nsupport an even stronger United Nations role in the\npeaceful settlement of disputes; preventive diplomacy and\npeace-keeping; the advocacy of human rights, including\nwomen\u2019s rights; and humanitarian aid, sustainable\ndevelopment and environmental protection. We wish to\nsee this forty-ninth session of the General Assembly make\ntangible contributions towards improving the\nOrganization\u2019s performance in all these important areas.\nAs we assemble this year, we can look back on\nconcrete results in several areas following years of strong\nUnited Nations involvement. In particular, it is with deep\nsatisfaction that we now welcome the newly elected\nGovernment of South Africa to this year\u2019s session of the\nGeneral Assembly. This is a historic moment, both for\nSouth Africa and for the United Nations. I would like to\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to the South African\npeople. They have put a painful past behind them and\nhave charted a new course.\nWithout the strong support of the United Nations,\nthe democratization process in South Africa would\nundoubtedly have been slower. Norway\u2019s political and\neconomic support for the democratic forces dates back to\nthe 1960s and 1970s. We will continue to support the\nSouth African people by working with the democratically\nelected Government. A democratic, prosperous South\nAfrica will have a positive impact on the whole African\ncontinent. Common security and cooperation can now\nreplace front lines and confrontation. We hope that South\nAfrica will be in a position to contribute substantially to\nconflict-resolution and peace-keeping.\n16\n\n\nThe historic developments in South Africa have been\nparalleled in the peace process in the Middle East. Two\nweeks ago we observed the anniversary of the signing by\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) of\nthe Declaration of Principles, following talks in Oslo.\nDuring the past year the peace process has been further\nconsolidated. It was a source of great satisfaction to us\nthat, one year to the day after the signing, and once again\nin Oslo, the parties were able to iron out certain differences\nwhich had been obstructing the peace process. I would like\nto compliment both Israel and the PLO on their\ndetermination to follow through on the commitments they\nhave made.\nHowever, the commitment of the parties alone is not\nenough. The international community must shoulder its\nresponsibilities, and I appeal urgently to Member States for\ncontributions, especially to meet the short-term needs of the\nPalestinian Authority. In our capacity as Chair of the Ad\nHoc Liaison Committee, we shall continue to work both\nwith donor countries and with the parties themselves to\nensure that the peace dividend benefits Palestinians in their\ndaily lives.\nIn our view, the United Nations should take on new\nresponsibilities with respect to channelling economic\nassistance to the Palestinians, especially to the Palestinian\npolice force. The General Assembly must also address the\nnew relationship that has developed between Israel and the\nPalestinians. Our deliberations and decisions on Middle\nEast matters must reflect the new reality created by the\nparties themselves.\nIn Guatemala the peace process has now reached a\nturning point. The very active and constructive role played\nby the United Nations has led to significant advances at the\nnegotiating table this year. Norway, as a member of the\nGroup of Friends, would like to commend the Government\nof Guatemala, the URNG and the Guatemalan people on\nthe important agreements signed in Puebla and in Oslo.\nWe now urge the parties to keep up the momentum of the\nnegotiating process. Norway will contribute to the human\nrights verification Mission to Guatemala. It is our hope\nthat this Mission will encourage the parties to resume the\npeace negotiations without further delay.\nIn the former Yugoslavia the tragedy continues. Yet\nanother chapter in the endless human suffering caused by\nthe war is unfolding. Thousands of Muslims are being\nforced to leave their homes in Serb-held territory in\nnorth-eastern Bosnia, adding to the countless numbers from\nall groups that have been displaced during this conflict.\nReports tell us of detention, rape and plunder. We appeal\nto the parties to the conflict to stop this senseless\nbrutality, and we welcome last week\u2019s Security Council\nresolution which strongly condemns this practice. While\nwe continue to press for a political settlement, we must\nkeep up the humanitarian relief efforts for the victims of\nthis meaningless conflict.\nA lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be\nachieved only by political means, not by military force.\nThe Contact Group\u2019s proposal has our full support,and the\nBosnian Serbs must be persuaded to accept this package\ndeal. The decision made by the authorities of the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to sever\nall political and economic ties with the Bosnian Serbs is\na step in the right direction. We welcome the initiative\ntaken by the co-chairmen, Lord Owen and Thorvald\nStoltenberg, to deploy an international mission on the\nborder between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n(Serbia and Montenegro) and the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Norway has already contributed personnel\nand is also involved in the logistics of this operation.\nSecurity Council resolution 943 (1994) of 23 September\n1994 on sanctions demonstrates, therefore, the resolve of\nthe international community to press for a political\nsettlement.\nAs we press for negotiated solutions both in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina and in Croatia, it is also incumbent on\nthe outside world to do nothing that can prolong the\nconflict or cause it to escalate. The flow of arms into the\nformer Yugoslavia must be halted. The arms embargo\nmust not be lifted now, for this could have unforeseeable\nconsequences and would certainly endanger the\nUNPROFOR troops and jeopardize humanitarian relief\nefforts.\nPeace-keeping activities constitute the most\nimportant tool at the disposal of the United Nations for\nresolving conflicts and promoting peace. Norway\nadvocates strengthening such functions. As Member\nStates, we must be willing to enable the United Nations\nto do in the field what we profess to support in the\nconference rooms. Nearly 1 per cent of the entire\nNorwegian population has participated in peace-keeping\noperations.\nIt is important that the Organization\u2019s capability of\nconducting peace-keeping operations be continuously\nenhanced. At last year\u2019s session of the General\nAssembly, the Nordic countries presented an initiative to\nstrengthen United Nations command and control\n17\n\n\ncapabilities in peace-keeping operations. I feel encouraged\nby the progress made on various related issues during the\nlast 12 months. However, there is room for further\nimprovement. These matters should be treated with some\nurgency.\nProper communication between the Security Council\nand the troop-contributing countries is particularly\nimportant. While we acknowledge the improvements\nalready made in this respect, we still feel that further\nprogress is needed. I propose that regular consultations and\ninformation-sharing be instituted between members of the\nSecurity Council, the troop-contributing countries and the\nSecretariat of the United Nations.\nA new role for regional organizations in conflict\nresolution and securing peace is emerging, not only in\nEurope but also in other parts of the world. In Europe the\nEuropean Union is playing an increasingly important role\nas it develops its political and economic contacts in an\nall-European context. Nothing could be more worthwhile\nthan transforming Europe, the cradle of two world wars,\ninto a continent with a solid framework of political,\neconomic, social and cultural cooperation across the old\ndivides. Hence, the European Union is shaping the future\nof Europe in a significant manner - and is indeed also\nmaking important contributions in a global perspective.\nThese are two major reasons why Norway is seeking\nmembership in the European Union.\nRegional organizations should take on more\nresponsibility for peace-keeping in the future. Nevertheless,\nwe must not confuse the growing need for regional action\nwith the fundamental role of the Security Council as the\nmain guardian of international peace and security.\nNowhere have peace and security been more\nsystematically set aside during the last year than in Africa.\nThe genocide we have witnessed in Rwanda has shocked\nthe entire world, and has brutally reminded us of the\nhorrifying behaviour such conflicts may generate. We are\ndeeply committed to the principle that those charged with\ncrimes against humanity must be brought to trial.\nMore than ever, Africa needs our support to overcome\nthe prevailing crises. I welcome the increasingly important\nrole played by the Organization of African Unity. Norway\nstands ready to support regional processes to encourage\ncloser cooperation among African nations with a view to\naccelerating economic growth and democratization.\nSocial and economic problems are closely linked to\nconflict and unrest. A global perspective is needed if\nsolutions are to be found and progress made. No other\norganization has the potential of the United Nations to\nprovide such a perspective. Development-related\neconomic and social issues must remain high on the\nUnited Nations agenda. I therefore welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s preliminary report on an Agenda for\nDevelopment. The five dimensions of development\nsingled out in the report provide a useful framework for\nthought as well as action. Peace, economic growth, the\nenvironment, justice and democracy are indeed the key\nparameters in our common drive towards a better world\nfor all.\nWe are now looking forward to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s supplementary report, which we hope will\ninitiate a debate on the appropriate role of the United\nNations in global efforts for development, based on the\ncomparative advantages of the Organization.\nThe International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment in Cairo will be looked upon as a turning\npoint in the history of population policy as it relates to\nsocial development and women\u2019s rights. The conclusions\nwill have a wide-ranging impact on democracy-building,\neducational policies, health-care programmes and the\nstatus of women. Both that Conference and next year\u2019s\nWorld Summit for Social Development and the Fourth\nWorld Conference on the Status of Women represent\nmilestones in the effort to renew our commitment to\nfulfilling basic human needs.\nAt the United Nations Conference on Environment\nand Development in 1992, we pledged to commit\nourselves to fulfilling the challenges of Agenda 21.\nThese include strengthening efforts to change present\nunsustainable patterns of consumption and production,\nparticularly in the industrialized world. I should like to\nemphasize the importance of this issue. Norway will\ncontinue to promote the efforts of the Commission on\nSustainable Development in this respect.\nOver the years, the United Nations has taken on an\nincreasingly important role in the field of human rights.\nFor us, this remains a high-priority issue. The close link\nbetween democracy, human rights and development has\nbeen brought home to us once again by the tragedy of\nHaiti. Norway fully supports Security Council resolution\n940 (1994) and will contribute to restoring democracy and\nhuman rights in the troubled country of Haiti.\n18\n\n\nThe establishment of the post of High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights was warmly welcomed by the Norwegian\nGovernment. All countries must now cooperate fully with\nthe new High Commissioner. Regrettably, the past year has\nonce again seen unacceptable violations of human rights in\nmany countries, resulting in untold human suffering. We\nurge all States to ensure that minimum standards for the\nprotection of basic human rights are observed at all times,\neven during internal conflicts and disturbances.\nFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right.\nMy Government remains deeply concerned by the continued\nthreat voiced against Salman Rushdie and all those\nassociated with his works. We repeat our call to the\nIranian authorities to remove this extra-territorial and\nintolerable threat.\nFor years disarmament and arms control have been\ncentral to our deliberations. Today we are facing new\nchallenges in this field. The need for a comprehensive ban\non all nuclear testing is indeed a top priority issue. We\nexpect all nuclear Powers to refrain from testing during the\nongoing negotiations. Substantial results should be\nachieved before the 1995 Non-Proliferation Treaty\nConference. This would facilitate the indefinite and\nunconditional extension of the Treaty, which is another item\nof the utmost importance on our arms control agenda.\nThe increased risk of proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, of nuclear and chemical material, associated\ntechnology and means of delivery is a major security\nchallenge that we must take steps to eliminate. The recent\nattempts to conduct an illegal trade in nuclear material are\nalarming and demand immediate action.\nIncreasingly, our security is threatened by the\nenormous deposits of nuclear waste on land and at sea. We\nmust do everything within our power to counter this risk.\nThe Nordic countries and Russia are planning an\ninternational conference on nuclear waste management, in\ncooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA). In order to deal with these problems, substantial\nfinancial and technological resources will be required. To\nthis end, Norway has proposed the establishment of an\ninternational action plan for nuclear waste management,\nmatched by an international fund similar to the nuclear\nsafety account in the European Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment. We call upon the international community\nto mobilize the resources necessary to deal effectively with\nthese problems.\nBefore concluding, I would like to draw attention to\na matter of great concern to Norway: the necessity to\nensure a rational, responsible exploitation of marine\nresources. This should indeed be a matter of importance\nto all countries, whether they are coastal States or\nlandlocked. Norway is deeply concerned by the\nincreasing problem of excessive exploitation of straddling\nand highly migratory fish stocks through unregulated\nfishing on the high seas. The effectiveness of\nconservation measures is thus being eroded, and the\nrecovery of stocks is being halted or even reversed by\nStates claiming free access to such stocks. The situation\ncalls for urgent and effective legally-binding measures to\ncounter the threat to important fish stocks and the coastal\ncommunities directly dependent on them. Therefore, the\noutcome of the United Nations Conference on Straddling\nFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks will be\ncrucial in this respect. All of us, coastal and fishing\nStates alike, share the responsibility for ensuring that the\nConference succeeds in establishing a solid foundation for\nthe long-term conservation and sustainable use of these\nfish stocks.\nIn closing, I would like to emphasize the\nfundamental importance of a sound financial basis for the\nUnited Nations to perform its work. It is incumbent on\nall of us to do what we can in this respect. As we\napproach next year\u2019s anniversary, we owe it to the\nfounders to ensure that the Organization they created -\nour most important custodian of international peace and\nglobal security - is in the possession of the necessary\nmeans to discharge all its obligations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to convey to you, Mr. President, the text of the letter I have been charged by President Zein El Abidine Ben Ali, President of the Republic of Tunisia and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity to read to the General Assembly on his behalf. The President would have liked to deliver this speech himself, but for reasons beyond his control he is unable to do so. I shall therefore read his speech to the Assembly.\n\\\"I have the pleasure, first of all, to extend to you, Mr. President, my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Your election does honour both to the entire African continent and to our sister country, Cote d'lvoire, and is also a well-deserved tribute to your excellent reputation. We are confident that your vast experience and outstanding qualities will be the best guarantee of the success of the work of the session.\n\t(Cote d'lvoire)\n\\\"It is also a pleasure for me to reiterate my warmest congratulations to your august Assembly and to assure you of the great importance that Tunisia attaches to the laudable and sometimes exhausting efforts which the United Nations continues to deploy in the service of peace and in laying the foundations of constructive dialogue between nations.\n\\\"Tunisia, which has opted for dialogue as a means of conducting both its domestic and its foreign policies, can only support this approach, contribute to its consolidation and entrenchment.\n\\\"The innumerable peace initiatives undertaken by the United Nations are distinguished by their civilizing character, as well as by their highly humanistic orientation. The fact is that civilization cannot coexist with war, just as peace cannot exist without dialogue. There is no doubt that our United Nations system possesses, in addition to the tool of dialogue, the means whereby it is able to deal with problems that threaten peace and security in our contemporary world.\n\\\"Given the magnitude of the responsibility devolving on us all, given the accumulation of world problems in the areas of security and of the economy in particular, with all the attendant risks that arise there from, we are of the opinion that international solidarity requires all members of the international community to be more committed and\u2003to make further contributions to the search for effective solutions to such problems within the framework of the prevailing tenets of universalism and globalism.\n\\\"Five years ago, from this very rostrum, I described to your august Assembly the radical reforms which we had then undertaken to put in place in Tunisia with determination and perseverance, in the wake of the constitutional change of 7 November 1987, as we faced up to the new challenges resulting from the great changes which were confronting us within the international community.\n\\\"From the outset, we had opted, as a basic choice, for promoting the participation of our citizens and for the harnessing of their full potential in building their own future, in the conviction that such is the very essence of democracy, and its real meaning.\n\\\"Since modernization of political structures can never yield the desired results if not accompanied by a reform process covering the social and economic sectors, we promulgated laws and put in place structures which we deemed capable of liberalizing the economy and encouraging private initiative in all sectors of production. In addition, we readjusted the fiscal system and improved the functioning of the banking and financial system in order to align them with this trend. As a culmination of this process, we enacted a unified investment law and reorganized and streamlined the functioning of the administrative channels.\n\\\"At the same time, we devoted special attention to developing and strengthening our human potential in various areas, in particular through reforming our system of education and improving professional training. We also strengthened the cultural sector; consolidated the plan for the struggle against illiteracy and for the advancement of women, with a view to strengthening their rights and preserving their dignity by making them partners with full rights and duties in the work of development.\n\\\"We also attach great importance to the protection of children and of the family. In the social domain, we adopted dialogue and negotiation as the basis for relationships between the forces of production. We have also made efforts to preserve the gains of workers, to promote good working conditions, to expand social welfare coverage and to protect health and safety in the workplace while trying to increase job opportunities. At the same time, we have revitalized the values of social mutual assistance and national solidarity in order to render assistance to the disadvantaged, to help develop the outlaying areas of the country, to integrate them in the framework of the national economy and, thereby, to raise the standards of living of their inhabitants.\n\\\"The year 1994 has been a particularly momentous one for Tunisia. For the first time, a multi-party parliament has been elected. We had the honour of hosting the thirtieth summit of the Organization of African Unity and of welcoming President Nelson Mandela, hero of the struggle against racial discrimination and first President of the free Republic of South Africa, and a living symbol of Africa's wisdom in its most lofty sense.\n\\\"In the same year, we said farewell to President Yasser Arafat, who returned to his homeland after having lived with us for 12 years, a respected and honoured guest, as the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, now that the Palestinian people are beginning to recover their inalienable and legitimate national rights after a heroic struggle which lasted for half a century. We should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our deep satisfaction at the positive and promising steps that have been taken in the context of the Middle East peace process, and voice our determination to continue to contribute to the efforts aimed at achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n\\\"We have also spared no effort in strengthening further our close ties with our neighbours within the framework of the Arab Maghreb, as well as with the Arab, Muslim and African countries, the non-aligned countries and all friendly countries in Europe, Asia and America, with which we share mutual interests and have ties of fruitful cooperation. We have never hesitated to support those causes which were right and just, such as that of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and have responded positively, in so far as we were able, to the appeals and initiatives of the United Nations in the field of peace-keeping in several parts of the world.\n\\\"All these choices, efforts and achievements entitle us to reaffirm that today, Tunisia is able to meet the challenge of change which it had the courage to take up well before the advent of the global changes which we have been witnessing since the end of the last decade. Tunisia, the land of openness, tolerance and moderation, inspired as it is by its rich legacy of civilization and dedicated to its convictions and its guiding principles, will spare no effort in continuing to make its constructive contribution to international efforts, particularly within the framework of the United Nations, in order to strengthen sustainable development and peace throughout the world in the interest of all mankind. It goes without saying that our mandate at the head of the Organization of African Unity affords us a valuable opportunity to work further in mobilizing the international community and in focusing heightened attention on the concerns of the African continent, whose countries represent nearly a third of the Member States of the United Nations.\n\\\"Today, the African scene especially as projected by the audio-visual mass media, confronts us with highly contradictory images. Thus, while taking note with satisfaction and optimism of the reconciliation and harmony that we now see among the various elements of society in South Africa, which in the past were torn asunder by the odious system of apartheid, we feel despair and sadness at the persistent conflicts and hotbeds of tension in other parts of the continent. However, it would be neither fair nor objective to limit ourselves to a negative assessment of such events without attempting to shed light on them and to identify their causes in order to be able, with wisdom and concern, to remedy them and to contain their effects.\n\\\"In order to resolve the fundamental problems of Africa, we need to identify the ideal path and the most effective means of helping the continent gain control over the course of events and changes that are taking place on its soil. We have to do this not only for the sake of Africa but also in the interest of the international community as a whole. We should always keep in mind the imperative need to deal specifically with the fundamental issue which confronts so many African countries, namely, the achievement of political reform and the modernization of the economy, as corollaries of global development, under conditions of security and stability.\n\\\"There can be no doubt that in the area of political reform, the African continent has taken concrete and promising steps; but not as many as it would have liked, nor at the rate it would have desired. The African States more than anyone else, are well aware of that.\n\\\"On the other hand, as the efforts of the donor countries have fallen short of expectations, those countries should review their stance with regard to the development process in Africa in the light of the new realities and the changes that have taken place, which require the international community to redouble its efforts to participate effectively in the development of the continent.\n\\\"Africa is fully aware that the responsibility for its development is, in the first instance, its own. This is an awareness that has been confirmed by the African leaders, at their Summit in Tunis this year, when they stated that it is the duty of the Africans themselves to face up to the challenges that the present course of events confronts them with and to undertake firmly and in earnest the necessary economic reform and the rational development of human and material resources.\n\\\"At their thirtieth Summit, held in Tunis, the African leaders voiced an unshakeable will to live in peace and to mobilize their potential in the service of global and sustainable development, in order to be able to ensure a decent life for their fellow-citizens, free them from all forms of domination and hegemony and guarantee their ability to exercise their right freely to choose the model of society most in keeping with their traditions and the specific cultures. Experience has shown the gravity of the error of trying to carbon copy systems of power and of administration and impose them on peoples of other continents. The tragic consequences of such efforts are very much in evidence.\n\\\"Nevertheless, we look to the future with optimism, for today most countries of the African continent, with a heightened sense of responsibility and commitment, are trying to rid themselves once and for all of the legacies of the past. This necessary and legitimate endeavour can be made concrete only through consecration of the values of democracy, freedom and justice - those higher values to which mankind in Africa has always adhered spontaneously and enthusiastically.\n\\\"During the Cairo Summit the African States were able to establish machinery for the prevention, management and settlement of conflicts. This decision was reaffirmed at the Tunis Summit. The African machinery has already begun to operate and has made a start on the implementation of the resolutions of the Tunis Summit and is tackling numerous remaining problems and crises in Africa - such as those of Rwanda, Burundi, Angola and Somalia - with a view to assisting in their settlement.\n\\\"In this context, we have spared no effort, as acting President of the Organization of African Unity, in cooperation and in coordination with African leaders, to increase emergency assistance to Rwanda. It is indisputable that the tragic situation prevailing in Rwanda requires the participation of everyone of goodwill, including the international community, and the mobilization of all efforts to heal the wounds of the brotherly people of Rwanda and to help them recover their security and stability, in harmony and fraternity.\n\\\"In implementing Security Council resolution 918 (1994), the African States have not hesitated to demonstrate their readiness to send troops to Rwanda within the framework of the second stage of the United Nations Mission (UNAMIR II) with a view to the re-establishment of security in this brotherly country, in accordance with the decisions of the Arusha Summit.\n\\\"We would have hoped, however, that material and logistical support for the African States involved had not been delayed. It was this delay that prevented the deployment of troops in Rwanda at a time when their presence was essential to and would have been a decisive factor in establishing peace and security in this brotherly country and in the region and in bringing about the desired national reconciliation that would have made possible the return of thousands of refugees, and thus would have mitigated the effects of this tragedy in line with the Arusha process.\n\\\"In this respect, I should like to emphasize that the establishment of the machinery for the prevention, management and settlement of conflicts reflects Africa's political will to give concrete expression to preventive diplomacy. However, the existence of such will is not enough by itself, when it comes to taking on such a role. Hence the major responsibility devolving on the United Nations to assist the machinery, by providing the funds for peace deriving from the Organization, as well as necessary means for the success of such intervention.\n\\\"At the Tunis Summit, the African countries adopted a code of honour and conduct designed to govern relations between the States of the continent and that aims at promoting the struggle against all forms of extremism, fanaticism and terrorism which are among the most important issues before the United Nations and the international community.\n\\\"In this respect, one of the object lessons to be learnt from the events in Rwanda is that it is imperative that the review of the United Nations Security Council's methods of work be expedited and that the necessary measures to deal with the problem of procrastination that has been noted in the implementation of United Nations resolutions be taken with the speed and diligence required in dealing with international crisis situations so that United Nations intervention may be effective and timely. Failing this, the role of preventive diplomacy will have to be strengthened and Africa will have to be provided with the opportunity to contribute to its strengthening realistically in order to avoid any recurrence of the tragedies we have witnessed, such as those of Rwanda, Burundi and Somalia.\n\\\"Joint African action in the economic sphere has continued since the African Economic Community was set up at the Abuja Summit in 1991. The aim is to initiate a strategy that would make possible the achievement of the complementarity and economic integration of the African States. Those States are required to achieve a greater degree of coordination and cooperation amongst themselves in order for them to be able to cope with the new developments in world markets especially after the establishment of the World Trade Organization. They have to explore prospects for the future so that Africa may be assured of a better position in international trade, which is witnessing a diminution of the share of the least developed countries.\n\\\"Clearly, the efforts that Africa is currently making to solve the problems of the present and to secure the future deserve the support and assistance of the international community. I have called upon the leaders of the seven richest countries, when they met recently in Naples, to become involved in the concerns of the African continent and to respond to its desire for a review of the level and content of its cooperation with the international community within the framework of a global strategy of North-South cooperation based on partnership and mutual development for peace and progress.\n\\\"While noting with satisfaction and being gratified at the success of numerous countries of America and of Asia with regard to settling the debt problem and increasing the rate of economic growth, we note with regret that the burden of external debt still constitutes the major obstacle to development efforts in Africa, as it has a highly negative impact on programmes of economic and social reform and on foreign investment.\n\\\"In addition, it is important to note that the increasing level of African indebtedness arises essentially from the cost of debt servicing, which is doubling year by year and which, along with the deterioration in the terms of trade, is a principal factor inhibiting the African countries' development efforts.\n\\\"We believe that stability, security and development are a collective responsibility and a common aspiration. The rich countries are called upon to take account of this in their policies; to make their public opinion sensitive to the importance of economic assistance for the developing countries; to make provision for a reduction in the staggering imbalances between peoples; and to highlight the positive consequences of such an approach, in the medium and in the long term, for the donor countries themselves through the opening up of markets, profitable investments and the limiting of emigration and of the problems resulting there from - the most appropriate means of translating preventive diplomacy into concrete action in dealing with all types of crises.\n\\\"It was in the context of these mutual interests that we suggested several years ago to the industrialized countries the formulation of a comprehensive strategy for development in Africa that would allow the States of the continent clearly to define their economic plans on the basis of continuous support by the countries and institutions that back them financially.\n\\\"Starting with 1989, I have proposed a number of initiatives at several international forums, including this General Assembly, the G-7 summits at Toronto and Naples, the European Union summit in Strasbourg, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and the Vienna Conference. All those initiatives related to such issues as human rights, the environment, the concretization of North-South cooperation through the conclusion of development partnership contracts between the developing countries and the industrialized countries and the recycling of debts. The ultimate aim was the codification of trade and political relations on the international level.\n\\\"All of those proposed initiatives have now taken shape. Some of them are being implemented, while others are still being studied by regional and international groupings.\n\\\"Today, the world witnesses new phenomena, which have an ever-greater impact on the international arena and which are primarily characterized by universality and comprehensiveness. We are therefore all the more convinced of the timeliness of our initiatives and of the need to carry on and complete their implementation.\n\\\"The organic interdependence of the present and future interests of States has now become a concrete reality. The same is true of the relationships amongst peoples in all their various aspects, which are subject to the functioning of the machineries of multilateral cooperation that manage the complex relations of States on the external and the domestic levels.\n\\\"It is in this context that the various forthcoming international events will take place, namely, the United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, which will be held in Tunis; the International Symposium on Organized Crime; the World Summit for Social Development, as well as the proclamation of 1995 as the United Nations Year for Tolerance; and the World Conference on Women, which will take place in Beijing. All of these events have been scheduled to take place in the context of the international action aimed at the setting up of humanity's agenda for comprehensive development - 'An Agenda for Peace' -that would reflect, on another level, the universal nature of human security.\n\\\"Thus the international community is called upon to mobilize itself on the occasion of the Tunis meeting on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders and the International Symposium on Organized Crime in order to hone a preventive strategy, identify the means required or, more specifically, to build effective institutional structures to combat terrorism and organized crime, including offences of an economic and political nature, such as violations of human rights and drug trafficking.\n\\\"In this respect, Tunisia has unswervingly adopted a diplomacy of cooperation based on peace, stability and security. In addition, we are working to ensure that the United Nations Year for Tolerance will be a good occasion wherein such human values will be underscored and made a political goal and a means of avoiding and preventing disputes.\n\\\"As for the World Summit for Social Development, it will afford an opportunity to search for urgent international solutions to urgent social problems and to make clear the need for the formulation of an international strategy for social development, since social problems today are an overriding concern of all countries both in the North and in the South. Indeed, those problems endanger stability, security and peace throughout the world and in particular in Africa. Therefore, the African Heads of State and Government recognized, during their meeting in Tunis, the importance of this world Summit and the need carefully to consider the recommendations that will result from it.\n\\\"The strong upheavals that have taken place on the world scene have directly impacted on the conditions in many countries and particularly in those which do not have the wealth or sufficient potential to adapt to the new international order. Therefore, the international community is called upon to devise new modes of cooperation. Such modes, as they will have to be unprecedented in both form and content, will require the existence of political will and international solidarity and the establishment of a partnership for lasting social and human development.\n\\\"The improvement of living conditions, respect for human dignity, justice for all, equality of all races and peoples, as well as the values of tolerance and respect for others, are the indispensable foundations upon which social life and international cooperation must be based.\n\\\"We are gratified here to reiterate our great appreciation of the active role that the United Nations performs in the management of problems of peace, security and development throughout the world. We would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the son of Africa and of the Arab world who has worked to introduce a new dynamism into the agenda for comprehensive development and the 'Agenda for Peace'. This role is supported by the African States, and we continue to find it a source of great encouragement. In the same context, we take note with great satisfaction of the compromise reached within the framework of the Organization of African Unity concerning the need to implement the project for structural reform of the United Nations aimed at greater efficiency and increased balance and equality in the representation of regional groups.\n\\\"In this context, we insist on the legitimacy of the wish expressed by the African continent to strengthen its presence within the United Nations system by obtaining for itself that place which goes hand in hand with its position and with its aspiration to make a greater contribution to the management of international affairs and to the strengthening of security, stability and progress throughout the world.\n\\\"It is on behalf of Tunisia and on behalf of the Organization of African Unity that I renew this appeal, while hoping that at this session we will achieve adequate formulas for reforms to be undertaken within the United Nations system, in order to consolidate the foundations of security, peace and stability throughout the world and to provide a stimulus for the process of development for the benefit of all of humankind.\\\"\n"

We are confident that with your able leadership\nour deliberations will be guided towards a successful\nconclusion, for the benefit of the global community.\nLet me also offer Swaziland\u2019s gratitude and praise to\nyour predecessor, whose wise direction ensured the\nsuccess of the deliberations of the Assembly at its forty-\neighth session.\nThe past 12 months have presented many challenges\nto our Organization, in its pivotal role as an effective\ninstrument for fostering global peace and security, and as\na dynamic forum for promoting a spirit of understanding\nand cooperation among the nations of the world.\nClearly, significant progress has been made in\nmeeting these challenges, and my delegation recognizes\nthe role of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, whose diplomatic skills and\nuntiring efforts have contributed so greatly to the\ncontinuing ability of the United Nations to achieve the\nsuccesses on which the whole world depends.\nIn April this year, the eyes of the world were\nfocused on South Africa as the people of that country\nwent to the polls to elect, for the first time, a Government\nthat would represent all South Africans, regardless of\nrace, religion or creed. Today, in a triumph for the spirit\nof reconciliation, peace and compromise among all South\nAfricans, we welcome the new, non-racial and democratic\nSouth Africa back into the family of the United Nations.\n\n\nWhile congratulating the people of South Africa for\ntheir substantial achievement, the Kingdom of Swaziland\nalso salutes the role of the United Nations in bringing about\nan end to a regime it had long opposed. As a result the\nmillions of South African people who had been denied a\nvoice in this Hall will once more be heard. South Africa\u2019s\ntriumph is therefore also a victory for the principle of\nuniversality, on which the United Nations was founded.\nAs neighbour, partner and ally, Swaziland, and the\nother countries in the subregion, have particular reason to\nrejoice at the successful process of transition in South\nAfrica. Quite apart from the benefit of peace to the area\nbrought about by a successful political transformation, we\nall look forward to enjoying the fruits of closer economic\nand trade cooperation with the region\u2019s most influential\ncountry.\nSwaziland has been most impressed with the very\nclear policy of His Excellency President Mandela, stated\nconsistently since he took office in May, on the importance\nof close cooperation with others in the region.\nWe have already welcomed South Africa into the\nSouthern African Development Community, and other\ninitiatives are under way to forge closer trade and economic\nlinks between our newly liberated neighbour and the rest of\nthe subregion, for South Africa cannot expect to stand on\nits own in the future. It is a fact that the economic\ndestinies of the nations in our subregion are inextricably\nbound together.\nEven as we celebrate the return of peace and stability\nin South Africa, our continent continues to provide some of\nthe worst examples of people\u2019s inhumanity to one another.\nSwaziland watched with horror as the tragedy unfolded\nearlier this year in Rwanda. Many words have been spoken\nhere about the dreadful scenes we all witnessed, and our\nhearts went out to the millions whose lives were shattered\nby the effects of the civil war there. No other justification\nis needed to spur on our efforts to address the issue of\nconflict prevention and resolution than the loss of so many\nlives, so quickly, in Rwanda. We pray that a formula for\ntrue, lasting peace may be found, and that the two peoples\nmay be able to find some way of living side by side with\neach other.\nThe situations in Burundi, Liberia, Sudan and Somalia\nalso continue to give us cause for grave concern.\nSwaziland supports all peaceful efforts aimed at bringing\nabout negotiated settlements to the problems in these\ncountries.\nDespite the many set-backs to peace on our\ncontinent, the past twelve months have also seen\nsubstantial progress among a number of countries -\nprogress which owes much to the efforts of our\nOrganization.\nI have spoken already of our admiration for the\ndevelopments in one of our neighbouring countries, South\nAfrica, which took the path of reconciliation and peace\ntowards the much-needed process of reconstruction and\ndevelopment.\nThe same degree of respect applies to our other\nneighbour, Mozambique, which, after so long a period of\nbitter hatred amongst its people, has at last chosen to lay\ndown weapons in favour of the ballot box. Swaziland\njoins the world in praying for a peaceful election process\nlater this month, and calls on the leaders to allow the\nsame spirit of reconciliation and unity that brought an end\nto the war after so many years to continue after a new\ngovernment has been chosen.\nWe appeal to the international community to\ncontinue to provide the financial, technical, moral and\nmaterial support that will be necessary for Mozambique\nto rebuild itself, and to give its people a chance to fulfil\ntheir high potential.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland warmly welcomes the\nagreement that brought about a peaceful solution to the\nsituation prevailing in our sister Kingdom of Lesotho.\nWe welcome the opportunity presented now for the\nBasotho people themselves to address their concerns. It\nis our fervent hope that the agreement will be\nimplemented successfully, without undue delay, so that\nlasting peace and stability may come to the kingdom.\nThe direct effects of developments on our continent\nare of obvious concern to the Kingdom of Swaziland.\nBut in this day and age of global interdependence, the\npotential effects on us of situations outside Africa are of\nequal importance. Two recent developments provide\nparticular cause for hope in areas of long-running dispute.\nIn the Middle East, the seeds of peace and\nreconciliation, sown last year by Prime Minister Rabin\nand Chairman Arafat, and encouraged by the United\nStates, Norway, the United Nations and others, are at last\nbearing fruit. Talk of trade and cooperation is replacing\n2\n\n\nthe noise of gunfire, as the bitter rivalries of generations\ngive way to a new order of peace in the region.\nSwaziland salutes all those who contributed to the\nprocess of peace in the Middle East; we appeal to the\nleaders of the region to join in the process and to allow it\nto continue without disruption, so that precious resources\nmay be directed towards worthwhile development goals.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has long been concerned\nabout the spread of nuclear weapons, and the effect this has\nhad on world stability. We were therefore encouraged by\nthe recent initiatives on the part of the United States and\nRussia to substantially reduce the number of their weapons.\nWe also support all efforts on the Korean peninsula,\nwhere disaster has been pending, to bring about real\nprogress on the nuclear issue. This issue has been the\nfocus of major instability for the entire far-east region, and\nSwaziland fully supports all efforts to bring about a\npeaceful resolution to the problem.\nWe look forward to the peaceful reunification of the\ntwo Koreas, and encourage all moves to bring this to\nfruition.\nWars and conflict situations in Africa and around the\nworld continue to stretch our belief that people can ever\nlive peacefully with one another. More and more, the\nresources of the United Nations are being overextended to\nmeet the challenges these situations present, and conflict\nresolution finds itself close to the top of the agenda for\naction by this Assembly.\nMercifully, the Kingdom of Swaziland has been spared\nthe horrors of internal conflict, but no country can really\nfeel immune to the effects of war and confrontation,\nwherever these may be occurring. Deciding on the best\nway for the world to cope with conflict situations is\ntherefore a problem we all share, and we in Africa are\nconscious of our particular responsibility for deciding on\nmechanisms to limit, prevent and cope with conflict\nsituations developing on our continent.\nThis issue has been central during discussions at\nsubregional and regional conferences. Most recently,\nimportant resolutions were adopted at the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) summit in Tunis, and at the Southern\nAfrica Development Community summit in Gaborone,\nwhich went some way towards deciding on the regional\nresponse to one of Africa\u2019s most pressing problems.\nBut despite almost unanimous willingness for our\ncountries to become involved more directly in the\ncontinent\u2019s conflicts, it was clearly recognized that the\nmajority of us lacked the resources to lend an effective\nhand.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland therefore supports the\ngrowing call for an integrated approach to conflict\nresolution on our continent, which would bring close\ncooperation between Africa and the rest of the world by\nestablishing mechanisms to coordinate the resources of\nboth in the most effective way. The OAU is clearly in\nthe best place to mobilize the efforts of its members - and\nmost important of all, to undertake preventive diplomacy\nbefore a situation has the chance to develop - while the\nUnited Nations can continue to play its role as\ncoordinator of the international response.\nMany of Africa\u2019s present conflicts could well have\nbeen prevented or contained if properly coordinated\nmechanisms had already been in place. The Kingdom of\nSwaziland welcomes discussion here so that a plan of\naction can be agreed upon quickly on this vitally\nimportant issue.\nIn this regard, and as a measure of Swaziland\u2019s\nacceptance of her responsibility to the rest of the world,\nHis Majesty King Mswati III announced at the OAU\nsummit in Tunis this year that he would be taking steps\nto decide how best the Kingdom\u2019s small defence force\ncould be used alongside other troops in multinational\nforces for the benefit of global peace and stability.\nHis Majesty has begun the process of investigating\nunder what conditions the nation\u2019s soldiers can be\noffered, bearing in mind the small size of the defence\nforce and our relative lack of appropriate weapons and\nequipment. Clearly, we cannot allow our soldiers to enter\ninto potentially dangerous situations without proper\nprotection and without adequate training.\nThese are some of the issues to be looked at before\nwe can fully commit ourselves to taking this more active\nrole in global peace-keeping, and we will be approaching\nthe Secretary-General for consultations on this important\ninitiative.\nThis session of the General Assembly is entrusted\nwith the task of discussing \\\"An Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\". The focus of the world is on the\nrequirement now to channel our resources towards\nachieving lasting global stability through the sustainable\n3\n\n\ndevelopment of our countries, providing us with improved\nstandards for all our peoples.\nThe welcome end to the period of confrontation\nbetween the world\u2019s super-Powers should mean that\nincreased global resources can now be redirected to\nachieving a new and more balanced world economic order.\nCloser attention can now be given to the plight of all\ndeveloping countries, which continue to suffer the effects\nof serious development neglect. This crucial point was\ndiscussed at length at last weekend\u2019s meeting of the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) in Madrid, where the\nview of the developing world was made very clear.\nThe continent of Africa contains the highest number\nof the world\u2019s poorest countries, and any agenda for\ndevelopment should take into account the special\ncircumstances surrounding the inability of this region to\ndevelop effectively.\nWe in the region know ourselves, all too well, what\nfactors continue to obstruct our progress. It is a familiar\ncatalogue, including resource constraints; inappropriate\ndevelopment policies; the slow pace of industrialization and\ntransformation into producers of processed goods;\ninadequate infrastructure; natural disasters; and a continuing\nround of armed conflicts.\nWe know the problems, and we are trying our best to\novercome them. We understand our responsibility to our\npeople to mobilize our resources in the most effective way\nto overcome the obstacles to national development. The\nneed is clear, and our resources and abilities are limited,\nbut we are trying hard. We also recognize that we cannot\nhope to achieve long-term sustainable development without,\nat least, the short-term assistance of the rest of the global\ncommunity.\nMuch of what we need is contained in the United\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\n1990s, and our continent\u2019s collective appeal is for the swift\nand full implementation of its many programmes. But each\nnation has its separate, distinct needs.\nSwaziland welcomes recent initiatives towards\nstrengthening South-South cooperation, and we believe they\nwill result in real progress towards overcoming the\neconomic challenges facing us all in that grouping.\nIn trying to meet our national economic development\nobjectives, the Kingdom of Swaziland has adopted a broad\nand integrated approach aimed at achieving sustainable,\n\\\"human-centred\\\" development, through policies that focus\non the priorities of the reduction of poverty, universal\naccess to primary school, and affordable primary health\ncare.\nRecent United Nations initiatives also guide us in\nour Government policies. As a follow-up to the Earth\nSummit, for example, we have established a national\nenvironmental authority to ensure that environmental\nconcerns are properly integrated into all stages of public\npolicy and national development strategy formulation.\nSwaziland welcomed the opportunity to address the\nrecent United Nations Conference on Population and\nDevelopment in Cairo, and the adoption of the\nProgramme of Action constitutes a significant step in our\ncollective aim. The Kingdom had already embraced the\noption of acceptable child spacing as the cornerstone of\nour population growth policy, and we have begun a\ncomprehensive programme of education for our people in\nthe realities of and efforts to deal with overpopulation.\nThese and all aspects of the economic development\nof the Kingdom will be debated by the whole nation\nduring the process of national economic consultation,\nwhich was recently initiated by His Majesty the King.\nThe process is designed to allow all Swazis the\nopportunity to be involved in deciding the future direction\nof the Kingdom\u2019s economy, and will embody the nation\u2019s\nwishes for future priorities and strategies. These in turn\nwill form the basis of our request for future support from\nour friends in the international community, and we will be\nkeeping the United Nations fully informed of\ndevelopments.\nThe process follows on from last year\u2019s very\nsuccessful political reforms, resulting from a similar\nperiod of national consultation, which concluded last\nOctober with direct elections to Parliament under a new\nsystem of secret ballot. The democratic elections were\ndeclared free and fair by the international community and,\nmore importantly, were what the Swazi people themselves\nhad chosen.\nBoth processes - political and economic reform -\nshow clearly Swaziland\u2019s principle of rule by consensus\nof the people. We believe this principle is at the heart of\nthe peace and stability we have enjoyed for many\ngenerations, and it has spared us the horrors of internal\nconflict suffered by so many on our continent.\n4\n\n\nI spoke earlier of South Africa\u2019s return to the\ninternational community, as, among other things, a triumph\nfor the United Nations in upholding the principle of\nuniversality. The Kingdom of Swaziland urges the\nAssembly to apply the same principle to investigate the\nmerits of the case of the Republic of China in Taiwan.\nHis Majesty King Mswati III joined a number of other\nHeads of State in raising this issue at the forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly. His Majesty called for\nthe establishment of an ad hoc committee to determine\nwhether or not the Republic of China had a reasonable case\nfor rejoining our Organization. This call has been taken up\nby an increasing number of countries that support the idea\nof looking into the issue in more detail.\nQuite apart from the principle of universality, there are\nother important factors for us to consider when reviewing\nthe case. The Republic of China in Taiwan has much to\noffer to the world community. It clearly has the resources\nto be of more use to the rest of the international\ncommunity. More important, though, is the desire of the\nRepublic of China to be of use - and assistance - to the rest\nof the world.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland, along with a large\nnumber of other developing countries throughout Africa,\nAsia and the Americas, has had first-hand evidence of the\nRepublic of China\u2019s willingness to offer generous\nhumanitarian and development assistance.\nAs more and more worthy targets appear for the\nUnited Nations resources, we can surely ill afford to reject\nthe call to investigate further whether that country\u2019s\nassistance can be put to wider use through the agencies of\nour Organization.\nAt the heart of the issue, though, is the fact that 21\nmillion people believe that they are not represented in the\nUnited Nations. These people believe that they are\nexcluded from our founding principle of universality. In\nconsideration of this right, which they believe has been\ndenied them, the time has surely come for us to listen to\ntheir voices.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes and supports the\nparticipation of the Republic of China In Taiwan in the\nactivities of the United Nations, and we therefore call once\nmore for the establishment of an ad hoc committee to\nreview the case for their re-admittance to the Organization.\nThe United Nations has a distinguished history of 49\nyears of growth and achievement. The challenges we\nfaced almost 50 years ago, as the world emerged from\nglobal conflict, have changed in substance but not in\nimportance.\nWe have the opportunity now, in this forum, to lay\nthe foundations for an agenda for development that will\nbring about the stability and peace we all desire.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is proud of its\nmembership of the United Nations and commends the\nwork of all who have contributed to the many successes\nover the years. The nation is deeply indebted to the\nUnited Nations agencies, whose efforts are contributing so\nmuch to the attainment of our development goals.\nOn behalf of His Majesty King Mswati III, Her\nMajesty the Indlovukazi, and the whole Swazi nation, I\nshould like to reaffirm my country\u2019s full support for, and\ncommitment to, the Charter of the United Nations. May\nAlmighty God bless these deliberations with the success\nthey deserve.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Essy on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session and to wish him every success in discharging this noble duty.\nA well-deserved word of appreciation is due to his predecessor, Ambassador Insanally, for the remarkable competence and skill he displayed as President at the last session.\nWe highly esteem the Secretary-General's unreserved commitment, at the head of the world Organization, to make broad reforms in it and to increase its effectiveness in all fields.\nAfter the fall of the iron curtain in Europe, Albania joined the family of democratic nations, leaving behind a deep isolation and a totalitarian regime. In two years, thanks to the determination of the democratic Government to carry out profound and urgent reforms, Albania has taken important steps in all fields. State institutions have been transformed, drawing upon the positive experience of developed States. The former secret service was dissolved and the army was placed under civilian control and underwent reform in compliance with the requirements of a demilitarized, profoundly democratic\nsociety. Today, Albania boasts an independent judiciary and a constitutional court which supervises the constitutional character of the laws passed by Parliament. Currently in Albania, there are more than 30 registered political parties,\thundreds of non-governmental\norganizations, and more than 320 magazines and newspapers, of which 90 per cent are privately owned. At present, Albania's religious communities practice their own beliefs in exemplary harmony and tolerance, according to the centuries-old traditions of my country.\nBy promoting democracy and strengthening the institutions of the rule of law, the democratic Government seeks to guarantee the country's internal social and political stability. However, Albania continues to be the poorest country of the European continent and faces a series of economic difficulties. By firmly pursuing the economic policy of shock therapy, in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the international community, the Government is implementing a series of short- and medium-term programs that have given a great impetus to free individual initiative. In two years' time, agriculture, land, apartments, transport, services, trade and about 2,500 small and medium-sized enterprises have been privatized. From 400 per cent, the inflation rate has dropped to less than 30 per cent a year; the currency is stable and practically convertible; and production is on the rise. In 1993, Albania recorded growth rate of 11 per cent, the highest in Europe. Foreign investments are also increasing.\nIn the coming months we shall move ahead without losing time. The nearest objectives in legislation are the approval of the new penal code, the penal procedure code and the constitution, which will meet most advanced European standards. We will also try to increase cooperation with various international organizations, particularly with the agencies of the United Nations system.\nAlbania attaches special importance to strengthening friendly relations and cooperation with the international community, the European Union, the United States of America, the countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and other friendly countries in the world. Albania's President Berisha is resolutely devoted to the establishment and strengthening of these ties in order to do away, once and for all, with the bitter consequences of the severe 50-year isolation which our people suffered. We want to have friendly relations, especially with our neighbors, and we are making efforts so that a climate of good understanding and cooperation, based on mutual respect and benefit in the spirit of the basic principles of\nthe Helsinki Final Act, will prevail all around us. We have established such relations with Italy and are on the way to their further and all-round development.\nWe would also like to have on a consistent basis the sort of good, tension-free relations we are currently enjoying with Greece, the only country of the Balkans that is a member of the European Union. We regard these relations, not merely as bilateral, but also as closely linked to the prospect of the integration of Albania and the Balkans into Europe. Advances are being made in the relations of good-neighborliness and broad cooperation with Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, on the basis of a long historical tradition.\nAs regards the new Balkan State, our eastern neighbor, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, we are resolutely committed to building relations of exemplary neighborliness with it and to helping that country overcome its internal and external difficulties. We are convinced that its integrity, its internal stability, its recognition and its membership in all international forums are of vital importance for peace, security and stability in the region. Our indispensable good relations with Macedonia are linked to and conditioned by the presence of an Albanian population that ranks second in size to Macedonians. We think that sound inter-ethnic understanding between Macedonians and Albanians, established on the basis of the due recognition of the Albanians' human and national rights, is indispensable for the domestic stability and prosperity of that Republic and the entire region.\nWe would like to have peace, good-neighborlinesses and fruitful cooperation with Montenegro and Serbia, but these relations will remain frozen and mortgaged to the overall solution of the Yugoslav crisis, especially the political settlement of the Kosovo issue. The Kosovo issue is not merely and solely a question of respect for the human rights of the two million Albanian people and the recognition of a few rights in the areas of education and culture. The question concerns recognition of the political self-governing entity of the Albanians, for which the population of Kosovo has cast its vote in a democratic manner.\nBelgrade should seriously consider this option. We consider regional cooperation and integration an indispensable condition for our integration into Europe. We have been making continuous efforts to promote understanding with our neighbors. For the further promotion of Albania's democratic and economic changes\nthere is a need for security and confidence in the Balkans. We hold that the developed countries could contribute with a full strategy and program in order to encourage the radical democratic changes in the entire Balkan space, a kind of Marshall Plan designed to promote peace, democracy and modem civilization there, an economic- political program for the all-round rehabilitation of the region.\nNational and ethnic problems left over from the past, backwardness in terms of economic and social development, and the new problems resulting from the change of systems make it still possible for old political mentalities to dominate the stage of inter-Balkan relations. Those mentalities are opposed to true democratic developments, even in the countries which call themselves ancient democracies.\nAs a Balkan country, Albania is concerned about the war and the crises that have encompassed our peninsula. We are convinced that at the foundation of the present-day Balkan crisis lies the revival of aggressive nationalism, which has unfurled the banner of territorial annexationist claims. The end of the cold war has again brought onto the scene the demons of old Balkan politics which seek a redrawing of the existing borders and the re-dismemberment of some States to the benefit of others. The Milosevic regime's opposition, through a bloody war, to the will of the peoples to break away from the former Yugoslav Federation was the first challenge to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Helsinki Final Act, while the dismembering of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the first act carried out in the name of creating a hegemony-seeking Greater Serbia at the expense of this former republic of the Federation, a Member of the United Nations and of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\nIn today's Balkans the nations that consider themselves more powerful and better armed are seeking to extend their territories through force and war in order to expand their power. Expansion and aggressiveness inspire their policies towards their neighbors. National divisions, inter-ethnic hatred or religious diversity are encouraged and artificially provoked, and they are converted into major national and international policy issues in an attempt to disguise historically unfounded territorial claims. At the foundation of what politicians today call \\\"ethnic conflicts\\\" in the Balkans lie the aggressive nationalism of a hegemony-seeking nation, racism and xenophobia, genocide and massive \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". That is why we have often insisted that any settlement that would legalize the\naccomplished fact of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in Bosnia would create a dangerous precedent for new tragedies of this kind, starting in the Balkan region.\nToday, Serb and Greek nationalism are seriously threatening the Balkans. Such elements consider that the collapse of Communist dictatorships in the Balkans created a vacuum to be exploited to achieve their nationalist ambitions.\nHence, Serb nationalism launched an aggression in the north and a war to realize a Greater Serbia by creating a real holocaust at the end of this century against the Bosnian people and by strengthening apartheid in Kosovo.That nationalism is bogged down in grave crimes. In our judgment, only the intransigence of the international community and the refusal to recognize the violation of the principles that all of us have accepted will compel the Serbs in Belgrade, Pale and Knin to give up war as a means of solving problems. The dismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" on its territory are unacceptable. We have supported and still support the request of that Republic for the lifting of the arms embargo against it, an embargo which - there is no doubt - has been an encouragement to the aggressor. Similarly, we support the recent Security Council resolutions 941 (1994) and 942 (1994), which we believe are steps in the right direction for putting an end to hostilities in the region. However, we are opposed to resolution 943 (1994), which is a concession to the Milosevic regime and makes a settlement of the Yugoslav crisis and the establishment of general peace in the Balkans remote.\nI would like to recall that the crisis in the former Yugoslavia started in Kosovo and that it persists there, alive and very dangerous. Sanctions against Belgrade should not to be eased but should be further tightened and truly implemented if we want the crisis hotbeds in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the occupied territories of Croatia, Sandiak and Vojvodina, and especially in Kosovo to be eliminated. The Albanian Government insists that the lifting of sanctions against Serbia be conditioned on the settlement of the Kosovo issue.\nWe should be realists. It was not Milosevic's goodwill but the unanimous stand of the great Powers of the Contact Group that recently made Belgrade announce an interruption of its aid to Serbian aggression in Bosnia and accept international monitoring of that act. On this occasion we should stress that these decisions are positive and welcome. They should be irreversible steps, for we consider that the future of peace and stability in the Balkans will also depend, to a considerable extent, on a just settlement of the Kosovo issue. Albanians in Kosovo have been deprived of all rights. Serb nationalism rejects dialog. It is brandishing weapons and engaging in threats by the use of tanks; it is organizing police terror daily from village to village, from one city quarter to another. We have insisted and still insist on carrying out a dialog between Kosovo's legitimate institutions and its leadership, on the one hand, and Belgrade, on the other, in the presence of a third party, on the restoration of the democratic institutions that were abolished with the use of tanks and on the definition of a status that should include recognition of the right to self-determination at an opportune moment. This is the only way, in our view, to reach an overall settlement of the Balkan crisis, which may grow into conflicts far larger than previous ones unless it is tackled with proper determination and responsibility.\nGreek nationalism, too, is another growing threat to Albania and the Albanians. It is seeking, through a series of maneuvers, to block the reforms in Albania and to destabilize it in an attempt to render the settlement of the Albanian question more difficult and delay it. To facilitate the position of its ally in the north, it is making territorial claims against Albania.\nGreek nationalism is dangerous not only on account of its tradition but also because of the fact that it has the privilege of being a somewhat forgotten nationalism. For, since Greece is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and of the European Union, there is a tendency to ignore it. The truth is that Greece today, as a member of NATO and the European Union, is subject to a certain control by and dependence on those organizations, and this is a positive thing. However, it is also true that over the past two years Greek nationalism has blocked action by those institutions several times because of the consensus needed to take decisions.\nToday, the establishment and progressive consolidation of positions in Greek official circles is a bitter fact. The power game that is taking place in Greece is undoubtedly being played through the free vote, but, in distinction to all the other countries of Western Europe, it is being played with nationalist slogans. It is an undeniable fact that after the game is played official Greece will emerge more nationalistic than it was before. It is precisely for these reasons that Greece, the birthplace of democracy, our millenary neighbor, avoided and gave up the opportunity to serve as a promoter of the integration of the Balkan countries into Europe after the fall of the iron curtain. At the same time, through its official and unofficial policy it became a true champion of Serb nationalism - not, of course, for the sake of Serbia\u2019s interests but for the sake of interests and ambitions which it hopes to achieve by remaking the Balkans.\nWe do not mean that Greece can be compared to Serbia, for that would not be realistic. But what causes great concern is the progressively official character Greek nationalistic policy is assuming. It is the Greek Government which has blocked the recognition of Macedonia and has imposed a blockade on it, ignoring the fact that its border is also the border of the European Union. It is Greek state nationalism that blocks European Union aid to the poorest European country, Albania, rendering its economic growth more difficult. The Mitsotakis Government officially demanded the autonomy of \\\"northern Epirus\\\", as they call the south of Albania; the Papandreou Government declares that it has incorporated the south of our country in Greek defense planning. The official character the Greek Government has given to its policy on \\\"northern Epirus\\\" poses a serious threat to the Balkans.\nGreek nationalism is trying to manipulate about 60,000 Greeks who live in the south of Albania - according to the 1989 census, they comprise 1.85 per cent of the country's population - as a means to destabilize Albania and to achieve its annexationist designs. For this purpose, Greece is emitting organized, nationalistic and fundamentalist propaganda through radio stations, air-dropped leaflets and the distribution of materials which claim the south of Albania and demand the overthrow of the democratic Tirana Government. On 10 April 1994, an armed band was sent into Albania, where it killed two Albanian army men; hundreds upon hundreds of firearms have been smuggled into Greek minority villages and young Greek minority people have been recruited and sent to attend Greek military schools without the knowledge of the Albanian Government. The recent verdict passed by an Albanian court on five Albanian citizens of Greek origin on charges of collusion with the Greek secret services, sending out military intelligence, the distribution and illegal possession of arms and so on, was exploited as an excuse to attack the Albanian Government at all international institutions and forums, including this august Assembly, to block 35 million ecu in European Union aid to Albania, to expel in retaliation 60,000 Albanian citizens who were legally employed in Greece in a matter of a few weeks, maltreating them, beating them up and killing six of them.\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Greek minority of Albania did not let itself fall prey to such a chauvinistic policy. The Greek minority expressed this stand openly two weeks ago during Albanian President Sali Berish's visit to Greek minority villages in the south of Albania. All this has arisen because ethnic minorities in Albania live in harmony with Albanians, and are not maltreated by the Government. On the contrary, with the establishment of the democratic regime, they are step by step enjoying the most advanced standards as set forth in United Nations instruments, the Copenhagen Document and other international conventions on minorities. This has been confirmed by dozens of foreign observers, ethnic minority specialists, parliamentarians, representatives of international institutions, including the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) High Commissioner for ethnic minorities, Mr. Max van der Stoel, various non-governmental organizations, journalists and so on.\nWith the establishment of the democratic regime in Albania, members of the Greek minority are represented in or lead local organs of power; are represented in the Albanian parliament in the ruling parties and the opposition parties, and even in a separate party; they are present at all levels of the administration as ministers, ambassadors, members of the supreme court, and so on; they go to Greece freely and with no obstacles from the Albanian State; they learn or are taught in their mother tongue, and a recent decision of the Albanian Government has created more opportunities to extend this possibility; they have their own schools at all levels, a separate branch in the Greek language at the Gjirokastra University, their own mass media, radio broadcasts and newspapers in the Greek language, as well as their political and cultural organizations.\nThe Albanian Government has openly declared that the crisis in its relations with Greece will in no way affect the harmonious relations between Albanians and members of the Greek minority in Albania.\nOn the other hand, we call on the Greek Government to apply the international conventions relating to ethnic minorities. It cannot shirk its responsibility with its senseless denial of the presence of national minorities in Greece. How could the Turkish, Macedonian and Albanian minorities vanish in Greece at a stroke? The Greek Government should put an end to the suffocating climate that prevents these minorities from asserting their own national identity.\nHow could the Greek Government forget the 1944-1945 massacre of the Albanian population of Chameria, when thousands upon thousands of people were stabbed to death and killed with firearms by Greek chauvinistic nationalists. And some of those who could escape alive, old folk and children, were expelled to Albania and Turkey, thus creating a real tragedy of divided families, whereas their land, homes and other property were usurped by Greek colonists, who still possess them today in contravention of international civil law.\nWe have always appreciated the importance of good relations with Greece, free from any concern and tension, for our development, peace and security. Because of the reasons already mentioned, this has not always worked out. We tried to overcome the present-day crisis in our relations, provoked against our interest and will, through dialog either on a bilateral footing or through international mediation. The Greek minority people in Albania, too, have publicly supported unconditional dialog between the two Governments. Unfortunately, the Greek side has so far rejected a meeting of our two countries' Foreign Ministers, proposed by the Albanian side, as well as the mediation of the United Nations Secretary-General, the European Union presidency and the United States Administration. On the contrary, they are still bringing pressure to bear on the democratic Albanian Government.\nThe Albanian Government will continue to make every effort to be constructive and strive for peace in its policy towards its Balkan neighbors, aware of the fact that the Balkans is one of the hottest and most dangerous spots in the world today, and therefore the attention of the international community should not be distracted from it.\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress that we share the view and join the efforts aimed at revising the Charter and structure of the United Nations, especially as it concerns such important organs as the Security Council, which takes decisions on the maintenance of international peace and security, in order to enhance their efficiency in response to today's challenges in a fast-changing world. The crisis the world is currently experiencing urgently raises the need to achieve consensus on such a restructuring of the Security Council, so as to make this important decision-making body as representative and democratic as possible and even more effective in the adoption of decisions and their implementation. I take this opportunity to reiterate the candidature of my country for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council from \n\nthe Eastern European Group for the 1996-1997 term. We think that giving this seat to Albania after 40 years of membership in the United Nations would also be an encouragement to small countries to assume the responsibility incumbent upon them and commit themselves to safeguarding peace, security and world order.\nWe look confidently to the further enhancement of United Nations peace-keeping activities. To this end, Albania maintains that the United Nations needs an efficient mechanism to warn of conflicts in advance and to intervene in time in order to prevent their outbreak. We would like to stress the conclusion we have drawn from Bosnia's tragic experience. We seriously believe that the tragedy could have been averted if there had been serious attention by the United Nations when it recognized the secession and independence of that Republic from the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The military intervention Serbia perpetrated in order to halt more secessions from the federation would have been avoided if the new Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been placed under the firm protection of the United Nations.\nIt is never too late to draw lessons. We think that the United Nations should set up a modem system of trusteeship that could be set in motion whenever necessary to prevent human catastrophes like that in Bosnia. Today, this is dictated by the situation in Kosovo, which is very close to posing a potential threat like that posed by Bosnia; it is dictated also by the situations in Rwanda, Somalia, Haiti and other places.\nAs we said last year, we are in favor\nfavor of United Nations intervention wherever there are clear signs, as determined by early-warning monitoring, of a threat of human catastrophe. As we all know, the consequences of such catastrophes have negative effects on regional and international peace and security. We hold that in such cases there is no reason for the Security Council to hesitate to take a decision on intervention without the prior consent of the State or Government that is the cause of and is responsible for the catastrophe. Otherwise, such human catastrophes will never be prevented, and international peace, security and stability will always be threatened. What we demand is in full compliance with the universally accepted idea, that it is easier to avoid a crisis or conflict than to try to solve it after it has broken out.\n"

The Barbados delegation has\ncooperated closely with Your Excellency in the past, and\nwe have every confidence that you will guide the work of\nthis session with distinction.\nIt is with a deep sense of pride and satisfaction that I\nalso offer my Government\u2019s congratulations to our outgoing\nPresident, Ambassador Rudy Insanally of Guyana. As the\nfirst representative from the Caribbean to hold that high\noffice, Ambassador Insanally has represented the entire\nregion with exemplary skill and diplomacy, and has left\nmuch seminal work for us to build upon over the coming\nmonths.\nI also extend the good wishes of the Barbados\nGovernment to our distinguished Secretary-General, Dr\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, whom the Barbadian people had the\nhonour of receiving in Bridgetown earlier this year. We\noffer him our continued support in his difficult task at the\nhelm of the Organization at so crucial an epoch in world\naffairs.\nOn 23 June this year, the Republic of South Africa\nreceived a warm and emotional welcome back to this Hall\nas it formally resumed its participation in the work of the\nAssembly.\nAs it did then, Barbados warmly welcomes the\nreturn of South Africa to the community of nations. As\nwe rejoice at the demise of apartheid, we are still greatly\nmoved by the tremendous sacrifices made by the men,\nwomen and children of South Africa that made a\ndemocratic South Africa possible, and by the\nsteadfastness and the statesmanship of the South African\nleaders, particularly President Mandela, whose great\nstature and wisdom captivated this body some seven days\nago. We also acknowledge the sterling contribution of\nthe Special Committee against Apartheid, which for\n32 years worked unremittingly to achieve this remarkable\noutcome.\nSouth Africa is well poised to play a significant role\nin this Organization, and the international community has\nmuch to learn from the South African experience.\nIt is, however, imperative that we recognize that\nSouth Africa still very much needs our assistance with the\ngreat challenges that lie ahead. The Government of\nBarbados pledges to support the Government of South\nAfrica as it strives to improve the quality of life for its\ncitizens.\nBarbados is greatly encouraged by the progress made\nin the search for a just and lasting peace in the Middle\nEast since the signing of the Washington Declaration by\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization in\nSeptember last year. The Cairo Accord, which paved the\nway for the commencement of Palestinian self-rule in the\nGaza Strip and in Jericho, and the Israeli-Jordanian\nDeclaration, signed in Washington in July this year, are\nwelcome steps on the difficult path towards the attainment\nof peace in that region.\nBarbados hopes that future resolutions on the Middle\nEast will be reflective of these advances and will serve as\na fillip to the parties engaged in the negotiation process\nas they strive to achieve a comprehensive peace in\naccordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\n338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\nThe people of Barbados went to the polls on\n6 September and, in an incident-free election, voted a new\nGovernment into office. I am honoured to be a part of\nthat new order. The democracy that Barbados practices\n6\n\n\nis ingrained in the culture and habits of its people. For\nthem, freedom of speech and association and freedom to\nvote at regular intervals for a Government of their choice\nand to have the Government installed in an immediate and\norderly transfer of power are the simple and natural norms\nof life. Yet, sadly, what we in Barbados take for granted,\nothers close by in our own hemisphere still struggle to\nachieve.\nMy country, Barbados, has gained international\nrecognition for its comprehensive network of social\nservices, its people-oriented development policies and its\nhigh quality of life, which have earned it first place in the\ndeveloping world in the United Nations Development\nProgramme\u2019s Human Development Index. The present\nGovernment of the Barbados Labour Party fully recognizes\nthe challenges that lie ahead for a small, middle-income\ncountry like Barbados to sustain that achievement in an\ninternational economic environment that continues to\nmarginalize the small and fragile in the developing world.\nWith few resource endowments, our survival must depend\nexclusively on the skills of our industrial and committed\npeople and on the God-given beauty of our natural\nenvironment.\nThe new Government has responded immediately to\nthat challenge in its manifesto \\\"Charter for Change\\\", a\nfundamental policy document that represents a solemn\ncompact by this Government to work together with its\ncitizens in seeking for Barbados a strong, strategic position\nin the global community of nations as we approach the\ntwenty-first century. We are determined to use the\nopportunities created by the technological and\ncommunications revolution to overcome the obstacle of size\nand to harness our natural and strategic assets to convert\nBarbados into a full-service economy. We will encourage\nthe development of tourism and the international financial\nservices and informatics sectors to their fullest potential.\nWe will create a business-friendly environment that will be\nconducive to new investment, both local and foreign. We\nwill facilitate the growth and development of the small-\nbusiness sector and encourage entrepreneurship. A\nradically restructured Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign\nTrade and International Business, under my direction, has\nbeen put in place to spearhead this endeavour.\nAgainst this background, the people of Barbados view\nwith concern the tragic situation of Haiti. For far too long\nHaiti has been a burden on the collective conscience of the\nregion. For too long a just and equitable solution has not\nonly eluded the countries in our own hemisphere, but\neluded also the grasp of the Security Council of the United\nNations. We are greatly encouraged that the deployment\ninto Haiti of the multinational force took place under\npeaceful circumstances and that the spectre of a bloody\nconfrontation was averted. The participation of Barbados\nin the multinational force and the United Nations Mission\nin Haiti, authorized by Security Council resolution 940\n(1994), is testimony to our commitment to ensuring that\nthe will of the Haitian people is finally respected and\ntheir lawful President and his administration restored to\noffice without delay. The clear terms of resolution 940\n(1994) must be honoured in full, and the power of a\nbrutal and lawless military and its callous leadership\neffectively and permanently neutralized.\nAs stated by Prime Minister Owen Arthur of\nBarbados in his recent address at the White House on\nbehalf of the Heads of Government of the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM):\n\u201cWhere democracy has taken root, it should be\nencouraged to grow and to flourish. Like the Soviet\nUnion and South Africa, Haiti too deserves its\nrendezvous with democracy. The Haitian people\nwished for it. They suffered for it. They voted for\nit. And now they are dying for it.\u201d\nHaiti\u2019s rendezvous with democracy has now begun\nin earnest. Hope is finally returning to a people that for\na very long time had felt that all was lost. But as we in\nCARICOM have warned on numerous previous occasions,\nthe ballot box is merely the beginning of the democratic\nprocess. The international community must now\norchestrate a massive effort to put in place the\ninstitutional infrastructure necessary to maintain and\nstrengthen the fledgling Haitian democracy and to bury\nforever the ghosts of the past. The reconstruction of Haiti\nentails the creation of conditions that will ensure that the\nrights and freedoms of all Haitian people are respected.\nIt must also respond effectively to the critical\ndevelopment needs of the Haitian population and to their\njust aspirations to share equitably in the resources of their\ncountry.\nThe Governments of the Caribbean Community are\ncommitted to playing their part in this vital phase of the\nprocess, and to this end have agreed to provide assistance,\nin concert with other members of the international\ncommunity, in the development of a civilian force as a\nprofessional organization for maintaining the peace and\nrespect for human rights in Haiti. They are also prepared\nto make available to the constitutionally appointed\nauthorities in Haiti a cadre of officers from the public\n7\n\n\nservice of the member States of CARICOM to provide\ntraining in public administration, the conduct of elections\nand other activities in support of the institutionalization of\nthe democratic process.\nAs we look across the Caribbean Community, we see\nmuch that gives us cause for hope. The private and public\nsectors of our subregion are collaborating more and more,\nwhile, at the same time, intergovernmental cooperation has\nincreased. The political dialogue between Heads of\nGovernment is flourishing, and economic cooperation is\nexpanding. Concerted efforts are also being made to boost\nintraregional trade and to improve the economic, social and\ncultural well-being of our peoples.\nThis year the Caribbean Community celebrated its\ntwenty-first anniversary. A pioneer among integration\nmovements in our hemisphere, CARICOM has sought to\nrespond to the reality that Caribbean peoples share a\ncommon destiny, which is best realized through\ncoordination and cooperation in pursuit of their economic,\nsocial and political well-being.\nThis year also, building on the foundations laid by\nmany statesmen of the Caribbean and on the ideas most\nrecently developed by the West Indian Commission, the\nleaders of 25 States whose shores are washed by the\nCaribbean Sea met at Cartagena, Colombia, to sign the\nConvention establishing the Association of Caribbean\nStates. The Association will bring together in their\ncommon pursuit of development 40 Caribbean-basin States,\ncountries and territories with a total population of\n200 million. Its stated aims are: to promote, utilize and\ndevelop the collective capabilities of the Caribbean region\nto achieve sustainable cultural economic, social, scientific\nand technological advancement; to develop the potential of\nthe Caribbean Sea through interaction among member\nStates and with third parties; to promote an enhanced\neconomic space for trade and investment with opportunities\nfor cooperation and concerted action, in order to increase\nthe benefits which accrue to the peoples of the Caribbean\nfrom their resources and assets, including the Caribbean\nSea; and to establish, consolidate and augment, as\nappropriate, institutional structures and cooperation\nagreements responsive to the various cultural identities,\ndevelopmental needs and innovative systems within the\nregion.\nBarbados fully supports the aims of the Association\nand welcomes its establishment as an important step in the\nconsolidation of the regional integration effort. But our\naims to foster development across the Caribbean will not be\ncomplete until all of the partners are free to participate on\nan equal footing. In this regard we believe the time has\ncome to remove the last vestige of cold-war rivalry from\nour hemisphere. We join the international community in\nappealing to the United States to lift its punitive economic\nembargo on Cuba and to facilitate the economic\nreintegration of that neighbouring State into the world\neconomy. We urge that political will be found to resolve\nthe remaining differences between the two countries\nthrough further dialogue.\nEarlier this year, 116 countries and 150\nnon-governmental organizations were represented at the\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States, held in Barbados. The\nfirst follow-up activity to be held in fulfillment of a\nmandate from the International Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, the \\\"Earth summit\\\", the\nConference aimed to develop a blueprint of priority\nactions for the implementation of Agenda 21 in the\nspecific context of small island developing States. The\nresults of the Conference will shortly come before the\nGeneral Assembly for its endorsement at this session.\nWe urge the international community to lend its full\nsupport to the measures proposed to ensure sustained\nfollow-up and implementation of the proposals contained\nin the Barbados Programme of Action.\nOn 16 November, the United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea will come into force, 12 years after it\nwas opened for signature at Montego Bay. We welcome\nthe recent developments which have enhanced the\nprospects of universal participation in the Convention and\nlook forward to the inauguration of the work of its\nrelevant organs. We look forward too to the successful\nconclusion next year of the Conference on Straddling Fish\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, and to the\nadoption of a legally binding regime to regulate the\nconservation and management of these threatened stocks.\nThe wise observation by the Secretary-General that\n\u201cdevelopment is a fundamental right and the strongest\nfoundation for peace\u201d has been recognized by the General\nAssembly, which in recent years has been giving priority\nattention to social development by convening a number of\ninternational conferences devoted primarily to social and\neconomic issues, as envisaged in Article 55 of the\nCharter.\nThe recent International Conference on Population\nand Development spoke volumes about the changing\nnature of international dialogue and the changing role of\n8\n\n\nwomen. In greater numbers and with greater strength, civil\nsociety in the form of non-governmental organizations\nworked alongside Governments to craft a plan of action\nwhich might realistically address the reproductive health of\nwomen and the broader needs of women in the\ndevelopment process. We owe a debt of gratitude to\nMs. Nafis Sadik, Mr. Fred Sai and the rest of the\nConference leadership, who pushed for and achieved a\nbroad consensus on many difficult issues which fall into the\nrealm of the population and development dialogue.\nFor my country, the outcome of the International\nConference on Population and Development and the Plan of\nAction confirm much of the effort which has been spent on\nimproving women\u2019s access to family planning and health\nservices. I stand before the Assembly as an example of the\nprogressive attitude which Barbadians hold regarding\nwomen\u2019s status and leadership potential. I am also\nreminded that we too need to work on areas highlighted by\nthe population Conference proceedings: difficult issues\nsuch as reducing maternal mortality, addressing the needs\nof special groups such as youth, and looking at how our\npolicies and programmes further women\u2019s empowerment.\nStill, I am heartened by the openness of the United\nNations processes to the contributions of citizens\u2019 groups\nalongside Governments, and will watch with great interest\nthe progress at the social summit and women\u2019s conference.\nThese conferences, together with the 1990 World Summit\nfor Children and the 1992 Rio de Janiero Conference,\nextend along a continuum which urges action to look into\nthe difficulties faced by our citizens and at how\nGovernment policies can relieve the uneven pressures which\nare put upon women.\nBarbados considers that these meetings are of vital\nimportance and that their core themes demand the adoption\nof a meaningful programme of action that would\ndemonstrate a firm commitment to the oft-repeated concept\nthat the human being should indeed be placed at the centre\nof development. Poverty, unemployment, gender equality,\nchildren\u2019s rights and other integrated issues must be tackled\nwith the same urgency and resolve as other aspirations of\nthe Charter if this Organization intends to signal a true\nturning-point in its human-development strategy.\nThe United Nations has contributed significantly to\npromoting and ensuring respect for and observance of\nhuman rights since the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration on Human Rights on 10 December 1948. The\nlegal framework and the established human rights\nmachinery have been greatly strengthened by the Vienna\nDeclaration and Plan of Action adopted by the World\nConference on Human Rights held at Vienna in June\n1993. The Conference affirmed that democracy,\ndevelopment and respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually\nreinforcing, and especially emphasized that the right to\ndevelopment is a basic human right.\nAt its forty-eighth session, the General Assembly\nhonoured the Latin American and Caribbean region by\nappointing His Excellency Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ayala Lasso of\nEcuador as the first United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights as a first step in implementing the\nVienna Declaration. At its forty-ninth session, the\nGeneral Assembly must now seek with equal vigour to\nimplement the other important measures of the Vienna\nDeclaration. Barbados urges that the Working Group on\nHuman Rights pursue its mandate in a coherent,\ntransparent and balanced manner in order that the long-\nterm interests of human rights may be truly served.\nBarbados believes that every human being is entitled\nto the unfettered enjoyment of all human rights and that\nthe ultimate human right is the right to life. In this\ncontext, we urge that the Assembly give serious\nconsideration at this session to the harmful impact that\nillicit drug trafficking, organized transnational crime and\nterrorism have on the effective enjoyment of human\nrights. Barbados welcomes the recent decision of the\nCommission on Narcotic Drugs to establish a working\ngroup to pursue areas of collaboration with the\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in\nmaritime trafficking. We are also encouraged by the\nprogress the Working Group has made on the draft statute\nfor an international criminal court and support the\nrecommendation by the International Law Commission\nthat the General Assembly convene an international\nconference of plenipotentiaries to study the draft statute\nand to conclude a convention on the establishment of an\ninternational criminal court.\nMy Government has always been a strong supporter\nof the United Nations. We believe that in the emerging\nnew world order it is more critical than ever for the\nUnited Nations to be capable of fulfilling its role as the\nprimary guarantor of the security and independence of\nsmall States, and as the protector of the powerless and\neconomically vulnerable who form the vast majority of its\nmembership. It is also important for the small, but\nmorally authoritative, voices of this world body to\ncontinue to stress the absolute necessity for the\n9\n\n\ninternational community to use equitably and responsibly\nthe powers conferred upon it in the Charter.\nOver the past year, priority attention has been given in\nthe work of the General Assembly and the Economic and\nSocial Council to the task of elaborating an Agenda for\nDevelopment as a necessary corollary to, and indeed a\nprerequisite for, the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\". We have taken\ncareful note of the Secretary-General\u2019s report to the forty-\neighth session in this regard and look forward to giving\ndetailed consideration to the recommendations which he\nwill present in his report to this session.\nWhile we recognize that the United Nations has an\ninescapable responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, we must acknowledge also\nthat peace and development are indivisible. The root\ncauses of most conflicts are to be found in the legacy of\npoverty and dispossession that underdevelopment\nengenders. While we agree that the world body must of\nnecessity respond to critical conflict situations as they arise,\nit must at the same time be pointed out that the vast\nmajority of the world\u2019s population does not live in a state\nof war or civil conflict. The betterment of the economic\nand social conditions of that majority deserves a central\nplace in the deliberative and decision-making bodies of the\nUnited Nations and must be the principal objective of an\nAgenda for Development.\nAn Agenda for Development must promote a new\nconsensus on international cooperation for development and\nan integrated approach which is people-centred.\nFurthermore, it must be based on creating a new\ncooperative relationship between the United Nations and the\nBretton Woods institutions, one which recognizes the\nfundamental importance of the social dimension to\ndevelopment. The policies pursued by these institutions\nover the past decade, particularly within the framework of\nstructural-adjustment programmes, have left a legacy which\nconvinces us of the need for radical reform.\nWe must remind ourselves that the improvement of\nhuman well-being is the fundamental criterion to which the\ndevelopment objective must respond. There is little value\nin short-term economic growth if the measures used to\nattain it result inevitably in social disintegration. The\nBarbados delegation therefore strongly supports the view of\nthe South Centre that fresh approaches must be sought and\na new social contract established if social, political and\neconomic objectives are to be reconciled. The United\nNations is the appropriate forum to ensure that this\nreconciliation of objectives can be promoted in a\nuniversal, transparent and democratic manner.\nSeveral useful views have emerged over the past\nyear during the discussion of the Open-Ended Working\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council.\nWe look forward to an intensification of these discussions\nduring the forty-ninth session. Any enlargement of the\nCouncil must only be contemplated within a context that\ndeals also with the issue of equitable geographical\nrepresentation, the question of the veto, and the question\nof increasing the transparency of the operations of the\nCouncil and its accountability to the wider international\ncommunity. Decisions arrived at hastily to deal with only\none aspect of the issue, or merely to respond to an\narbitrary deadline of next year\u2019s celebrations, will not\nprovide a lasting solution to this critical issue.\nThe United Nations will have reached a remarkable\nmilestone in 1995 as it celebrates 50 years of tireless\nservice to the goal of enabling all mankind to live in\ndignity and enjoy better standards of life in larger\nfreedom. While it is fitting that we acknowledge this\nmilestone with appropriate ceremony, we must recognize\nthat the United Nations will be called upon to face\nchallenges in the twenty-first century that could be\nimmeasurably more difficult than those of the previous\nera. Global stability will depend more and more on the\nability of the United Nations to promote economic and\nsocial justice than on its ability to silence guns.\nThe kind of challenges I have in mind are poignantly\netched in the following quotation from an unpublished\nwork in progress entitled \\\"The Rwanda Poem\\\" by the\ndistinguished Barbadian poet and writer Mr. Kamau\nBrathwaite, who, only a few days ago, received the\nNeustadt International Prize for Literature:\n\\\"Sa/hell crumbles into these flickering miles\nMiles of the silences of holes\nOf the cold dry moon in our belly\nMarrow burning its protein into its sound\nSkin smouldering to ash\nHolocaust of dome - there is no music anywhere\nHeads propped up on sticks of skeletons\nBald headed children naked of all else\nBut large deep agate space-age eyes\\\"\nGlobal stability will be difficult to maintain if the\ncries of the majority of the world\u2019s peoples, whose lives\nare marked by a lack of food, shelter and education and\n10\n\n\nwho are afflicted by poverty, disease, and other forms of\nsocial misery, continue to go unheeded and are merely\nreflected as glaring statistics in United Nations reports on\nthe world\u2019s social situation.\nIt is Barbados\u2019 belief that the challenge that will\nconfront the United Nations in the era ahead will lie\nundoubtedly in the humanitarian sphere. This Organization\nis the only universal body with the legitimacy to take up\nthis challenge. But if it is to meet this challenge\nsuccessfully, it must be made more efficient, effective and\nalert. In this context, prevention must supersede reaction.\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nOrganization next year, \\\"We the peoples\\\" must renew our\ncommitment to this unique body and strive to ensure its\nrelevance to the twenty-first century. Mr. President, be\nassured of Barbados\u2019 commitment to these endeavours.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Mr.\nAmara Essy on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at the forty-ninth session. We are particularly\ngratified that an eminent son of Africa is leading the\nAssembly\u2019s deliberations this year.\nWe offer our thanks to his predecessor, Ambassador\nInsanally, who presided over a year of considerable\nactivity in the General Assembly with great aplomb and\nfinesse. The Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, will be completing three years in office.\nWe wish him well as he continues to lead the United\nNations.\nWe have already welcomed the new South Africa to\nthe United Nations. South Africa today is a reminder of\nthe triumph of the principle of equality of man - a\ntriumph in which the United Nations played a major role.\nThe world community must commit itself to ensuring that\nthis principle is implemented for all time to come. All\nefforts should be made for the development of South\nAfrica.\nForty-nine years ago a world tired of war declared\nthat at this foundry of the United Nations it would beat its\nswords into ploughshares. Instead, we have only\nproduced words, while the swords have not disappeared.\nThe words may be important, but unfortunately they have\nremained mere words. We seem to be stepping into a\nnew world order in a gaping moral void, with no credible\npromise of peace nor of a nonviolent world. And we are\napproaching 1995: the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations; the fortieth anniversary of Panchsheel - the Five\nPrinciples of Peaceful Coexistence; the Year of Tolerance,\nwhich is being celebrated by the United Nations; and the\none hundred and twenty-fifth birthday of the apostle of\n13\n\n\npeace and moral force, Mahatma Gandhi, whose message\nonly gains in relevance year after year.\nGlobal security today demands a holistic approach\ninvolving the promotion of economic and social\ndevelopment; the protection of human rights; the promotion\nof harmony and social cohesion in multi-racial and\nmulti-ethnic societies; the combating of terrorism,\ndrug-trafficking and clandestine traffic in armaments; and\nthe enhancing of the capacity of the United Nations, within\nthe framework of its Charter, to prevent conflicts, preserve\npeace and alleviate suffering. The new agenda of the\nUnited Nations must be shaped on the basis of this\napproach, giving peace and development equal priority and\ntreatment. The General Assembly, with its universal\nparticipation and comprehensive mandate, should project\nsuch a holistic vision and revitalize that vision into action.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s Agendas have reminded us\nof what we should focus on, namely, disarmament,\ndevelopment and peace. I put them in that order because\ntrue peace can only follow disarmament and development.\nThe cold war was not war, yet certainly not peace. In its\nwake, we have seen how, most frighteningly, poverty,\ndisease and a host of miseries affect the cause of peace.\nThey had been there all the time, but were not seen by the\njaundiced eye of the cold war. In the new post-cold-war\ncontext, therefore, the nexus of disarmament and\ndevelopment with peace becomes crystal clear - indeed\ninescapably clear.\nWe have to start with disarmament. The slaughter in\nRwanda has taken place during the forty-ninth anniversary\nof the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For almost\n50 years, we have lived in fear of general and complete\nextinction instead of global and complete disarmament.\nThose who had biological and chemical weapons have\ngiven them up under universally binding commitments. We\nmust now go one logical step further and exorcise the\ngreatest evil of all, namely, the weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nWe have had global discussions on nuclear\ndisarmament before, but now that the cold war, which\nspawned these weapons, is over, and the previous\nadversaries have been drawn into a partnership for peace,\nthis is surely the time to agree - in regimes which are\nglobal, comprehensive, verifiable and non-discriminatory -\non steps to make the world a safer place. Another\nopportunity will arise when the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) comes up for\nreview next April. We hope that States Parties will use that\noccasion to refashion the Treaty into a real instrument for\nglobal disarmament. Quite apart from the NPT, it is\nessential that we examine a detailed implementation\nprocess of total and global disarmament, which has been\naccepted in principle, though in words only thus far.\nLast June in Cairo, the Foreign Ministers of the non-\naligned countries, at India\u2019s suggestion, proposed that a\nfourth special session on disarmament be convened. We\nthink the time and the circumstances are right for the\nGeneral Assembly to plan for this special session for next\nyear, or as soon as possible.\nBut disarmament alone will be inadequate. We are\nrushing towards another precipice, where the disparities\nin wealth between nations would trigger violent revolution\nwithin States. A global convulsion will come if we\ncontinue to disregard the development imperative. The\nproblems of development are global problems and must\nbe addressed by all of us. We must set a substantive\nagenda for development, commit ourselves to it and\nimplement it.\nThe World Trade Organization, which should soon\ncome into being, must promote what we expected but did\nnot quite achieve so far in the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade (GATT) - non-discrimination,\nconsensus and transparency in the international trade\nregime. We hope that the multilateral trade negotiations\nwill stimulate economic growth in our countries and in\nthe world economy. It will not if the carefully negotiated\nconsensus, to which we committed ourselves at\nMarrakesh, is destroyed by the introduction of new\nconditionalities. Faith in the multilateral system will be\nshaken if countries use their trading strength and bilateral\npressures to weaken and distort agreements to which they\nhave just become parties.\nThe themes of the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment focus on the critical issues of poverty\neradication together with social integration and the need\nto increase avenues for productive employment, without\nwhich we will not have the broad-based, self-sustaining\nsocial and economic development that is the only\nguarantor of peace and security. If the Summit is to\nsucceed, we must agree upon the commitments for\nadditional resources dedicated to national programmes\naround the world. We should not be sidetracked from\nthis goal by new concepts which do not command\nconsensus, and do not address the fundamental needs of\ndevelopment.\n14\n\n\nThe United Nations must also re-order its priorities so\nas to counter several disturbing centrifugal trends which we\nsee emerging. What the world needs is support for the\nnation-State system on which the United Nations was built.\nIn June this year, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and\nPresident Yeltsin, representing two of the largest pluralistic\nnations in the world, issued the Moscow Declaration on the\nProtection of the Interests of Pluralistic States. In this\nDeclaration, which has been circulated as a document of the\nGeneral Assembly, Russia and India have put forward\nprinciples which, if acted upon, will, we think, promote\ngreater harmony in the world.\nAgainst this background, there are a few questions for\nthe Assembly to consider. For the 45 years of the cold\nwar, the Security Council was forced into immobility, but\nwhen the cold war ended, it found itself shouldering a\nstupendous task. As if to make up for years of inactivity,\nit has rushed into many areas. We must ponder the\nconsequences of the decisions taken over the last few years,\nwhich have on occasion sent United Nations peace-keepers\nin pursuit of objectives whose nexus with peace is rather\ntenuous.\nNew doctrines justify armed United Nations\nintervention under circumstances that are not quite defined -\nnot yet at any rate. These initiatives are well meaning but\nthey do not seem to address the problems from the right\nend. The ultimate human right is the right to live - the\nright to food and shelter without which life is impossible.\nThe poverty of many nations makes this a problem to\nwhich there are no easy answers. If there are\ncircumstances which justify armed multilateral intervention,\nby the same logic should not the United Nations have the\nright to enforce the equitable sharing of resources among\nnations?\nThe Non-aligned Movement, at the meeting of its\nForeign Ministers in Cairo this year, suggested some\nguiding principles for peace-keeping operations of enduring\nsignificance. All means for the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes chosen by the conflicting parties should be\nexhausted before coercive measures are considered.\nPeace-keeping operations should strictly adhere to the\nprinciples of the Charter, in particular the principles of full\nrespect for the sovereignty of States, their territorial\nintegrity and non-intervention in their internal affairs.\nPeace-keeping operations should be considered only at the\nrequest of the Member States involved. The resources for\npeace-keeping activities should not be at the expense of\nresources for development activities of the United Nations.\nThere should be no hesitation in ending those operations\nwhich have been overtaken by events or become\ninconsistent with their mandates. It is also important to\nensure that the distinction between peace-keeping\noperations and other activities of the United Nations,\nincluding humanitarian assistance, is maintained at all\ntimes. While coordination between these activities at the\nfield level is important, their integration could irreversibly\nalter the basic purposes of these distinct activities and\ndetract from their effectiveness.\nPrudence must be exercised in the use of regional\norganizations in peace-keeping operations. It is the\ncapacity of the United Nations for peace-keeping that\nmust be strengthened.\nWe have responded positively to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s appeal for the strengthening of the United\nNations capacity for peace-keeping by designating a\nbrigade for the stand-by arrangements that are being put\nin place.\nIt is true that the work of the Security Council and\nits role in the United Nations are of the greatest\nimportance. There is therefore all the more reason that\nthe Council should be representative of the international\ncommunity and have maximum legitimacy. The United\nNations needs a Council that is effective, but it cannot be\neffective if the impression grows that it represents\nentrenched privileges and that its agenda could vary from\nthose of the general membership. The democracy and\ngood governance which are urged upon all States cannot\nstop at the gates of the United Nations.\nThe present-day composition of the Security Council\nreflects the power balance of the immediate post-war\nperiod. Since then, the membership of the world body\nhas increased many times over. There is also a greater\ndiffusion of power. To give the Council\u2019s actions greater\nlegitimacy, moral authority and political effectiveness, it\nis imperative to expand the membership of the Council.\nDeveloping countries must be included in the category of\npermanent members to reflect the universal character of\nthe world body. The number of non-permanent seats\nmust also be increased to give Member States greater\nopportunity for participation in the work of the Council.\nA selective, piecemeal expansion of the number of\npermanent members would not be prudent. The Security\nCouncil is not a corporate board, where equity shares\ndetermine the voting power, nor can it be likened to the\nBretton Woods institutions, which reflect the wealth of\nnations. The United Nations is based on the principle of\n15\n\n\nthe sovereign equality of nations. Its primary objective\nremains the maintenance of international peace and security.\nThese elements must find expression in the composition of\nthe Council, which must be able to address the challenges\nof the twenty-first century.\nDurability and resilience, rather than expediency,\nshould determine the time frame of any expansion. On the\nbasis of any criteria - population, size of economy,\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity and to peace-keeping or future potential - India\ndeserves to be a permanent member of the Security\nCouncil.\nThe working methods of the Security Council must be\nreformed to enhance transparency and to express the\ndemocratic aspirations of the vast majority of Member\nStates. We hope that the Open-ended Working Group on\nthe question of increase in the membership of the Security\nCouncil will duly reflect on these issues in its deliberations\nnext year.\nHuman rights are the new vogue. The profoundly\nhumanistic traditions of the Indian civilization, with its\nemphasis on tolerance, harmony, non-violence and the\ninviolability of the individual, are in-built in our ethos.\nSeveral centuries back, an Indian thinker wrote:\n\\\"Man is above everything else. Man is the highest\ntruth. There is nothing above man.\\\"\nAll human rights are sacrosanct in India, guaranteed\nby a secular Constitution, an independent judiciary, a free\npress, and public opinion vigorously expressed. India\u2019s\ncommitment to the promotion and protection of human\nrights has now received another institutional impetus with\nthe establishment of our National Human Rights\nCommission, which has begun to function effectively, with\nits findings published in its annual report. In keeping with\nour policy of transparency we maintain a sustained dialogue\nwith important non-governmental organizations, which\nincludes affording greater access to them. We have also\ninvited the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights to visit India.\nIt is true that much remains to be done on a\nworldwide basis to further international cooperation to\npromote and protect human rights. But the problem must\nbe seen in perspective. In India, for instance, we grapple\nwith the problems of development for 900 million people;\nin the north-west and in the north-east we face brutal\nterrorist movements, often supported from abroad, which\nhave killed thousands of innocents, made refugees of\nhundreds of thousands within India, and threatened our\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We will face these\nproblems and defeat them. We welcome the support and\nadvice of friends abroad, but we cannot accept the\nposition that all human rights are a privilege of the\nterrorists. The rights of innocent and unarmed citizens\nmust be protected. We urge that the question of human\nrights should not be made into a politically motivated\nslogan insensitive to the rights of those citizens.\nSince the toxin of terrorism is deliberately being\nspread by some countries - and none of us is immune -\nthe international community must come together to defend\nitself. Terrorism is fast becoming a means, if not a\nweapon, of mass destruction. Many countries have\nsuffered and many more could be affected. Terrorists\nhave killed far more people in the last decades than the\nchemical and biological weapons which we have agreed\nto ban and destroy. Just as the international community\ndecided that a convention was needed to outlaw those\nweapons, so it must urgently negotiate a convention to\ncounter and eradicate terrorism. We urge the General\nAssembly to initiate serious thinking on this subject. The\ninternational community must also provide the necessary\nsuccour to the victims of terrorism, whose numbers are\nswelling by the day.\nThe closing years of the twentieth century will see\nhuman society poised at a critical juncture as regards the\nfuture. Will the end of the cold war mark the beginnings\nof a new, more stable global order, of freedom and\nwell-being growing on the soil of cooperation, consensus\nand mutual respect, or will the world instead revert bit by\nbit to the mind-set which breeds anarchy and a return to\ncentrifugalism and destruction, to end up once again in\nthe tyranny of imposition and domination? Should we\nregress to the system of spheres of influence which has\nled to so many wars over the last two hundred years?\nThese questions have still not been adequately answered.\nMany years ago the father of our nation, Mahatma\nGandhi, had asked what test should guide human\nendeavour. His conclusion, after long years of struggling\non behalf of India\u2019s many dispossessed millions, was as\nfollows:\n\\\"I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in\ndoubt, or when the self becomes too much with you,\napply the following test: Recall the face of the\npoorest and the weakest man whom you may have\nseen, and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is\n16\n\n\ngoing to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything\nby it? Will it restore him to a control over his own\nlife and destiny?\\\"\nIf the protection afforded to its weak, its most\ndispossessed, people is the measure of community\u2019s worth,\nas indeed it must be, then the millions of refugees, and the\nconflict, poverty, hunger and deprivation that afflict so\nmany regions of the world today bear stark testimony to the\nloss of some vital ethical underpinning. If the world today\nis to redeem a future that seems increasingly mortgaged to\ngreed and hatred, we must recall once again that it is the\nnobility of our means, and the ends we pursue, that\ndetermine our rewards. Our welfare will be determined\nonly in accordance with the values and principles we abide\nby.\nAs Mahatma Gandhi and sages before have taught and\npractised, truthfulness, charity, compassion, non-violence\nand treating others as we would wish ourselves to be\ntreated are the values that really stand the test of time.\nThese are the values to be inculcated in our great global\nOrganization, the United Nations, to which we are all\ncommitted.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, Mr. President, to congratulate you on your\nelection to such a responsible post. I am certain that you\nwill be able to guide our debates with your well-known\nefficiency.\nThese are years of change and transformation. In an\namazingly short period of time we have moved from a\nbipolar world marked by strategic confrontation which\nseemed insurmountable to a world in which the hope of\nan international order of peace and harmony coexists with\nsome uncertainties. There are still serious conflicts that\nrequire our full attention and that of the United Nations -\nthe main institution the international community has for\nthe solution of such conflicts.\nThe international landscape is full of contrasts: there\nare encouraging signs of convergence alongside other\nsigns that seem to point to the persistence of\nauthoritarianism and extremism, which inevitably lead to\nviolence. Torn as it is between hope and uncertainty, the\nworld must face the challenge of finding the right\nanswers. But we must keep in mind and never lose sight\nof the fact that we cannot aspire to a world at peace if we\nfail to establish a just international society. There can be\nno peace without justice and there can be no justice\nwithout the full assurance of freedom and human rights.\nThere can be no peace or justice if there is\ndiscrimination. There can be no peace or justice where\nthere is hunger. There can be no peace or justice where\nthere are regimes that repress individual freedom. And\nthere can be no peace or justice when terrorism continues\nto be protected by political, cultural and economic\nsponsors.\n11\n\n\nBut, as I said at the outset, there are also some facets\nof reality that encourage us. One of the high notes of the\npast year was the successful conclusion of the institutional\ntransition of the Republic of South Africa, magnificently\nembodied in the figures of President Mandela and the\nenlightened opposition leaders. The national unity\nagreements which made it possible for South Africa to be\nsuccessfully integrated into the family of democratic nations\ndemonstrate once again that the endeavour of nation-\nbuilding must always be based on dialogue and\nunderstanding between major political forces.\nWe have also witnessed with satisfaction and hope the\ncontinuation and the strengthening of the peace agreements\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nIn Gaza and Jericho, after more than 30 years, the\nPalestinian people is once again determining its own future\nin its own land.\nThe original agreements have been strengthened by\nthose recently signed by Israel and Jordan, which\nunequivocally represent the definitive acceptance of the\nState of Israel by the whole of the international community.\nWe hope that such a promising start will soon lead to\nsimilar agreements with other, indispensable actors in the\nregion.\nAs at all great moments in history, the solution to the\nviolence and despair that lasted for so many years has not\nbeen a matter of chance. Involved here have been men,\ngreat statesmen, true leaders, who - without setting aside\ntheir own legitimate grievances - have decided courageously\nto do away with rancour and recrimination. These Israeli\nand Palestinian leaders have pointed the way to\nreconciliation founded on peace.\nBut not all is brightness. The shadows of the Balkan\ntragedy linger, despite the tremendous efforts being made\nby the United Nations and regional groups to find a just\nand satisfactory peace. Argentina has contributed to this\nquest for solutions to the best of its ability, through the\nUnited Nations Protection Force. Since 1992 more than\n4,000 Argentine soldiers have been dispatched to contribute,\nsometimes even with their lives, to fulfilling the resolutions\nof the Organization.\nIn Africa, Rwanda has demanded the attention and\ngripped the hearts of all men and women of goodwill.\nArgentina has contributed by sending foodstuffs and\nmedical supplies, and doctors and nurses from our country\nhave joined in the efforts of thousands of international\nvolunteers who, amid scenes of horror and destitution,\nremind us of the inner nobility of every human being.\nIn Latin America, our region, to which we attach the\ngreatest importance, the process of consolidating\ndemocracy has continued. Significant steps have been\ntaken in terms of the non-proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction, and it is now possible, as in few regions\nof the world, to point to high levels of growth in an\natmosphere of increasing economic stability. Our region,\nwith its renewed democratic outlook, its respect for\nhuman rights, for peace and progressive but resolute\nintegration, has in a few years become the centre of\nattraction for international investment. In this framework\nof increasing freedom that the region now demonstrates,\nI should like particularly to hail the historic process of\nelections in El Salvador, which has put behind it a long\nperiod of confrontation.\nWith respect to the situation in Cuba, my\nGovernment would once again voice its conviction as to\nthe need for democratization on a pluralistic basis as the\nonly way to prevent the worsening of the crisis that exists\nthere and to permit the country to be reintegrated fully\ninto the Latin American community.\nIn Haiti, the overall solution lies in compliance with\nSecurity Council resolution 940 (1994), which, within the\nsystem of collective security provided for in the Charter,\nauthorizes multilateral action, a mechanism that is\nessentially different in nature from unilateral intervention,\nwhich we reject.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express thanks for\nthe work done by Mr. Dante Caputo, the former Foreign\nMinister of my country, who, after completing important\nand intelligent work during his term as Representative of\nthe Secretary-General for the question of Haiti, decided\njust a few days ago to resign that position.\nI believe in this regard that it is important to refer to\none of the most disquieting challenges that threaten\ndemocracy: corruption. This phenomenon progressively\nerodes credibility and public trust in institutions and their\nleaders. The Argentine Government is committed to a\nrelentless struggle against corruption, placing particular\nemphasis on eliminating excessive State control and a\nlack of transparency in State administration, a fertile\nground for corruption.\nThe problems that make up the international agenda\nmust, in Argentina\u2019s view, be solved by strengthening the\n12\n\n\nUnited Nations. We have constantly and firmly supported\nthe work of the Security Council, which is at last on the\nway to regaining the role assigned to it by the Charter. The\nparticipation of Argentina in nine peace-keeping\noperations - the highest number for any Latin American\ncountry - in the form of troops, military observers and\ncivilian police, is a concrete contribution that bears out the\nconvictions that I have spoken of today.\nI wish to emphasize that in its participation in peace-\nkeeping operations, the Argentine Republic is accompanied\nby 72 countries. I wish to pay tribute to them as well for\nassisting in achieving peace and justice in many, very\ndiverse, regions of the world.\nWe have also responded to the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposal that a system of stand-by forces be set up, and our\nresponse takes the form of a pledge of specialized\npersonnel, transport and 1,500 troops.\nAnother aspect of far-reaching importance in terms of\nthe evolution of the United Nations itself is the question of\nequitable representation on the Security Council and an\nincrease in the number of its members. Argentina attaches\ngreat importance to this issue and takes the view that the\nnumber of members on the Council has always\ncorresponded to the geopolitical situation prevailing at a\nspecific time and that efforts at reform should thus be\ndesigned to adapt the number to the current geopolitical\nsituation.\nCombating the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction is one of the indisputable pillars of international\npeace and security.\nWith this in mind, Argentina has ratified the Treaty of\nTlatelolco, while currently our Parliament is considering\naccession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons, which should be extended for the sake of global\nsecurity and stability.\nWith respect to chemical weapons, we are taking the\nnecessary steps to set up a national authority, and we hope\nto see international verification measures strengthened.\nAt the same time, we firmly support the conclusion of\nthe comprehensive test-ban treaty.\nIn the past year, Argentina joined the systems\ncontrolling exports of high technology and equipment with\npossible military uses, enabling us to benefit from the\ntransfer of technology.\nWe are concerned at the persistence of the\nsovereignty dispute over the Malvinas, South Georgia and\nSouth Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime\nareas.\nAlthough we have a satisfactory relationship with the\nUnited Kingdom on other bilateral questions, we cannot\nhelp but once again reaffirm before this world forum, as\nwe do each year, our sovereign rights over those\nterritories.\nOur claim this year has taken on special significance,\nsince the Argentine people, through their representatives\nin the National Congress, reformed the supreme law of\nthe country little more than a month ago, giving\nconstitutional status to the question of the Malvinas\nIslands by including, in the new text of the constitution,\na transitional clause which reaffirms our rights and states\nthat in recovering those rights respect for international\nlaw and the way of life of the population of the Islands\nshall be paramount.\nThus the entire spectrum of Argentine political\nopinion has given solemn embodiment to a claim which\nis more than ever central and permanent to our foreign\npolicy.\nFor this reason, and despite the fact that our two\nGovernments have collaborated on certain aspects of the\nmanagement of the living resources of the South Atlantic,\nwe cannot but deplore the further recourse by the United\nKingdom to unilateral jurisdictional measures in the area;\nthese undermine the possibility of broadening existing\nagreements and of arriving at others. We trust that the\nUnited Kingdom shares with us the conviction that there\nis no real alternative to cooperation in the South Atlantic.\nWith respect to fisheries, we have arrived at\nprovisional agreements allowing for the rational\nexploitation of these resources and preventing predatory\nfishing. But repeated recourse to unilateral measures such\nas I have described jeopardizes the possibility of adding\nto or indeed maintaining these understandings.\nAs far as oil is concerned, Argentina has once again\nput forward specific proposals for cooperation. Our\ninitiatives on this matter are based on the recognized\nprinciple of international law prohibiting the unilateral\nexploitation of non-renewable resources, a dispute which\nhas been acknowledged by the General Assembly.\n13\n\n\nAs to the inhabitants of the islands, I wish to reaffirm\nbefore this Assembly our full readiness to establish direct\nand responsive links with them. It is clear to us that the\nproblem of the Falkland Islands has an inevitable human\ndimension which is bound up with the way of life and the\nneeds of the islanders.\nArgentina is ready to preserve the way of life and the\nparticular characteristics, and in this context we are\nprepared to study all matters, from communications to the\nlegal and financial systems, in order to find logical\nsolutions acceptable to all.\nDialogue with the islanders is an inseparable part of a\nrational, civilized solution to this problem. Once again,\nlogic and reason are pointing inexorably towards\ncooperation and dialogue.\nThe economic and social agenda is an indication of\njust how positive an event was the conclusion of the\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT); it will make it possible to more effectively\ntackle problems of unemployment and the distribution of\nwealth.\nArgentina\u2019s policy aims at securing the consensus of\nthe countries of the Americas in order that we may declare\nthe continent a zone free of subsidies and unfair practices\nwith respect to agricultural products. The agreement on\nagriculture marks an important advancement, and Argentina\nthinks it is appropriate to take a further step by helping to\neliminate distortions in international trade.\nArgentina\u2019s concern for social problems is well\nknown. Through measures to establish stability, to combat\ninflation and to ensure economic growth, we have taken an\nimportant step forward in our struggle against poverty.\nTurning to external matters, we have proposed the\nestablishment of a volunteer corps to combat hunger and\npoverty, coordinating efforts under way in this field.\nPresident Clinton kindly referred to our initiative yesterday,\nand we particularly value his support.\nThe issues related to the relationship between\npopulation and development, which a few weeks ago were\nabsorbing world attention in Cairo, cannot be left out of\nthis analysis. We believe in promoting fundamental values,\nsuch as the advancement of women, human rights, and\nsustainable economic development, but with respect to\npopulation policies we maintain that human life exists from\nthe moment of conception until natural death, condemning\nany practice undermining this.\nPopulation policies should not aim to smother life,\nbut to ensure the greatest access of all individuals to the\nbenefits of development and the fair distribution of\nwealth.\nThere are two scourges besetting the world at the\nend of the twentieth century: drug trafficking and\nterrorism. Both of these call for concerted action on the\npart of the international community, for they are not\nnational but world-wide scourges.\nWith respect to terrorism, I can speak with the\ntwofold weight of conviction and pain - with conviction,\nbecause of our repudiation of terrorism as a means of\npolitical or religious expression, and with pain, because of\nthe hundreds of Argentines who died as a result of the\nattack that destroyed a building belonging to the Jewish\ncommunity in Buenos Aires in July. We are grateful for\nthe solidarity extended to us and for the Security\nCouncil\u2019s condemnation. We believe that concerted\naction is needed to tackle terrorism - terrorism which has\nerupted in New York, London and Panama as well as in\nBuenos Aires. It is vital for the United Nations to play\na more active, leadership role, coordinating a global\nendeavour to effectively combat this scourge.\nWe reiterate here our suggestion that the United\nNations should be provided with a unit devoted to the\nquestion of international terrorism.\nUnited Nations action must enjoy the resolute\nsupport of all. It is iniquitous and unacceptable that there\nare Governments that encourage terrorism. Sovereignty\nmust not be used as a shield for abetting terrorist\norganizations while the world looks on helplessly. If we\nHeads of State all worked in concert, we could put an end\nto this veritable scourge afflicting us all.\nThe United Nations should also study multilateral\nmechanisms that, while respecting the immunities and\nprivileges enshrined in the Vienna Convention, would\nprevent and punish the abuse of those immunities and\nprivileges to support the actions of international terrorists.\nWe cannot rule out the possibility that such immunities\nand privileges were abused in the attacks in Buenos\nAires.\nIn closing, I wish to address the need to strengthen\nthe United Nations, in particular with respect to its\n14\n\n\nresponsibilities in the area of international peace and\nsecurity. This involves first resolving its pressing financial\ndifficulties.\nThe United Nations must also continue to study the\npossibility of changing the current structure of the Security\nCouncil. In the view of the Argentine Republic, any\nincrease in the number of members should be prudent and\nmoderate, so that the Council is guaranteed maximum\npossible operating efficiency. In addition, any expansion\nshould avoid the creation of unjustifiable imbalances in the\nrepresentation of the various regions of the world. The\nArgentine Republic believes that the principle of the\nsovereign equality of Member States must always be\nrespected. Furthermore, none of the provisions of Article\n23 of the Charter should be disregarded. For all these\nreasons, it would seem preferable to think in terms of a\nlimited increase in the number of non-permanent members\nand, as far as possible, the elimination of restrictions on\ntheir re-election.\nWe find ourselves on the eve of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Organization. Let us make the best use\nof the system of collective security and the mechanisms of\neconomic and social cooperation provided by the Charter.\nI have no doubt that by doing so we shall have a much\nbetter world in the next 50 years, one worth living in for\nour children and our children\u2019s children.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure, at\nthe outset, to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection and to wish you and the members of the Bureau\nevery success in the discharge of your duties. Your\nelection is a mark of the confidence and high regard in\nwhich both you and your country are held by the\ninternational community. Your wisdom and your\nforbearance will be crucial to the successful outcome of\nthe current session.\nI should like to express deep appreciation for the\nexemplary manner in which your predecessor conducted\nthe work of the Assembly during his tenure last year. I\nalso wish to express my gratitude to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless\nefforts to enhance the Organization\u2019s ability to meet the\nchallenges of a rapidly evolving world.\nIt is gratifying to observe that the membership of the\nUnited Nations now encompasses several recently\nindependent States. We share bonds of religious and\ncultural affinity with some; we share friendships and\nmutual respect with all. We hope that the principle of\nuniversality, which has always been the cornerstone of the\nUnited Nations, will soon encompass the remaining\n15\n\n\npeoples and regions, so that this Organization can truly\nrepresent the collective conscience of mankind.\nIt is, I believe, fitting to extend heartfelt\ncongratulations to President Nelson Mandela, to\nVice-President Frederik De Klerk, and to the people of\nSouth Africa. They have together established a new order\nin their country, one founded on justice and equality. The\nworld rejoices at the return of South Africa to the fold of\nthe international community of nations. The South African\npeople have proved that peace is always possible, so long\nas all are given the chance to participate in its building.\nThis is a theme that bears consideration.\nAs we approach a landmark in the history of the\nUnited Nations - the fiftieth anniversary of its foundation -\nit is appropriate to look forward rather than back; to take\nstock of things to come rather than things past. It is\nappropriate to consider the shape that our global order is\ntaking.\nSouth Africa offers a new paradigm, a fresh vision for\na changing world. It shows us that a new order must have\nroom for everyone. We must be able to listen to all voices:\nto the weak and the powerful alike. A new order must be\ninclusive and must actively encourage participation at every\nlevel: for in our ever- more interdependent world, the\nfuture of one is the future of all. This, I believe, goes to the\nvery heart of global peace.\nWe are called upon, then, to articulate a new\napproach. We must protect the rule of law, but we must go\nfurther, and ensure that democracy, pluralism and respect\nfor human rights come to govern the life of nations. We\nmust evolve new procedures of cooperation, communication\nand accommodation. We must promote social\nresponsibility, national commitment and international\nobligation. Nations must learn to coexist with their\nneighbours; but more than this, they must learn to work\nwillingly together as partners in the enterprise of peace.\nSuch a transformation is taking place in the Middle\nEast. My region has been synonymous with conflict and\nwar for decades. At last we have an historic opportunity to\nresolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, and to fashion in its place\na new commonwealth of peace, hope and participation for\nall.\nThe question of Palestine has been Jordan\u2019s main\nconcern. Family ties, geographic contiguity, and shared\nhistory and traditions ensure that this is so. Over the years,\nJordan has extended support and encouragement to our\nPalestinian brethren. Our contributions and sacrifices to\nthe Palestinian cause from 1948 onwards have been\nwidely acknowledged. My country has received\nsuccessive waves of refugees and returnees, at a huge cost\nto our economy, imposing an impossible burden on our\nlimited resources. Yet we remain committed to our\ndemocratization process, to the protection of civil liberties\nand human rights, and to the provision of decent living\nconditions and services for all our citizens. Underlying\nthis commitment is our belief that broad-based popular\ninvolvement in civil society is fundamental to its health.\nThis is why Jordan has been able to weather the ravages\nof war, to survive the long years of turmoil in our region.\nIf Jordan has been on the front line of war, so too\nhas it been on the front line of peace. In those well-\nknown words of Security Council resolution 242 (1967),\nwhich my country helped to draft, Jordan has always\nworked steadfastly for a just, lasting and comprehensive\npeace in the Middle East. We promoted the genesis of\nthe current process with the Madrid Conference of 1991.\nWhen the Israeli Government of the day refused to\nnegotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO), Jordan stepped into the breach, helping the\nPalestinians to assume their proper role by providing an\numbrella for their participation.\nNow the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of\nthe Palestinian people, is negotiating directly with Israel.\nThey are installed in Gaza and Jericho, and conduct their\naffairs as they see fit: their destiny is at last in their own\nhands. Jordan welcomes these developments, and will\ncontinue to do everything in its power to ensure the\nsuccess of Palestinian autonomy arrangements.\nOn the Jordanian-Israeli track, our common agenda\nhas paved the way for us to agree upon modalities in\nareas such as water, the environment, energy, territory,\nborders and regional security. These agreements resulted\nin the meeting between His Majesty King Hussein and\nPrime Minister Rabin of Israel, on 25 July 1994, at which\nthey signed the Washington Declaration. This historic\ndocument ended the state of war between Jordan and\nIsrael. I myself have just held constructive talks with\nPresident Clinton and Foreign Minister Peres, the goal of\nwhich is to build a framework of trilateral development as\nwell as an economic equilibrium in the region, and to\nmaintain the momentum towards peace.\nJordan and Israel are engaged in substantive talks,\nseeking just and mutually agreeable solutions to the\noutstanding issues listed in our common agenda. Our aim\n16\n\n\nis to conclude a treaty of peace based on solid grounds that\ncan withstand the winds of change. Such a treaty, we\nbelieve, will delineate our rights and duties under\nconditions of peace. It will open the door to cooperation at\nthe regional level, so that the benefits of peace may be\nenjoyed by our peoples. It has always been Jordan\u2019s vision\nthat the Middle East, cradle of civilization and birthplace of\nthe three great monotheistic religions, should be a region of\ncultural tolerance and mutual interdependence.\nImportant as our bilateral talks with Israel may be, we\nare keenly aware that no two nations stand alone. Our aim\nremains a comprehensive peace. Many of the issues we are\ncurrently addressing defy the confines of bilateralism and\nrequire regional and international participation.\nOne such issue concerns the spiritual significance of\nthe city of Jerusalem. For believers in the three great\nmonotheistic faiths, Jerusalem must be the ultimate symbol\nof peace and its glorious manifestation. A final settlement\non the political and administrative status of the city,\nhowever, will occur in negotiations between Palestinians\nand Israelis. Any arrangement reached must serve the\nneeds of the millions of followers of Islam, Christianity and\nJudaism.\nThe economic dimension of peace is likewise a\ntransnational concern. The economies of the Middle East\nhave been shattered by the conflict. They must be revived\nif peace is to take root on the ground. Access to more\nequitable opportunities for economic growth will be vital.\nInternational debt relief and write-off strategies should be\nplanned, encompassing improved concessionary terms by\nthe Clubs of Paris and London.\nBut the States of the region must also play their part.\nRestrictions on trade should be relaxed. We must develop\na non-discriminatory approach to sustainable development\nand economic well-being. We hope that the Middle\nEast-North Africa Economic Summit at Casablanca will\nbuild on the achievements of the Regional Economic\nDevelopment Working Group and prove a useful forum to\nexplore the potential partnership between Governments,\nprivate businesses and international financial institutions -\nfor this partnership surely holds the key to the economic\nfuture of the region.\nInternational changes wrought by the end of the cold\nwar have affected the political situation in the Middle East\nas elsewhere. The transformation of world power politics\nhas been accompanied by a shift in attitude, modifying the\ncost benefit calculus of regional States. National strategic\nobjectives can no longer be sought at the cost of others in\na supposedly \\\"zero sum game\\\". In the context of a\nregional security regime, the size, the role and the\nfunction of the armed forces in individual States of the\nregion are likely to undergo radical changes. These will\nfavour peace-keeping functions, allowing scarce resources\nto be released for development needs.\nln this context, Jordan fully supports the five\ndimensions of world peace and security outlined by the\nSecretary-General. I would like to add that Jordan\nsupports the ongoing effort to streamline the United\nNations, and fully endorses the attempt to increase the\nnumber of permanent members on the Security Council.\nWe also support the American proposal that\npeace-keeping operations be strengthened by additional\npersonnel, more effective field capabilities, greater\ncooperation between the United Nations and participating\ncountries and a more united approach to training.\nHere again, Jordan is at the forefront of change.\nOur armed forces as peace-keepers under the United\nNations command as far afield as Georgia, Angola and\nthe former Yugoslavia value the opportunity to take part\nin these missions, for in a very real sense, they allow us\nto participate in the unfolding world order. Jordan is\nproud to be involved in shaping global security\narrangements.\nAs the peace process develops, it will be necessary\nto promote a common regional identity and a shared\nregional vision. All the Middle East must contribute to\nthe articulation of this vision. The key, again, is\nparticipation. If the countries and peoples of the region\nhave a say in shaping its future, they will have a stake in\nits success. And success will accordingly be all the more\nlikely; for the diversity of our region is a positive asset\nthat we must learn to use creatively. We will inevitably\ndiffer on certain issues, just as we will agree on others.\nBut we must be able to discuss our views in the\nknowledge that they will be heard, for honest\ncommunication is the basis of genuine involvement in any\njoint enterprise.\nIn this spirit, Jordan feels honour-bound to register\nits concern over threats to the process of global\nreconciliation. Inertia must not be allowed to dominate\nthe conduct of world affairs. Deep-seated conflicts will\nnot disappear by themselves. We urge the international\ncommunity of States to take swift action to facilitate their\nresolution.\n17\n\n\nOne glaring example is the ongoing situation in Bosnia\nHerzegovina. The appalling practices of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\"\nand genocide continue even as we speak. My country\nabhors these atrocities. Jordan supports all the international\ncommunity\u2019s efforts to end this tragic and wasteful conflict,\nand we have taken positive steps to alleviate the hardship\nit has caused. Jordan has joined the Non-Aligned\nMovement\u2019s task force on Bosnia. Our soldiers, who form\nthe second largest contingent of the United Nations\npeace-keeping effort in the Balkans, are engaged in both\nhumanitarian relief and peace-keeping duties. Jordan has\nsupported the Vienna and Washington Agreements to\nestablish a federation between the Muslims and Croats of\nBosnia, and has welcomed the peace plan advanced by the\nContact Group, supported by the G-7 summit in Naples.\nThe Serbian challenge to the plan, in the face of Muslim\nand Croat acceptance, is cause for deep disappointment.\nI turn now to the situation in the Gulf. The\nimportance of stability and security cannot be overstated.\nInternational norms must be observed; the territorial\nintegrity of all States must be preserved. Their sovereignty\nand political independence must be upheld on the basis of\nnon-interference in their internal affairs. My country also\nwishes to reiterate its serious concern for the plight of the\npeople of Iraq, where living conditions are deteriorating\nrapidly. We intend to do our utmost to alleviate the\nsuffering of the Iraqi people, so far as is consistent with the\nprovisions of United Nations resolutions.\nThe distorted image of Islam remains a cause for\ngrave concern. The attention of this body should be turned\nto the spreading of Islamophobia, or hate for Muslims.\nThis phenomenon occurs in all manner of ways, from the\npurely verbal to the bluntly physical. Its proponents deal\nin inflammatory rhetoric. They preach the inevitability of\ncultural apocalypse, tarring all Muslims with the brush of\nfanatical extremism. They ignore the fact that Islam is a\nbroad and adaptable concept and institution. One billion\nMuslims now live on this earth. Thus, Islam encompasses\nall shades of political opinion, different patterns of\ntheological thought, and countless varieties of human\nexperience.\nJordan urges Member States to join forces in bringing\nabout a better understanding of Islam as a religion, a\nculture and a civilization. The expression of anti-Muslim\nsentiment, and other manifestations of Islamophobia, should\nbe monitored and combated by educational campaigns,\ncultural exchanges and similar endeavours. We have\nalways advocated an interfaith dialogue as the surest way\nto combat bigotry and stereotyping.\nMore than a decade ago now, I stood before this\nAssembly and called, on behalf of my country, for a new\ninternational humanitarian order. That led to the\nestablishment of the Independent Commission on\nInternational Humanitarian Issues. The Commission was\ncharged with investigating a wide range of pressing\nhumanitarian issues. It performed its duties well,\nproducing a series of reports that made clear the scale of\nthe impending global humanitarian disaster.\nIt would be comforting to stand before this\nAssembly today and tell it that its work has made a\nsignificant difference. It would be comforting, but it\nwould not be true. A new international humanitarian\norder has not come into being. The powerless remain\npowerless. The dispossessed have not recovered their\nbirthrights. There are more refugees, more street\nchildren, more innocent victims of conflict than ever\nbefore. What is worse, these issues are still addressed in\na piecemeal fashion. It is often said that one should not\ntry to treat a mass of symptoms, but to seek out root\ncauses. Remarkably, it sometimes seems that far from\nseeking causes we are doing our best to ignore the\nsymptoms.\nToday, I have tried to address causes. I have spoken\nof the fundamental need for participation at all levels. I\nhave put before the Assembly a vision of a global order\ncharacterized by partnership and communication, tolerance\nand trust. In some places this vision is on the road to\nrealization; in others, it has seldom been more remote.\nThe alternatives are very clear, and the choice is ours.\nI pledge my country\u2019s full support to this\nOrganization, for as we move towards the twenty-first\ncentury, and as the Organization moves towards its\nfiftieth anniversary, the ideal that inspired the Charter of\nthe United Nations has never been more important.\n"

        "file_text": "May I at the outset\nexpress my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your\nelection to the important post of President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session.\nThe loss of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic Sea, where\nmore than 900 people perished, brought disaster close to\nour shores. The shock still lingers in the hearts and minds\nof all people around the Baltic. I am certain that this tragic\nevent will in the end bring the stricken peoples even closer\ntogether. Let me convey our sincere gratitude for the\nsympathy and condolences that have been expressed in this\nAssembly.\nSweden\u2019s commitment to the United Nations and its\nprinciples and ideals is longstanding, firm and deep. To the\nnew Swedish Government this commitment is crucial. The\nfiftieth anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations is\napproaching. It is perhaps the most important political\ndocument in the hands of humanity today. Its strength and\npotential are immense and must be brought to fruition.\nIn the spirit of the Charter, world leaders should\nmobilize a global civic spirit of solidarity to extend the\nscope of and respect for international law and to\nstrengthen global governance. The United Nations gives\nus an international system of law to avoid anarchy and\nthe rule of the strongest. The United Nations enables us\nto work together to thwart ruthless assertion of\nself-interest and spheres of influence.\nSweden wants a United Nations which reacts\neffectively against atrocities and mitigates human\nsuffering and through which we can tackle the major\nquestions of global survival, together and in solidarity.\nSweden wants a United Nations that not only is a forum\nfor the interests of States but that places the well-being of\nthe individual at the centre. Solidarity does not recognize\nborders. Let me quote from the statement of the\nPresident of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, in this\nAssembly a week ago:\n\\\"The millions across our globe who stand expectant\nat the gates of hope look to this Organization to\nbring them peace, to bring them life, to bring them\na life worth living.\\\" (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 14th meeting, p. 10)\nThese expectations and hopes are threatened by war\nand violence, by the suppression of human rights, and by\nracism and xenophobia. They are threatened by\nstarvation, poverty, disasters and environmental\ndegradation. Peace and security, democracy, human\n\n\nrights and sustainable economic and social development\nconstitute a cohesive entity. If we neglect any of these\nvalues, we endanger the others.\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania are here among us in\nthis Assembly as democratic and sovereign countries from\nwhich Russian troops have at long last been withdrawn.\nDiplomatic breakthroughs in the Middle East offer hopes\nfor a comprehensive and lasting peace. In El Salvador the\nUnited Nations has made a significant contribution to\nending the civil war. In South Africa, the apartheid has\nbeen dismantled.\nYet we are confronted with new conflicts and dangers.\nWe must all learn from tragic events such as those in\nRwanda and Somalia. The inconceivable suffering in\nRwanda points to the need for preventive diplomacy, early\naction and the coordination of United Nations efforts. In\nSomalia, the break-up of organized society and the ensuing\nlarge-scale violence and starvation underline the need for\nthe careful coordination of peace-keeping, peacemaking and\npeace-building endeavours.\nWhile taking a forceful attitude to gain respect, the\nUnited Nations should avoid military enforcement other\nthan as a very last resort and with a clear Security Council\nmandate.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina and in other parts of the\nformer Yugoslavia, efforts to end the conflict must be\nintensified and accepted by all parties. Pressure on Bosnian\nSerbs has to be further increased. Only in peace can the\ntragic consequences of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" be reversed.\nNow is the time to work out plans for reconstruction and\nreconciliation.\nThe Swedish Government is concerned about\ninformation on Iraqi military activity close to the border\nwith Kuwait. We fully support the statement on the\nsituation made by the Security Council three days ago.\nIn facing the challenges of the post-cold-war\ninternational system, Member States must give their full\nsupport to the United Nations, but they must also actively\npromote necessary reforms of the Organization. The\nCommission on Global Governance, headed by the Swedish\nPrime Minister and by Mr. Ramphal, will present proposals\nfor reform early next year.\nLet me mention a few areas where, in my view,\nreform is urgently needed.\nThe United Nations must be able to operate more\nefficiently and according to modern principles of\nmanagement, and new priorities have to be set.\nWe need an enlarged and more effective Security\nCouncil, one that is both legitimate and representative.\nThere is a need for increased transparency in the work of\nthe Council. Countries in all regions must feel that they\nare partners in its actions. The Council has to maintain\npolitical control over the actions it authorizes. It must not\nbecome an instrument for dividing the world into spheres\nof interest, one in which the collective nature of United\nNations action is not sufficiently safeguarded.\nSweden has drawn experience from its participation\nin the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).\nSubstantive consultations between troop contributors, the\nSecretariat and Security Council members on a formal\nand regular basis are necessary.\nThere must be a particular focus on early warning\nand early action in conflict resolution. Preventive\ndiplomacy should be further strengthened. Thousands of\nlives can be saved and costly relief efforts avoided if\naction is taken in time.\nThe new Swedish Government is ready to establish\na United Nations peace-keeping brigade. We do this in\nresponse to the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal for stand-by\nforces set up by Member States, ready to be deployed in\ncrisis areas without delay.\nThe need for better and more uniform training of\npeace-keepers is urgent. Particular attention should be\npaid to improved coordination between the military\naspects of peace-keeping and civilian and humanitarian\nefforts. With this in mind, Sweden is prepared to\ncontribute to improved training of peace-keepers.\nSweden would like to see closer interaction between\nhumanitarian programmes and peace-keeping operations.\nThere is great potential for humanitarian action as a tool\nof preventive diplomacy, as well as for promoting a\npolitical climate that can facilitate the peaceful settlement\nof disputes at an early stage.\nThe reluctance of Member States to pay their dues\nin full and on time is frustrating and must cease\nimmediately. When this lack of discipline affects the\nfinancing of peace-keeping operations, it puts an\nadditional burden on the troop contributors.\n2\n\n\nSweden welcomes measures by the Department of\nHumanitarian Affairs to coordinate the activities of\nhumanitarian agencies and many non-governmental\norganizations.\nHuman rights is another area of priority for the\nSwedish Government. Fortunately, there is a growing and\nwidening awareness among Member States of the role of\nhuman rights and democracy for the development of\nmodern societies. Binding norms protecting human rights\nexist, yet violations continue. This is unacceptable.\nGovernments must show the will and commitment to fully\nimplement human rights norms.\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child was a great\nachievement. It is indeed a great challenge to assure all\nchildren of care, protection, education and freedom from\nhunger and from physical or mental violence, as provided\nfor in the Convention and reaffirmed at the World Summit\nfor Children. Governments which have ratified the\nConvention must live up to their commitments to the\nchildren of the world.\nSolidarity is fundamental in our efforts to overcome\nglobal economic and social challenges, and, thus,\nfundamental to prospects for peace and solidarity. The\nUnited Nations has a unique and central role in this\nendeavour.\nSweden\u2019s development cooperation will focus on\nsupport for the long-term, sustainable development of poor\ncountries, with special emphasis on democracy, popular\nparticipation and the rights of women and children.\nSweden will continue to allocate a substantial amount\nof its assistance to operational activities in the United\nNations. We will also continue our efforts to strengthen the\nUnited Nations function as a forum for normative\ndiscussion and action and as a channel for development\ncooperation. The quality and effectiveness of United\nNations activities in the economic and social field have to\nbe improved, while at the same a stable and predictable\nflow of resources is secured.\nPriorities and the allocation of responsibilities within\nthe international community need to be discussed further.\n\\\"An Agenda for Development\\\" (A/48/935) is a key\ninstrument in this endeavour. We must use it to draw up\na clear and strategic programme of action for the United\nNations system in the development area.\nThe International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment in Cairo, the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment to be held in Copenhagen, and the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women in Beijing are all linked.\nThey contribute to the achievement of human security in\na broader sense.\nThe Cairo Conference established that questions of\npopulation and development must be treated together.\nThe starting-point must be the human being and the rights\nand security of the individual.\nAgenda 21, adopted at the Rio Conference,\nfacilitates joint action to achieve sustainable development\nat both the local and the global level. All over Sweden\nlocal versions of Agenda 21 are now being actively\npursued.\nIt is imperative to stop wasting resources and\nthereby depriving future generations of their means of\nlivelihood. Patterns of consumption and production must\nbe sustainable. In this regard, the developed countries\nhave a particular responsibility. Ecological balance must\nbe established also while we combat poverty.\nDisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction are central to the goals of preventing\nconflicts, promoting peace and fostering economic and\nsocial development. In recent years important progress\nhas been made. Agreements that were inconceivable only\na few years ago have been concluded. But signatures are\nnot enough. Agreements must also be ratified and\nimplemented if they are to contribute to peace and\nsecurity.\nFurthermore, the present momentum should be used\nto strengthen and further develop well-established\ndisarmament regimes. The need to establish a verification\nsystem for the Convention on biological weapons is a\ncase in point.\nThe non-proliferation Treaty is a key to both nuclear\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. The Treaty is the\nonly multilateral agreement in which nuclear-weapon\nStates have committed themselves to nuclear\ndisarmament. As long as nuclear weapons exist, we must\ninsist that these commitments be honoured. It is not least\nwith this in mind that the extension of the Treaty should\nbe pursued. Our common goal must be a world free of\nnuclear arms.\n3\n\n\nOn several occasions, Sweden has presented proposals\nfor a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We are gratified that\nall States, including the nuclear-weapon States, are now\nprepared to negotiate such a treaty. It is essential that these\nnegotiations be concluded in the very near future.\nSweden was one of the first countries to ratify the\nchemical weapons Convention. So far, almost 160 States\nhave signed the Convention, but only 16 have ratified it.\nWe urge all States to take the necessary steps for\nratification, so that the Convention can enter into force\nwithout delay.\nSome 100 million land-mines all over the world\nrepresent both an acute and an impending humanitarian\ndisaster as well as a threat to economic development, even\nyears and decades after hostilities have ceased. The\nlong-term solution is an international agreement to ban\nanti-personnel land-mines. Sweden has proposed such a\nban.\nRegional instruments for preventing and dealing with\nconflicts are being developed. This should not deprive the\nregions involved of support from the international\ncommunity through the United Nations. The responsibility\nof the United Nations, including the Security Council,\nremains universal.\nThe Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (CSCE) is a central and indispensable institution for\nconflict prevention and management. The endeavours of\nthe CSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities have\neffectively contributed to building security in Europe, as\nhave the CSCE missions in the field.\nThe Swedish experience of cooperation between the\nCSCE and the United Nations tells us that global and\nregional efforts are not in contradiction but are mutually\nreinforcing.\nSweden\u2019s non-participation in military alliances\nremains unchanged. This policy contributes to the\nmaintenance of stability in the north of Europe, and\nimproves our possibilities of working for common security\nin Europe and in the world at large.\nSweden will actively contribute to the new security\npartnership in Europe by responding rapidly to requests\nfrom the United Nations, and by contributing substantially\nto activities of the Council of Europe, the CSCE and the\nPartnership for Peace arrangement. We want to strengthen\ncooperation with all our neighbours around the Baltic Sea\nand in the Barents Sea region. We look forward to\ncooperation in all areas with the new, democratic Russia.\nSweden has applied for membership in the European\nUnion. In one month the people of Sweden will decide\non this important question in a referendum. As a member\nof the Union, Sweden would whole-heartedly support the\nUnion\u2019s efforts to promote security and economic and\nsocial development, not only in Europe but on a global\nscale. It is by looking outwards, by forging links and\nextending its cooperation to other regions, that the\nEuropean Union makes its contribution to global stability\nand solidarity. Let me emphasize that there is no\ncontradiction between European and global cooperation.\nSweden will be an active member of the United Nations\nand defend openness and international cooperation.\nSweden has presented its candidature for a seat on\nthe Security Council for the period 1997 to 1998. The\nSwedish candidature is based on our commitment to\nglobal security, on our will to promote international law,\nand on our conviction that conflicts can and must be\nsolved by addressing their root causes before they lead to\nwar.\nSweden\u2019s support for the United Nations is a\nfundamental national interest and a cornerstone in our\nforeign policy, for reasons of peace, freedom, security,\ndemocracy and justice. For these reasons, Sweden will\nstrongly promote the United Nations \u2014 a United Nations\nbased on democratic principles, giving us all a voice in\nour common future.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I should like warmly to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of\nthe current session of the General Assembly. I am\nconvinced that given your outstanding talent and\nconsummate experience, you will fulfil this lofty mission\nwith distinction. At the same time, I should like to express\nmy appreciation and thanks to Mr. Samuel Insanally for the\npositive contribution he made during his presidency at the\nlast session.\nI wish to avail myself of this opportunity to extend a\nhearty welcome and congratulations to the delegation of\nSouth Africa, which is taking part in the work of the\ncurrent session. We are convinced that a united,\ndemocratic and non-racial new South Africa led by\nPresident Nelson Mandela will contribute positively to the\npeace and development of Africa and of the world as a\nwhole.\nThe world is still undergoing profound changes, and\nthe transition toward multipolarity has accelerated.\nEconomic factors are playing a greater role in\ninternational relations. Relaxation of tensions has become\nthe main trend of the world today. However,\nhegemonism and power politics continue to hold out.\nRegional hot spots flare up intermittently. Destabilizing\nfactors tend to multiply, thus compounding the volatility\nof the international scene. The maintenance of peace,\nstrengthening of cooperation and promotion of\ndevelopment remain the major challenges of our era.\nTo eliminate regional hot spots and settle\ninternational disputes are the world\u2019s priorities and the\ncommon concern with which the international community\nhas been trying to deal in one way or another.\nExperience has shown that such practices as interfering in\nother countries\u2019 internal affairs and resorting to pressure,\nsanctions or even force at will cannot help; they can only\nincrease the complications and difficulties that stand in\nthe way of a final solution. In the interest of maintaining\nregional peace and stability, the international community\nand regional organizations should take an appropriate and\neffective approach, that is, to promote dialogue and\nnegotiations between parties directly concerned so as to\nreach a solution acceptable to all sides. This has been\nbest illustrated by the breakthrough achieved in the\nMiddle East peace process and by the progress made on\nthe Korean nuclear issue.\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations can play a\npositive role, but not all of them have been successful.\nExperience and lessons learned in this regard should be\nsummed up. It is our consistent view that peace-keeping\noperations should strictly conform to the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter and the norms of international\nrelations. Such operations should be undertaken with the\nconsent and cooperation of the parties concerned, and an\nimpartial and unbiased attitude should be maintained. No\npeace-keeping operations or humanitarian aid programmes\nshould be permitted to interfere in the internal affairs of\nany country, still less to use force or become embroiled\nin a conflict between the parties. A lesson should be\ndrawn from what befell the United Nations peace-keeping\nforces in Somalia.\nHere I wish to underline the importance of strict\nadherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence\nas the basic means to prevent international conflicts.\n9\n\n\nThese principles, namely, mutual respect for sovereignty\nand territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression,\nnon-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs, equality\nand mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, were jointly\ninitiated four decades ago by China, India and Myanmar -\ncalled \\\"Burma\\\" at the time - and were subsequently\nembodied in the 10 principles formulated by Asian and\nAfrican countries at the Bandung Conference and in the\npurposes and principles espoused by the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations and other regional organizations\nof the developing countries.\nThe history of the past four decades has testified to\nthe immense vitality of the Five Principles. All nations,\nnotwithstanding their differences in social systems,\nideologies, values or religious faiths, can live in amity and\ncarry out mutually beneficial cooperation as long as they\nabide by these principles. Failure to do so will lead to\nfriction, confrontation or even military conflicts. In a world\nas diversified as ours, nations have no alternative but to\nadhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and\nto find common ground while shelving their differences in\norder to live together amicably and pursue common\ndevelopment.\nThe peoples of the world have long lived in the\nshadow of a nuclear holocaust, due to the all-out nuclear\narms race between the two super-Powers during the cold\nwar, which resulted in a massive stockpiling of nuclear\nweapons. Now the international situation has drastically\nchanged. Not only can we avert another world war, but the\nchances have increased for the complete prohibition and\nthorough elimination of nuclear weapons and for mankind\nultimately to eliminate the threat of a nuclear war.\nChina has always stood for the complete prohibition\nand thorough elimination of all weapons of mass\ndestruction. The Chinese Government holds that a\nconvention on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons\nshould be concluded in the same way as the conventions\nbanning all biological and chemical weapons, respectively.\nAs a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, China is in favour of its extension. Yet\na mere extension of the Treaty is obviously not sufficient.\nWith a view to ultimately ridding mankind of the threat of\na nuclear war and ushering in a nuclear-weapon-free world,\nthe Chinese Government proposes the following.\nAll countries that possess nuclear weapons should\npledge unconditionally not to be the first to use them and\nshould immediately start negotiations to conclude a treaty\non non-first-use of nuclear weapons against each other;\nefforts for the establishment of nuclear-free zones should\nbe supported and all nuclear Powers should undertake not\nto use or to threaten to use nuclear weapons against any\nnon-nuclear-weapon State or nuclear-free zone;\nnegotiations should be undertaken with a view to\nconcluding a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty not\nlater than 1996; the principal nuclear Powers should\nimplement their existing nuclear disarmament treaties as\nscheduled and go on to drastically cut back their nuclear\nstockpiles; negotiations should be undertaken to conclude\na convention banning the production of weapon-grade\nfissile materials; a convention on the complete prohibition\nof nuclear weapons should be signed under which all\nnuclear Powers should undertake the obligation to destroy\nall their nuclear weapons under effective international\nsupervision; and international cooperation in the peaceful\nuse of nuclear energy should be vigorously promoted\nsimultaneously with the efforts to prevent the proliferation\nof nuclear weapons and step up the nuclear disarmament\nprocess.\nThe above points make up an integrated and\ninterrelated nuclear disarmament process. We hold that\nall States, whether they possess nuclear weapons or not,\nare entitled to participate fully in this process.\nSince mankind has been able to make nuclear\nweapons and tap nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in\nthe twentieth century, we are confident that in the twenty-\nfirst century it will be able to completely ban and destroy\nnuclear weapons and fully harness nuclear energy to\nenhance its own welfare. Before the advent of the new\ncentury, we stand ready to join the other nuclear as well\nas non-nuclear States to blaze the way towards this lofty\ngoal and make our due contribution to its ultimate\nrealization.\nIt is now an international trend to give priority to\neconomic problems. Hence all countries are devoting\nthemselves to economic development and the expansion\nof international cooperation. This year the world\neconomy has started a recovery and East Asia continues\nto maintain a high growth rate. But there is unevenness\nin the world as a whole. It is disturbing to note that the\nimpoverishment of some developing countries has\nworsened. In the interest of common development, we\ncall for the abolition of protectionism and of\ndiscrimination in international economic relations and\ntrade. Neither global multilateral trade arrangements nor\nregional economic and trade cooperation should be\nexclusive. The principles of openness, equality and\nmutual benefit should be upheld. The World Trade\n10\n\n\nOrganization, to be founded next year, should from the\noutset be a broadly representative and open trade institution\nbased on equality and mutual benefit.\nThe world economy is an interdependent whole.\nDeveloped countries should make more tangible\ncontributions to global economic development and the\nexpansion of international economic cooperation. Primarily\nthey should take effective measures to open their markets,\nprovide development funds, transfer technology and\nincrease assistance to the developing countries to reduce\ntheir debt burden, thereby contributing to their economic\ngrowth, social stability and relief from poverty. Such\nactions will in turn bolster the economic growth of the\ndeveloped countries themselves.\nThe international community and the United Nations\nshould be more concerned with development matters and in\nparticular should actively help the developing countries to\nachieve prosperity. We appreciate the Secretary-General\u2019s\nefforts in submitting the Agenda for Development pursuant\nto General Assembly resolutions. We hope that our\ndeliberations thereon will serve to reinvigorate world\neconomic development and international cooperation.\nThe Chinese Government considers economic\ndevelopment the central task of the whole nation and makes\nreform and opening its basic state policy. This year we\nhave taken a new series of major steps to intensify the\nreform and opening which have the effect of ensuring\nsustained, rapid and healthy economic growth. Gross\ndomestic product, foreign trade volume and overseas\ninvestments registered increases in the first six months of\n11.6 per cent, 25.5 per cent and 54.9 per cent respectively,\ncompared with the corresponding period last year. We will\nstep up our all-directional opening-up and continue to work\nfor world prosperity. We have been striving for an early\nresumption of our contracting party status in the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. A solution to this matter\nwill be in the interest of both China and the world as a\nwhole. China needs to cooperate with the rest of the world\nwhich in turn needs such an important trading partner as\nChina. A World Trade Organization without China would\nbe inconceivable.\nHuman society continues to move forward and make\nprogress. But social ills still stand out starkly such as\npoverty, unemployment, the deteriorating environment, the\npopulation explosion, refugees, illegal immigration, drug\ntrafficking, crime and injurious and unfair treatment of\nsocial groups such as women, children and the disabled.\nSome of these problems have become even more acute, and\nhave cried out for a remedy by the world community\nthrough international cooperation. We consider that it is\nnecessary to step up such cooperation. Because\nconditions vary, different countries face different social\nproblems. Each country has to draw up social\ndevelopment policies adaptable to its own conditions.\nInternational cooperation in this field should adhere to the\nprinciples of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit\nwithout political strings or interference in domestic\naffairs. Developing countries account for the majority of\nthe world\u2019s population and are in a disadvantaged position\nsocially. This is where the emphasis of the United\nNations social programmes should be placed.\nIn recent years we have actively supported and\nparticipated in important international conferences on the\nenvironment, human rights and population under the\nauspices of the United Nations. We will actively take\npart in the World Summit for Social Development, to be\nheld in Copenhagen next March. The Chinese\nGovernment attaches great importance to the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing in\nSeptember 1995. The Chinese people, our women folk in\nparticular, are preparing for and looking forward to this\ngrand event with tremendous enthusiasm.\nIn response to the call in the documents of the 1992\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, the Chinese Government has analysed the\nactual conditions in the country and drawn up \\\"Agenda 21\n- White Paper on China\u2019s Population, Environment and\nDevelopment in the 21st Century\\\", which will be an\nimportant guide in the formulation of our medium- and\nlong-term national, economic and social development\nplans.\nTo ensure and protect human rights is an essential\npart of a nation\u2019s social policy. My Government makes\nit a basic policy to constantly enhance the people\u2019s\nenjoyment of human rights commensurate with our\neconomic and social development. We always hold that\nthe principle of universality of human rights must be\nviewed in the context of the actual conditions of a given\ncountry. Conditions vary from country to country. It is\ninevitable and normal that there is divergence of views on\nhuman rights issues. We are in favour of dialogue on the\nbasis of equality and mutual respect so as to increase\nmutual understanding. We are against using human rights\nas a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of other\ncountries.\n11\n\n\nNext year will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations. Both the world and the\nUnited Nations have undergone drastic changes in that half\ncentury. The United Nations is the most representative\nintergovernmental Organization of sovereign States.\nMembers of the Organization are equal, irrespective of size,\nstrength or wealth.\nNotwithstanding its shortcomings, the status and role\nof the United Nations in global international affairs remain\nirreplaceable by any other international organizations or\ngroupings. It is the hope of the people of the world that\nthe Organization will better fulfil the mission conferred on\nit by the Charter and and that it will make even greater\ncontributions to the maintenance of peace and the\npromotion of development.\nTo cope with the greatly changed international\nsituation and grim challenges ahead, United Nations\ninstitutions should undergo relevant and necessary reforms.\nIn our view, any such reforms should serve to maintain and\nenhance the positive role of the United Nations in\ninternational affairs and improve its efficiency. At the\nsame time, the reforms should take full account of the\nconcerns and interests of the developing countries, which\nmake up the majority of the membership, so that their role\nmay be enhanced. The function and role of the General\nAssembly should be strengthened. Reform of the Security\nCouncil must be aimed at facilitating a better performance\nof its functions under the Charter. Any enlargement of the\nCouncil\u2019s membership must fully conform to the principle\nof equitable geographical distribution to ensure broader\nrepresentation. Actions by the Council should better reflect\nthe collective will and common aspirations of the entire\nUnited Nations membership.\nTo prepare for the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, China has set up a\nnational committee, in accordance with the relevant United\nNations resolution. We hope that the commemoration in\nvarious countries in the coming year will be used to review\nthe experience of the past and look to the future so that we\nmay carry forward the purposes and principles of the\nCharter and enable the Organization to do a better job in\nmaintaining peace and promoting development.\nIt was sad that the first half of our century witnessed\ntwo world wars with disastrous consequences for mankind.\nThe ensuing cold war cast a dark and menacing shadow of\nwar over the world for the greater part of the second half\nof the century. It is gratifying, none the less, that we have\nbeen able to fulfil the historic mission of eliminating the\ncenturies-old colonial system from the Earth within this\ncentury. This is unquestionably one of the greatest\nachievements of contemporary human society.\nLooking ahead to the twenty-first century, we are\nfully confident of the future of humanity. The Chinese\npeople will make common efforts with all other peoples\nof the world to usher in a new century of peace and\nprosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "The honor and the duty of presiding over the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly have been entrusted to you, Mr. President, and, through you, to your country, Cote d\u2019Ivoire. Burkina Faso and all of Africa are moved by this signal honor.\nBeyond the legitimate pride experienced by my delegation, I should like to reaffirm our full readiness to assist you. Your wealth of diplomatic experience, together with your professional and human qualities, will ensure the success of our deliberations.\nYou have succeeded Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who, with discretion and professionalism, determination and logical organization, guided a forty- eighth session that was rich in ideas, initiatives and various kinds of fruitful contacts. We thank him for this.\nThe Secretary-General\tof\tour Organization,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\thas\tconsistently and\ncourageously continued both in word and in deed to chart a course designed to reaffirm the mission of the Organization and to participate in defining the present and future spheres of action of the international community.\nIndeed, vision, courage and patience are virtues of which our world is in dire need. We have moved from the static certainties of the international environment of less than a decade ago to the daily, fluid and dangerous uncertainties that surround us and sometimes overwhelm us, and there is an urgent need to find, or to recover, a reliable compass and collective will and solidarity.\nHowever, we have been witnessing a disintegration of the old order. We must indeed note that the post-cold- war period has been characterized by the simultaneous emergence of heated conflicts that pit nations against each other or rend apart their integral elements. From Bosnia and Herzegovina to Rwanda, the causes and means may differ more or less noticeably, but the immediate consequence is always identical: the enormous suffering of peoples.\nDuring the forty-seventh session of our General Assembly, Burkina Faso stated:\n\\\"In their millions, people are cast out into a life of wandering; children are robbed of their childhood, and of their adolescence too; a future without hope is already the lot of a growing number of people caught in the crossfire between one world that is dying and another that is being bomb\\\". (Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-seventh Session, Plenary Meetings, 21st meeting, p. 86)\nAfrica continues to be shaken by upheavals and crises of all sorts, and particular attention should be paid to them. With regard to Angola, Burkina Faso welcomes the present efforts aimed at implementing the Peace Agreements and supports Security Council resolutions 864 (1993) and 932 (1994). We urge UNITA to negotiate with greater firmness and thus allow the Lusaka meeting to yield the hoped-for results for peace and the well-being of the people of Angola as well as of the subregion.\nAs to Mozambique, it is our hope that the holding of free and democratic elections this month will put an end to so many years of confrontation and will further commit this brotherly country to a course of reconstruction and national reconciliation for development and peace.\nWe hope that a solution can be found in Western Sahara within the framework of a referendum whose terms of reference will be accepted by all.\nWe welcome the fact that in Burundi progress is being made in the process begun and supported both by the United Nations and by the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), and we hope that the election of the President of the Republic on 30 September 1994 will make possible positive developments in this situation very soon. Burkina Faso, within the framework of the OAU, is making its contribution to this process.\nIn Liberia, because of the lack of confidence among the parties, neither the demobilization nor the disarmament provided for in the Cotonou Agreement has fully taken place. These measures had been advocated to bring about an atmosphere propitious to the establishment of democratic institutions. Burkina Faso continues to support the Cotonou Agreement of 25 July 1993 as well as the Akossombo agreement of 12 September last.\nIn Somalia, far from the cameras and the media, the tragedy that was so widely reported by those media two years ago continues. The same players are pursuing the same conflict just as chaotically and relentlessly, without any sign of the will to put an end to it through dialog and negotiation.\nIn Rwanda, the unspeakable tragedy that has combined genocide with intransigence has showed the international community its limits and the procrastination of which it has been guilty. After having hastily decided on a withdrawal during the first weeks of April 1994, the international community, responding to the clamorous indignation of public opinion, was forced to review its position and find a way to return to the scene of the tragedy and attempt to limit its shameful and disastrous development. We should like here to thank those who have wished to confine the irreparable and immeasurable damage within the limits of the restored human conscience. Without an active policy of reconciliation and national reconstruction, it is difficult to envisage a calm and stable future for that brotherly country. In this task, which is enormous in all respects, the Government of Rwanda will need all the assistance that can possibly be given it in a clear-sighted, responsible and committed manner. For its part, Burkina Faso, insofar as it is able, will tirelessly continue to make its contribution to Rwanda.\nAnnoyance, irritation and understandable fatigue now hold sway in the Security Council in its consideration of the questions of Liberia and Somalia; indeed, it is even thinking about leaving those two brotherly countries to their own devices. The reasoning put forward for this is that in an environment marked by a plethora of requests for material, financial and human resources, it is impossible to continue to deal with protagonists who prefer war to the\nloss of a power that has not yet truly even been achieved. It is true that peace cannot be imposed anywhere.\nBurkina Faso is aware of this and experiences it every day as President Blaise Compaore, putting these convictions into practice, engages in subregional mediation and thus makes his contribution to the great African plan for the necessary and indispensable integration of our continent.\nPeace thus must be unremittingly pursued. And the task of diplomats is to work to find acceptable and viable terms.\nShould we then leave all those areas of conflict to their own devices? The answer to this question will tell us more about all of us than about the protagonists of those crises.\nIn Asia and Latin America, the conflict situations with which our Organization is dealing are moving in a direction which gives us reasonable hope to see a settlement very soon. We encourage Kuwait and Iraq to respect resolution 833 (1993) of the Security Council. We are also encouraging dialog between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, as well as negotiations between the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the nuclear issue.\nBurkina Faso has welcomed and hailed the signing on 13 September 1993 of the historic agreement on the Declaration of Principles between President Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin, and also the signature on 4 May 1994 of the Agreement on Gaza and Jericho. Burkina Faso urges that this policy be pursued.\nThe first democratic elections have taken place in South Africa. The South African people now have leaders that they have freely elected. We once again hail the eminence of President Mandela, as well as the merits of Vice-President De Klerk, for having been able, together with the people of South Africa, to lead South Africa towards a democratic and non-racial society. Here among us at last in the United Nations, South Africa will be able to play and fully shoulder its role in the community of nations, thus strengthening that principle of universality that we supported in a recent initiative concerning the Republic of China.\nAll of this indicates the extent to which political upheavals affect, sometimes in an extraordinary fashion\nthe haves of men, women and children on all continents. However, to use an expression that was used four years ago during the World Summit for Children, the world continues inexorably to witness a \\\"silent emergency\\\" that is still going on and is growing.\nThe global economy has experienced a recession that has more brutally and heartlessly affected the developing countries. This state of affairs has exacerbated situations of injustice and flagrant inequality. The improvement of the economic climate of the developing countries hinges on the growth of financial investment flows, on the transfer of technology, on the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers, on just remuneration for commodities and raw materials. This is not new, and it will be reiterated as long as the developing countries do not have a greater say concerning the processes and machinery for decision-making relating to all these questions.\nThis is why an agenda for development is now urgent and of the highest priority. This agenda should put forward specific measures for implementation focused on growth and development, and integrate the strategies and plans for action negotiated and adopted during the United Nations conferences. From Rio to Cairo, it has been possible to obtain consensus, but what is still missing are the new and additional resources with which to implement the decisions taken. In this connection, we hope that the implementation of the International Convention to Combat Desertification, signed in Paris on 14 and 15 October 1994, will not also suffer from this lack.\nWhile the developing countries are fulfilling their share of commitments, the developed countries are balking at making their contributions. This is notably affecting the concept and the implementation of global partnership, which was so highly praised at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.\nWe fear that, as regards the use made of their results, these Conferences have only been understood in terms of their theme, without taking account of development. If these comments are harsh, reality is even more so.\nProblems build up while financial resources dry up. The eradication of poverty, in such a context, will be difficult to bring about and will have fewer chances for success. The commitment undertaken by the developed countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their GNP to public assistance for development has not always been respected, except by a few of them.\nAfrica, more than the other continents, is in a situation that is critical and recognized as such by the United Nations. However, from the Program of Action of the United Nations for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa in 1986, to the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, adopted in 1991, nothing concrete has given concrete form to that commitment by the international community.\nOver the last ten years, the African debt has been discussed ad infinitum, without, however, being reduced or eliminated to an extent likely to allow Africa to relaunch its economy and structure its markets. Several of our partners have made efforts, and we note the decision of the Group of Seven in Naples to expand the Trinidad Conditions to the performing African countries.\nIf this is a step in the right direction, it is not sufficient in a context where, as I said earlier, the deterioration of the terms of trade and the loss of preferential markets are increasing the burden of the debt. We therefore support the efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at establishing a fund for diversification, and we call upon the partners of Africa to play an active and positive role in establishing this fund.\nIn April 1994, the signing in Marrakesh of the Agreements of the Uruguay Round opened a new chapter in international trade relations, more or less establishing the marginalization of Africa, which had already been evident throughout the negotiations. We hope that the recently created World Trade Organization will be able to participate in the creation of a multilateral system of trade based on applicable, non-discriminatory relations, and that in particular it will take account of the interests of the developing countries.\nOn the basis of a concern for independence and for the integration of the global economy, access to resources, markets and technology, preferential assistance and compensation measures must be open to the developing countries. The spirit of this new configuration should not be motivated by charity but rather by the awareness that certain measures must be taken to ensure that the development of the world in partnership and solidarity takes place harmoniously. It is in the interest of all of us.\nThe forthcoming World Summit for Social Development, therefore, should emphasize man's needs and put man at the center of development and of international cooperation in drawing up the objectives and specific commitments which we shall be undertaking. So\ntoo, the World Conference on Women to be held in Beijing will have to continue that work of intensification begun in Cairo during the International Conference on Population and Development: woman, the best agent for development.\nFor half a decade, the Member States of the United Nations have been involved in a series of Conferences that culminated in an acknowledgment of the following facts. The right to development exists. It must be reflected in reality. It is part of human rights. Development is possible only in peace, and peace itself can be maintained only through development. Democracy and development, therefore, are linked.\nOne after the other, the representatives who have spoken have emphasized the role of the United Nations. The Organization is the most valuable multilateral instrument available to nations. It is important that we give it the means to fulfill our ambitions and our projects.\nThe times have compelled us to confine ourselves to finding the answers that must be found for the urgent situations threatening the lives of human beings. Peacekeeping operations currently face unprecedented complexity and difficulty. We salute and thank the 73 nations that are offering their sons and their resources for the purpose of extinguishing flames kindled throughout the world by man's intransigence and madness.\nApart from the question of urgency, there are priorities. If these are understood and dealt with, the emergency situations of tomorrow and beyond will be eased, and we shall come closer to having a more stable, less unjust and more harmonious world.\nA review of the United Nations system - the role, nature and place of the Security Council and of the General Assembly - is one of the urgent priorities that must be addressed if we are not to harm the future. It will become ever more difficult to wish for democracy in the world if democracy is avoided in the functioning and activity of the United Nations.\nA year from now we shall be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of this Organization. The profusion, complexity and simultaneousness of problems relentlessly assail societies and nature. Mankind will be able to face these challenges and difficulties only by assuming and accepting our complementarity and our interdependence. It is that initiative and that momentum which will renew our bond with the ideals proclaimed 49 years ago in a\ndocument signed in San Francisco, which we call the Charter of the United Nations.\nLet us, therefore, be an Organization of truly united nations. This is possible only if there is a spirit of justice, peace and solidarity.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": " It\nis with pleasure that I warmly congratulate Mr. Amara\nEssy on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session. In his election I see\na recognition of the role that C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, a friendly\nAfrican country, has played on the international scene as\nwell as an appreciation of his personal qualities and\nexperience.\nA word of recognition is also in order for the\noutgoing President, Ambassador Samuel Insanally, for his\ndedicated and positive service during the last session of\nthe Assembly.\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, I renew my homage for the secure and\ncommitted manner in which he is carrying out his\nmission. As he already knows, Portugal can be counted\non in the pursuit of the objectives of peace and\ndevelopment and in the consolidation of a substantial\nreform of the United Nations system.\n15\n\n\nMy German colleague has already addressed the\nAssembly on behalf of the 12 member States of the\nEuropean Union, expressing positions to which Portugal\nfully subscribes. Nevertheless, I would like to reflect on\ncertain issues which are of particular importance to my\ncountry.\nThe end of the bipolar era has created, somewhat\nperversely, greater unpredictability and uncertainty in the\nsystem of collective security, which has most visibly led to\na rebirth of extreme nationalism and new focuses of\nconflict. In this perspective, I would like to underline the\nimportance we attach to cooperation between the United\nNations and regional organizations and mechanisms. Such\ncooperation implements the concept of complementary\nactions and allows for more agile solutions adapted to\nconcrete circumstances.\nThe road to stability and the progressive development\nof a new concept of security also passes through the\nstimulation of political institutions capable of guaranteeing\nrespect for universally recognized values. Similarly, greater\ninternational control of the use of force will require not\nonly the best and most adequate means but also a\nconstantly renewed political legitimacy in order to wield\nthem. In my view, this legitimacy is tied to the goal of\nbuilding an international society based on ideals which\npromote peace, democracy and human rights.\nWe must also keep in mind the socio-economic\ndimension of the issues that threaten international stability\nand security. More than ever, we need an integrated\napproach within which the preventive dimension is given\npriority, both in its purely political and diplomatic aspect\nand in its development-aid aspect.\nIn this context, we underline the importance of the\ncommitted participation of all nations in an Agenda for\nDevelopment, as the Secretary-General has invited us to do.\nToday more than ever, the portentous words of the Pope\nring true: \\\"Development is the new name of peace.\\\"\nIn this regard, we need to rethink, not only the role of\ndevelopment aid, but also the very concept of development.\nIt should become more comprehensive, including respect\nfor democratic values and human rights as well as social\nand economic issues and other issues related to the\npreservation of the environment, demographics, the\nprevention of endemic diseases and the fight against the\ntraffic in drugs.\nHere we must also underline the importance we\nattach to helping countries that are truly committed to\nimplementing social and politico-economic reforms\nconducive to sustainable development. However, such a\nprocess must be complemented by an increasingly liberal\ninternational system and by a set of measures that seek to\nreduce the burden of external debt and create the\nconditions for a reactivation of private investment in their\neconomies.\nIn this context, I welcome the signing in Marrakesh\nof the Uruguay Round agreements and the forthcoming\nstart-up of the World Trade Organization, which will\nallow for freer trade, with the simultaneous strengthening\nof rules and disciplines.\nAs a member of the European Union, Portugal\nfirmly defends the enlargement of the Union and the\nstrengthening of ties with other countries of Central and\nEastern Europe and the Mediterranean basin. For the\nentire continent, the European Union is undoubtedly an\nimmense consolidating force of democratic ideals,\nstability, prosperity and respect for human rights.\nOther organizations, such as the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western\nEuropean Union (WEU) and the Council of Europe\ncontribute equally to the same ideals. If the\ndemocratization of Eastern Europe has created the\npossibility of future adhesions to the European Union, it\nhas also led to a new relationship as regards security on\nthe continent.\nWe understand the desire already expressed by many\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe to join the\ndefence and security organizations, and we are ready to\nconsider, in due time, a gradual and balanced enlargement\nof NATO to include those States that share with us the\nsame democratic values and respect for human rights and\nthe rule of law. The question of the enlargement of\nNATO to the east cannot, however, overshadow the\nessential transatlantic dimension which must remain the\ncornerstone of European security. On the other hand, any\nincrease in the membership of NATO must not create\nnew divisions in Europe. Therefore, Portugal affirms that\nall the possibilities of the Partnership for Peace, a\nmechanism aimed at uniting countries of the Eurasian\nregion in activities of military cooperation, must be\npursued.\n16\n\n\nLast year, I stated here that Portugal considers the\nnuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty fundamental for\ninternational security. As we approach the 1995\nConference I should like to reiterate the intention of my\nGovernment to support all efforts that will lead to the\nunconditional and indefinite extension of that instrument.\nWhile referring to security, I should like to welcome\nand support the initiative announced here yesterday by\nPresident Clinton to reach an agreement on reducing the\nproliferation of anti-personnel mines. Such an initiative\ncould not be more timely and, for our part, I can announce\nhere that Portugal is in the process of preparing legislation\nto outlaw the commercialization of those weapons and their\nproduction.\nIn the context of Europe, I cannot avoid referring to\nthe situation in the former Yugoslavia and, in particular, to\nthe terrible conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite all\nthe efforts applied towards bringing an end to that situation,\nwar goes on with its tragic fare of death, destruction and\nsuffering.\nThe international community has demonstrated that it\npossesses a common interest in the search for a political\nsolution to the conflict. We must, however, recognize that\nthis progress is insufficient and that, without real political\nwill shown by all parties directly involved, a stable and\nlong-lasting solution will never be found.\nPortugal has actively participated in the efforts of the\ninternational community with both men and mat\u00e9riel, and\nwill continue to remain on the ground for as long as it is\nuseful and necessary. We are, in fact, reinforcing the\nPortuguese contingent in the area within the activities of the\nWestern European Union (WEU).\nSub-Saharan Africa, to which my country is linked by\nparticularly strong cultural and historical ties, continues to\nbe the region of the planet with the most worrying levels of\ndevelopment. Portugal has defended the idea that the\ninternational community should grant Africa first priority,\ncommensurate with the unparalleled magnitude of the\nproblems that need to be overcome. But firstly, Africans\nthemselves must prove that underdevelopment is not\ninevitable. And the greatest contribution that they can\nmake in this direction is a determined commitment to\nsearch for peaceful solutions to both existing and potential\nconflicts, and a continued deepening of the process of\npolitical and social democratization on the continent, as\nwell as the adoption of indispensable economic reforms.\nThe first free and democratic elections in South\nAfrica and the investiture of Nelson Mandela as its Head\nof State, as well as the formation of a Government of\nnational unity, represent historic achievements not only\nbecause they have left apartheid behind but also because\nthey have proved the viability of finding in Africa\npeaceful solutions to complex situations. Portugal, which\nactively participated in all efforts to support the process\nof democratic transition in that country, warmly salutes\nthe new South Africa, a country which is host to an\nimportant Portuguese community. We believe that the\nhuman, economic and technological potential of that\ncountry can undoubtedly constitute an important factor for\neconomic recovery in all of southern Africa.\nIn Mozambique also there are signs that the hopes of\nits people with regard to the peace process will not be\ndisappointed. The completion of the cantonment and\ndemobilization processes, the formation, despite some\ndelays, of the new armed forces and the peaceful manner\nin which the electoral campaign has been conducted are\nall crucial achievements to be recognized, and foretell the\ncoming elections of 27 and 28 October 1994 as being a\ncrucial moment for the future of Mozambique.\nWe appeal to the main Mozambican political forces\nto find the forms of dialogue and understanding\nconducive to guaranteeing a true national reconciliation\nwith full respect for democratic principles.\nPortugal was an observer at the negotiations and is\nrepresented in all the commissions created by the peace\naccord, playing a major role in the formation of the new\narmy, as well as participating significantly in the United\nNations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ).\nPortugal will remain committed to following this\nprocess closely in the context of the accords and we\nconsider it important that the international community\nsupport Mozambique not only during this particular phase\nbut also in what we hope will be the following stage of\nnational reconstruction and reconciliation.\nIn southern Africa, one of the longest, and surely\ndeadliest, conflicts the world has ever known rages on.\nAngola continues to be the stage for a war that has\nalready claimed hundreds of thousands of innocent\nvictims.\nPortugal, as a member of the troika of observer\ncountries, will continue to do all it can in actively\nsupporting the United Nations mediation in the person of\n17\n\n\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General, whose\nefforts I take this opportunity to salute, in the search for a\ndefinitive solution to the Angolan conflict.\nThe international community cannot and must not\nforget the origins of the current conflict, which frustrated\nthe hopes of the Angolan people created after the Bicesse\naccords and the elections of September 1992. Beyond\nattributing blame, it is now more important not to give up\nthe efforts to bring this terrible conflict to an end.\nThe Lusaka negotiations, which seek to promote -\nwithin the context of respect for the peace accords and\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council - a genuine\nreconciliation in Angola, have reached a crucial stage.\nThe complete acceptance by the Angolan Government\nand UNITA of the set of proposals of the mediation on\nnational reconciliation constitutes an important step.\nUNAVEM II must be given the necessary means to\ncomplete its mission. For this to happen, appropriate forces\nmust be placed on the ground immediately following the\ninitialling of the accords and the correct dimensions of that\npeace-keeping operation must be defined.\nIn any case, peace will not be possible unless there is\na genuine will on the part of the Angolans themselves.\nI appeal here to the Angolan Government and UNITA\nto do all in their power so that this opportunity is not lost.\nI also appeal to the international community to\nredouble its commitment and support.\nDespite the continuation of the conflict in Angola, the\nhistorical changes under way in southern Africa offer\npossibilities which must be consolidated and developed.\nPortugal has from the very beginning supported the\nproject for a dialogue between the European Union and that\nregion of Africa, an idea that has just been expressed in the\nrecent Berlin Conference between the European Union and\nthe Southern African Development Community (SADC).\nAs was stated in the Berlin Declaration, the aim of this\ndialogue is, inter alia, the promotion and development of\ntrade, investment and cooperation, in order to stimulate a\nbalanced development of that region which may, in turn,\nprovide an engine for progress in the rest of the continent.\nThe dramatic situation in Rwanda shows how\nimportant the role of the Organization of African Unity is\nin the prevention of similar situations, namely through the\nimplementation of its mechanism for the prevention,\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts created last year\non 29 July at the Cairo Summit. From the very\nbeginning, Portugal has supported the creation of this\nmechanism and, in conjunction with African and other\nlike-minded countries, is prepared to participate actively\nin the search for means that will permit the empowerment\nof such an instrument.\nI cannot end this reference to Africa without\nwelcoming the way in which the first democratic and free\nelections were held in Guinea-Bissau and expressing\nsatisfaction at the peaceful and orderly climate that has\ncharacterized the campaign for the elections in Sao Tome\nand Principe, to be held in a few days.\nOne of the current priorities of our foreign policy is\nthe convergence of efforts with those countries which\nshare with us the Portuguese language. With them we are\nbuilding a community which I am sure will come to\nrepresent a new and exemplary political reality.\nWe are also seeking to deepen the political dialogue\nand cooperation between Europe and Latin America.\nThat cooperation is institutionalized in its own\nmechanisms, among which I single out the dialogue\nbetween the European Union and the Rio Group as well\nas the Ibero-American Summits. These in turn have\nallowed open and profound discussions of political\nquestions of common interest to countries united by close\nhistorical and cultural ties and by shared sensitivities.\nThis is what happened, once again, at the Summit in\nCartagena, Colombia.\nI am glad to be able to acknowledge here the clear\nevolution towards democracy and respect for human\nrights that has occurred in all of Latin America and the\nCaribbean. That very positive evolution contrasts even\nmore strongly with such shocking situations as that of\nHaiti, a country where conditions are being created for\nthe re-establishment of democratic constitutional order\nfollowing the intervention of a multinational force\nauthorized by the United Nations Security Council.\nPortugal continues to devote special attention to the\nevolution of the situation in North Africa. To that end,\nwe have advocated a rapprochement with the countries of\nthat area in accordance with the Lisbon Declaration of the\nEuropean Council, which, I recall, defined a new concept\nfor a political, economic, social and cultural relationship\nbetween the European Union and the Maghreb.\nFollowing the Corfu meeting of the European Council,\n18\n\n\nwhich attached particular importance to stability and\nsecurity in the Mediterranean, we reaffirm our dedication to\na dialogue and a deepening of ties with the countries of the\nregion. Nor can we defend any other approach when we\nconsider the geographical proximity and close historical ties\nthat unite Portugal and North Africa.\nIn fact, it is important that the countries of both sides\nof the Mediterranean deepen their dialogue so that we can\navoid the spread of an idea which we reject - that of\nconflict between civilizations. On the contrary, we should\nvalue the concept that countries with different political\nideas and whose populations espouse diverse religions are\nable to establish ties of trust and true cooperation.\nIt is my opinion that we have today well-founded\nreasons to believe that a comprehensive peace in the Middle\nEast will be a reality in the not-too-distant future. The\naccords already signed between Israel and the Palestinians\non the one hand and Israel and Jordan on the other testify\nto their determination in seeking a comprehensive, just and\nlasting peace. The achievements already made will\ncertainly serve as a catalyst for new initiatives. From this\nperspective, the decisions and resolutions of the United\nNations should reflect the positive developments already\nregistered.\nIt is also necessary that the international community,\nand in particular the countries of the region, support the\nefforts under way. We hope that progress in the peace\nprocess, in both its bilateral and multilateral aspects,\nforeshadows the capacity to generate a new era of stability\nand development in that part of the world.\nUniversalism has always marked the ideas and\nbehaviour of the Portuguese. In Asia Portugal has\ncenturies-old ties with a number of countries which we\nwish to maintain and develop. It is with great admiration\nthat we look upon the development of some areas of that\ncontinent. We are certain that the countries of that region\nwill have ever-increasing importance in the determination\nof the fate of our planet.\nPortugal attaches the greatest importance to respect for\nhuman rights, so much so that this respect can be\nconsidered to be a major pillar of its foreign policy. Our\naction has as a fixed reference point the results of the\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights, which rejected\nany regression or reduction of the established norms. We\nsupport the work of the High Commissioner and the Centre\nfor Human Rights, both of which should be granted the\nnecessary financial means for an efficient exercise of their\nfunctions.\nWe defend with particular commitment the principle\nof universality when applied to respect for human rights\nand their indivisibility, and we oppose any attempt to\nsubordinate their strict observance to other objectives. On\nthis issue, we cannot and must not yield. We believe that\ndemocracy, respect for human rights and development are\nmutually reinforcing.\nWe attach the greatest importance to the\ninternational conferences to be held in 1995: the World\nSummit for Social Development and the World\nConference on Women. We consider promising the\npositive results recently achieved in Cairo by the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\nwhich we welcome.\nIn the context of human rights, among which this\nOrganization has always included with special distinction\nthe right to self-determination, I feel duty-bound to touch\nupon a question to which the international community has\nbeen giving growing attention. I am referring to the\nNon-Self-Governing Territory of East Timor. I reaffirm\nbefore this Assembly that Portugal has no specific\nobjective concerning the question of East Timor beyond\nthe defence of the rights of its people and the conclusion\nof the process of decolonizing the Territory in accordance\nwith international law and with full respect for the\nlegitimate rights of the Timorese people. For this reason,\nwe remain committed to talks that, under the auspices of\nthe Secretary-General, are being held with the Indonesian\nGovernment with the aim of finding a just,\ncomprehensive and internationally acceptable solution.\nUndoubtedly, progress has been slow and we have\nnot advanced on the substance of the matter. But, as a\nreading of the progress report of the Secretary-General\nreveals - and I must express here a word of appreciation\nto him - some steps have been taken, not only through the\nso-called confidence-building measures, but also with the\ninvolvement of the Timorese themselves in the search for\na solution to a problem in which they are the principal\ninterested party.\nEast Timor has recently ceased to be an almost\nforgotten Territory. We sincerely hope that the growing\nattention that has been granted it will contribute\ndecisively to an improvement in the concrete situation of\nits people and to the adoption of a more coherent attitude\n19\n\n\nin the recognition and defence of their legitimate and\ninalienable rights.\nOn 16 November the Convention on the Law of the\nSea will come into force, culminating a long and important\nprocess which will open new and determinant channels of\naction and cooperation. The importance of this area will\nclearly justify the General Assembly\u2019s adopting by\nconsensus the draft resolution of the Economic and Social\nCouncil on the proclamation of 1998 as the international\nyear of the oceans. We are confident that its proclamation\nwill contribute in an effective manner to a wider debate and\na greater enlightenment of world public opinion on the\nimportance of the problems which we face in this area, thus\nenabling the adoption of solutions that will permit their\nresolution at a global level. Portugal actively participates\nin this debate, seeking with the holding of Lisbon\nExpo/98 - the last great exposition of the twentieth century,\nthe subject-matter of which is directly related to this area -\nto provide an important instrument for the achievement of\nthe goals we have set.\nIn conclusion, I should like to reflect upon the\ninstitutional reforms that are so necessary for adapting the\nOrganization to the new international context, its challenges\nand the greater possibilities of global cooperation. These\nreforms, which we believe to be essential and urgent,\nshould be carried out with transparency and on a consensual\nbasis. They must be realistic and be aimed at increasing\nefficiency.\nAlthough we are still at a preliminary stage, we\nconsider it useful to state here the aim of our thinking on\nthis matter. First of all, we believe that it is necessary to\nreinforce the efficiency and responsibility of the Security\nCouncil. We maintain that a third category of members\nshould not be created beyond those of permanent and\nnon-permanent members. A pragmatic and reasonable\nsolution to ensure greater representation on the Council\nwould be to increase the number of non-permanent\nmembers by one for each region. We are also of the\nopinion that the number of permanent members should be\nincreased, but such an increase should not be achieved at\nthe expense of the number of non-permanent members.We\nencourage regional agreements which, through increased\nrotation, will permit greater representation on the Council.\nIt is crucial that permanent members of the Council should\nhave the ability and the political will to assume fully the\nresponsibilities that come with that status as regards the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nSome States have declared themselves ready to\nassume greater responsibilities in regard to the\nachievement of the objectives of the Charter. The\nPortuguese Government declares - here today - its support\nfor the inclusion of Germany and Japan as permanent\nmembers of the Security Council. Both the unified\nGermany, a country that provided a notable incentive for\nthe construction of the European Union, and Japan, a\ngreat Power of the Asia-Pacific region, are in a position\nto make an effective contribution towards increasing the\nweight and the efficiency of the Security Council. It\nwould however be difficult to comprehend if an increase\nin the number of the permanent members did not also\ninclude the southern hemisphere of our planet. In this\ncontext, and among the eligible countries, we point\nnaturally to Brazil, a founding Member of the United\nNations, the largest country in Latin America and a State\nthat has unequivocally abided by the principles of the\nCharter.\nPortugal is a candidate for a seat on the Security\nCouncil for the biennium which begins in 1997. Our\ncandidature reflects a position of profound commitment to\nthe main objectives of the United Nations as set out in the\nCharter. It reflects also our desire to contribute fully to\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nThus, Portugal reaffirms its commitment with regard\nto the objectives of the United Nations, which my country\nhas supported with increasing responsibility as an active\nparticipant in the different areas of the Organization and,\nparticularly, in the United Nations peace-keeping\noperations.\nWe are approaching the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations Charter. Portugal will seek to emphasize\nthis commemoration and to ensure that its significance is\nunderstood by the public at large and, in particular, by\nyoung people.\nIn this celebration, we wish to contribute to\nrenewing our ideals and sparking people\u2019s conscience in\norder to promote increased participation in the objectives\nestablished by the Charter of the United Nations.\nIn short, this means the creation of a greater\nsensitivity to the irreplaceable role of the United Nations\nin the resolution of the major issues faced by humanity at\nthe turn of the century.\n"

        "file_text": "Costa Rica hails and congratulates you most\nwarmly, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly. We also wish to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral, whose untiring efforts have made this an\nOrganization which is daily playing a more dynamic and\neffective role in the advancement of peace, security and\ndevelopment.\nWe are Members of an Organization whose name\nbespeaks hope and dreams - the United Nations; not aligned\nor groups of nations but one single family of peoples,\nunited in the struggle for peace, human rights and\ndevelopment.\nIn those dark days of 1945, filled with suffering,\nhatred and ruin, those who forged the United Nations\ncreated an Organization with medium- and long-term\nobjectives. Rather than setting up a transitory league of\nvictors, their vision was to look to the future in unity.\nThey thought not only of themselves; they thought as well\nof their children and their grandchildren. They also\nthought of the children of their former adversaries, and\nthought as well of those who had stayed on the margins\nof the tragedy.\nMy country is proud to have been a founding\nmember of this fraternity. It is also proud to say that the\nideals of the United Nations live on in the spirit and in\nthe daily lives of our people. And although my country\nis not wealthy, not powerful, not big, we feel we have\nhonourably served the cause of this Organization both\nwithin and beyond our borders.\nDespite the limitations inherent in our small and\npoor country, the Costa Rican people have proved they\nare capable of dreaming bold dreams and of making those\ndreams come true. Forty-six years ago, when the United\nNations was about to take its first steps and the world\nwas just beginning to emerge from the horrors of the\nSecond World War, a group of men and women of vision\nin our country began to pursue the dream of a world\n\n\nwithout wars and armies, and decided that the dream should\nbegin to be made a reality right at home. We thus\nabolished our army and began a long period of economic\ngrowth, accompanied by social well-being and political\nstability. We became a model of human development in a\ndeveloping country and a force for the abolition of war and\nviolence in our region. It is through our commitment to\nmaking this dream a reality within our own borders that our\ncountry has made its most important contribution to the\ncause of the United Nations.\nToday, as humanity stands at a decisive crossroads,\nthe need to build new utopias has become of the utmost\nurgency. As human beings, we are at our creative best\nonly when we are in pursuit of a dream, when our eyes\nshine with the gleam of that dream. Given the magnitude\nof the dangers we face, the international community, now\nperhaps more than ever before, needs to muster all its\nenergies in pursuit of renewal.\nAs a people living at the centre of the Americas, we\nare deeply concerned by the threats hanging over mankind.\nWe are especially concerned about growing tensions\nbetween the proponents of social progress and those of the\nnatural environment that supports it. At times, the\ncountries of the world seem to be playing out a macabre\nglobal compact for self-destruction. While the production\nand consumption patterns of the industrialized world are\nwreaking havoc on nature, poverty in the third world is also\ncausing serious environmental damage. The end result is\na rapid deterioration of the natural resource base upon\nwhich all of life and society depends, to the point where the\nvery survival of humanity is in jeopardy. With every\npassing day, awareness is growing of the fact that this\nabsurd path the world has chosen to follow is not\nsustainable.\nGiven such a formidable threat, the United Nations\nonce again shines like a beacon of hope for the world. As\na forum pooling the energies of the international\ncommunity, it has already acted resolutely in dealing with\nthe environment. From a variety of vantage points, many\nof its agencies have launched efforts to preserve and\nconserve the world\u2019s resources and to establish norms of\nsocial organization that are compatible with the life cycles\nof the planet. At the Rio de Janeiro Summit, that decades-\nlong effort of the United Nations in this area was clearly\nexpressed, and the adoption of Agenda 21, along with the\nconventions on biodiversity and climatic change, which my\ncountry has signed, is to a large extent the fruit of the work\nof the United Nations.\nAs the community of nations tackles new common\nchallenges, Costa Rica once again affirms its commitment\nto play a useful role. Aware as we are of our limitations\nas a small and poor country, we can but offer the best we\nhave. We pledge our land and our collective\ndetermination as a contribution to building utopias and\nkeeping hope alive.\nWe wish to assume our role in these global causes\nwith two reasons in mind: we are committed to the\nworld-wide struggle to ensure the existence and well-\nbeing of mankind, and we feel it is urgent for us to\nprovide our people with the kind of development that will\nmake of nature an ally and not an enemy.\nToday, we acknowledge that the social and economic\nprogress made in Costa Rica in recent decades was\nachieved at the expense of a serious deterioration in our\nenvironment. Our polluted rivers, our eroded soil and our\nrapidly disappearing forests are the unfortunate proof.\nFor the future, only sustainable development can offer us\ncontinued abundance and growing well-being, generation\nafter generation.\nAll too often throughout history, human beings have\nopted for the easy way out - only economic growth,\nsuperficial and fleeting change and an irrational\nexploitation of the environment. Aware as we are of the\ndeplorable results of such an approach, we Costa Ricans\nwish to rid ourselves of such self-deception. We envisage\nsustainable development as one that is mindful of the\nmacro-equilibrium that in turn makes long-term\ndevelopment possible - I refer to political stability, social\nequity, economic balance and harmony with nature.\nThe enjoyment of peace, democracy and stability in\nCosta Rica is in large measure because of the sustained\ninvestment we have made for decades in education, health\nand other services to ensure the well-being of our people.\nBy abolishing our army, we have been able to convert\nmilitary expenditure into expenditure on social\nprogrammes and to avoid the threat of stunted\ndevelopment such as often occurs under military\ndictatorships. Building on these traditions, we are now\nattaining new and ambitious goals.\nTo achieve sustainability, major changes are in store\nfor us in our way of life, and to make these changes we\nwill have to set free the energies and the determination of\nour citizens. That is why we are shifting away from\nrepresentative democracy and moving towards more\ncomplex forms of participatory democracy.\n2\n\n\nSince we have chosen to pursue sustainable\ndevelopment we are committed to finding medium- and\nlong-term solutions to the cyclical economic imbalances\nfrom which we have suffered over the years.\nDesirous as we are of changing the ways in which we\ninteract with the natural world, we in Costa Rica have\nundertaken an ambitious programme based on social\nconsensus, the work of the scientific and technological\ncommunity and the historical ability of new State\ninstitutions to promote development. Decades ago, when\nthe topic of environmental conservation was not yet a key\nitem on the agendas of Governments or international\norganizations, my country was already working to set up a\nsystem of nature conservation areas which today cover one\nfourth of our national territory and provide protection for\nvirtually all our animal and plant species. Today we are\ntaking yet a further step and endeavouring to arrive at an\nintegrated scheme to combine nature conservation with the\nproductive use of tropical biodiversity. Our goal to live in\nharmony with nature has helped us to realize that our land\nwas for the most part meant to be forested. The objectives\nof our programme include improving the net absorption of\ncarbon dioxide through forestation programmes carried out\nin conjunction with developed countries, the exportation of\nplant trees and the development of technologies for tropical\nreforestation. These and other projects are part of a\nnational plan designed to implement all the elements of\nAgenda 21, adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.\nIn the pursuit of these and other, similar goals we\nintend to make Costa Rica into a model of sustainable\ndevelopment. Indeed, we hope to become the first\ndeveloping country to make the leap to sustainable\ndevelopment. Like other dreams we have cherished and\nrealized in the past, through our own efforts and with the\nhelp of the international community, this dream is bold and\nambitious.\nCosta Rica cherishes this aspiration for all of Central\nAmerica as well. We are committed to our region\u2019s efforts\nto achieve sustainable development, efforts that are today\nbeing carried out under a common programme that was\nagreed to at our recent meetings of Presidents.\nDuring the tragic years of the Central American crisis\nCosta Rica did not suffer the ravages of war or dictatorship,\nnor did it see any of its freedoms taken away.\nNevertheless, our national development was hampered by\nthe backwardness, injustice and violence that held sway\nthroughout the region. Today, we Costa Ricans reaffirm\nour conviction that our destiny as a nation is indissolubly\nlinked to that of the other nations of the Isthmus.\nCosta Rica vividly remembers and continues to be\ngrateful to the United Nations for its valuable support in\nbringing peace to our region. We recall the exceptional\nefforts the Organization made. Its action of solidarity,\nmobilizing substantial resources and devising specific\nprogrammes, was at that time of great benefit to Central\nAmerica.\nToday, the situation is very different. In our region\nwe have put an end to the fratricidal conflicts that bled us\nfor decades and we have ushered in an era of\nreconciliation, peace and democracy. Today, Central\nAmerica offers much more fertile ground for ever-higher\nlevels of human development. Today, our peoples are\nmore capable of building a better future for themselves\nand therefore of establishing mutually beneficial and\ncooperative relations with international organizations and\nfriendly countries.\nToday\u2019s watchword is \\\"interdependence\\\". The\nindustrialized countries will be able to maintain their\nstandards of living and levels of production only if they\ncan foster development in the rest of the world. This is\nwhy we invite them to forge closer ties of cooperation\nwith us so that Central America\u2019s goals can be shared and\nmore easily attained by our countries.\nNotwithstanding innumerable difficulties and despite\n40 years of cold war and a multitude of conflicts, the\nUnited Nations has a record of accomplishment\nunprecedented in history.\nWe derive great satisfaction from the imminent\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Never before\nin the history of mankind has any joint effort for peace\nmanaged to endure so long, and never before has any\ninternational effort taken on such universal proportions.\nWe nevertheless hope that this universality will\nbecome total as soon as possible, without any exceptions\nwhatever. Today, Costa Rica would like to reaffirm its\nstrong support for the legitimate aspirations of the\nRepublic of China in Taiwan to take part in the efforts of\nthe United Nations. We believe that the people of that\nnation must be represented in this family of nations. It is\na reality, and it is also an issue that the Organization\ncannot continue to sidestep.\n3\n\n\nThe impending anniversary is also a good time for us\nto set a new course for the United Nations so that we can\nsuccessfully meet new challenges. We consider the ideas\non this subject contained in the Secretary-General\u2019s\n\\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" to be of the utmost importance, and we\nhope that we will be able to contribute to making them a\nreality.\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" is a particularly important\nguide for the international community. Its natural\ncomplement, the agenda for development, optimistically\nreflects mankind\u2019s new concerns and offers us great\nopportunities to work dynamically in building the new\nmillennium.\nIndeed, there is a great deal of work before us.\nAlthough there is no longer a cold war, although many\nStates have rejected totalitarianism, it is still true that we\nare faced with the horror of the unfolding tragedy of\nRwanda, the aggression being pursued against Bosnia and\nthe resurgence of ethnic and religious fanaticism. We are\nfrustrated to see that the best efforts of the organized\ninternational community have not been sufficient to find a\nway out of the Cuban crisis, in our America.\nWe feel indignation in the face of the violence and\nexploitation to which women and children continue to be\nsubjected and alarm at the steady increase in drug\ntrafficking and its occasional ally, terrorism. We are sad to\nsee that hunger and poverty continue to be a daily reality\nfor millions in Africa, Asia and our own Latin America.\nThese painful realities must not, however, weaken our\nresolve. Recently we have seen hopeful and bright signals\nto the effect that things can and should be different. We\nhave witnessed the Republic of South Africa peacefully\nputting an end to a shameful regime and becoming the\nmother of all its children, regardless of the color of their\nskin.\nWe have seen Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians\ntogether plough furrows of peace through the Holy Land.\nThe first steps have been taken towards reconciliation in\nNorthern Ireland. There are signs of lessening tensions on\nthe Korean peninsula, and we trust that, through\nnegotiations, there will be effective control of North\nKorea\u2019s nuclear programme.\nJust a few days ago we saw how the efforts of the\ninternational community had finally provided the people of\nHaiti with a chance of real peace and democracy. Costa\nRica would like to make a proposal that it considers basic\nfor human development in Haiti. To this end we ask the\nUnited Nations to work with others on a democratization\nprogramme, with the gradual and irreversible abolition of\nthe army in that country. The time is ripe for such an\ninitiative; by carrying it out we would protect this long-\nsuffering nation from many future injustices.\nHaving for many years been committed to the\nstruggle against poverty and underdevelopment, Costa\nRica has strong hopes of the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, to be held in Denmark next March. My\ncountry shares and supports its objectives and will\nenthusiastically participate in activities at the Summit and\nafterwards.\nWe optimistically hail, as part of the restructuring of\ninternational relations, the establishment of the World\nTrade Organization. We are confident that its creation\nwill lead to greater legal consistency in international trade\nrelations, a new era of global economic cooperation and\na greater dynamism in trade, as well as higher volumes.\nFor countries such as the banana-producing countries of\nLatin America, today facing serious problems because of\nreduced access to markets in the European Union, this\nnew forum will be of particular importance. We are glad\nthat its priority topics include the links between trade\npolicies, environmental policies and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nCosta Rica was present in San Francisco to declare\nits faith in the future of the world. We have been here\nfor half a century, bearing witness to our trust in the\nUnited Nations. Today Costa Rica is present again to call\non all Member States to continue to look forward, firmly\ncommitted to working with still greater dedication for the\nattainment of the common goal of securing the well-being\nof our peoples.\nWe must have faith in the future, but we must work\nto build it. Let us forge a new spirit in our minds and fill\nour hearts, and this Organization, with a new kind of\nfeeling. Let us adopt as our own the attitude embodied\nin the lessons of an old proverb:\n\\\"Fear less and hope more; complain less and breathe\nmore; speak less and say more; hate less and love\nmore; and all good things shall be yours.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Mr Amara Essy,\nForeign Minister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on his election as\nPresident of this important Assembly\nI should also like to extend to Ambassador Samuel\nInsanally the congratulations of Ecuador on his brilliant\nperformance during the last session.\n13\n\n\nEqually, on behalf of the Government of Ecuador, I\nshould like to extend our congratulations to the Secretary\nGeneral,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his work in carrying out his\nimportant duties.\nDuring these last few years, the world of international\nrelations has undergone a swift and profound\ntransformation. Several problems which divided nations\nhave disappeared, while other have emerged, as have forces\nand elements whose existence invites careful reflection.\nThe most serious ideological differences have been\novercome and we have witnessed with satisfaction the\nholding of free elections in South Africa; however, in other\nparts of the world, other evils have reappeared - racism,\nxenophobia, civil wars - and problems such as hunger and\npoverty have become more acute. Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti,\nand Rwanda are just some of the names which now move\nmankind\u2019s moral conscience.\nAt the same time, the historic role of the United\nNations has acquired a unique and far-reaching meaning,\nand the near future of the planet appears linked to the\ndirectives and decisions adopted in the General Assembly\nand in the Security Council.\nThe fact that the United Nations is about to celebrate\n50 years of existence is truly pleasing, because it means\nthat this forum of mankind has consolidated its leading role\nin history. At the same time, this anniversary leads us to\nreflect on ways to improve the Organization. This process\nwill inevitably involve reconsidering some United Nations\nstructures in order to adapt them to the new demands of\ndevelopment which will be discussed at the social summit\nsoon to take place in Copenhagen. The social summit must\nenable nations, taking account of the many decades during\nwhich trade and financial matters have played against less\ndeveloped countries, to commit themselves to more direct\naction to face the problems of inadequate education, illness,\nviolence and poverty.\nThe United Nations is approaching its fiftieth year at\na time when building a new international order has become\nimperative. Ecuador wants this new international order to\nbe marked by unconditional respect for the principles of the\nOrganization\u2019s Charter, by the international economic\nrestructuring which for many years has been one of the\nmain aspirations of the developing world, and by effective\nand continuing solidarity and interdependence among all the\nnations on our planet.\nThe changes on the international scene have brought\nabout a new and growing interest in the United Nations.\nThe international community turns to the Organization\nmore often and with more confidence when it needs help\nin solving its problems. The Organization\u2019s structures\nmust be revised and strengthened so that its responses can\nmeet the needs that have been put to it.\nTo carry out this endeavour, it will be necessary to\naddress statements that have been made regarding the new\ncomposition of the Security Council and to consider the\nneed to revitalize the General Assembly, giving it\nfunctions and responsibilities in keeping with its status as\nthe highest forum of the Organization. An international\norder based on and designed for the human person must\nhave at its disposal an adequate tool for carrying out\nprogrammes needed for the economic and social\ndevelopment of our peoples. From that point of view, it\nis imperative for us to undertake a process of\nstrengthening the Economic and Social Council.\nFurthermore, we have to create conditions that will\nprovide the indispensable motivation for States, given the\nnew circumstance of the world, to place their full trust in\nthe International Court of Justice.\nEcuador, a country that has the deepest respect for\nfundamental human rights, appreciates and assumes with\nthe utmost responsibility the trust of the international\ncommunity, granted through this Organization, enabling\nit to contribute to the work of the most important forums\ndevoted to the promotion and protection of all human\nrights.\nThe Government of Ecuador echoes the expressions\nof support to the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights. It trusts that his difficult task will be\nbased on the frank understanding of the international\ncommunity. It also expresses its conviction that the\nAssembly will commit the necessary administrative and\nfinancial resources to facilitate the duties of the High\nCommissioner.\nHuman rights and social development are\ninseparable, indivisible. In daily reality we cannot\nseparate respect for human rights from fair economic\nrelations. As stated by the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), quality of life is a subject which\ncannot remain at the entire mercy of the game of\nmacroeconomic statistics.\nWe developing countries are affected in our foreign\ntrade by the gradual deterioration of the terms of\n14\n\n\nexchange, a phenomenon which generates serious social\nconsequences and which forces us to export greater\nvolumes of raw, finished and semi-manufactured goods.\nWe also face non-tariff barriers, and many other measures\nthat block access by our products - such as bananas and\nflowers in the case of Ecuador - to the markets of those\nvery developed countries where the principle of free trade\nis designed and developed. This protectionist policy\ncontradicts the goals of general welfare sought by the\ninternational community.\nThe countries of Latin America, including Ecuador,\nhave launched a great effort of adjustment and economic\nrestructuring which must be properly understood and which\noffers a framework more conducive to international\ncooperation and to foreign investment.\nAt this stage of history, neither the developed nor the\ndeveloping countries can neglect the so-called social\nquestion, a product of the socio-economic inequities that\ndominate the world. The solution to this problem can be\nachieved only by international cooperation at all levels.\nThe development of poor nations must depend on their own\nefforts, on cooperation based on smooth, effective and\nprofoundly human mechanisms of integration.\nWe believe in the fundamental right to life.\nTherefore, we cannot and will not accept the\nimplementation of programmes conditioned on population\ncontrol and abortion, which are what Pope John Paul II has\ncalled \\\"the culture of death\\\". These are the bases that\nshould inspire solidarity and international cooperation.\nEnvironmental problems, and those linked to the\ndangerous use of nuclear weapons, have shown that we\nhumans are all voyaging in the same boat and that our\ndestinies are intertwined. Thus, the prosperity of some\ncannot result from the exploitation or damage of the\nenvironment of others; the accumulation of weapons in one\ncountry is nothing but a boomerang that country is throwing\nat itself.\nI want to recall the words of the Constitutional\nPresident of Ecuador, Mr. Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n, in this\naugust forum, when he said:\n\\\"I must emphasize that although the developed\ncountries, which are mainly responsible for the\ndeterioration of the environment, have a particular\nobligation, it is other countries that are being asked to\nmake the sacrifice of restricting the exercise of their\nlegitimate right to use the wealth that nature has given\nthem. It is necessary to seek due compensation\njointly, especially in the shape of financial aid and\ntechnological cooperation\\\". (A/47/PV.12, p. 18)\nInevitably, all our peoples must join forces to\nsafeguard and restore the environment. In the ecological\nfield, we have completed the stage of formulating rules\nand international conventions. Now we must join our\nresources and technical efforts to put those solutions into\npractice as soon as possible. That is why it is important\nto develop greater linkage between institutions such as the\nWorld Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and\nthe International Monetary Fund on the one hand, and\nprogrammes of the United Nations and the Global\nEnvironment Facility on the other. Therefore, genuine\ntransfer of clean technologies is of great importance.\nIt is especially worrisome that nuclear testing for\nmilitary purposes continues to be carried out. Ecuador\ncondemns these tests, which damage the environment,\nendanger the countries of the test area and ignore the\nright of all the peoples to peace and security.\nFurthermore, Ecuador is worried by the fact that in the\npost-cold-war era some countries have attracted\nsignificant numbers of technicians and nuclear scientists\nin order to develop their military power. Resolution\n48/70, approved last December, opens the way towards a\ncomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, which all States\nshould support.\nWe believe in the need not only to extend the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but also to\nimprove it and establish it forever. At the same time, we\nsupport the declaration of new nuclear-weapon-free zones,\nsimilar to those established by the Latin American Treaty.\nIn this regard, it is a matter of serious concern that,\nwhile we are trying to limit and even eliminate nuclear\narsenals, there has been an increase in the manufacture of\nconventional weapons and in the traffic in them.\nAccordingly, there is an imperative need, as the Holy See\nproposed through its Council for Justice and Peace, for\nthe creation of an international authority to reduce the\ntrade in weapons and to achieve the goal of a\ncomprehensive ban on all kinds of weapons.\nEcuador welcomes most warmly the agreements\narrived at and the progress made in the Middle East in the\nprocess of establishing peace and normalizing the\nrelations between Israel and its Arab neighbours.\nEcuador firmly supports this process, which is an example\nfor the solution of other, perhaps less complex, problems.\n15\n\n\nWe also condemn the actions of extremist groups who,\nthrough terrorism, attempt to prevent the consolidation of\npeace in that important part of the world.\nWe were particularly enthusiastic over the\nreinstatement of South Africa in this world Organization.\nWith the victory over apartheid one of the United Nations\nlongest and most difficult struggles has now come to an\nend.\nWe must however reiterate our profound concern over\nthe ongoing ethnic and religious clashes in the territories of\nthe former Yugoslavia. Ecuador supports the actions taken\nby the international community in seeking a political\nsolution that would ensure an end to the tragedy in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina.\nAnd now my country would like to issue a plea to the\ninternational community to provide generous humanitarian\nassistance for the victims in Rwanda.\nRecently, there has been a proliferation of United\nNations peace-keeping operations. Notwithstanding all its\nshortcomings, the international effort in this regard is\npraiseworthy, but we believe this Organization should,\nbasically, use preventive measures to deal with the\nunderlying causes of civil, international and inter-ethnic\nconflicts, and along with thIs, it should also address the\nproblems of injustice, inequality in economic and trade\nrelations, and the persistence of prejudice and age-old\nenmity. The road to peace lies through programmes to\nprovide help in practical and urgent terms, to those\ncountries most affected by hunger and extreme poverty.\nThere must be a prompt review of programmes of\ncooperation. There must be a more fruitful effort on the\npart of the specialized agencies of the United Nations\nsystem to develop a true culture of peace and the respect\nfor the rights of others.\nThe fundamental obligation of the United Nations -\none might even say its real raison d\u2019\u00eatre - is not only the\nmaintenance of international peace and security but also the\nraising of the economic, social and cultural standards of\npeoples. This is the only solid basis for progress and\ndevelopment.\nI believe it is time for this Assembly to adopt\npragmatic resolutions so that we may spend less on paper\nand bureaucracy and more on technical and cultural\nmissions and specific programmes that would reach those\npeople that face the greatest problems, areas afflicted by\nwar, plague and starvation.\nEcuador has advocated a solution to the complex\nHaitian crisis that takes account of the principles of non-\nintervention and the peaceful settlement of disputes and\nthat involves the participation of all sectors of Haitian\nsociety, with the broadest respect for human rights and\ntaking account of the relevant resolutions of the\nOrganization of American States and of the United\nNations.\nEcuador trusts that democracy will be established\npermanently and as soon as possible in Haiti. To that\nend, it is offered all the diplomatic and political support\nthat it can. At the same time, we would wish to\nparticipate in the humanitarian efforts to contribute to the\nrebuilding of the Haitian economy, once constitutional\norder is restored.\nEcuador would also be in favour of continuing the\nCuban-American dialogue in that same constructive spirit\nand with good will. We fervently hope that our sister\nnation of Cuba may be able to become fully involved\nagain in hemispheric cooperation. It will be necessary to\nmake great strides along the road to broadening and\nstrengthening democracy and pluralism, and at the same\ntime an end must be put to the unilateral blockade to\nwhich Cuba has been subjected for many years.\nIn keeping with our constant desire to contribute to\na climate of peace, understanding and cooperation among\npeoples, Ecuador has been seeking some means of dealing\nwith its age-old controversy with Peru and strengthening\nits ties of friendship and cooperation between the peoples\nof Ecuador and Peru. As we said earlier, Ecuador\nattaches very special importance within this process, to\nthe intervention of His Holiness the Pope, in seeking a\ndefinitive solution to this problem. This is in view of the\nhigh moral authority of His Holiness, which is recognized\nby both our peoples.\nIt is increasingly clear to our two nations that the\nway to development is to be found in working together in\nharmony.\nWe wish to deepen and broaden our far-reaching\ncommon interests. This is to the mutual benefit of our\ntwo countries and would enable us to become efficient\npartners as we develop together.\nAll the nations represented in this Assembly are\ncalled upon to build a better world, a world free from the\nhorrors of war, hunger and environmental destruction.\nMay we, through our work, respond to this historic\nchallenge.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me, on behalf of the\nBulgarian delegation, congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his\nelection to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I should also like to extend my\nappreciation to his predecessor, Ambassador Samuel\nInsanally, for his proficiency in presiding over the\nforty-eighth session.\nDiverse, often conflicting trends and events\ncharacterize the present year, which has marked the end\nof apartheid in South Africa, a significant breakthrough in\nthe Middle East peace process and steps towards a\nsettlement of the problems in Northern Ireland. We have\nalso witnessed, however, the incredible human tragedy in\nRwanda and the continuing bloodshed in Bosnia. New\nhotbeds of tension have emerged in some parts of the\nworld.\nWhat are, in our view, the parameters of the political\nsituation in the world, and Europe in particular? Efforts\nto build a new world based on the idea of developing the\ncollective security system envisaged in the United Nations\nCharter have received additional impetus. Universal\nstandards for human rights and international mechanisms\nfor safeguarding them are being devised. The problems\nof population, poverty and the global ecosystem are being\naddressed with increasing attention. A concept for\nrenewed cooperation for development is being considered\nin which peace, the economy, the environment, social\njustice and democracy are viewed as aspects of the same\nmovement towards a better world.\nAt the same time, the elimination of the\ncontradictions between the East and the West has been\nfollowed by destabilization - temporary, we hope - in\nsome regions of the world. Acts of aggressive\nnationalism and xenophobia, of violence and terrorism,\nare becoming more frequent. The numerous conflicts\nbased on national, ethnic and religious intolerance are\ndifficult to manage. Among other things, this has\ndisturbed the balance between the efforts to maintain\ninternational security and the activities in the social and\neconomic sphere, against a background of spreading\n20\n\n\nhunger and poverty and the aggravation of economic and\nenvironmental problems.\nThese global problems have left their mark on\nrelations in Europe as in other places. On one hand, new,\nhistoric possibilities for wide cooperation between all\nEuropean States have opened up in the process of\npromoting a common European identity. On the other\nhand, new, as well as reawakened, national interests and\npolicies are taking shape, and these are interacting with and,\nat the same time, counteracting the integration processes.\nThe end of the ideological and military confrontation\non the old continent has not yet led to the removal of all\nbarriers. Europe is still divided into zones that differ in\nterms of security and economic welfare. It is desirable that\nthis division be overcome, as the problems of the zones\nwith less security could be transferred to those with greater\nsecurity.\nThe global political dimension of the ongoing\ntransition to democracy and a market economy in Central\nand Eastern Europe has been largely recognized. Despite\nthe serious decline in living standards and rising\nunemployment, the Bulgarian people voted for transition.\nThe process of market-orientated reform that started about\nfive years ago is irreversible. Our association with the\nEuropean Union is a manifestation of the European\norientation of my country\u2019s policy and an expression of the\npolitical will to adhere to the universal values of\ndemocracy. We are adapting our economic, social and\ntrade mechanisms to those of the European democracies\nand are actively participating in political dialogue with the\nEuropean Union. Though slower than we anticipated, the\neconomic reforms in Bulgaria are moving ahead.\nAs a participant in the Partnership for Peace initiative\nof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and as a State\nwith associate status in the Western European Union,\nBulgaria will contribute to the improvement of cooperation\nbetween the Euro-Atlantic and European security\ninstitutions and the relevant United Nations structures.\nOn the eve of the session of the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Budapest\nlater this year, Bulgaria is confident that the high-level\nrepresentatives of European countries will come up with\nnew ideas to improve the functions of the CSCE, including\ncooperation with United Nations.\nThe Council of Europe - one of the oldest of the\ninternational organizations in Europe - has won recognition\nas an organization capable of responding adequately and\nin a timely manner to the challenges of our time by\npromoting pluralistic democracy, the rule of law and\nrespect for human rights.\nAs Bulgaria currently holds the chairmanship of the\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I\nshould like to refer briefly to this body, which already\ncomprises 32 members. Nine States have joined since\n1989, and nine others are involved in a process of\naccession. Cooperation between the Council of Europe\nand United Nations institutions and between the Council\nand some of the specialized agencies has been developed\nover many years and has produced concrete results. This\ncooperation has now become triangular - combining the\nefforts of the Council of Europe, of the CSCE and of the\nUnited Nations. In addition, there is a developing\npartnership with the European Union.\nIn this complex and interdependent environment the\nUnited Nations must increase its capacity to confront the\nnew challenges if it is to be effective in peace-making\nand in the development of social and economic\ncooperation between countries. In this context, important\nviews and concepts are contained in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", in his\nreport on new dimensions of arms regulation and\ndisarmament and in his agenda for development.\nBulgaria values highly the role of the United Nations\nin solving problems directly related to the strengthening\nof regional and international security. We support a\npeaceful and equitable solution of the conflicts in the\nCaucasus region, the Caribbean, Africa and other places.\nWe are particularly concerned about the conflict in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, which has become one of the\nmost serious challenges facing European States and\ninstitutions, the entire civilized world and the international\norganizations. We call for an immediate end to the war\nand the suffering of the population. A political solution\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina must be based on respect for\nthe interests of all parties. There must be compromise\nand realism on all sides. In our view, concerted action by\nthe participants in the Contact Group is the second\nprerequisite for the achievement of a lasting and just\nsolution to the conflict.\nLet me once again reaffirm the position of Bulgaria\non the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. My country will\nnot participate, directly or indirectly, in any military\n21\n\n\nactivities on the territory of the former Yugoslavia - not\neven under the flag of the United Nations - and we call\nupon the other Balkan States to do likewise. \\\"Restraint\\\"\nshould be the key word for the Balkan region. Bulgaria\nwill continue to pursue a constructive and balanced policy\nand will not take part in any one or other grouping of\nBalkan countries. Thus it will maintain its stabilizing role\nin the region.\nBulgaria subscribes to the view that in the current\ncircumstances it would not be appropriate to lift the arms\nembargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina. This, in our\nview, would make the conflict even more uncontrollable.\nWe welcome the adoption of Security Council\nresolutions 941 (1994), 942 (1994) and 943 (1994), which\nreflect in a balanced way the current developments in the\nregion. We hope that the easing of the sanctions against\nSerbia and Montenegro will be followed by the adoption of\na responsible policy by the party concerned, thus leading to\nfurther normalization of the situation in the region. We\nappeal to the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs to accept the\nproposed peace settlement and to act in accordance with the\nnorms of civilized behaviour.\nThe crisis in the former Yugoslavia is directly related\nto yet another important problem - that of equitable burden-\nsharing, not only in implementing the sanctions imposed by\nthe Security Council but also in overcoming their adverse\neffect on the economies of third countries. The decision to\nabide strictly by the sanctions has not been an easy one for\nus. We joined in the sanctions against Serbia and\nMontenegro - sanctions mandated by the United Nations -\nin the conviction that they are one of the peaceful means by\nwhich the international community can contribute to a\nsolution of the conflict. The sanctions have, however,\ncaused significant direct and indirect losses to my country.\nOn three occasions since 1991 - as a result of the sanctions\nagainst Iraq, Libya, and Serbia and Montenegro - Bulgaria\nhas requested consultations with the Security Council\nregarding its special economic problems. Let me point out\nthat the adverse effects of the sanctions have came at a\ntime of major economic transformation. They distort trade\nseriously and hence have a significant negative impact on\nthe economy, affecting primarily the emerging private\nsector.\n\nAt a time of reorientation of foreign trade within our\nEuropean integration policy, the implementation of the\nsanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n(Serbia and Montenegro) has cut off our normal trade\nroutes to European markets. The lack of adequate\nalternative transport corridors makes our export activity\nmuch less competitive and sometimes even impossible.\nThe sanctions are far from being the only source of\nour problems and difficulties, but they definitely have a\nconsiderable negative impact on the overall political,\neconomic, security and social situation in my country. I\nwould say that the burden of the sanctions exceeds the\npoint of reasonable economic and social tolerance in\nBulgaria, given the lack of adequate financial, economic\nand trade assistance. Urgent measures are imperative to\novercome all those negative effects. Bulgaria would\nwelcome a more active involvement of international\ninstitutions and the developed countries in, for example,\nfinancing projects for improving the transport\ninfrastructure of the country as part of the alternative\nroad, railroad and communication links in Europe.\nAnother measure could be the provision of better market\naccess for Bulgarian goods and services. We also hope\nthat the sanctions Committee established under resolution\n724 (1991) will give favourable and timely consideration\nto the applications submitted by Bulgarian companies,\nespecially those for providing humanitarian aid to the\nBulgarian minority in eastern Serbia, whose situation is of\nprimary concern to us.\nThe United Nations has shown considerable\nunderstanding of our difficulties and has given us moral\nsupport. I would like to recall the adoption by consensus\nof General Assembly resolution 48/210, initiated by\nBulgaria and sponsored by a number of countries. We\nnow look forward to constructive discussions on the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report on this resolution. This should\nlead to the General Assembly\u2019s adoption of further\nrecommendations for practical steps aimed at assisting\nthird countries in alleviating their special economic\nproblems.\nBulgaria is of the view that in the process of\nrestructuring the United Nations account should be taken\nof the new political and economic realities of the world,\nas well as the specific problems of countries in transition\nto a market economy and of small States, while at the\nsame time observing the principles of international law\nand equality set forth in the United Nations Charter.\nThe improvement of interaction between the General\nAssembly, the Security Council and the\nSecretary-General, as well as the restructuring of the\n22\n\n\nmajor United Nations bodies in the social and economic\nsphere, will contribute to reinforcing the role of the United\nNations in the pursuit of the necessary balance between\npreventive diplomacy, promotion of sustainable\ndevelopment and protection of human rights.\nBulgaria is following with great interest the ongoing\ndiscussion on the question of equitable representation on the\nSecurity Council and increasing its membership while\npreserving its effectiveness. Our country is ready to\nparticipate actively in the search for consensus decisions.\nWe believe that the Security Council\u2019s work would be\nmuch more effective if, in the decision-making process on\nregional issues, the positions of neighbouring countries and\nStates concerned, as well as those of the respective regional\norganizations, were taken into consideration. This is\nparticularly important in cases where the Security Council\nconsiders the imposition of economic sanctions. It would\nbe useful to prepare and examine in advance a complex\nevaluation of the negative effects sanctions would have on\nthe economies of neighbouring countries.\nThere is also a need for greater transparency in the\nactivities of the sanctions Committees. We therefore\nsuggest that their meetings should be open to interested\nStates. The respective Chairmen could also conduct\nbriefings after each meeting to inform the States of the\ndecisions taken.\nThe States willing to provide contingents for\npeace-keeping operations should also be involved in the\nSecurity Council deliberations regarding these operations.\nIn addition, the recently established practice of holding\nregular meetings of the heads of current operations, the\nmember States of the Security Council and representatives\nof other interested States should be institutionalized,\nespecially in cases where the Security Council considers the\nmandate, composition and nationality of the contingents\ninvolved in a particular peace-keeping operation.\nBulgaria supports the efforts of the international\ncommunity aimed at preventing the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and at their elimination. At\nthe forthcoming Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) review and extension conference, we will\nadvocate an indefinite and unconditional extension of the\nTreaty. We are also happy to announce that this year\nBulgaria ratified the 1993 Convention on the Prohibition of\nthe Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. The\nRepublic of Bulgaria will continue to support regional and\nglobal initiatives on conventional disarmament and arms\ncontrol.\nIn today\u2019s world, peace and security, democracy and\nsustainable development are inseparable. We therefore\nsupport the strengthening of the United Nations role in\nthe social and economic field.\nThe further liberalization of world trade is an\nimportant factor in development. The successful\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations provides favourable prospects for wide\nliberalization and stable growth of world trade. The\nWorld Trade Organization will be of paramount\nimportance for the efficient functioning of the global trade\nsystem for the benefit of all countries. We expect that\nBulgaria will be able to finalize its negotiations on\naccession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT), including the results of the Uruguay Round,\nwithin a time-frame that will allow us to become a charter\nmember of the World Trade Organization.\nBulgaria is interested in taking all possible measures\naimed at achieving economic stability through sustainable\ndevelopment. Regional cooperation has a considerable\nrole in this regard. We hope that the Conference of\nMinisters of the Environment of the European countries,\nwhich is to take place in 1995 in Sofia, will contribute to\nreinforcing the positive trends in the solution of regional\nenvironmental problems.\nThe promotion and protection of human rights and\ncooperation in the humanitarian field has an especially\nimportant place in Bulgaria\u2019s domestic and foreign policy.\nWe support the strengthening and promotion of the\nUnited Nations monitoring mechanisms in the field of\nhuman rights, the establishment of the post of United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the\nincreased public awareness regarding human rights in all\nparts of the world and the activities of the\nnon-governmental organizations. The World Summit on\nSocial Development in Copenhagen and the Fourth World\nConference on Women in Beijing are expected to give a\nmajor impetus to the development and protection of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\nNext year we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations. We await it with a sense of\nresponsibility and hope. I am confident that the efforts of\nthe international community to build a new world security\n23\n\n\nsystem based on the effective maintenance of world peace\nand stability, respect for human rights and promotion of the\nmarket-economy principles and of universal democratic\nvalues will dominate the future of the world Organization.\nBulgaria is prepared to contribute to the achievement of\nthese goals.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first to\ncongratulate you most warmly, Sir, on your election as\nPresident. The Assembly could not have made a wiser\nchoice. I wish you all good fortune and success in your\nmission.\nIn a few months we shall commemorate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the birth of the United Nations. The United\nNations is the fullest expression man has yet achieved of\nthe age-old desire to escape from war and establish an\nenduring peace.\nWhen the United Nations was founded in San\nFrancisco 50 years ago the threat of nuclear war between\nthe super-Powers had already begun to cast a shadow\nacross the world. That shadow has now lifted, and we all\nlive and sleep more safely as a result. Yet as we approach\nthe anniversary we are all more conscious of the suffering\nand destruction that still disfigure parts of almost every\ncontinent in the world. The threats to international peace\nand security are more diffuse and perhaps less serious than\nthey were, but not less real and not less tragic for those\ncaught up in them.\nTo some extent, disappointment comes out of\nexaggerated expectation. There is still a tendency to think\nof the United Nations as if it were some great palace of\nworld order which descended splendidly from heaven 50\nyears ago. If that were our view, then every broken pane\nof glass in that palace, every door, every pillar fouled or\ndamaged would be a disgrace and a scandal.\nBut, of course, in reality world order does not descend\nfrom heaven at the moment when a Charter is signed. It is\nnot like that at all. World order is built painfully,\ngradually, brick by brick. Sometimes the wind and the\nweather destroy what has already been built. But the\nbuilders cannot afford to be discouraged - and we are all\nbuilders. They have to repair; they have to rebuild; they\nhave to hope that gradually in what they build the\nadvances will outnumber the retreats.\nThere have been recent advances that have been\ndramatic - beyond expectation. No one who was present\nat the Union Buildings in Pretoria this May could fail to\nbe moved at the birth of the new South Africa. The\ngoodwill and the cheerful determination of all South\nAfricans on that occasion were a marvelous refutation, it\nseemed to me, of the cynicism that so often weakens our\nwork.\nAnd we have seen the same as the peace process\ngathers strength in the Middle East.\nIn part of my own country, we may - and I fervently\nhope we shall - see killings cease, see fears slowly\ndissolve, as a result of the process started by the British\nand Irish Governments in the Downing Street Declaration\non Northern Ireland.\nIn Europe - in Cyprus, in the former Yugoslavia, in\nGeorgia -the United Nations has helped at least to contain\nif not yet to resolve deep-rooted conflicts. The world\u2019s\nmost intractable problems continue to be laid at your\ndoor, Mr. Secretary-General, like infants laid at the door\nof some medieval monastery. It is not surprising that, for\nall the efforts of 77,000 men and women serving in\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations in the field, our\nOrganization has had failures as well as successes to its\nname.\nAs is common in our society of mass media, the\nheadlines have been dominated by the reversals, and some\nof them have indeed been tragic. In Rwanda the efforts\nof the United Nations failed to avert genocide. In\nSomalia it looks as if our efforts have been effectively\nspurned by a people whose need for help seemed, and\nseems, self-evident.\nA word about Bosnia. There has in recent months,\nmercifully, been more peace in Bosnia. It is a fragile,\nuncertain, inconclusive, often interrupted peace, but it is\nstill better than what went before. We necessarily discuss\nBosnia all the time. The debate in particular in this\nbuilding about the United Nations arms embargo has at\ntimes seemed to rage more fiercely than the fighting on\nthe ground. Certainly the diplomatic efforts have been\nfrustrating. And I can understand those who believe that\nreverting to a fight, even a fight to the death, would be\n5\n\n\npreferable to the tangle of negotiations and compromise that\nsometimes seems to stretch ahead for ever.\nNevertheless, I do not agree with that opinion. We\nshould value, we should build on, the advances that have\nbeen made, we should value the lives that have been saved\nby the reduction in fighting on the ground. We can now\nsee perhaps more clearly that the United Nations Protection\nForce (UNPROFOR) has been essential in protecting\ncivilians and in preventing the Bosnian Serb army from\nmaking further advances. Who here can believe that\nGorazde, or Srebrenica or Zepa would still be in the hands\nof the Bosnian Government if it were not for the bravery\nand commitment of UNPROFOR troops?\nUNPROFOR can operate only if it is able to keep\nlines open to all the parties to the fighting. It could not\ncontinue if leading members of the United Nations were\nrearming one side; UNPROFOR would then be identified\nas a party to the war. It is not mandated or equipped for\nthat purpose. Our Secretary-General has endorsed that\nview, and the Commander of United Nations forces in\nBosnia has rightly said \\\"We have not come here to fight a\nwar from inside white painted vehicles\\\".\nSo I welcome the decision of which we heard\nyesterday from the Bosnian President, the decision to accept\nthat now is not the moment to lift the arms embargo. And\nthat Bosnian decision allows UNPROFOR to continue its\nmission. We have said before that if the Bosnian Serbs do\nnot join the peace process and agree the map presented by\nthe Contact Group, then our present approach may become\nexhausted. Lifting the arms embargo may become\nunavoidable, as we said at Geneva in July, and in those\ncircumstances UNPROFOR would have to withdraw. But\nit would not be a good policy. Indeed, it would be a policy\nof despair, a policy that, as in Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear,\n\\\"Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,\n\\\"...\n\\\"That things might change or cease\\\". (King Lear, Act\nIII, scene i, l. 5)\nA real solution to the conflict, as always, lies with\nthose who are doing the fighting. We from outside must\ncontinue to show all the parties that the way forward is\npolitical agreement and not more military action. There is\na settlement plan, the settlement plan of the Contact Group,\non the table. Those who refuse it, those who continue the\nwarfare, must be isolated, must be put under sustained -\nindeed, increased - pressure. Those who cooperate with the\ninternational peace plan effectively, in deeds and not just\nin words, should have that cooperation recognized.\nI need to say a few words in response to the remarks\nmade yesterday by the distinguished President of\nArgentina concerning the dispute over the Falkland\nIslands. President Menem was right - and I am glad that\nhe mentioned it - when he referred to the increasing\ncooperation between the United Kingdom and Argentina\nin several areas. Indeed, this cooperation nowadays\ncharacterizes our bilateral relationship. And we certainly\nhope, sincerely hope, that the progress that we have\nachieved together will not be reversed.\nWe are quite clear about British sovereignty over the\nFalkland Islands and the other British dependencies in the\nSouth Atlantic, so we were concerned at the recent\nincorporation into the constitution of Argentina of the\nnew clause to which President Menem referred. It seems\nto us that in these Falkland Islands, as in Northern\nIreland, we must heed the wishes of the people\nconcerned. Indeed, any other course for us or for the\nUnited Nations would be inconceivable. This body has\nheard those wishes of the Islanders expressed, most\nrecently by their elected representatives who visited the\nUnited Nations for the debate in the Committee of 24 last\nJuly.\nSo we have a difference. But despite this difference,\nwe have joined a dialogue with the Argentine\nGovernment on fisheries and petroleum development. We\nlook forward to resuming discussions in the near future\nwith the Argentine authorities on a new agreement on\nfishing and on the development of possible hydrocarbon\nresources in the South Atlantic continental shelf. We are\nalso discussing the welcome Argentine offer to remove\nmines from the Falklands. It seems to me that that is the\nrational and logical path to the wider progress of which\nthe President of Argentina spoke.\nI return to this Organization. It is often the target of\ncriticism because it cannot solve every problem laid at its\ndoor. We all know that there is scope for improving the\nperformance of the United Nations here in New York\nand, more critically, where the United Nations and its\nagencies are in action on the ground. The steps taken so\nfar are a beginning, but only a beginning.\nMachinery cannot run on thin air. The United\nNations can only run on the fuel that we, its Member\nStates, supply to it. So where it has failed, we must not\npretend that the failure lies with the system. It lies with\n6\n\n\nus. The failure of the United Nations is our failure, and so\nit is for us to take action. For example, the sufferings of\nthe Rwandan refugees will not be helped by Member\nStates\u2019 holding their heads in their hands. Their hands\nshould be ready to provide from their pockets what is\nneeded to remedy such suffering.\nPreventive diplomacy is the ideal. But it often will\nnot be enough. We have to be prepared for the demand for\npeace-keepers to continue. There are practical ways in\nwhich we can respond better to that demand: first, by\nensuring that we learn the lessons from our experiences in\npeace-keeping; secondly, by taking practical steps to\nimprove our capacity to keep the peace, especially in\nAfrica; and, thirdly, by reforming our financing system.\nI should like to say a brief word about peace-keeping.\nIt is often impossible to predict at the outset of a mission\nwhat demands or dangers United Nations troops will\nencounter. Within limits, they must be ready to improvise.\nBut allowing their role to drift from peace-keeping to taking\nsides in a war carries high risks to the troops themselves,\nto the political process they support, and to the ability of\nthe United Nations to put in peace-keepers elsewhere. It\nundermines the willingness of Member States to contribute\ntroops. So in making their decision to contribute to a\nUnited Nations operation countries need to be confident that\ntheir troops will be supporting peace and not becoming a\nparty to war.\nRwanda put this to the test, and we were found\nwanting for a response for the time being. The issue was\nnot really whether the United Nations should have sent an\nintervention force to stop the fighting - which it clearly\ncould not - but whether it could find the means, the men\nand the equipment, for a force to protect the civilian\npopulation. That, tragically, took far too long.\nThat is the latest lesson we need to learn from. It is\nnot now, it seems to me, a question of will, because there\nis a far greater readiness than there used to be to\ncontemplate intervention on the ground to mitigate or\nprevent humanitarian disaster. It is not so much the will,\nthe intellectual willingness; it is the resources, the know-\nhow, the ability to respond swiftly, which are still not\nenough.\nYou, Mr. Secretary-General, have pointed this out over\nand over again, and I should like to pay tribute to the\npatience and persistence with which you have rammed\nhome this lesson and sought not merely to tell us the truths\nabout it but to persuade us into practical action and remedy.\nI agree with what you have said on many occasions. We\nneed to work hard and fast to overcome obstacles which\nare essentially practical.\nWe British will continue to contribute practically.\nWe have 4,000 British men and women in blue berets,\nfrom Georgia to Rwanda, something which would have\nbeen thought inconceivable even 10 years ago. We have\nthe seconded British experts at United Nations\nHeadquarters. The speed with which the Department of\nPeace-keeping Operations has adapted to cope with ever-\nincreasing demand has been impressive. The\ndevelopment of the professional military staff at United\nNations Headquarters has been particularly welcome. So\nhas the trend to bring more seconded staff in alongside\nUnited Nations personnel. But it will be vital also to help\nto strengthen our ability to respond quickly in areas where\nit remains weak. Africa, in the light of experience,\nshould be a priority.\nAfrica\u2019s need for peace-keepers is plain to see:\nnearly 40 per cent of all United Nations peace-keepers are\ndeployed in Africa. Africa needs peace. There can be no\ndoubt of that, because it is only in peace that Africans\nwill succeed in finding their own solutions to their\nproblems. The remarkable events in South Africa earlier\nthis year showed that.\nThe efforts of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) to develop a coherent approach to the prevention\nof conflict are welcome. They deserve our full support.\nBut the OAU has warned that its resources are not\nenough. I believe that the United Nations must respond.\nBy setting up a coherent structure of support systems,\nrunning from early warning and preventive diplomacy\nright through to humanitarian and peace-keeping\ndeployment on the ground, we can make sure that the\nskills and resources can be put into action as soon as the\nneed arises, and not months later.\nWhat does that mean? It means, first, an early\nwarning system. Not all conflicts can be foreseen. Some\nare triggered by assassination or a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat or other\nsudden events. More often, surely, we can see trouble\nbrewing: competition for land and resources, ethnic or\nreligious rivalry, the gradual breakdown of law and order,\nill-judged responses by central governments. We need a\nmechanism to pull together information and analysis of\nevents like these, to take a regular forward look at\npotential troublespots and decide whether preventive\ndiplomacy needs to be triggered.\n7\n\n\nThen, secondly, it means a capacity to react, that is to\nsay, to intervene diplomatically before warfare breaks out.\nWe do not have that capacity now. Britain and France - we\nannounced this last year - have offered help, making\navailable experienced diplomats and offering equipment and\nsupport. There needs to be an institutional framework. In\nEurope we have the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), which operates to agreed\nprinciples and has intervened, for example, in Ukraine,\nMoldova and the Baltic States to try to help parties to\nresolve disputes before there is recourse to fighting. The\nOAU has its own experience of pre-emptive action, and it\nwould clearly need to be the focal point of an enhanced\neffort in Africa. I am proposing that the United Nations\nshould help the OAU and African countries to share this\nexpertise and establish agreed mechanisms for preventive\ndiplomacy in Africa.\nBut, thirdly, that will not always be enough. Peace-\nkeeping skills will continue to be in demand. We must\nbuild up the necessary capabilities in Africa. Many African\ncountries already make a major contribution to peace-\nkeeping - Ghana, Egypt, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia,\nto mention just some. But we all know the United Nations\nhas not been able to deploy in Africa with the necessary\nspeed and effectiveness.\nI therefore propose that, under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, a number of military staff colleges existing\nin Africa should become peace-keeping skills centres; that\nis to say, they should give training in doctrines and\ndisciplines of peace-keeping, and in mediation and conflict\nresolution.\nThe physical capacity also needs to be strengthened if\nintervention is to be rapid when it is needed. That requires\nUnited Nations logistics basing centres, like those already\nexisting in Europe, to store equipment and ensure that it is\nquickly available, with rapid mobile logistics teams,\nearmarked by Member States, to help to maintain that\nequipment in good running order and to give training and\non-the-spot maintenance support. Again, the lesson of\nRwanda is clear. These centres will also need headquarters\nstaff to identify and remedy logistic weaknesses, give\nadvice on maps or communications and advise existing and\npotential troop contributors.\nThese are not proposals for enormous new machinery.\nWe need a framework within which existing resources,\ncapability and know-how can be mobilized. We will\nstrongly support such an effort. It needs further\ndiscussion - above all, among and with African countries.\nWe would welcome such discussion soon, here in New\nYork, to develop these ideas, other people\u2019s ideas and\ntake some practical decisions quickly.\nFinally, money. As you, Mr. Secretary-General,\nremind us, as you are bound to remind us, the United\nNations at the moment works miracles with what we do\nnot pay it. It simply cannot keep running on exhausted\ncredit. It must be able to pay its peace-keepers, for\nexample. We will not be able to build up the operations\nof the United Nations unless we act now to put the\nfinances of the United Nations on a sound and sustainable\nfooting for the long term.\nNo radical change in principles is needed, but we do\nneed a sensible updating of the way in which assessments\nare calculated. The existing system was adopted in 1973.\nMuch has changed. No one now would propose that\nStates with above average per capita incomes should\nenjoy an 80 per cent discount on their peace-keeping\ncontributions. No one now would suggest that discounts\nfor all the newly independent Member States should be\nabsorbed by five countries in an open-ended arrangement.\nBut that is the system. It means that some countries are\npaying too much and others too little. It means that we\nnow need to put these anomalies right. Moving to a\nsystem based on relative capacity to pay, with automatic\nadjustment for changing circumstances, would not mean\nvery much change for most countries, but it would mean\na fair, equitable basis on which the long-term viability\nand therefore vitality of the United Nations could be\nassured.\nA word about the Security Council. Reform is on\nthe agenda - that is quite right - and I believe it is in the\ninterests of the United Nations to sort out the question of\nenlargement in good time. We would like the momentum\nof discussion to be maintained.\nNext year\u2019s fiftieth anniversary is a good milestone\nfor the debate. We will work hard for a good outcome,\nboth on enlargement and on transparency, where recent\ninformal arrangements to improve consultation on peace-\nkeeping between the Secretariat, the Security Council and\ntroop contributors should be further developed.\nWe should ensure that the Council is representative,\nwhile avoiding an enlargement so great that it puts at risk\nthe effectiveness of the Council. If consensus can be\nreached, then clearly there are countries that, by virtue of\ntheir global interests and their contribution to international\n8\n\n\nsecurity and United Nations operations, should be invited to\naccept the responsibilities of permanent membership.\nI have concentrated today on how we deal with crises\nand defuse tensions. But, of course, those are only some of\nthe challenges that our Organization faces. Drug trafficking\nand associated international crime are other threats to our\nsecurity and well-being. We need to give new energy and\nencouragement to all those who are involved in developing\ncooperation against those threats. I mention this because I\nfeel that we must give particular support to the United\nNations International Drug Control Programme. This is the\nprogramme that has the responsibility for leading all the\nworld\u2019s efforts in this field. Once again, the United\nNations is the best resource we have for tackling a menace\nthat threatens the whole world.\nIn conclusion, we can say confidently that the United\nNations is indispensable. It is not a perfect glass palace,\nbut it is the best building we have, even though the winds\nstill blow cruelly through its gaps and its defects. We all,\ntherefore, have a duty to repair, make good, build afresh.\nNext year we will look back rightly on the\nachievements, and the list of achievements is long. But it\nwill remind us, and we will remind ourselves, of what has\nnot yet been achieved. And I hope that will stir us to show\nthe same vision, the same strength of purpose as the\nfounders of the United Nations, with, I hope, results of\nequal value for the next 50 years.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all, Sir, to congratulate you\nwarmly on your noteworthy election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Your presence,\ndear brother, at the head of the Assembly is clear proof of\nthe commitment of your country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, to the\ndefence of international ideals and the promotion of\nmultilateral diplomacy. Furthermore, your personal\ncompetence and the rich diplomatic experience you have\nacquired over the years are a guarantee of the success of\nour deliberations. My country, Guinea-Bissau, which holds\none of the vice-presidencies, wishes to assure you of its\ntotal availability and fullest cooperation.\nOur thanks and congratulations also go to your\nillustrious predecessor, Mr. Samuel Insanally, for the\nwisdom with which he guided the work of the forty-eighth\nsession.\nWe would also like to express our congratulations to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to\npay him a tribute for his tireless activity in the midst of\nso many dramatic events.\nThe general debate of the forty-ninth session reflects\nthe logic of the post-cold-war period, in which the burden\nof blocs, ideological confrontations and threats of nuclear\nhas been lightened, thus creating favourable conditions for\na new type of relationship between nations and peoples.\nThe political and socio-economic changes that have\ntaken place on the international scene undoubtedly will\nhave repercussions on the structure and functioning of the\nUnited Nations.\nCreated 49 years ago, the United Nations has long\nlived in the context of the bipolarization of blocs and of\nideologies. Today more than ever, our Organization is\ncalled upon to face the challenges of international politics\nin a different way.\nThe positive trend emerging on the international\nlevel thanks to joint efforts by many parties to preserve\nthis trend is nonetheless being thwarted by various\nhotbeds of tension and conflict in different regions of the\nworld.\nGuinea-Bissau, aware of this fact and of its harmful\nconsequences, is firmly committed to the promotion of a\nnew international conscience, based on respect for human\nvalues.\n\n\nThe United Nations, in order to better respond to the\nrequirements of our times, must take these new challenges\ninto account and thus undertake the necessary reforms.\nThe universally hailed end of bipolarization in\ninternational relations has brought about a rebirth of hope\nfor a new era of peace. Alas, the world is still the theatre\nof tragic and unforeseeable events.\nThe African continent is one of the regions of the\nworld that is most affected. Drought and desertification,\nwhich bring disorder to that continent, diminish its\nproductive capacity and provoke famine, is now being\ncompounded by fratricidal wars.\nIt is no accident that in the course of recent years\nmore than half of the peace-keeping operations of the\nUnited Nations have taken place, unfortunately, in Africa.\nIn Angola, the people continue to be victims of\nsuffering and atrocities. Guinea-Bissau once again urges\nthe parties to the conflict to fully respect the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions and hopes that the Lusaka talks\nwill produce results.\nIn Mozambique, significant progress has been\nachieved in the efforts to establish a lasting peace. We\nrepeat our congratulations to the Government and to the\nResist\u00eancia Nacional Mo\u00e7ambicana, and urge them to\npersevere along this road, which should lead to the holding\nof multiparty elections in the coming days.\nIn Liberia, the situation remains virtually unchanged,\ndespite numerous agreements concluded between the parties\nconcerned. If it continues, this state of affairs may imperil\nthe stability of the subregion.\nThe situation in Rwanda and in Somalia continues to\nbe of serious concern to my country. We urge all of the\nparties concerned to end hostilities in favor of dialogue for\nthe achievement of national reconciliation. My Government\nwelcomes the international community\u2019s unified actions on\nbehalf of these two countries, in particular \\\"Operation\nTurquoise,\\\" undertaken by France.\nWith regard to the situation in Western Sahara, my\ncountry\u2019s delegation welcomes the progress achieved and\nsupports the efforts of the Secretary-General.\nSimilarly, Guinea-Bissau is of the opinion that the\nconflicts in the former Yugoslavia must be resolved through\npeaceful negotiations.\nThe end of apartheid and the holding of the first free\nand democratic election in South Africa have turned a\npage in the history of that country, which is called upon\nto play an important role in Africa and in the world.\nThe peace agreement signed between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization, which provides for\nmutual recognition by the two parties, and the agreement\nbetween Israel and Jordan represent important steps\ntoward the creation of lasting peace in the region.\nConcerning the question of East Timor, we support\nthe continuation of all initiatives undertaken under the\nauspices of the Secretary-General with a view to bringing\nabout a just and equitable solution.\nRegarding Cuba, my country encourages dialogue\nbetween the United States and that country to find a\nsolution to the question of the embargo, the repercussions\nof which have a major impact on the population.\nIn the case of Haiti, we are pleased to note that after\nmany efforts by the United Nations and the Organization\nof American States, the fundamental rights of the Haitian\npeople have finally been re-established and democracy\nrestored with the return of the constitutionally elected\nPresident, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It is appropriate here\nto pay tribute to the decisive role played by the United\nStates in the implementation of Security Council\nresolution 940 (1994).\nRespect for human rights is a factor for peace and a\nguarantee of international stability. The full exercise of\nindividual rights presupposes the existence of objective\nconditions of economic and social organization based on\njustice and equity.\nThe international community must promote more just\nand constructive cooperation between States to combat the\nperverse effects of poverty and improve material\nconditions in the most needy countries and among the\nmost handicapped populations.\nWe are pleased at the results achieved by the World\nConference on Human Rights and hope that the\nresolutions and decisions agreed upon there will\ncontribute to the protection and strengthening of human\nrights.\nLike many preceding speakers, I wish to emphasize,\non behalf of Guinea-Bissau, that it is our firm conviction\nthat the Republic of China in Taiwan should regain its\n2\n\n\nplace in the United Nations, on the basis of the principles\nof parallel representation of divided countries. As a full-\nfledged Member of the United Nations, the Republic of\nChina in Taiwan, with its 20,000,000 inhabitants and its\nhighly advanced stage of economic and technological\ndevelopment, could play a preponderant role on the\ninternational scene. We hope that at its next session, which\nwill coincide with the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary\nof the founding of our world Organization, the General\nAssembly will decide to put this item on its agenda.\nGuinea-Bissau has just carried out multiparty\nlegislative and presidential elections, which were considered\njust and transparent by our people and by international\nobservers. These elections, which showed the good\ncitizenship and maturity of the people of Guinea-Bissau,\ntook place in a climate of exemplary civilian peace. Our\ncountry is firmly committed to the preservation and the\ndeepening of pluralistic democracy, a condition sine qua\nnon for any type of lasting development.\nAs emphasized by His Excellency Jo\u00e3o Bernardo\nVieira, President of our Republic, at his inauguration on 29\nSeptember this year, there were no losers in the elections in\nGuinea-Bissau. All the people of Guinea-Bissau and our\ncountry\u2019s national unity, stability and development were\nwinners.\nAt this new stage in the history of our country we are\nof course counting on our people\u2019s determination, but also\non the international community\u2019s support.\nWe welcome the success of the Uruguay Round and\nthe prospects for international trade that were opened up\nwith the signing of the Marrakesh Agreement and the\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization. We\nbelieve that the achievement of the objectives after more\nthan eight years of negotiations, resulting in the Declaration\nof Marrakesh, should have beneficial consequences for the\ndeveloping countries, thus enabling trade to play its\nefficient role as a motor for development.\nWe believe that it is urgent to revise the current\neconomic order, which strongly penalizes the developing\ncountries. Indeed, these countries, and those of Africa in\nparticular, are faced with the problems of the outflow of\ncapital and the deterioration of the terms of trade, which\nseriously compromise the economic and social development\nof the countries of the South. This extremely painful\nsituation is a significant cause of the developing countries\u2019\nexternal indebtedness.\nThe external debt of the developing countries in\ngeneral and of the African countries in particular remains\nan unbearable burden for their economies and a major\nobstacle to their development.\nGuinea-Bissau, with the support of its principal\neconomic partners, is continuing its efforts to find an\nappropriate and lasting solution to the debt problem,\nwhich has serious consequences for its socio-economic\ndevelopment.\nWe consider that the Organization should devote\nspecial attention to the United Nations New Agenda for\nthe Development of Agrica in the 1990s in order to speed\nup the process of the socio-economic transformation of\nthe continent. Similarly, we support the rapid\nimplementation of the \\\"Agenda for Development\\\".\nThe problem of desertification represents a major\nconcern for the Government of Guinea-Bissau, a country\nwhich, because it is located in the Sudano-Sahelian\nregion, is faced with persistent irregularities in rainfall, as\nwell as massive invasions of insects that destroy\nagricultural production. In this context, our country\nsupports the signing of an international convention to\ncombat desertification in those countries experiencing\nserious drought and/or desertification, particularly in\nAfrica.\nThe social and economic development activities of\nthe United Nations are in our view aimed in particular at\nthe most vulnerable groups - women, children, young\npeople, the aged and the handicapped. The situation in\nwhich the majority of people in the developing world are\nnow living deserves special attention from our\nOrganization.\nIn fact, the solution of the problem lies in a better\ndevelopment of North-South cooperation. If there is to be\nprogress in the developing countries, health and education\nsystems must be upgraded, and machinery must be\nestablished to eradicate hunger and poverty and improve\nliving conditions in the world.\nWe repeat our support for the convening of the\nWorld Summit for Social Development in 1995 and of the\nFourth World Conference on Women, as well as the\nPreparatory Conference in Dakar and Habitat II.\nThe international community is capable of meeting\nthe challenges facing it and of resolving complex\nproblems. Our Organization has many, sometimes\n3\n\n\ndifficult, tasks to accomplish. It is our sincere wish that the\nprocess of restructuring the United Nations system, so\nnecessary for the revitalization of the Organization, can be\ncompleted, so that the hopes that prevailed at the founding\nof the United Nations will be seen in a new light when we\ncelebrate the forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations.\n"

        "file_text": "Please allow me to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the exalted\noffice of President of the General Assembly. Your\ndistinguished career and your experience in international\naffairs, together with your outstanding personal qualities,\nassure us of wise and skilled leadership at the forty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nAs we approach the fiftieth year of the life of our\nOrganization, let us look back to the first principles of its\nexistence. Let us see how we can apply those principles\nto the dynamic realities of our time and, to the extent that\nhuman discernment will allow, to the uncertain\ncircumstances of the next half century.\nEmerging from the unspeakable horror and devastation\nof untrammelled global conflict, the international\ncommunity brought forth the United Nations as an\ninstrument, above all, for preventing conflict and keeping\nthe peace. This mission was to be carried out, if possible,\nthrough the encouragement of the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes by the contending parties themselves or, if\nnecessary, through the interposition of armed force by the\nUnited Nations.\nAs with any human institution, the United Nations\nrecord in this regard has been mixed. We find that the\nUnited Nations has been effective in keeping the peace in\nthose cases in which both the parties to the disputes and the\nmajor Powers involved have turned \u2014 or have been\ncompelled to turn \u2014 to the international community to\nseparate the contending forces and allow them a respite\nfrom war. This we have seen in such places as Cyprus,\nAngola, Mozambique, Liberia and certain parts of the\nMiddle East, including Lebanon.\nIn recent years, a singular success was achieved in my\nown part of the world when in Cambodia, upon the resolve\nof the international community and the Cambodian parties\nthemselves, the United Nations not only enforced the peace\nbut also managed the transition to a regime of peace and\nnational reconciliation.\nContending with matters of war and peace has\nengaged the greater portion of the attention and\npreoccupation of the United Nations and of the international\ncommunity. However, our founding fathers recognized\nfrom the very beginning that it is not enough to head off\ncrises and intervene in conflicts, but that the roots of war\nand peace lie in the human condition and the human mind.\nIt is thus there, at their roots, that mankind must deal with\nquestions of war and peace.\nAs we look back at this half-century, we see with\nextraordinary clarity that the enduring triumphs of the\ninternational community have come not with the imposition\nof outside force but when the deepest concerns of the\nnations and peoples involved are addressed and resolved.\nIn the past year, two such triumphs brightened, like twin\ncomets, the history of the human community, forcefully\ndemonstrating yet again this essential reality. These\ntriumphant achievements came in precisely those two areas\nthat had most deeply engaged the United Nations for the\ngreater part of its existence \u2014 South Africa and the\nMiddle East.\nIn South Africa, national peace and reconciliation in\na regime of democracy emerged victorious after decades\nof struggle, led by the United Nations, against apartheid\nand on behalf of human dignity, racial equality, majority\nrule and political pluralism. This happened only after\nmost of the political forces in the country recognized\nthese universal values as essential to the survival of the\nSouth African nation.\nIn the Middle East, the dramatic breakthrough\nworked out by Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO) has opened the doors of hope for an\nend to the Arab-Israeli conflict. This was made possible\nby the tenacious insistence of the international\ncommunity, mainly through the United Nations, on the\nright of the Palestinian people to govern themselves and\non the right of all States in the region to a secure\nexistence within internationally recognized boundaries. It\nfinally occurred because the leaders of Israel and the PLO\nand other Arab leaders recognized the essential nature of\nthese rights.\nSadly, savage conflicts continue to ravage lives in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, Rwanda and other\nareas experiencing similar tragedies, mainly because\npeople of influence among the various ethnic groups,\ntribes and clans have not accepted the fundamental truth\nof their common humanity.\nFor a long time, the United Nations has advanced\nthe proposition that economic development \u2014 raising the\nincome of a nation as a whole \u2014 was vital to peace and\nstability in the world. The United Nations is certainly\nright to emphasize this important reality. In many cases,\nextreme poverty has led to despair and to a sense of\noutrage over the perceived injustice of living in penury\nand deprivation in a world of affluence and profligate\nconsumption, of being inadequately compensated for the\nuse by others of one\u2019s nation\u2019s human and natural\nresources, and of being doomed to a chronic inability to\nshake off an unpayable debt to foreign creditors.\nFortunately, many developing nations \u2014 and the\nPhilippines is proud to take its place among them \u2014 have\nmade hard political decisions and adopted economic\npolicies favourable to dynamic and sustained economic\ngrowth.\n19\n\n\nThese are thus hopeful times for economic growth, at\nleast for those countries in a position to take advantage of\na more liberal international trading regime. However, as\nmany countries, and the United Nations itself, have\nrealized, economic development by itself is not enough.\nRaising the overall income of a nation is not enough. A\nlarger gross national product does not necessarily mean a\nbetter life for the individual citizen. A bigger economy by\nitself does not satisfy the individual person\u2019s aspiration to\nhuman fulfilment.\nIndeed, economic growth cannot be sustained for long\nunless the individual citizen and the individual community\nhave a stake in that growth and unless they are mobilized\nand empowered to take active part in the process of\ndevelopment. Economic growth would be meaningless to\nthe individual who does not share in its benefits or whose\ncommunity is destroyed by it. Development is empty for\npersons who are deprived of their individual rights and\nfreedoms. A society cannot find fulfilment in growth, and\nindeed the development process itself is severely hampered,\nif it does not take adequate care of its vulnerable groups:\nwomen, children, ethnic minorities, the handicapped, the\nhomeless. Development cannot be sustained unless the\nnurturing qualities of the natural environment are conserved\nfor future generations.\nCare for citizens\u2019 fulfilment as human beings, for their\ncommunity and for society cannot wait. It cannot wait for\ntotal peace to be achieved or for a certain level of\ndevelopment to be attained. All these \u2014 peace,\ndevelopment, and the quality of society and of human\nlife \u2014 must proceed simultaneously.\nWe in the Philippines have learned this lesson the hard\nway and are now applying it faithfully. We have secured\npeace and national reconciliation through a peace process\nthat includes having sincere discussions with dissident\nelements and extending a generous amnesty to them. We\nhave granted a substantial degree of autonomy and self-rule\nto our ethnic minorities, particularly the Muslim\ncommunity. We have devolved extensive authority,\nresponsibility and resources on local governments and\ncommunities, and we have restored the system of\ndemocratic pluralism, through which the people and their\ngroups can thrash out their grievances and advance their\ninterests in peace and with civility.\nAt the same time, we have pursued a purposeful\nprogramme of economic development through the\nliberalization of the conditions governing trade, investments,\nand banking and finance, and through the privatization of\nGovernment enterprises. We have provided infrastructure\nfacilities and generous incentives for domestic and foreign\ninvestors. These, together with the restoration of political\nstability, have placed us back on the road to economic\nrecovery and self-sustaining growth.\nSimultaneously, we have adopted a social agenda\nthrough a broad national consensus. In accordance with\nthat agenda we have endeavoured to improve the quality\nof life of our people, not only because such an\nimprovement is their inherent right, and not only because\nthe ultimate purpose of development, in our view, is the\nwelfare of the individual and his community, but also\nbecause we know that the best way to spur economic\ndevelopment is to afford the people a stake in it and\nbecause we recognize that the people are an economy\u2019s\nmost vital resource.\nWe are thus jealously safeguarding the individual\nFilipino\u2019s fundamental rights and freedoms. Part of this\neffort is the importance that we place on human-rights\neducation for all, including the armed forces and the\npolice, a mission that is mandated by a unique provision\nin our Constitution.\nWe are expanding the empowerment of our people\nand their communities, particularly of the most vulnerable\ngroups. We have devoted attention and resources to the\nconcerns of women, including women workers, and of\nchildren, particularly those of the poor. We have\nprotected the rights and culture of our ethnic minorities.\nAnd we have allocated substantial resources to health and\neducation for the development of our people as our most\nvaluable asset.\nWe in the Philippines believe that this simultaneous\nand balanced approach to peace, development and the\nquality of individual lives must be applied in the\ninternational community as well as within nations, in the\nfamily of man as well as in national societies.\nThe expansion of the global economy is important\nfor peace in the world and the progress of nations, but it\nis not enough. Each country must have a stake in this\nexpansion and an enlarged share of it.\nEven this is not enough. The international\ncommunity must go beyond nations in its ministrations.\nIt must devote greater attention to care and respect for\npeople and to the recognition of the inherent equality of\nall human beings \u2014 regardless of gender, of age, of race,\nof religion, of language, of culture or of nationality.\n20\n\n\nWe must all remember that the sources of conflict do\nnot lie only in disputes over territory or resources. As we\nknow only too well, they arise also, and it seems\nincreasingly, from intolerance of other people\u2019s beliefs and\ncultures and from the less than human treatment of people\nfrom other lands.\nMankind has made progress in advancing the truth that\nthere are certain things that transcend national boundaries\nand are the common heritage, the common concern and the\ncommon responsibility of all nations and of mankind as a\nwhole. Among these are the environment and the oceans\nand their resources.\nThere is something else that transcends national\nboundaries and summons global responsibility, something\nthat is of infinitely greater worth than even the environment\nor the oceans. I am speaking of the world\u2019s most\nvulnerable human groups. I speak specifically of migrant\nworkers, refugees, children, the aged and the disabled, and\nthe special concerns of the world\u2019s women.\nThe transnational migration of workers is an\nincreasingly prominent phenomenon of international life in\nour time. This is the result of supply and demand for\nworkers seeking equilibrium. Migrant workers, however,\nare more than a commodity to be traded in the international\nmarket-place. They have the same dignity and rights as\nany of us in this Hall. Moreover, they make a vital\ncontribution to the economies and societies of the countries\nin which they live and work.\nAnd yet, many countries, including developing\ncountries, treat migrant workers as being less than the\nhuman beings that they are. At best, these workers are left\nunprotected by the law governing labour and employment.\nThe international community, the United Nations, cannot\nallow the abuse of these vulnerable and valuable members\nof the human family to continue.\nWe urge member States to ratify or accede to the\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights of\nAll Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families as an\nexpression of their recognition of the common humanity\nthat they share with migrants and their families.\nThe Secretary-General might form a group to submit\nrecommendations to the Assembly at our next session on\nimproving coordination of the various efforts of the United\nNations on behalf of migrant workers. And I call upon the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights to make the rights\nof migrant workers one of his priority concerns.\nI reiterate the call for a global conference on\ninternational migration and development, which was\nsupported by many delegations at the recent International\nConference on Population and Development, held in\nCairo.\nNatural and man-made disasters have created\nlarge-scale flows of refugees around the world. While the\ndistinction between refugees and economic migrants has\nto be resolutely made, genuine refugees must be given all\nthe protection that international conventions call for.\nChildren, by their very nature, have a claim to\nmankind\u2019s protection and care. That claim is special in\nthe case of street children, children coerced into drug\naddiction, refugee children and children in the areas of\narmed conflict or natural disasters. National societies and\nthe international community must ensure that such\nchildren are provided with adequate food, medical care,\nshelter and education. We may need to draw up a\nconvention dealing with the sale of children, child\nprostitution, child pornography and the nefarious trade in\nbody parts of children.\nThe rights, education and empowerment of women\naround the world are of special importance to the United\nNations and to the world, as they have everything to do\nwith some of mankind\u2019s most vital concerns \u2014 the health\nand education of children, the advancement of the\neconomy, the preservation of the environment and the\nmanagement of the country\u2019s and the world\u2019s population.\nWe in the Philippines look forward to the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women, and call for the inclusion\nin its platform of action of measures for the protection\nand advancement of women\u2019s rights, particularly of\nwomen in positions of great vulnerability, including\nwomen migrant workers, women refugees, and minority\nwomen. We also call upon the Ninth United Nations\nCongress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment\nof Offenders to take steps towards making gender-based\nviolence a crime, especially violence against women\nmigrant workers and the victims of the traffic in women.\nUnderlying the need to safeguard the welfare of\nthese vulnerable groups is the fundamental issue of\nhuman rights, the issue of respect for all people and their\nrights, the issue of their inherent equality as human\nbeings. The United Nations has adopted numerous\ninternational instruments on human rights, beginning with\nthe Universal Declaration. The Philippines is party to 21\nof these.\n21\n\n\nThe United Nations must renew its commitment to\nfoster compliance with these solemn covenants, always with\nrespect for the sovereignty of nations. Since the concept of\nthe inherent rights and equality of human persons resides in\nthe minds of people, United Nations efforts in this regard\nmust begin with education. As our Constitution proclaims,\nhuman-rights education is itself a human right.\nOur delegation reaffirms its full support for a proposal\nintroduced last year for the declaration of a United Nations\ndecade on human rights education. At the same time, the\nUnited Nations human rights machinery must be\nstrengthened, particularly the new office of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human\nRights.\nEven as we refocus our concerns on basic human\nneeds, we should not lose sight of the continuing, and even\nincreased, importance of peace-keeping in the mandate of\nthe United Nations. We must, however, make sure that the\npeace-keeping function does not divert resources from\neconomic and social development, is not used by the major\nPowers simply to pursue their respective agendas, and is\ncarried out in a transparent and democratic manner.\nThe Philippines fully supports an approach to\ninternational peace and security that is based on securing\nfriendly relations among peoples of different political,\ncultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds, respect for\ninternational law, and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nWe believe that the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity should not rest primarily on the use or threat of\nsanctions, armed force, or other coercive measures. Nor\nshould peace-keeping operations, important as they are, take\nthe place of the political settlement of disputes.\nIn light of this, and because of the growing number\nand complexity of United Nations peace-keeping operations,\nwe in the United Nations have to agree on a set of guiding\nprinciples for the establishment and conduct of such\noperations. Such a set of guidelines would not only\ncontribute to the effectiveness of the peace-keeping\noperations but also broaden the base of active support for\nthem. The maintenance of international peace and security\nis a collective responsibility. The United Nations must\nensure the international nature of all peace-keeping\noperations if it is to maintain their credibility.\nIt is in this spirit that we approach the live question of\nthe reform of the Security Council. It is ironic that, in the\nmidst of the rapid spread of democracy within nations in\nrecent years and the expanding membership of the United\nNations, the Security Council remains unrepresentative in\nits size and in the geographic distribution of its\nmembership and undemocratic in its decision-making and\nworking methods.\nClearly, while the composition and methods of the\nSecurity Council must reflect the realities of political and\neconomic power, we have to redress the imbalance in its\ncomposition and increase the participation of the general\nmembership and other United Nations organs in its\ndecision-making, if we are to enhance its effectiveness\nand its accountability. This would involve both enlarging\nthe Council\u2019s membership and reforming its methods and\nprocedures.\nSpecifically, we believe that the Council\u2019s\nmembership should be better balanced in terms of\ngeographic distribution and increased representation of the\ndeveloping countries. At the same time, the Security\nCouncil has to improve the transparency of its working\nmethods and decision-making processes, which, in turn,\nwould enhance its working relationship with the general\nmembership and the other principal organs of the United\nNations, especially the General Assembly. We look\nforward to early action on this aspiration by the working\ngroup of the General Assembly dealing with the\nexpansion of the Security Council and related matters.\nThe General Assembly, for its part, must revitalize\nitself if it is to carry out its functions and discharge its\nresponsibilities under the Charter, including those\npertaining to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity in which it must assert its role as the only\nprincipal organ with universal membership. In the past\ntwo years, the General Assembly adopted two resolutions\nto this effect. Let us begin implementing their key\nprovisions.\nRevitalization of the United Nations is demanded by\nthe new circumstances and challenges of today\u2019s dynamic\nworld. Let us, at the very least, do our very best to\nuphold and strengthen the principle of universality in our\nOrganization.\nIt is in the interest of revitalizing the United Nations\nthat the effective management of the Organization\nassumes enormous importance. The Philippine delegation\nwelcomes the creation by the General Assembly of the\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services. We suggest,\nhowever, that the Assembly consider the possible\nestablishment of an independent advisory group to\noversee the work and receive the reports of this Office.\n22\n\n\nThis would provide the checks and balances so necessary\nin a large organization such as the United Nations.\nAs the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\napproaches, we must ensure that the balance is maintained\namong the principal concerns of the Organization \u2014 the\nmaintenance of peace and security, the promotion of\neconomic progress and the advancement of social\ndevelopment.\nBecause it has lagged behind the first two of the\npreoccupations of the United Nations, I suggest that we\nnow pay closer attention and turn our efforts more to the\nthird of our Organization\u2019s principal concerns \u2014 the social\ncomponent of the basic needs of the human community and\nthe human person.\nAs we approach this important milestone of the\nOrganization, it is altogether fitting that we focus the work\nof the United Nations on the human person and society,\nwhose interest and welfare, after all, are the ultimate reason\nfor the existence of the United Nations and the final\nobjective of its works.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me first of all, on behalf\nof the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to convey\nto you our congratulations on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly. We hope that under\nyour presidency the General Assembly will bring its work\nto a fruitful conclusion.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our\nappreciation of the activities and efforts of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to\nstrengthen the United Nations and enhance its\nresponsibility and its role.\nBefore I begin my statement, allow me also to\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General, to the\nSecretariat of the United Nations, and to the specialized\nagencies and other organizations in the United Nations\nsystem for the deep condolences they expressed on the\ndemise of our respected leader, Comrade Kim Il Sung,\nformer President of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea.\nMay I also take this opportunity to extend our\nprofound thanks to the Heads of State or Government, to\nthe Governments and to the peoples of different countries\nfor their messages of deep condolence and consolation as\nwell as for their arrangement of services of mourning for\nour great leader.\nOur respected President Kim Il Sung devoted his\nefforts, throughout his life, to ensuring the prosperity of\nour motherland and to the freedom and happiness of its\npeople and to world peace and the progress of humanity.\nOur leader\u2019s passing is a very great loss and profound\ngrief for our nation. He performed immortal exploits,\nwhich will go down in the annals of history through his\ntireless and energetic activities from his early years to the\nadvanced age of over 80. Although the heart of our leader\nhas ceased to beat, his great exploits will be remembered\nfor ever. Our great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung will\nalways be with us.\nDespite the greatest loss that our nation has suffered\nin its five-thousand-year-long history, our people have\nbeen able to turn their grief and sorrow into strength and\ncourage and they have been able to rise up again, because\nthey have another great leader, Comrade Kim Jong Il,\nwho has inherited the ideology, the qualities of leadership\nand the lofty virtues of our paternal leader.\nOur dear leader Comrade Kim Jong Il is the supreme\nleader of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and\nthe Supreme Commander of its revolutionary armed\nforces. A man of literary and military accomplishments,\n5\n\n\nof loyalty and filial piety, a man perfectly endowed with\nthe qualities and traits of leadership, Comrade Kim Jong Il\nenjoys the greatest respect and the absolute confidence of\nour people, who have entrusted him with their destiny and\ntheir future.\nOur society is characterized by the close unity between\nthe leader and the people in a socialist system centred upon\nthe popular masses, a system which they have chosen and\nwhich they have built on their own.\nOur dear leader Comrade Kim Jong Il remains\ncommitted to his life-long mission of carrying forward and\naccomplishing the revolutionary cause pioneered by our\nfatherly leader through generations and he is energetically\nleading the overall affairs of our party, State and armed\nforces. The Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea is firmly committed to fully carrying\nforward and further building on the accomplishments of the\nrespected leader President Kim Il Sung, and the lifetime\nteachings of the leader remain the guideline for our\nactivities. Our people will follow the wise leadership of\nComrade Kim Jong Il, more firmly as they arm themselves\nwith the Juche idea, the revolutionary idea of the respected\nleader Comrade Kim Il Sung, and defend, safeguard and\nglorify our socialism, which is their life and soul.\nThe lifelong desire of the great leader Comrade Kim\nIl Sung was the reunification of our country, and he worked\nenergetically until the last minute of his life for its\nrealization. National reunification is the patriotic cause\nrelated to the destiny of our nation and it is the supreme\ntask of our nation and one that can be delayed no longer.\nIt is indeed an intolerable tragedy that the division of\nour nation that began in the 1940s has lasted until today, at\na time when humanity is preparing to usher in the twenty-\nfirst century.\nThe Government and people of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea, being desirous of national\nreunification, have long been exerting every effort to\nachieve reunification on the basis of the three principles of\nindependence, peaceful reunification and national unity; the\nproposal for the establishment of a confederal State; and the\nTen-Point Programme for Great Unity of the Whole Nation\nfor the country\u2019s reunification, serves as the common\nreunification programme of the nation.\nAs there exist different ideologies and political systems\nin the north and the south of Korea, the establishment of a\nconfederation based on the concept of one nation and one\nState, two systems and two governments, is the only way\nto achieve reunification on the basis of the principle of\nneither side conquering or being conquered by the other.\nThis is the cardinal principle for reunification that\ncorresponds to current reality existing in the Korean\npeninsula.\nThe major stumbling-blocks to humanitarian\nexchanges, dialogue and contacts between the north and\nsouth are South Korea\u2019s so-called \u201cNational Security\nLaw\u201d, which defines fellow countrymen as enemies, and\nthe concrete wall, a symbol of division and confrontation.\nAll the legal and physical barriers must be removed at an\nearly date if we are to achieve our consistent goals of free\ntravel and contacts, cooperation and exchanges between\nthe north and the south and if we are to realize national\nunity. This is not only the unanimous demand of the\nentire Korean people and the world\u2019s peoples but also the\ntrend of the times.\nOur nation is firm in its will and intention to achieve\nnational reunification in the 1990s. Our people will\ncertainly open the door to national reunification by\nachieving the unity of all Korean nationals in the north\nand the south and abroad on the basis of national\npatriotism and a spirit of national independence, thereby\npromoting coexistence, co-prosperity and common\ninterests, dispelling the fears of northward invasion and\nsouthward invasion and the fears of prevalence over\ncommunism and of communization and by working\ntogether to establish an independent, peaceful, neutral,\nreunified State transcending the differences in doctrines\nand views.\nAn important point in defusing the tensions and\nbringing about peace on the Korean peninsula is to\nreplace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace\nagreement and to establish a new peace arrangement to\nreplace the current armistice mechanism. The Korean\nArmistice Agreement is a provisional step that envisages\nthe suspension of any military actions between the\nbelligerent parties and its subsequent conversion into a\npeace agreement.\nThe Armistice Agreement states, in paragraph 60 of\narticle IV, that, in order to help establish a lasting peace\non the Korean peninsula, a political conference of both\nsides should be held at a higher level. However, such a\npolitical conference has yet to be convened and the\nunstable armistice has lasted so far.\n6\n\n\nOver the last four decades or so the Korean Armistice\nAgreement and the armistice mechanism have proved to be\nnominal and insubstantial, failing to prevent or restrain\narms reinforcement from outside Korea, a military build-up\nand large-scale military exercises. Moreover, it is\nanomalous in every way that the Armistice Agreement\nsigned in the 1950s should remain intact, even today when\nthe cold war is over. These facts highlight the urgent need\nto replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement\nand the existing armistice mechanism with a peace\narrangement.\nIn April this year the Government of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea made a detailed proposal to the\nUnited States that the two countries should begin\nnegotiations on an arrangement for a lasting peace to\nreplace the outdated armistice system. It subsequently took\nthe practical step of opening the representative office of the\nKorean People\u2019s Army in Panmunjom as our new\nnegotiating body. In late August this year the Chinese\nGovernment announced its decision to withdraw the\ndelegation of the Chinese People\u2019s Volunteers to the\nMilitary Armistice Commission, in view of the urgent need\nto substitute a new peace arrangement for the Korean\nArmistice Agreement, and in consideration of the current\nstatus of the malfunctioning Military Armistice\nCommission.\nThese measures were taken as innovative, goodwill\nsteps to make a breakthrough in establishing a new security\narrangement on the Korean peninsula, taking into\nconsideration the recognized international practices under\nwhich some countries terminated their belligerency after the\nSecond World War and declared peaceful relationships.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea still\nremains, in legal terms, in a state of belligerency with the\nUnited Nations, of which it is a dignified Member State.\nThat is because the cease-fire has lasted so long. At its\nthirtieth session the General Assembly, in 1975, adopted\nresolution 3390 B (XXX), urging the dismantling of the\nUnited Nations Command and the replacement of the\nArmistice Agreement with a peace agreement, but that\nresolution has not yet been implemented. The United\nNations should give due attention to the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s proposal for the establishment\nof a new peace arrangement and fulfil in good faith its own\nobligations in this regard, thus making amends for its\nunsavoury past vis-\u00e0-vis the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea, a Member State of the United Nations, and\nimplementing its own resolution.\nAnother very important element in defusing tensions\nand establishing lasting peace on the Korean peninsula\nwould be a fundamental resolution of the nuclear issue.\nThe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is a political\nand military issue to be resolved bilaterally by the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United\nStates, in view of its origin and its nature and substance.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has\nmaintained its firm position that the nuclear issue on the\nKorean peninsula should be resolved through dialogue\nand negotiations between the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea and the United States. Thanks to the\nsincere and patient efforts of the Government of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States have\nheld several rounds of bilateral talks, leading to the recent\nAgreed Statement by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea and the United States, both of which are now\nworking towards its implementation. This shows that if\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the\nUnited States work together to resolve the issue with trust\nin each other, and on the principle of impartiality and\nequality, they will bring about a good and fruitful\noutcome.\nTo demonstrate the transparency of our nuclear\nactivities, we took the bold decision to replace the\nexisting system of graphite-moderated reactors with a\nsystem of light water reactors, at the sacrifice of our\nindependent atomic power industry. However, certain\nforces, which are not happy with a possible resolution of\nthe nuclear issue, are still resorting to pressure and threats\nagainst us, while peddling arguments about so-called\nspecial inspections \u2014 arguments that are highly\nprovocative to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\nand have had a negative effect on the talks between it and\nthe United States. This is nothing but an attempt on the\npart of these forces to wreck the talks by any possible\nmeans as they enter a new stage, and to make the\nsituation on the Korean peninsula an extremely strained.\nThe Korean people are strongly independence-\nminded, and independence means life for the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea. No threat or blackmail, no\npressure or sanctions, will ever work on us. Our people\nwill never beg for peace at the expense of our national\ndignity and sovereignty simply out of fear of war, and the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will never sell\nout its supreme interests under pressure.\nThe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is one to\nbe resolved by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\n7\n\n\nKorea and the United States, and no other party is entitled\nto intervene in this bilateral process. Intervention by any\nother party in their talks will only create difficulties and\ncomplications, and erect obstacles to the resolution of the\nissue, rather than help in its resolution in any way.\nBefore the South Korean authorities talk about the\n\u201cnuclear issue\u201d, they should refrain from creating obstacles\nto the progress of the talks between the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States, from\nencouraging confrontation between North and South and\nfrom aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the\nUnited States have now set out on the path of dialogue and\nnegotiations and are moving towards implementing their\nagreements on the final objectives of the peaceful resolution\nof the nuclear issue and other outstanding issues. The\nworld welcomes this process and looks forward to\nsatisfactory results. The Government of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea will continue all its sincere\nefforts to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula\nand to achieve the region\u2019s denuclearization. I would like\nto take this opportunity to express our profound thanks to\nState leaders, Governments and peoples for their support\nand encouragement for the principled position and sincere\nefforts of the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea to resolve the nuclear issue.\nHumankind now has the shared task of building a\nnew, free and peaceful world, free from domination and\nsubjugation. In order to build the new world which\nhumanity wants to see, we must eliminate, once and for all,\nthe legacies of the discredited cold-war era and realize the\ndemocratization of international society so as to enable all\ncountries and nations to exercise their sovereign rights on\nan equal basis in international forums.\nThe most important element in this respect is the\ndemocratization of the United Nations. Among the\nMember States of the United Nations, there are, of course,\nbig and small countries, and there are also old Member\nStates and new Member States. However, there cannot be\nany senior countries or junior countries, and there cannot be\nany dominating countries or countries to be dominated by\nothers. All United Nations Member States are equal\nMembers of the United Nations, and all contribute jointly\nto world peace and security.\nThere can be no place for individual Member States to\nhold privileged positions within the United Nations.\nCertain forces still try at international forums to trample\ninternational justice and the principle of impartiality\nunderfoot. They are attempting to openly apply a double\nstandard in dealing with the nuclear issue, human rights,\nterrorism and a number of other issues. They are\nbringing unreasonable pressure to bear upon those\ncountries that they consider to be offending them, making\nslanders and false charges concerning the \u201cnuclear threat\u201d,\n\u201chuman rights violations\u201d and \u201cterrorist States\u201d, while\nthey simply wink at the wrongful actions of those\ncountries considered to be obedient to their directives.\nThese phenomena still continue undiminished.\nThis is a clear indication that there still remain\noutdated concepts and the mentality of the cold-war era,\nwhen the strong-arm actions and high-handed behaviour\nof a few countries were allowed to go unchallenged.\nSuch unfair and unreasonable acts and behaviour should\nno longer be allowed any place in international relations.\nRestructuring of the United Nations is important, in\norder to meet more actively the changed reality and new\nchallenges.\nThe non-aligned and other developing countries\nmake up a majority of United Nations membership. For\na fair and proper representation of their demands and\ninterests in the resolution of major international issues,\nthere is every reason why developing countries should\nbecome permanent members of the Security Council.\nWe believe that, despite any need for enlarged\nmembership of the Security Council, no permanent\nmember seat should be given to any country that has still\nfailed to wipe the slate clean with regard to its past as a\nnation defeated in the Second World War. Japan is now\nseeking permanent membership in the Security Council.\nIt must first make a full and unambiguous apology, and\nprovide compensation, for its past aggression and war\ncrimes. This would be the proper behaviour for Japan.\nDisarmament \u2014 nuclear disarmament in\nparticular \u2014 is another task that must be undertaken\nurgently. People throughout the Earth have long wanted\nto live in a peaceful world free from nuclear weapons,\nand they have been calling for the complete abolition of\nsuch weapons. However, the nuclear-weapon States are\nreluctant to scrap their nuclear arsenals totally, even in\nthe current post-cold-war era. They still seek to\nperpetuate their monopoly in nuclear weaponry and to\njustify legally the continued possession of these weapons.\nThis is anachronistic thinking, which only spurs the\n8\n\n\nnuclear-arms race and blocks progress in meaningful\ndiscussions on general disarmament.\nThe extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons is now a matter of worldwide interest\nand concern. The existing Treaty defines the rights and\nobligations of the nuclear-weapon States and of the\nnon-nuclear-weapon States respectively on an unequal basis.\nIf this Treaty is to be fair it should contain unconditional\nnegative security assurances from the nuclear-weapon States\nto the non-nuclear-weapon States; a commitment by each\nnuclear-weapon State not to be the first to use nuclear\nweapons; provision for a total ban on the use of these\nweapons; and a timetable for the complete abolition of\nnuclear weapons. These would be the first steps towards\nrendering meaningless the existence of nuclear weapons on\nour planet.\nWe are witnessing the disturbance of peace and\nsecurity in some regions of the globe. No small number of\ncountries are suffering severe calamities. It is indeed\nheartbreaking to see how national sovereignty is trampled\nunderfoot and how regional conflicts and religious and\nethnic conflicts continue unabated, only to escalate into\nwars. It is our view that disputes between countries and\nnations should be resolved through peaceful negotiations\nbetween the parties concerned, in the interests of those\nparties and for the sake of world peace.\nSocial and economic development is an important\nmatter directly related to international peace and security.\nIt is common knowledge that social and economic\ndevelopment has been greatly hindered, and the worldwide\nphenomenon of the rich getting richer and the poor getting\npoorer is becoming even more intense. A fair and just\ninternational economic order should be established to free\nthe people of the developing countries from famine, disease\nand disasters and to narrow the widening gap between the\ndeveloped and the developing countries.\nThe United Nations should give priority to the\ndevelopment of the developing countries and strengthen its\nown role in their economic and social development. We\nhope that the Agenda for Development proposed by the\nSecretary-General will make a substantial contribution to\nthe economic development of these countries.\nThe summits of non-aligned countries and other world\nconferences have emphasized the need for the establishment\nof a new, fair international order and have adopted\nresolutions calling for practical measures to this end. The\nnon-aligned and other developing countries are working\nhard to achieve South-South cooperation and to establish\nthe South-South economic order, starting in the fields of\nfood and agriculture, education and health, which are\npriority areas in the drive to accelerate social and\neconomic development and to shake off economic\npoverty.\nThe developed countries should pay due attention to\nthis matter. They should move to resume dialogue with\nthe developing countries and to join in establishing a fair\ninternational economic order, and should refrain from any\nactions that would hinder the economic development of\nthe developing countries.\nPeople in many countries are currently engaged in a\nvigorous struggle to reject all foreign domination and\ninterference, to defend national independence and\nsovereignty and to achieve national stability and\nprosperity.\nWe express our solidarity with the Cambodian\npeople, whose cause is the promotion of national\nreconciliation and unity and the country\u2019s post-war\nrehabilitation. We fully support the peoples of the States\nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\nin their efforts to secure peace in their respective\ncountries and common prosperity, and all other Asian\npeoples in their efforts to build a new, independent and\nprosperous Asia.\nWe support the struggle of the Arab people for a fair\nand comprehensive solution of the Palestinian question\nand other Middle East problems, and we support Libya\u2019s\nefforts to secure a peaceful resolution of the Lockerbie\ncrisis through dialogue and negotiations, as well as the\nArab League\u2019s proposal in this regard.\nWe are gratified by the establishment of the\nmultiracial, democratic Government in South Africa\nfollowing the eradication of racist rule, and we support\nthe African peoples in their struggle to achieve the\nindependent development of their respective countries\ndespite their socio-economic difficulties.\nWe express our firm solidarity with the just cause of\nthe Cuban people, who are resolutely defending the\nsovereignty of their country and the gains of socialism,\nand with the struggle of the Latin American peoples for\npeace and prosperity in their countries.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea and the Korean people will continue\n9\n\n\ntheir full support for and firm solidarity with all the peoples\nin the world in their struggle to oppose all forms of\ndomination and subjugation, to build a new society and to\npromote the common cause of mankind.\nIndependence, peace and friendship have been the\nconstant cornerstone of the foreign policy of the\nGovernment of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\nThe concept of independence, peace and friendship as the\ncornerstone of our foreign policy, established by our\nrespected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung during his lifetime,\nreflects the unanimous desire and aspiration of our people\nand of peoples throughout the Earth to build a new,\nindependent, peaceful and friendly world. It is the principle\nby which the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea, in its external activities, is constantly\nguided.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea will continue to join with the world\u2019s peoples who\nare seeking independence, will strengthen the ties of\nfriendship and cooperation and will undertake in good faith\nits own duties in the interests of the common cause of\nmankind - the safeguarding of a just world peace and\nsecurity and the building of a new, independent and\nprosperous world.\nThe delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea will work sincerely with other delegations for\nsuccess in the discussion of the items on the agenda of the\ncurrent session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": " Let me express my great\npleasure at seeing Mr. Amara Essy presiding over our\ndeliberations. I am confident that, given his experience and\nskills, this session will contribute to the further\nenhancement of the role of the United Nations. Let me\nalso thank the Secretary-General for the thoughtful and\nthorough review of the world situation, given in his annual\nreport - this in addition, of course, to our thanks for his\ntireless work for the good of the Organization.\nI would like to follow the point made by our Dutch\ncolleague regarding the increased responsibility of\nindividual Member States for the success of this institution,\nlet me say that the end of the cold war has been a source\nof and a sound reason for satisfaction throughout the entire\nworld community. A series of \\\"velvet revolutions\\\" in\nCentral Europe, the dissolution of the USSR and\nremarkable events in South Africa and the Middle East\nhave shaken the entire post-war geopolitical pattern of\n\\\"negative stability\\\" - frozen enmity. As expected, the end\nof the East-West confrontation and the disappearance of\ncompeting blocs has proved beneficial to international\nrelations. The planet has become a safer place. Yet the\neuphoria is fading, giving way to a sober evaluation of\nevents. Indeed, have all the \\\"Berlin Walls\\\" or \\\"Iron\nCurtains\\\" been dismantled - especially economic barriers\nthat separate countries on a global or regional scale? Is the\n\\\"peace dividend\\\" actually being paid? Has the North-South\ndevelopment gap ceased to widen and to undermine the\nnewly acquired, still fragile global stability?\nThe old bipolar, confrontational world has gone. We\nare not divided anymore. But we are not united either. In\nfact, many problems, dormant or concealed until now, have\nsurfaced with startling force: ethnic conflicts, nationalisms,\nreligious intolerance. The \\\"cold war\\\" may very well be\nreplaced by a \\\"cold peace\\\" or, even worse, by \\\"hot chaos\\\".\nGlobal cooperation will not come by itself. The\nUnited Nations is best placed to lead its Members in an\neffort to achieve it. However, are the nations ready for it?\nIs the United Nations properly equipped to cope with the\ntask?\nThe question that should be asked first is not what\nthe United Nations could do for us, but what we - the\nMember States - should do to unite the nations. A\ncontest between the two super-Powers no longer dictates\nthe course of history. The international scene, both\npolitical and economic, has become pluralist, with\nmedium-sized and small countries emerging as\nincreasingly important actors. Previously, the role of\nthese countries was, at best, that of a go-between or\nobserver, rather than an active participant. Now they are\nbecoming partners in the multi-country discourse.\nMultilateralism is becoming more important than ever.\nMultilateral arrangements in various domains provide both\ninsurance of equal treatment and an opportunity to take\npart, to contribute. Multilateralism increases the freedom\nof action of individual States and the degree of their\nresponsibility.\nLet me set forth briefly the way in which Poland, a\nmedium-sized country, perceives its role and duty - I\nstress duty - as a partner in the international effort to\nbring about global cooperation, to build a united world.\nFirst, we develop friendly relations with neighbours.\nThe best testimony in this regard is found in the treaties\nwe have concluded with all our seven neighbours. We\nregard those treaties as a great common accomplishment\nby Poles, Belarusians, Czechs, Germans, Lithuanians,\nRussians, Slovaks and Ukrainians. It was not always easy\nto reach an agreement: hard diplomatic work,\nimagination and willingness to compromise were required,\nto say the least. But the result was very much worth the\neffort. The treaties constitute a solid block of durable\nrules based on international law, in a region of major\nimportance for the security of the continent and the world\nat large.\nSecondly, we are active in developing regional\ncooperation. The Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and\nPoland have formed a non-binding structure known as the\nVisegrad group. It is not an organization; it has no\npermanent bodies, not even a secretariat - a true rarity for\nany international venture. The group did, however,\nmanage to work out a Central European Free Trade\nAgreement (CEFTA).\nPoland is also a partner in the Central European\nInitiative and the Council of the Baltic Sea States.\nFurthermore, we have recently reached out to our eastern\nneighbours with a number of proposals to enhance\nregional links.\n24\n\n\nThirdly, we are impatiently and insistently striving to\nbecome members of institutions whose membership has\nbeen determined by the logic of the divided world. We all\nagree they must not remain exclusive. It is \\\"one Europe,\none world\\\" that lies behind Poland\u2019s efforts to join the\nEuropean Union, the Western European Union and the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It was in this\ncontext that Poland responded with determination and\nconfidence to the Partnership for Peace programme. By\nvirtue of its history, size and vital interests, Poland wants\nto enter NATO not as a front-line State but, rather, as a\ncountry furthering cooperation. We do not want to create\nnew divisions. On the contrary, we are striving to\novercome the remnants of the past divisions which are still\nwith us. It was also in this context that Poland entered into\nthe association agreement with the European Union, and it\nis in this context that Poland is actively preparing for\nmembership. It is our strong desire to take part in the\nprocess of integrating Europe so that it becomes more\nsecure, cooperative and hospitable; and to participate in an\neffort to overcome the irrationalities of history - rivalry,\nimperial divisions and nationalistic stereotypes.\nFourthly, Poland is a strong believer and a dedicated\nparticipant in interregional and global actions. We are in\nthe forefront in promoting cooperation within the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\nThe CSCE is not only the symbol of the necessary bonds\nof security but also a forum for practical cooperation across\nthree continents. We support the CSCE as a regional\narrangement within Chapter VIII of the United Nations\nCharter.\nPoland is a time-tested participant in United Nations\npeace-keeping operations. Over 2,000 of our troops are\nthere to uphold the ideas in the Charter, whenever called to\nduty by the Security Council.\nPoland, finally, is also active in other areas of\ninternational cooperation: in the economic, social, cultural,\neducational and health fields as well as in the promotion of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms as stipulated by\nArticle 13 of the Charter.\nMedium- and small-sized States are potentially a great\nasset of the United Nations; it has not so far been\nsufficiently recognized, let alone utilized. States such as\nPoland can play a stabilizing role and exert an important\nbeneficial influence on developments in their immediate and\nmore distant neighbourhood, and tangibly contribute to\nglobal stability and security. In particular, they can be\nexpected to become nuclei of regional integration as they\nshould not be suspected of seeking to dominate or to\nimpose their will on others.\nTo act locally - that is, regionally - is practical and\neffective. Medium-sized countries in consensus with\nsmaller States can, indeed, make a difference. However,\nwe should not allow a loose constellation of separate\nvillages to emerge. We need a global, united village.\nTherefore, we need a framework for subregional, regional\nand interregional cooperation and discipline to ensure\ncoherence. This is of course the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the\nUnited Nations. We are trying today to improve its\noperations. Let me here draw attention to two specific\nissues.\nFirst, the fundamental task for the United Nations is\nto maintain international peace and security. The role of\nthe Security Council has been in recent years broadened\nby more frequent recourse to action under Chapter VII of\nthe Charter. On the one hand, that allows for a fresh look\nat the security role of the United Nations, particularly in\nthe context of countries which do not enjoy sound\nsecurity guarantees. On the other hand, one cannot\nremain indifferent to the Council\u2019s decisions in cases\nwhere sovereignty, democracy and human rights are\nviolated, or access to humanitarian assistance is hindered.\nFor this reason, Poland consistently makes an effort to\nrespond to the Council\u2019s calls for action, be it in the\nformer Yugoslavia, Rwanda or, most recently, Haiti.\nPoland shares the view that the increase in the\nmembership of the United Nations justifies the\nenlargement of the Council. There are different\nsuggestions and ideas as to how this might best be done.\nThe principal criterion continues, for us, to be\npreservation of the effectiveness of the Council.\nEnlargement should be accomplished on a consensus basis\nand as a package. The interests of all United Nations\nregional groups need to be respected in the process. A\nseat on the Council, permanent or not, cannot be\nconsidered a matter of prestige. Indeed, it implies\nincreased responsibility and the ability to discharge it.\nThe Council\u2019s decisions involving peace-keeping and\npeace-enforcement measures, from sanctions to recourse\nto force, give rise to various risks and sacrifices by third\ncountries. They include potential risk to the lives and\nhealth of the troops and financial losses for which so far,\ndespite the provisions of Article 50, there is no adequate\ncompensation.\n25\n\n\nThe security of the peace-keepers is of the utmost\nimportance. Work undertaken on a convention on the\nsafety of United Nations peace-keeping personnel should be\ncompleted at the earliest date. There is also a need for\nactive dialogue between members of the Security Council,\nthe Secretary-General and troop-contributing States. Such\ndialogue should be a standard practice in the case of\ndecisions which may affect the security of these troops.\nPoland shares the view that: first, all United Nations\nactivities in the four fields - preventive diplomacy,\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and post-conflict\npeace-building - must be fully mandated and better planned,\norganized and financed; secondly, regional organizations\nshould make a more significant contribution in the areas of\npreventive diplomacy and peace-keeping, but one fully\nconsistent with the United Nations Charter; and, thirdly, a\nspecific mandate is to be sought when peace-keeping troops\nneed to use force beyond the requirements of self-defence.\nDisarmament is yet another dimension of a global\neffort to strengthen international peace and security.\nMankind is no longer held hostage to nuclear confrontation;\nthe nuclear arms race has been halted and, it is hoped,\nreversed. Post-cold-war cooperation between erstwhile\nadversaries has resulted in important nuclear disarmament\naccords. Poland is playing an active part in the ongoing\nmultilateral negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament\nin Geneva for a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty.\nInternationally verifiable, universally adhered to and\neffective, such a treaty would put in place yet another\nbarrier to the spread of nuclear arms, which is in the vital\nsecurity interests of each and every member of the family\nof nations. These interests would also be served by a\nnon-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and\neffectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile\nmaterial for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices.\nThe window of opportunity is wide open. It must not be\nignored. We warmly welcome the renewed interest and\ninitiative on nuclear disarmament submitted yesterday to\nthis Assembly by President Clinton and President Yeltsin.\nWe believe that further reinforcement of the\nnon-proliferation regime is imperative. We are alarmed by\nrecent reports of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials\nacross frontiers. This is a threat to international security\nand also a danger to innocent bystanders exposed to\nradiation. It also casts doubts on the efficiency and\nsufficiency of existing legal provisions and procedures. A\nthorough review of such provisions and procedures seems\ntimely.\nThe overriding national security interests of States\nwould be served in particular by the universalization of\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT). We welcome the recent accessions to the NPT,\nespecially by some of our newly independent neighbours.\nWe fervently hope that Ukraine will soon follow suit. In\nthis connection, I wish to recall that Poland firmly\nsupports the unconditional and indefinite extension of the\nNPT. The forthcoming Conference to review the\noperation of the NPT and to decide on its extension\nshould strengthen the regime. It will benefit the entire\ninternational community. Coming as an aftermath to both\nHiroshima and Chernobyl, it would be the most fitting\nstep to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the nuclear age.\nWith the signing of the chemical weapons\nConvention, there is a prospect of finally eliminating\nanother category of weapons of mass destruction. Poland\nis actively involved in the work of the Preparatory\nCommission for the Organization for the Prohibition of\nChemical Weapons, and its ratification procedure is well\nadvanced.\nIn conclusion, I would say this: more power to the\nregions; more authority to the Security Council; more\ninitiative and involvement on the part of medium-sized\ncountries. These are, in our view, the cornerstones and\nobjectives of the reform of the United Nations.\nAllow me now to address an issue to which Poland\nand a number of other countries attach particular\nimportance. I am referring to the provisions of Article\n107 and to parts of Article 53 of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. I doubt that there is any delegation here\nthat would not agree that they have become obsolete - a\ndead letter.\nFor almost 50 years these provisions have not been\nofficially invoked. Indeed, the States covered by this\nso-called \\\"enemy clause\\\" have become not only an\ninseparable part of the democratic world but also a crucial\nelement of the United Nations system. It is impossible to\nimagine how the Organization and its system could\nfunction without their political, economic and financial\ncommitment.\nPoland, the victim of the Nazi aggression that started\nthe Second World War, considers it its moral duty to take\na lead in closing this chapter of history for all time. We\nbelieve that the time has come to part with transitional\nclauses born of the war, concerning States which were\n26\n\n\nthen, 50 years ago, enemies, but which have now become\npartners in our common work for the United Nations.\nI formally propose the removal from the Charter of the\nUnited Nations of the clauses referring to \\\"enemy States\\\".\nA political decision by the General Assembly on this\nmatter could be taken at this session. While, of course,\nother modalities may be considered, the Assembly could,\nfor instance, request the Special Committee on the\nCharter of the United Nations to submit to it at its fiftieth\nsession a proposal for an appropriate legal solution that\nwould not amount to a substantive revision of the Charter.\nLet me express the hope that this initiative will meet\nwith the unanimous support of the Member States.\n"

        "file_text": "First, let me offer you,\non behalf of the Government and people of Sri Lanka,\nwarm congratulations to the President on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. We wish him an eminently successful tenure of\nthat high office.\nSri Lanka would also wish to express its gratitude to\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana for his\nexceptionally creative conduct of the work of the crucial\nforty-eighth session. Our good wishes extend also to His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General\nof this Organization, who must contend with increasingly\nchallenging tasks at a time when the United Nations is\nundergoing major transformation.\nIn Sri Lanka, the winds of change are blowing. In\nour country, we stand on the threshold of a new era of\ntolerance and peace, ending dissension. In August this\nyear, the Peoples\u2019 Alliance was voted into office, after 17\nyears in opposition, in a parliamentary general election\nthat was internationally acclaimed as both free and fair.\nAt this election - Sri Lanka\u2019s ninth since independence -\nthe people voted overwhelmingly, reaffirming their faith\nin parliamentary democracy, in fundamental freedoms and\nin the rule of law. Of the registered electorate, 76.2 per\ncent cast their vote, thus maintaining Sri Lanka\u2019s long\ntradition of high political consciousness and model\nelection procedures.\nWhat happened on 16 August in my country was\nmore than the routine exercise of the ballot to change a\ngovernment. In an election atmosphere in which\nconflicting views were given full rein, the Sri Lanka voter\nremained mature, calm and solidly entrenched in our\ncultural and democratic values. The result of the poll was\ntherefore a victory for moderation, tolerance and unity.\nIn my first speech one month ago in our newly elected\nParliament, I, as a representative of the minority Tamil\ncommunity, made a statement that I shall now repeat\nhere, in this supreme parliament of the peoples of the\nworld:\n\\\"Let it never be said, if it could ever have been said,\nthat the Sinhala people are racists. They are not.\nThey are absolutely not, and I think this election has\ndemonstrated so handsomely that that particular\nargument can be laid to rest for ever.\\\"\nUnder the leadership of the new Prime Minister,\nMrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, a peaceful\ntransition of power has been effected, defying the cynical\npredictions of some. Our nation\u2019s rich and diverse\ncultural heritage, steeped in the great religions of the\nworld and buttressed by a unique foundation of five legal\n23\n\n\nsystems, has made this triumph of democratic expression\npossible.\nSri Lanka\u2019s new Government reflects the multi-ethnic,\nmulti-religious fabric of its society. In Parliament, the\nGovernment has the support of a number of political\nparties, including those of the Tamil and Muslim\ncommunities. It is, therefore, well poised to bring an end\nto the conflict in the north-east part of the country through\npolitical negotiations, as mandated by the people. Prime\nMinister Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, in her first address to\nthe nation on assuming office, stated:\n\\\"We extend a hand of friendship to the people of the\nnorth-east and hope that their leaders would take it in\nthe same spirit that we have extended it.\\\"\nThe relaxation of the ban on certain essential items\ngoing to conflict areas and the reciprocal release of\npolicemen held by the secessionist movement are hopeful\nsigns of peace in our land. The all-island state of\nemergency has been lifted and reintroduced only in the\nconflict areas. Our Government will pursue with\ndetermination its quest for peace in our land - a just and\nstable peace, acceptable to all our people - undeterred by\nany set-backs that might be encountered in pursuit of its\ngoal.\nI seek the indulgence of this Assembly for having\ndwelt on recent developments in my country at some\nlength. I did so because, at a time when in some parts of\nthe world the ugly tide of intolerance is rising, we in Sri\nLanka are proud that we have witnessed a vindication of\nthe values of tolerance and principled conduct over the\nforces of narrow sectarianism and opportunism. Our recent\nexperience might fortify the efforts to banish prejudice and\nrancour among other peoples elsewhere.\nOn the international scene, there have been shining\nexamples of prolonged and bitter confrontation being\ndispelled through dialogue and negotiation. Thus, we\nwelcome wholeheartedly the end of apartheid and the\nestablishment of a united, democratic and non-racial South\nAfrica under the inspired, and inspiring, leadership of\nPresident Mandela.\nWe also welcome the positive developments in\nPalestine subsequent to the recent agreements between the\nPalestine Liberation Organization and Israel, and between\nJordan and Israel, while expressing our concern over those\nissues that still remain unsettled.\nOn the other hand, to our deep regret Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is still mired in bloodshed and violence and\nthe humanitarian crisis in Rwanda has not abated. We\nreiterate our hope that the intense suffering and\ndislocation in those countries can be halted through\nnegotiated settlement between the parties concerned and\npolitically disinterested efforts by the international\ncommunity.\nSri Lanka\u2019s strong and positive identification with\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries began in\nBelgrade in 1961, when Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was\nPrime Minister. She was Head of Government when Sri\nLanka hosted the historic summit of the non-aligned\ncountries in 1976. Our membership of this Movement,\nthen as now, derives from our deep conviction that its\nprinciples empower the dispossessed of this world, giving\nthem dignity and hope for justice. The collapse of the\nbipolarism imposed on the post-Second-World-War\ninternational scene is thus no reason for non-alignment to\nlie passive.\nAt the Non-Aligned Ministerial Conference in Cairo\nwe were proud to welcome South Africa as the one\nhundred and tenth member of the Movement. It is\nsignificant that this great nation emerging from the long,\ndark night of apartheid has chosen to adopt the principles\nof non-alignment. Cynics have predicted that the\nMovement will sooner or later join the rubble of the\nBerlin Wall. In our view, the end of the cold war does\nnot negate the rationale of non-alignment. On the\ncontrary, it vindicates the fundamental non-aligned\nprinciple that military confrontation can never promote\nsecurity, stability nor peace among nations. Principles are\nindestructible: people who believe in them are\nindomitable.\nThere seemed a unique opportunity at the end of the\ncold war for the world to achieve its long pursued\nobjective of general and complete disarmament under\neffective verification, especially in the crucial area of\nnuclear weapons. However, competing efforts by some\nto maintain a monopoly on nuclear weapons and by\nothers to break it frustrate our quest for nuclear\ndisarmament.\nSri Lanka is deeply conscious of the serious\nresponsibility we undertake in presiding over the 1995 on\nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty Conference. It is imperative\nthat our advance towards a nuclear-weapon-free world\nmake substantial progress. To that end, work in the\nConference on Disarmament towards a comprehensive\n24\n\n\ntest-ban treaty is encouraging, though we must remain\nvigilant over any attempts to delay the conclusion of the\ntreaty. In other areas of disarmament, Sri Lanka recently\nratified the chemical weapons Convention, which we hope\nwill come into force next year.\nAs we see the end of the nuclear arms race, we do not\nwant to have it replaced by regional arms races, whether to\nacquire nuclear-weapon capability or to achieve greater\nsophistication in conventional weapons. The United\nNations arms Register is but a step on a long road towards\ntransparency and confidence building, eliminating the arms\nbazaar, with its links to terrorism, drug trafficking and\nmoney-laundering.\nThroughout the course of the Third United Nations\nConference on the Law of the Sea, which spanned a\ndecade, Sri Lanka played a constructive and creative role.\nThe pioneering role played by the late Ambassador\nHamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka, President of\nthe Law of the Sea Conference and a former President of\nthis Assembly, is part of the history of this unique\nendeavour.\nSri Lanka has ratified the United Nations Convention\non the Law of the Sea, which has now entered into force,\nand has signed the Agreement relating to implementation of\nPart Xl of the Convention. This represents our continuing\ncommitment to the creation of a new legal regime of the\noceans. Sri Lanka looks forward to participating in the\nhistoric inaugural session of the International Sea-Bed\nAuthority in Jamaica.\nThe Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, taking\ninto account emerging realities, has developed a fresh basis\nfor a pragmatic, forward-looking approach to peace,\nsecurity and stability in the Indian Ocean area. We call\nupon the countries concerned, particularly the permanent\nMembers of the Security Council and other major maritime\nusers of the Indian Ocean, to enter into a serious and\nproductive dialogue for a new partnership in the context of\nthe Committee.\nAs the Law of the Sea Convention enters into force,\ngreater support needs to be extended to regional initiatives,\nsuch as the Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Cooperation\n(IOMAC), promoting cooperation between the developed\nand developing countries.\nAs the United Nations approaches its fiftieth\nanniversary, there is increasing, and more extensive, resort\nto multilateral action through the Organization. The\nSecurity Council is finally playing the role - and\nsometimes goes beyond the role - originally envisaged for\nit under the Charter. Yet we must continue to reiterate\nthat foresight and careful assessment are vital in the\npreparation for any Council intervention, and that such\naction should be pursued only with the consent and\ncooperation of the States concerned.\nFurthermore, it is important to emphasize that the\nSecurity Council acts on behalf of the general\nmembership of the United Nations. Unless its actions are\nbased on the widest possible support, Council decisions\nwill not be universally respected nor be truly effective.\nIn this context, Sri Lanka is of the view that Council\nmembership should be increased to provide for wider\nrepresentation, including representation of developing\ncountries. Sri Lanka was honoured to co-chair the\nWorking Group on the revitalization of the work of the\nGeneral Assembly, including the strengthening of the\nnexus between the Assembly and the Security Council.\nWe believe the approach we have taken to enhance\ntransparency and encourage democratic practices is one\nwhich is shared by the vast majority of developing\ncountries. We feel this process should be moved forward.\nIt was in this context that in 1993 Sri Lanka\nannounced its candidature for the 1996-1997 non-\npermanent Asian seat in the Security Council, which by\npractice of orderly rotation is due to the South Asian\nsub-region.\nSri Lanka is particularly conscious of its identity as\na small State, vulnerable to the ebb and flow of\ninternational tides, both political and economic. Yet we\nhave not hesitated to take principled stands when we\nmust. Nor will we shirk our responsibility to act in\nsolidarity with other developing countries. We share their\nproblems and concerns.\nSri Lanka is geopolitically and culturally an Asian\ncountry. We rejoice over the fact that our continent, after\ncenturies of dependence, is once more resurgent,\npolitically stable and economically vibrant. This has been\nachieved largely through self-reliance, indigenous\nentrepreneurship and the Asian value systems. As we\nmove at the global level to greater interdependence and\ninteraction, Sri Lanka will remain firmly focused on the\nAsian experience and its Asian context. We will spare no\neffort to develop and strengthen our ties with our Asian\nneighbours. An express commitment to pursue the\ninterests we share with the family of Asian nations will\n25\n\n\nbe a new, strong thrust in the foreign policy of our\nGovernment.\nIt is in that same spirit that we participated in the\nlaunching of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation (SAARC). We are encouraged by the positive\ndevelopments in SAARC as it journeys into the twenty-first\ncentury, propelled by two important trends in the region:\ndemocratization and the adoption of market-friendly\neconomic policies. Understanding among the peoples of\nthe region is increasing. Contacts between professional\nbodies in the region have rapidly gathered momentum.\nAs a region severely affected by poverty, we in South\nAsia have already taken steps to share our experiences and\nwork out common approaches including the SAARC\ncommitment to eradicate poverty by the year 2002.\nAbsolute poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy stalk\none fifth of the world\u2019s population. We trust that the 1995\nWorld Social Summit and the Agenda for Development will\neffectively address these issues and mobilize essential\nresources to back commitments to eradicate poverty,\nprovide employment and promote social cohesion before the\nend of this century.\nOur development experience has taught us the\nimportance of alleviating the poverty of the poorest and of\nmaintaining social equity with economic growth. Sri\nLanka\u2019s favourable social indicators are the result of a\nconsistent bipartisan commitment over the years to the\nmaintenance of a high level of social expenditure. A\nnumber of income-transfer measures are in place. These\nare indispensable to protection of the vulnerable segments\nof the population during a period of structural adjustment\naimed at accelerating economic growth.\nMy Prime Minister has made a clear statement on\neconomic policy, in which he indicates the Government\u2019s\nfirm resolve to build a strong national economy within a\nmarket framework, with the principal engine of growth\nexpected to be the private sector, both domestic and\nforeign.\nWe are particularly mindful of the need to pay\nattention to our youth. In 1995, when we shall celebrate\nthe tenth anniversary of the International Youth Year, it\nwould be timely to focus on the achievements of the decade\nand on further imperatives to advance the prospects for\nyouth. The former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka took the\ninitiative, at the Commonwealth summit in Cyprus, to focus\nspecial attention on youth issues. Subsequently, the non-\naligned countries, at the ministerial meeting held in Cairo,\nsupported the proposal to convene, at the highest political\nlevel, a special plenary meeting of this Assembly devoted\nto youth affairs, as part of the fiftieth anniversary\ncelebrations.\nI must also stress my Government\u2019s commitment to\nthe provision of a transparent system for the promotion\nand protection of human rights in the context of a truly\nvital democracy. During our recent election campaign we\npromised our people that we would, as a matter of the\nhighest priority, take steps to establish where necessary,\nand strengthen where possible, a legislative framework to\npromote and protect the full enjoyment of human rights.\nWithin five weeks of assuming office we have prepared,\nfor submission to Parliament, legislation to give effect to\nthe Convention against torture. Before the end of this\nyear, legislation will be introduced for the establishment\nof a national human rights commission. This commission\nwill have judicial and investigative powers and will be\ntotally independent of the executive.\nIn addition, I have appointed, from among persons\nactive in work for human rights through independent,\nnon-governmental organizations, six outstanding national\nexperts with international credentials to assist me with\ntheir knowledge and views. They serve in an individual\ncapacity and on an honorary basis. Their appointment in\nno way precludes them from continuing to engage in their\npublic campaigning for human rights, including comment\non or criticism of governmental performance in this area.\nTheir appointment is further evidence of my\nGovernment\u2019s firm commitment to the conduct of open\nand transparent government.\nAt the international level, we are of the view that\nhuman rights should not become an arena for North-South\nconfrontation and that no country should be singled out\nfor hostile attention on grounds other than genuine\nconcern for the human rights of its citizens. The scrutiny\nof a country\u2019s human-rights record must be guided by\nprinciples of impartiality and objectivity. Such scrutiny\nmust be motivated by a spirit of genuine concern,\ndialogue and cooperation. In this connection, we wish to\nfelicitate the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, Ambassador Ayala Lasso, on his efforts\nto foster a cooperative, rather than a coercive, framework\nfor the promotion of human rights world wide.\nSri Lanka is disappointed that, on the international\neconomic scene, developing countries continue to suffer\nfrom inadequate access to trade and technology, from low\n26\n\n\ncommodity prices and from excessive debt burdens.\nFinancial flows for development have severely contracted.\nThe economic disparities between the developed and the\ndeveloping worlds continue to widen.\nThe Charter of the United Nations rests on two main\npillars: the maintenance of international peace and security,\nand international cooperation for socio-economic\ndevelopment. The United Nations must therefore at all\ntimes proceed with equal commitment on both these\nfronts - politico-security and socio-economic development.\nNor must it be forgotten that economic inequalities and\nunderdevelopment are at the root of phenomena such as\nmassive refugee flows and even ethnic and other conflicts.\nWe reiterate the non-aligned countries\u2019 call for\nrenewal of the North-South dialogue on the basis of mutual\ninterests and interdependence. In this era of global\ntransition, the need for a favourable international\nenvironment is imperative. Many developing countries are\nembarking upon structural-adjustment programmes, at\nconsiderable cost, yet these policies will be successful only\nto the extent that there is a genuine commitment to free-\ntrade policies at the international level without extraneous\nconditionalities.\nToday - 26 September - Sri Lanka commemorates the\nthirty-fifth anniversary of the death of Mr. S. W. R. D.\nBandaranaike, former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. He was\nsucceeded by Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the world\u2019s\nfirst woman Prime Minister. Now - thirty-eight years later\n- their daughter, Ms. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,\nhas become Prime Minister. What is remarkable is that\neach of them was elected to office by the free vote of the\npeople in keenly fought elections. Each of them succeeded,\nby wholly democratic means, in unseating a strong\nGovernment. In 1956, in this Hall, Prime Minister S. W.\nR. D. Bandaranaike referred to the unconquered,\nunconquerable human spirit as the \\\"one golden thread\\\"\npassing through the \\\"dark fabric of human history\\\". He\nsaid:\n\\\"I look upon the United Nations as the one\nmachine available to mankind today through\nwhich it can express this unconquerable spirit of\nman in its efforts to achieve ... peace, friendship\nand collaboration\\\". (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Eleventh Session, 590th\nmeeting, p. 235, para. 41)\nThat remains our view of the United Nations today.\nWe collectively articulate a global social contract\nbetween the Governments and the peoples of this world\nwhom we represent. The success of a global social\ncontract rests on how individual States keep the people\u2019s\nfaith through good governance, the maintenance of human\nrights, equity and justice, and the provision of\nopportunities to enhance the quality of life. In Sri\nLanka\u2019s national context this involves political pluralism\nand makes of politics the discharge of a public trust\nwhere decision-making is open, transparent and based on\nthe widest possible extent of acceptance. Everyone in\npublic life is accountable for his or her actions. My\nPrime Minister expressed it in these words:\n\\\"This is a beautiful but difficult dream, which we\nshall strive to realize.\\\"\nIt is this vision that must concomitantly inspire the\nconduct of relations between States. Only then will the\nUnited Nations truly be \\\"a centre for harmonizing the\nactions of nations\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, your election to preside over the forty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly is a timely tribute to your\noutstanding professional and human qualities. It also\nreflects the high regard in which your sister country, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, is held due to the sagacity and level-headedness\nwhich it has shown in rising to the challenges of its\n19\n\n\nnational destiny and in performing its role on the regional\nand international levels. Your election is also a tribute to\nour continent, Africa, which this year sent to the\ninternational community a message of hope through the\nemergence of the united, democratic and non-racial South\nAfrica, which was solemnly welcomed to our ranks here a\nfew months ago.\nYour predecessor, Ambassador Samuel Insanally,\nadded to his prestigious career an outstanding performance\nin discharging his mandate, effectively and authoritatively.\nTo him we extend our best wishes in his future activities in\nthe service of Guyana, the Third World and the\ninternational community as a whole.\nTo the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, I should like to reiterate Algeria\u2019s\nsupport of his efforts to strengthen the role of our\nOrganization as the crucible for international action toward\npeace and development.\nAs we move toward the end of a century which has\nmade us aware of the global threats to peace, we stand in\nneed of a collective response, a new kind of political\nthinking and an elucidation of the stakes involved in order\nfor us to better grasp the challenges that face the\ncommunity of nations today.\nGiven the heterogeousness of players and the\ncomplexity of strategies, the present global disorder seems\nto be shaping a new order of things wherein the various\nstrategic, economic, political, cultural, social and ecological\nspheres tend to move closer together. This means that in\nthe highly fluctuating and fluid situation of the world in\nwhich we now live, the international order makes it more\ndifficult to coordinate the practices of States and is forcing\nimprovisation and an absence of logic on the initiatives of\nthe international community. Hence the international\norder\u2019s penchant to find balance only in heavy-handed\ntendencies that shape the future of peoples and of nations.\nTherefore, it is urgent to remove those ambiguities that\nare preventing the international community from moving\ntoward becoming the master of its own collective destiny.\nIn this respect, the United Nations, the repository of human\nhope and the receptacle of human fears, has a particular and\nimportant role to play as it represents an irreplaceable\nforum for dialogue and concerted action.\nBecause it is also the vector of a vision of change that\nwould bring the course of international relations into line\nwith the purposes and principles of the Charter, the United\nNations must find in the convergence of wills the\nmotivation likely to advance our collective action toward\nnew horizons of peace, and of universally and equitably\nshared security and prosperity.\nThe possibilities offered by the ending of the cold\nwar and the profound changes in the international system\nhave favoured new modes of interaction. We note here\nthat the streamlining of international interaction and of\nsocial and economic dynamics has highlighted inequalities\nand is shaping and reshaping constellations of forces that\nare beyond the rules of the world system.\nThese manifestations of ambivalence and rupture are\ncause for concern. They foreshadow a disturbing\nredefinition of the global balance through a reshaping of\nthe destiny of numerous peoples and nations that are\nfaced with insecurity and injustice.\nThe arduous progress of the international community\ntoward building a global order whose norms of\nfunctioning and laws of development would benefit from\nuniversal acceptance clearly requires a new impetus to\nensure control over the changes that are taking place and\nto integrate them into an orderly conception of transition.\nThus a security brought about by disarmament and\nan agreed-upon and fully assumed solidarity that give\nmeaning and content to the Agenda for Peace and an\nAgenda for Development as well as the results expected\nfrom the first World Summit for Social Development\nwould carry this promise by offering a framework and a\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre for a healthy remobilization of the\ncommunity of nations in tackling the next millennium\nwith the guarantee of a better future.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77,\nwho, in their efforts, identify themselves with the\npersistent quest for such a future, naturally and more than\never manifest their interest and willingness to engage\nresolutely in an effective and equitable partnership which\nwould mobilize energies in the service of this great\nendeavour. My country will spare no effort in making its\ncontribution.\nNearly 40 years ago, on 1 November 1954, Algeria\nundertook to stamp its own history with the seal of the\nprinciples and objectives of the United Nations through its\nstruggle for liberation which it waged under the banner of\nthe equality of peoples and of their right to self-\ndetermination.\n20\n\n\nAs an active member of the Organization and one that\nhas been involved in the realization of so many\nachievements which brought honour to the United Nations,\nAlgeria has continually reiterated in this forum the\naspirations of its people which are the same as those of so\nmany other peoples whose experiences and identity it\nshared. Whether it be a question of decolonization or of\ndevelopment, of disarmament or of human rights, of the\ndemocratization of international relations or of the actual\nfunctioning of the Organization, Algeria has joined its voice\nand its efforts to all those of good faith in setting its stakes\nconfidently on the capacity of the international community\nto transcend conditions of expediency in order to harness\nthe great surges of consensus and universal mutual\nassistance.\nIt is this same spirit which has ceaselessly motivated\nthe specific actions of my country within the framework of\nthe solidarity and cooperation of Maghreb, of the Sahelian-\nSahara, of Africa, and of the Arab and Muslim world as\nwell as in the Third World and the Mediterranean basin.\nIn that context, Algeria is fully aware of the\nsignificance, the scope and the effects, in its immediate area\nand beyond, of the profound work of national renewal in\nwhich it is currently engaged with a great deal of faith and\ndetermination. It is also aware of the sacrifices involved,\nfor its own sake as well as for others.\nAs during the November Revolution, which roused\nawareness and freed creative energies, today it there is a\nneed to break with other forms of behavior and other\nburdens, in order to anchor a young and ambitious society\nin progress and modernity through pluralist democracy, the\nvalorization of the elements inherent to the national\ncharacter and the realization of universal ideals of social\njustice and collective development.\nThe restoration of political stability, the consolidation\nof a State of law and order, the relaunching of economic\ngrowth which generates wealth and well-being, are a\nnecessary step in the multi-dimensional actions of the\nauthorities responsible for the period of transition during\nwhich the inner resources of the citizens and the intangible\nprinciples of the Republic must converge so that the open\npolitical dialogue currently being conducted by the\nPresident of State, Mr. Liamine Zeroual, may culminate as\nsoon as possible in the resumption of a pluralist, healthy\nelectoral process, that would express the popular will in a\nspirit of full sovereignty.\nIt is in this spirit of determination and consistency\nthat the resolute battle of Algeria against violence and\nterrorism - both in their manifestations and in their causes\n- is inscribed. This necessary campaign derives from the\nState\u2019s obligation to ensure, foremost among Human\nRights, the protection of the fundamental right to life. It\nimplies that we bring to bear the same vigour in our\ncollective denunciation of all governments who prove\nguilty of inciting and supporting terrorist violence or who\ndisplay willingness to engage in selective steps to prevent\nthe international community from implementing a\ncounter-strategy.\nThis year, Algeria has the privilege and the\nresponsibility of coordinating those Institutions engaged\nin the building of Maghreban unity. In carrying out this\nmandate which for Algeria represents a genuine\ncommitment to act in the service of all the peoples of the\nregion, we are engaged in consolidating gains and\npromoting new initiatives while keeping in perspective,\ngiven the historical juncture in which they occur, the\nscope of certain difficulties, both indigenous and\nexogenous, which impede progress toward the objectives\nof the Arab-Maghreb union.\nAmong these difficulties is the particular situation in\nwhich Libya has been put, namely that of being unable to\nplay its role in the valorization of regional\ncomplementarities and in contributing to the economic\nand social expansion of the region.\nOne must hope that the constructive proposals of\nLibya for the implementation of the relevant resolutions\nof the Security Council will enable it to quickly achieve\na peaceful and just solution to outstanding questions as\nwell as to the lifting of international sanctions which have\na negative impact on the living conditions of our Libyan\nbrethren.\nSimilarly, the people of the Western Sahara, whose\nlegitimate national aspirations it would be futile to hide,\nawait the scrupulous completion of the joint mission of\npeace of the United Nations and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity. The holding of a fair and impartial\nreferendum for self-determination in conformity with the\nsettlement plan agreed upon by the two parties and\nendorsed by the Security Council is one of the primary\nresponsibilities of the United Nations, under the Charter\nand under the Declaration on the Granting of\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. No\nadverse factor should stand in the way of the discharge of\nthat responsibility.\n21\n\n\nA just and lasting solution to the question of the\nWestern Sahara is also an important component of the\npeace and stability of the region as a whole. It is also\ninherent to the achievement of the liberation of the African\ncontinent. This is why Algeria is encouraging the United\nNations Secretary-General to ensure credibility and the\nutmost probity in the implementation of the settlement plan\nwhile increasing efforts to have the Kingdom of Morocco\nand the Polisario Front create a political dynamic which can\novercome all difficulties in the implementation of the\nreferendum process and beyond.\nIt was thanks to such a political dynamism that South\nAfrica honoured its rendezvous with history, to the\nsatisfaction of all, and that the United Nations was able to\nplay a positive role - something that Algeria welcomes and\nfinds gratifying. Apart from such specific elements, the\npeaceful dismantling of apartheid in South Africa is also an\nexample for other African nations that are being torn\nasunder by fratricidal strife.\nWith the continued assistance of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and the United Nations, Burundi and\nRwanda should be able to overcome the tragic\ncircumstances that have beset them and to opt for\nharmonious coexistence among the elements of their\nrespective peoples, with a view to mobilizing their energies\nin the service of national unity, democracy and\nreconstruction.\nThe return of peace and concord in Angola and\nMozambique, in line with the agreements concluded and in\nanswer to the popular will freely expressed, should finally\nenable those two brotherly peoples to heal the wounds of\npast years and to contribute to making southern Africa a\nregion of prosperity.\nThanks to the effective participation of the countries\nof west Africa, the situation in Liberia is moving toward a\nlasting solution, to which all parties must feel committed if\nthe country is to be secured against a recurrence of violence\nand instability.\nThe conflict in Somalia continues to be cause for\nserious international concern. The international\ncommunity\u2019s important presence in the field has had\nsatisfactory results in terms of humanitarian assistance and\nof reduced tension. The time has come for all the Somali\nfactions to work toward facing up to the challenge of\ncoexistence and national reconciliation in line with their\npeople\u2019s legitimate aspirations.\nStarting with the Madrid Conference, the Middle\nEast has embarked on the path of negotiation with a view\nto building a comprehensive just and lasting peace in that\nsensitive area of the world which has endured terrible\nbruising and suffering. Over the past year, important\nsteps have been taken on the road to peace, through the\nconclusion of the Palestinian-Israeli and the Jordanian-\nIsraeli agreements. Algeria hails the conclusion of those\nagreements and expresses the hope that these first steps\nwill be consolidated through effective and scrupulous\nimplementation of the provisions agreed upon and that\nthey will quickly be followed by significant breakthroughs\nthat meet the legitimate expectations of both Lebanon and\nSyria.\nThe edifice of peace in the Middle East has solid\nand positive foundations in international legality, and it is\nimportant that in the building of that edifice care should\nbe taken to make it a structure of permanent validity and\ncomprehensiveness which future generations would accept\nfully. Clearly, return of all the territories occupied by\nIsrael in 1967, including Al-Quds al-Sharif, and\nimplementation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian\npeople are prerequisites which should be at the heart of\nthe desired settlement.\nAlgeria, which participates in the multilateral\nworking groups that emanated from the Madrid\nConference, will continue to work with conviction for\nmaintaining the unity of the Palestinian and Arab ranks\nwith a view to consolidating the parameters of peace.\nThe unity of Arab ranks, which has been affected by\nthe consequences of the Gulf war, is an essential\nprerequisite of the peace which the international\ncommunity encourages and supports in the Middle East.\nFrom that point of view, an ultimate improvement in\nrelations between Kuwait and Iraq, on the basis of\ninternational legality and with respect for the principles of\nindependence, national sovereignty, territorial integrity,\nthe non-use of force or of the threat to use force, and\nnon-interference in internal affairs, is an imperative. Now\nthat the geographic framework of coexistence and\npeaceful neighbourliness between the two countries has\nbeen internationally enshrined, our hope is that the\nunresolved humanitarian issues will be satisfactorily\nresolved so that an atmosphere of reconciliation may\nprevail and lead to concrete steps in that direction. The\neconomic sanctions that are causing such suffering to the\nIraqi people should be lifted, not only because the Iraqi\nauthorities have cooperated in implementing the Security\nCouncil\u2019s resolutions, but also because keeping the\n22\n\n\nsanctions in place will be seen as a manifestation of\nindifference toward a people in danger.\nIn the same spirit, I should like to reiterate Algeria\u2019s\nsupport for the reestablishment and preservation of the\nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over the islands of\nAbou Moussa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb, which are\nstill under foreign occupation.\nThe tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is\ndaily becoming more serious, and which endangers the very\nfoundations of the United Nations in view of what is\nhappening to one of its Members, is a horrific test of the\ncredibility of the alleged movement, in international\nrelations, toward the reign of law and justice. Welcome as\nthey may be, the developments in international action that\nhave been taking place for a year now as a result of\nawareness of the horrors of ethnic cleansing and of the\ninhuman conditions imposed on the Muslim elements of the\npopulation such developments have not put paid to the\nextremism of the activist Serb minority or to its irredentist\nambitions which threaten the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In\ndischarging its national responsibility for the higher\ninterests of its people at such a critical juncture in their\nhistory, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is assured\nof the solidarity and support of Algeria.\nAt a time when the Haitian people and the\ninternational community have in sight a peaceful and\npositive outcome to the crisis that has beset the Republic of\nHaiti for some three years now, Algeria hopes that peace,\nstability, democracy and progress will be established in that\ncountry.\nThe twentieth century in the course of which mankind\nhas achieved considerable control over nature through\nextraordinary scientific and technological advances will,\nnevertheless, go down in history as the century which failed\nto meet the need for real and full security for the human\nrace.\nThe shortening of distances, the interdependence of\nnations, and the globalization of the economy and of\ncommunications, coexist with an untenable inability to wipe\nout hunger, poverty and numerous epidemics, while the\napocalyptic power of nuclear arsenals has exceeded all\nrational limits.\nThe end of the cold war has made possible the\nemergence of a concept of security based on general and\ncomplete disarmament and on economic and social levers.\nIt is important that nuclear disarmament be relentlessly\npursued and that the few notable results obtained in the\nreduction of nuclear arsenals by the United States and the\nRussian Federation be expanded and strengthened by the\nrapid conclusion of a treaty for a complete ban on nuclear\ntests.\nIt is this spirit which has made Algeria work for a\nnew vision of collective security that would be based on\ngeneral and complete disarmament. Hence, my country\u2019s\ninsistence that questions relating to disarmament and to\nnon-proliferation, and therefore to international security,\ncannot be dissociated from those which relate to\neconomic and social development.\nIt is also in this same spirit that my country adopts\na clear and committed attitude to the peaceful use of the\natom. That is why it is an honour and pleasure for me\nsolemnly to announce from this rostrum the decision of\nAlgeria to deposit, during this session of the Assembly,\nthe instruments of adherence to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. By its adherence to\nthat Treaty, Algeria hopes to contribute to the collective\nenterprise of general and complete disarmament, by\nmeans of which the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons must be raised, during its next review,\nto the level of an effective instrument for disarmament\nand a tool for the peaceful uses of the atom in the service\nof development. Moreover, it is important that the\nConvention banning chemical weapons should enter into\nforce and be fully effective.\nSuch a challenge imposes itself by the full weight of\nits imperatives and through awareness of the dangers that\nface a world in transition and in the grip of turmoil, a\nworld of uncertainty and one which bears powerful seeds\nof fragmentation.\nClearly the growing gap in development between\nNorth and South, which has been particularly exacerbated\nby the lack of genuine dialogue, shows, with a renewed\nsense of urgency, the need for the international\ncommunity to embark on the path of concerted action to\ntake in hand the phenomena of interdependence and, by\nso doing, to extract the elements of firm cooperative\naction in the service of development in a spirit of\nsolidarity.\nIn this context of accelerated globalization of\ninternational economic realities, cooperation for\ndevelopment clearly forms the only possible answer to the\n23\n\n\ndemands for new global regulation to ensure the conditions\nfor lasting and shared international security.\nThe message of the United Nations to which the\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter are of an\nunprecedented nature and scope in terms of their concept\nand extent has encircled the globe and has won for the\nOrganization a degree of participation which brings its\nmembership close to a universality which is worthy of its\nauthority and influence.\nThe work of restructuring the United Nations system\nand the debate on equitable representation within the\nSecurity Council in this respect provide a valuable\nopportunity for a close scrutiny of the institutional\nfunctioning of the bodies of the Organization as well as\na future-oriented overview that takes into consideration\nthe need for democratization and participation in the\ndecision-making process so that all the bodies of the\nOrganization may always enjoy full legitimacy by\nworking on behalf of the international community as a\nwhole.\nThe revitalization of the United Nations through its\nliberation from the practices and legacies of the cold war\npresupposes that an outstanding role be given to it in\nterms of the conception of global strategies and policies\nfor economic and social development.\nThe year which lies ahead now before the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations could be put to good\nuse to promote the control and ordered sharing by all\ncountries of the stakes at the end of the century. Thus\nthe international community can find, by acting in\nsolidarity and through concerted action, the springs for a\nnew dynamism of peace and cooperation. What is at\nstake here is our common future.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to extend to you,\nSir, my warmest felicitations on your well-deserved election\nto the high office of the presidency of the General\nAssembly. This is not only a mere recognition of your\nlong experience and your outstanding ability and diplomatic\nskill but also a reflection of the esteem in which your\ncountry, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, is held in the United Nations.\nI should also like to express our great appreciation and\nadmiration for the work of the Secretary-General and for\nthe determined and prudent leadership which he has\ndemonstrated on vital international issues.\nDespite important positive developments on a great\nnumber of issues occupying the attention and energy of\nour Organization, a significant number of old problems\nremain unresolved. Ethnic conflicts, nationalistic\nchauvinism, ethnic cleansing, xenophobia, racial\ndiscrimination, expansionist opportunism, social and\neconomic disparities, underdevelopment, the waste of\nscarce resources on fraternal enmities, the lack of\nnecessary commitment for the protection of the\nenvironment and gross and massive violations of human\nrights are only some of the evils still afflicting humanity\ntoday.\nAmong our priorities therefore should be the\nunequivocal reversal of the results of aggression and\nforeign occupation, support and defence of democracy,\nthe inversion of social and economic inequalities, the\nprotection of our environment and, finally, the protection\nand enhancement of human rights for all.\nIn order to accomplish such goals on a universal\nscale our Organization has to adapt, expeditiously and\neffectively, to the changing conditions and to the new\nchallenges. Better coordination between the various\nbodies that form the United Nations system is urgently\nrequired. The Secretary-General\u2019s recent decision to\nboost the coordinating role of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme on all developmental issues is\na commendable step in the right direction.\n\n\nWe are constantly witnessing world calamities.\nRwanda and the former Yugoslavia are dire and gory\nexamples. Our common goal should be to strengthen the\nUnited Nations in order best to respond to today\u2019s\nchallenges and the increased expectations of mankind for\nsecurity, economic viability and democracy. These\nexpectations can only be met by making the United Nations\nmore effective through the implementation of its own\nresolutions and the mandatory provisions of the Charter.\nThe General Assembly, the most prominent global\ndemocratic forum, represents the full membership of the\nUnited Nations. It functions on the principle of sovereign\nequality. As such, it has played a major role towards the\nrealization of the objectives of the world community and\nmust continue to do so in accordance with its mandate\nunder the Charter.\nGiven today\u2019s political realities, however, the Security\nCouncil has a substantially enlarged agenda and a more\ndynamic role to perform. In accordance with the Charter,\nthat organ has the ability to decide and to act. Nowadays\nit is able to act more effectively in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. In today\u2019s post-cold-war\nera the Security Council is in a position to play a broader\nand much more important role than ever before. In a world\nwhere new challenges require urgent solutions, such a\ndevelopment is welcome. Within the context of the\nreinforced and expanded role, a successful outcome of the\ndeliberations on the review of the Council\u2019s membership to\nreflect the realities of today\u2019s world is highly appreciated.\nHowever, the effectiveness of the most powerful organ\nof the United Nations is seriously compromised if it applies\ndouble standards. It must act in every case with\ndetermination and consistency. The record of its\nperformance indicates clearly that in those cases where the\ninternational community has shown steadfastness to defend\nthe principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and\nfully to implement its provisions, peace and justice was\nachieved. On the contrary, in those cases where unity of\npurpose had not been exhibited or the interests of nations\nor alliances had been placed above the universal principles\nand the rule of law, the problems remain and peace is\nelusive.\nThe financial difficulties confronting the Organization\npose severe constraints on its ever-increasing role in today\u2019s\nworld affairs. Every effort should be made to provide the\nOrganization with the necessary means to perform its vital\nmission effectively. In this regard I would recall that my\nGovernment decided early this year, after an appeal by the\nSecretary-General, to double on a voluntary basis its\nassessed contribution to all peace-keeping operations.\nOur commitment to the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes was thus manifested once again in a concrete and\npractical way. We hope that our gesture will soon be\nemulated by others. Our Organization desperately needs\ngenerosity by its Member States if it is to continue\nperforming its herculean mission effectively.\nIt is widely acknowledged that economics plays an\nimportant role in today\u2019s world politics. Development,\nthe protection of the environment, poverty alleviation,\nsocial progress, the improvement of health standards,\nproper education and sound technology require financial\nmeans for their attainment. In this exercise the United\nNations, through the Secretariat itself, the recently\nenhanced United Nations Development Programme and\nthe various specialized agencies, performs one of the most\nimportant missions, that of pursuing the betterment and\nthe economic well-being of peoples throughout the world.\nThese activities are also amply outlined in the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report, and therefore I do not intend to dwell on\nthem other than to declare that we are cognizant of their\nimportance and that they have our full support. We\ncommend the Secretary-General\u2019s integrated approach to\ndevelopment issues in \\\"An Agenda for Development\\\",\nwhich complements his ground-breaking \\\"An Agenda for\nPeace\\\". We fully subscribe to the Secretary-General\u2019s\nassertion that development is a fundamental human right\nand that development is the most secure basis for peace.\nIn accordance with the deliberations on the subject,\na successful implementation of the agenda for\ndevelopment depends on the priority to be given the\nfollowing elements: the alleviation of poverty and its\nunderlying causes, especially in Africa and other least-\ndeveloped regions; health and the status of women.\nThere is an urgent need for clear and effective population\npolicies.\nIn this regard, the recently concluded Cairo\nConference on Population and Development rightly placed\ngreat emphasis on development and the environment.\nThe new characteristic of the Conference\u2019s Programme of\nAction is precisely this linkage with sustainable\ndevelopment and protection of the environment. It\nconstitutes progress by integrating control of population,\nenvironmental protection and economic growth into the\napproach to population issues.\n2\n\n\nThe Rio Conference was a historic turning point in\nthis direction. Yet the follow-up and implementation of the\ndecisions taken at the Earth Summit remain contingent on\nthe political will to save our living space\u2019s web of life.\nThe Barbados Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, as the first\ntest of the international community\u2019s attachment to the Rio\ncommitments, focused on the acute problems that small\nisland developing States are confronted with. Cyprus, an\nactive member of this group, reiterates its commitment to\nthe early and prompt implementation of the Barbados\ncommitments, and expresses the hope that every member of\nthe international community will conscientiously fulfil its\nrelevant obligations.\nWe also welcome the recent broader agreement on\nseabed issues of the Convention on the Law of the Sea\npromoting universal application of the new legal order\ngoverning the seas and thus opening a new chapter in\ninternational relations.\nIn the light of our philosophy and experience, we\nattach much importance to the effective functioning of the\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations - the\nInternational Court of Justice. The increase in its\njurisdiction in contentious cases is encouraging. We also\nattach great significance to the possibility of clarifying legal\npoints in political disputes through advisory opinions. The\nInternational Court of Justice is indeed an integral part of\nthe United Nations peacemaking efforts and we\nwholeheartedly support the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal\nthat he be authorized to seek advisory opinions from the\nCourt as an important component of the peaceful settlement\nof disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nThe Secretariat\u2019s role in an improved, rationalized and\nmore effective United Nations is irrefutable. We have\nnothing but praise for the many men and women in the\ninternational civil service whose competence and dedication\nunder harsh circumstances enable the Organization to\nrespond to the ever-increasing demands in today\u2019s global\nenvironment. The Secretary-General has already done\nmuch in the direction of rationalizing and streamlining the\nSecretariat. He certainly has our support in the additional\nmeasures needed to carry out this task. We join in\nrecognizing the imperative need for adequate financial\nresources for the Organization, and for assessed\ncontributions to be paid in full and promptly by Member\nStates.\nIt should be recognized that true respect for human\nrights provides the foundation for the structure and\norganization of any society. Past and recent experience\nin every region of the world has demonstrated that the\nprotection and promotion of human rights is an\nindispensable ingredient of a stable, just and democratic\nworld order. Over the years, the United Nations has\nplayed a leading role in affirming human equality, which\nin essence forms the core of all rights, and in eliminating\nseparations based on ethnicity, religion, culture, socio-\neconomic disparities and political philosophies.\nIf we recognize the value of the axiom that in States\ngoverned by the rule of law the rights of citizens must be\nprotected unconditionally, then we should also accept the\nanalogy: that the same rights should be safeguarded for\nevery single citizen of a global State governed by the rule\nof law.\nAll the efforts of today\u2019s global community should\ntherefore be exerted towards the implementation of the\nbasic idea inherent in the international law of human\nrights - namely, that all the social mechanisms should\nexist to enhance the dignity of human beings, not to\nexploit them. Human rights are a powerful means to this\nend.\nIn order to achieve full respect for human rights and\nto eliminate human suffering, the world community must\nclearly oppose extreme nationalism, take unequivocal\nstands against policies of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and continue\nexerting steadfast efforts until we achieve the concrete\ndismantling of unjust and inhumane social systems that\nare based on ethnic segregation.\nThe effective promotion of human rights is naturally\nentwined with the global trend towards democratization.\nCyprus is in the vanguard of States that have become\nparty to international instruments for the protection of\nhuman rights, both at the global level, within the United\nNations and at the regional level, primarily through the\nCouncil of Europe.\nWe have had occasion in the past to express our\nsupport for the Secretary-General\u2019s constructive and\ntimely suggestions for improving the potential of United\nNations peace-keeping. We are encouraged that much\nprogress has been made in this field. In view, however,\nof the ever-increasing demands and the worsening\nfinancial problems associated with peace-keeping, we\nshould continue to do our best to assist in discharging, as\neffectively as possible, this major responsibility of the\n3\n\n\nOrganization. In this regard, may I recall that Cyprus, itself\na victim of foreign aggression, invasion and occupation, has\nvoluntarily undertaken the onus of paying on a yearly basis\none-third of the total cost of the United Nations Peace-\nkeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), which for the current\n12-month period amounts to $18 million. Similarly, the\nGreek Government generously offered a voluntary\ncontribution to UNFICYP of $6.5 million for the same\nperiod.\nSince the Republic of Cyprus has itself been one of\nthe longest beneficiaries of peace-keeping operations, I\nwould like to avail myself of this opportunity to express the\nappreciation of my country and its people to the\nOrganization and its peace-keeping function. I also take\nthis opportunity to express to the troop-contributing\ncountries our gratitude for sustaining UNFICYP for so\nmany years until the anomaly in the financing of the Force\nwas finally overcome in June 1993. On this occasion, I\nshould like to express the hope that a sound and fair\nsolution to the question of reimbursement to troop-\ncontributing countries will be found during the deliberations\nat this session. My country stands ready to offer every\npossible assistance towards the attainment of this aim.\nI shall refrain from addressing the long list of\ninternational problems described in this year\u2019s report by the\nSecretary-General (A/49/1) with which the Organization is\nactively dealing and which extend to all five continents.\nEach issue presents its own complications and special\ncharacteristics. Together, all the issues provide a measure\nof the enormity of what is expected of the United Nations,\nthe awesome burden of responsibilities of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the respect and admiration he deserves in\ncarrying out these tasks. As he has rightly pointed out in\nthe past:\n\\\"The United Nations, by undertaking a range of\nproblems as wide as the globe itself, must be expected\nto achieve successes but also to experience failures.\\\"\n(A/48/1, para. 512)\nOur world has witnessed in the last few years the\ncreation of new areas of tension and conflict through the\nunleashing of the destructive and centrifugal forces of\nchauvinism and ethnic strife. There have also been at the\nsame time some notable successes through the resolution of\nseveral regional issues and the withdrawal of foreign forces\nfollowing the end of our bipolar antagonistic world. We\nhave witnessed in many parts of the world the triumph of\nreason, the entrenchment of democracy and the emergence\nof free market economies. The achievement of putting an\nend to the odious practice of apartheid in South Africa\nbroadens the vistas of human wisdom; the historic\nAgreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO) on the one hand, and between Israel\nand other neighbouring Arab countries on the other mark\na new era in the Middle East. We express the hope that\nthe rest of the countries involved in this conflict will very\nsoon be able to join the others, thereby signifying one of\nthe major turning points in the history of the region.\nCyprus, an immediate neighbour, expresses the hope that\nsuch a catalytic positive evolution in our region will not\nleave our own problem unaffected.\nCyprus, almost a decade after the Cold War began\nto subside, remains divided as a result of foreign\naggression and military occupation, and its people forcibly\nseparated. As a result of ethnic cleansing by the\naggressor, Cypriots are victims of gross violations of\nhuman rights. A large component of the Cyprus question\nin its present dimensions is the massive violation of the\nhuman rights of the displaced persons who have been\nevicted by force from their homes by the Turkish forces\nof occupation and whose properties have been usurped by\nillegal settlers imported from Turkey to Cyprus in a\nsystematic and well-planned policy made by the aggressor\nto change the demographic composition of the occupied\nparts of Cyprus. In the same vein, the humanitarian issue\nof the enclave is another staggering dimension of the\nCyprus question. The missing persons still remain\nunaccounted for 20 years after the Turkish invasion and\noccupation of one third of the territory of the Republic of\nCyprus. This constitutes a severe violation of the human\nrights both of the missing persons themselves and of the\ntragic figures of their relatives.\nI put it before the Assembly today that Cyprus is a\ntest case for the resolve of the international community\nand of this Organization to demand and to enforce respect\nfor its will as expressed in a plethora of resolutions.\nTwenty years after the Turkish invasion of 1974, the\nproblem remains unresolved. The number of Turkish\nforces, despite resolutions of this Assembly calling for the\nwithdrawal of foreign forces from Cyprus, has in fact\nincreased, as is stated in the Secretary-General\u2019s report of\n30 May 1994. The presence of Turkish occupation troops\nconstitutes a serious threat to the people of Cyprus, and\nhas naturally given rise to a kind of arms race.\nThe General Assembly and the Security Council\nhave repeatedly reaffirmed the legal framework within\nwhich a just and lasting solution should be sought. In its\n4\n\n\nmost recent resolution, resolution 939 (1994) of 29 July\n1994, this basis is reaffirmed to be\n\\\"... a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty\nand independence and international personality and a\nsingle citizenship, with its independence and territorial\nintegrity safeguarded, and comprising two politically\nequal communities as described in the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions, in a bi-communal and bi-\nzonal federation, and that such a settlement must\nexclude union in whole or in part with any other\ncountry or any form of partition or secession\\\"\n(para. 2).\nThe Greek Cypriot side has for years accepted that a\nbi-zonal bi-communal federation was the basis for the\nsettlement of the Cyprus problem. The Turkish Cypriot\nleadership, fully supported by Turkey, has now made it\nclear that they have abandoned federation as the basis of\nthe solution and are promoting a loose confederation with\nseparate sovereignty for its two component parts.\nThe Secretary-General rightly and clearly attributed the\nfailure to make progress as follows:\n\\\"For the present, the Security Council finds itself\nfaced with an already familiar scenario: the absence of\nagreement due essentially to a lack of political will on\nthe Turkish Cypriot side.\\\" (S/1994/629, para. 53)\nIn the same report to the Security Council, the\nSecretary-General states the following:\n\\\"... a good offices mission, which by its nature is\ndependent on the consent and cooperation of the\nparties, is not an adequate method to deal with a\nsituation in which, for the past several years, one side\nhas consistently flouted the wishes of the international\ncommunity, as represented in the Security Council.\\\"\n(ibid., para. 58)\nMy view is that if this flouting and violation of\nSecurity Council resolutions is allowed to continue, there\nwill be no solution of the Cyprus problem. It is therefore\nnecessary for coercive action to be taken against the side\nthat flouts the United Nations resolutions.\nThere is also a further issue that requires to be\nurgently addressed. This is the problem of the military\nbuild-up which is taking place in Cyprus. The anxieties\ncreated by the presence of foreign troops on Cypriot\nterritory have given rise to a significant military build-up.\nSecurity is an extremely significant area, and is an\nissue of substance as well as a way to improve\nconfidence. I have therefore proposed the following.\nFirstly, the leaders of the two communities during\nthe intercommunal talks should make a solemn\ndeclaration to the Secretary-General on behalf of their\nrespective communities renouncing the use of force\nagainst each other and undertaking to take all the\nnecessary measures to prevent attack by members of one\ncommunity against the other.\nSecondly, the Government of the Republic should\ntake the following measures: repeal the National Guard\nLaw, disband the National Guard and hand over all its\narms and military equipment to the custody of the United\nNations peace-keeping force; undertake to maintain the\npolice force of the Republic at its present numerical\nstrength, armed only with light weapons; undertake the\ntotal cost of a substantially numerically increased United\nNations peace-keeping force; agree that the United\nNations peace-keeping force will have the right of\ninspection to ascertain compliance with the above; agree\nthat the National Guard armoured cars, armoured\npersonnel vehicles and tanks, which will be handed over\nto the custody of the United Nations peace-keeping force,\ncan be used by the United Nations peace-keeping force to\npatrol the buffer zone and to prevent intrusions in it; and\ndeposit in United Nations accounts all money saved from\ndisbanding the National Guard and from stopping the\npurchase of arms after deducting the cost of the United\nNations peace-keeping force, to be used after the solution\nof the problem for the benefit of both communities.\nThe Turkish Government, parallel to the above,\nshould withdraw the Turkish occupation forces from\nCyprus, as well as the illegal settlers, whose presence in\nCyprus, apart from violating United Nations resolutions\ncalling on both sides to respect the demographic\ncomposition of Cyprus, constitutes a military threat.\nThe Turkish Cypriots under arms should disband and\nhand over their weapons to the peace-keeping force.\nThe Turkish side complains that it has been isolated\ninternationally. The responsibility for this does not fall\non the Republic of Cyprus or on the international\ncommunity. It falls squarely on the shoulders of the\nTurkish leadership, which, by an act of purported\nsecession, declared a separate State. The international\ncommunity and the Republic of Cyprus simply respected\nSecurity Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984),\n5\n\n\nwhich deplored the purported secession, asked all States\nMembers of the United Nations not to recognize it and\ncalled upon the Turkish leadership to recall the act of\nsecession. All States respected these resolutions except\nTurkey.\nA small country has been violated by an aggressor, in\ncontravention of the Charter of this Organization, which\ndenounces the use of force. Twenty years have passed, and\nthe Security Council\u2019s many resolutions remain\nunimplemented. Unless the aggressor is faced with\nprogressively more severe consequences for its disregard of\ninternational legal order, a very bad example and precedent\nwill be allowed to cast doubt on the international\ncommunity\u2019s resolve and effectiveness.\nWith the advent of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, we are bound to review our past\nperformance and chart new avenues for the future. Did we\nmeet the goals set in 1945 by our founding fathers in the\naftermath of two devastating wars? Did we create the\nprerequisite for a just and peaceful world? Did we save\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war? As we\nnear the milestone of the Organization\u2019s fiftieth anniversary,\nlet us do some soul-searching, let us not be complacent and\nlet us no longer be guilty of errors of omission and\ncommission. Above all, let us not remain inactive because\nof inertia. People and nations all over the world have ever-\ngreater expectations of the Organization and the way in\nwhich it responds to the new challenges of our times. The\nCharter, by and large, has stood the test of time, but it is\nour responsibility to make the United Nations a more\neffective Organization. It is the world\u2019s last chance for\npeace.\n"

        "file_text": "At this forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations, the African continent has\nevery right to feel honoured in this great body. Through\nthe brilliant election of its President, our Assembly has paid\na tribute to the merits and the qualities of a great African\ndiplomat. I would add that above and beyond the\nrecognition so richly deserved by his country, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, for its contribution to peace, we also find in his\nelection a posthumous tribute to its founder, President\nHouphou\u00ebt Boigny, that unforgettable monument of\nmodern-day Africa. I would like to extend to our President\nthe warmest congratulations of the Congolese delegation\nand to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a well-\ndeserved tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\nSamuel Insanally, Ambassador of Guyana, who served as\nPresident at the forty-eighth session with such great\ncompetence and skill.\nMy congratulations go also to our Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who since becoming the leader\nof our Organization has endeavoured with such dedication\nto bring our Member States closer to the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter. On behalf of the Congolese\npeople, I would like to reiterate to this humble servant of\nmankind our most earnest encouragement as he discharges\nhis lofty responsibilities.\nMany peace-keeping and goodwill missions of the\nUnited Nations are currently to be found on African soil.\nWe welcome this necessary assistance, while we hope that\nthe peoples concerned will do even better in fostering\nconditions for a return to peace.\nFinally, how can one not feel overcome with joy at the\ntriumphant welcome given the return of the Republic of\nSouth Africa to the commonwealth of free nations? This\nreturn, which puts the finishing touches on the liberation of\nthe African continent from colonialism and racism, is surely\na source of legitimate satisfaction for the Members of the\nUnited Nations who devoted so much energy and so many\nresources in the battle of the South African people against\napartheid. To the delegation of that country that embodies\nthe hopes of an entire continent, I would like to extend a\nwarm, fraternal welcome.\nAt the beginning of this forty-ninth session the\nAssembly faces a complicated situation that combines real\nreasons for satisfaction with extremely worrisome issues.\nA marked trend towards dialogue and cooperation in\nsearch of solutions to the problems that confront our\nworld encourages our desire for a new system of\ninternational relations that would be more humane and\nmore just. The United Nations has to its credit many\nachievements in the restoration and creation of peace.\nConflicts that have been solved or are in the process of\nbeing solved give, little by little, faith and confidence in\nthe future, indeed I would say to life, to those peoples\nwho have been subjugated by despair, if not by the\ndisturbing resurgence of civil wars, ethnic tensions and\nreligious crusades.\nThe abolition of apartheid in South Africa, which\nseemed impossible yesterday, is a reality today, as if to\ngrant the wishes of the international community and to\nreward the strictures of the United Nations, a peaceful\ntransition has given birth to a united, democratic and non-\nracist South Africa.\nA peaceful settlement to the question of the Aouzou\nstrip has rid Central Africa of a fratricidal conflict. I\nhope the example of Libya and Chad will inspire other\nStates as well.\nFirmly and resolutely, the dynamic of peace begun\nin the Middle East is growing stronger and is opening\nprospects for cooperation to peoples long ruined by war\nand yet fated by geography and history to live together.\nThis is why, in hailing the significant progress achieved\nin this process, the Republic of the Congo hopes that we\nwill see rapid progress in the Arab-Israeli negotiations\nwith a view to the establishment of a thorough, just and\nlasting peace in the Middle East.\nBut the hope offered by the progress that has been\nachieved remains frustrated by the persistence of local\nwars that continue their bloodshed in various parts of the\nworld. Political differences and ethnic, racial or religious\ndiversity, far from enriching society, have elicited\nintolerance, hatred, violence and, worst of all, the\ndestruction of what is most precious to us all: human\nlife. From Bosnia to Angola, the similarities are striking.\nOf these crises that conceal several basic questions, we\nsee that a record number are in Africa: Angola, Somalia,\nLiberia, Rwanda ...\nThe Republic of the Congo remains greatly\nconcerned about the situation in its sister republic and\nneighbour Angola. We deplore the continuation of this\nfratricidal, murderous war, sustained by the intransigence\nand rigidity of UNITA. The Congolese Government\n41\n\n\nsupports all peace efforts undertaken by the international\ncommunity in the attempt to settle the conflict peacefully,\nespecially as part of the Lusaka negotiations: negotiations\nin which Angola has made very constructive proposals that\nshow the determination of President Dos Santos and his\nGovernment to find a solution that might take into account\nall the political sensibilities of that country. My country\nwould like to reiterate its wish to see Angolans finally\nreach understanding and reconciliation, so that they can\ndevote their energies to the rebuilding of their country, torn\napart by a war that has lasted far too long.\nWith regard to Liberia, we hope that the recent signing\nin Ghana of the cease-fire agreement by the various\nprotagonists will lead to better prospects for that country.\nThe genocide we have seen in Rwanda, another sad\nchapter in the history of mankind, is only the most extreme\nand inhuman manifestation of the problems facing Africa\ntoday. Violence, poverty, famine, disease, refugees,\nspiralling population growth - such is the widespread image\nof contemporary Africa. This well-known, gloomy picture\nno doubt stems from a habitual pessimism rather than from\na thorough study of reality.\nThe increase in the inequality between the richest and\nthe poorest countries has grown more complex with the\nemergence of worldwide markets, trade, communications -\neven, unfortunately, pollution. Africa, long relegated to the\nbackground, seems to have combined all the social\npathologies that inexorably strike ever-growing and ever-\npoorer populations. In our underdeveloped countries,\nchronic indebtedness and the drop in the prices of our basic\ncommodities, compounded by the pernicious reduction in\npublic aid for development and investments that continue to\nignore our legislation, however attractive and liberal it may\nbe, are worsening the disappearance of sources of financing\nand development.\nHere growth is slow to appear, whereas early signs\nalready herald the beginnings of expansion in the world\neconomy. The unemployed population is increasing, and\nworkers are under a constant uncertainty. As if to complete\nthis picture, natural disasters - drought and desertification -\ncompete with epidemics such as AIDS and malaria.\nInfections we thought to have eradicated are reappearing.\nIn this context of a disastrous economy, a population\nexplosion has eliminated any hope of redressing the\nimbalance between an almost zero economic growth rate\nand a population growth rate that is out of control. This\nsituation has destroyed all our efforts at recovery.\nCongo, for its part, has not escaped this common\ndestiny. The socio-political crisis which has shaken my\ncountry to its very foundations and brought great grief to\nmany Congolese families has to a large extent torn the\nsocial fabric and has completely ruined our economy.\nThis crisis has at least had the merit of destroying many\nillusions.\nWe had thought - or pretended to think - that it was\nenough simply to copy the old Western democracies and\nhold free elections under international supervision to\nensure that democracy prospered, that it was unnecessary\nto take local realities into account.\nSurely the European Parliament learned a bitter\nlesson from its failure, because it said to the new\ndemocracies that peoples and Governments should find\nformulas which would enable them to create democratic,\nlawful institutions based on their own history and cultural\nidentity.\nHow can we claim that in two years\u2019 time we have\ndone away with the ills of 30 years of badly assimilated\nMarxist-Leninist culture, a culture which was\nfundamentally hostile to pluralistic democracy and\nfundamentally opposed to individual growth. And what\nshould we say of the harmful effects of so many years of\nMarxist management of an economy that is today doomed\nbecause of that failure?\nCongo\u2019s economy today is suffering from the\ndisastrous consequences of ill-advised economic policies,\nwhich has given my country the honour of being placed\namong the most indebted countries in the world. In\naddition to this economic bankruptcy we find the waste,\nthe ruin of our cultural and moral values, and a\nbreakdown of the innate genius of our people.\nInsidious and pernicious, destitution and poverty\nhave crept into the private lives of men and women,\nevery day becoming more numerous, men and women\nwho to survive must hide behind the ultimate bulwark of\nethnicity, which has become a factor for segregation and\ndivision.\nMade idle and vulnerable, and subjected to chronic\nunemployment, our youth are now indulging in the\nillusion of drugs and the armed defence of dubious\ncauses.\n42\n\n\nThus, we see the scope of the consequences of so\nmany harmful factors in a society where people have lost\nall sense of perspective. Violence then becomes the outlet\nfor venting all sorts of political, economic and social\nfrustrations.\nThe outbreaks of violence in the Congo are the most\nabsurd manifestation of this. We must rely on our\ntraditional values to revive our dedication to dialogue and\npeace and hence realize how vain such extreme behaviour\nis - indeed, nothing more than human folly.\nWe have given new life to the democratic process; we\nhave started all over again. This is a process redirected\ntowards democratic transition, the first stage of power-\nsharing; it is the result of a policy of administrative\ndecentralization, one of the foundations of the development\nprogramme of President Pascal Lissouba. Today leaders of\nthe opposition are mayors of Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire -\nthe main cities in the country - and are thereby making\ntheir contribution to the national recovery.\nCongo\u2019s experience highlights the challenges facing\nthe new democracies, in particular young African\ndemocracies, which in order to build one nation must\nemerge from the condition of multi-ethnic States and one-\nparty or feudal systems and pass on to full democracy with\nits corollary, a market economy.\nIn order to meet these challenges, Congo has opted for\na programme of economic and social recovery that is\nalready under way. The programme involves the\nrelaunching of our country\u2019s development.\nOur bitter experience has led us to conclude that we\nmust give pride of place to the economy in order to\nsafeguard the young and fragile Congolese democracy and\ngive it a solid basis, especially taking into account the\ncrucial needs of our peoples, our own values and\ngeopolitical realities.\nTo fulfil this objective, the programme involves in its\ninitial phase a structural adjustment programme concluded\nwith the Bretton Woods institutions, a programme we are\ndetermined to carry out successfully in spite of the\nenormous sacrifices this will entail for our people. This\nmust be done because we are determined to stimulate\ndevelopment and to revive hope among our people. We are\nbanking on relaunching progress, but Congo cannot succeed\nalone. Africa is our salvation.\nIndeed, it is in the integration and complementarity\nof our economies that we should try to find solutions so\nthat we can emerge from the grave economic and social\ncrisis that has engulfed our countries, and especially\nrelaunch our growth and development. Let us hope that\nthe African States will be able to create the conditions for\nthis complementarity, especially through the use of\nscience and technology.\nThis initiative gives a good idea of the crucial\nimportance of the establishment of the African Economic\nCommunity. But in order to succeed this endeavour\nrequires human as well as financial resources. In this\nconnection, the international community is called upon to\ngive resolute help to our countries in their efforts to find\ncompetent men and women who can promote\ndevelopment by their know-how, in the appropriate\ninstitutions.\nDevelopment and the effective use of human\nresources are a decisive factor for the socio-economic\ndevelopment of our African continent. That is why,\nguided by this requirement of development, the Congolese\nGovernment has established the Panafrican Institute of\nManagement and Innovation to train people in the\nmanagement of resources, including human resources.\nFor the initiator of this project, His Excellency\nPresident Pascal Lissouba, development cannot be defined\nsolely in terms of growth; it must also be defined in terms\nof the ability to master the art of management.\nThe second requirement of this endeavour is to fund\nit. In this connection, we are not relying only on\nfinancial resources - that is, a massive influx of capital\ninto our poor economies. The economies would still have\nto be able to digest such capital.\nAbove and beyond the generation of financial flows\nto our countries, what Africa needs above all is the\nestablishment of a financial instrument, whose machinery\nwould be brought into harmony with the other, existing\ninstruments of international cooperation. This financial\ninstrument, with the support of all the African countries,\nwould obtain appropriate support from the international\ncommunity, especially the Bretton Woods institutions.\nThus, the African Development Bank is in our view\nthe best institution to deal with the financial aspect and,\nfurthermore, to study a system for funding science and\ntechnology for development. Today more than ever\n43\n\n\nbefore, science and technology are part and parcel of\ndevelopment; they are requirements of development.\nThe favourable developments in the world political\nsituation have given rise to the hope that a new era of\npeace will give the United Nations the role that its founders\nintended it to play.\nEverything - or almost everything - would seem to\naugur well for a new world order: an outpouring of\nfreedom and democracy; a revival of the universal\nawareness of human rights; and the pre-eminence of the\nUnited Nations in resolving issues linked to international\npeace, development and security.\nUnfortunately, the psychosis of nuclear apocalypse\ncharacteristic of the cold war has given way to a violent,\ndeadly expression of freedom and of local wars in a large\nnumber of developing countries, especially in Africa. We\nhave already stated that economic frustration is at the root\nof these events. Therefore, peace and security in our States\nand throughout the world require a solution to our people\u2019s\neconomic and social problems as well as the transformation\nof the world economic system with a view to establishing\na more just order. It is only then that we can have a true\nidea of the Agenda for Development and of its capability of\nmeeting the expectations and concerns of the developing\ncountries.\nThe vagaries of the Rwandan tragedy, especially at the\ntime when the critical decision was taken by the Security\nCouncil to withdraw the United Nations Assistance Mission\nfor Rwanda (UNAMIR), should awaken the conscience of\npeople everywhere and make them pause and reflect. The\njoint efforts of the United Nations and of the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) were crystal-clear. The continent-\nwide organization, through its conflict-prevention,\n-management and -resolution machinery, had committed\nitself to continuing these efforts.\nMy country welcomes the return of United Nations\npeace-keeping forces to Rwanda after a departure that had\nleft us with the bitter feeling that the decision was\ninappropriate.\nCongo, in spite of its internal difficulties, from the\nvery outset had felt concerned over the Rwandan tragedy.\nIn a manifestation of fraternal solidarity, my country has\ntaken part in all the humanitarian and peace-keeping\noperations in Rwanda, ranging from the OAU observer\nmission, UNAMIR I and operation \\\"Turquoise\\\" to today\u2019s\nUNAMIR II.\nIn drawing conclusions from these tragic events, the\n11 States of Central Africa, brought together in the\nUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security\nQuestions in Central Africa, have decided to create from\namong their respective armed forces a single peace-\nkeeping unit. This unit, once set up, will take part in\nOAU and United Nations peace-keeping operations.\nToday more than ever, in that part of Africa so sorely\ntried by instability and civil war, this advisory committee\nwould appear to be a valuable instrument for preventing\ncrises and conflicts and seems deserving of the attention\nand support of the international community. The recent\nsigning of a non-aggression pact among the States of the\nsubregion is a most concrete example of this.\nThis framework body for joint efforts for subregional\npeace and security, which my country will host in March\nand August 1995, will help, we are convinced, to prevent\ncrises and conflicts and thereby lay the foundations for\ngenuine peace and cooperation in Central Africa.\nIn an international context where we still see certain\nconflicts, we must acknowledge once again the pre-\neminent role of the Security Council, which safeguards\ninternational peace and security. The spectacular increase\nin the membership of the United Nations as well as the\nemergence of new political and economic forces the\nworld over require an expansion of this body on the basis\nof equitable geographic representation. In so doing, we\nwould only be abiding by the criterion of universality,\nwhich has always guided our Organization and which\nmust be constantly adapted to newly emerging realities.\nOur destinies are bound to become increasingly\nintertwined, our horizons to broaden, and all this in a\nspirit of diversity, complementarity and solidarity without\nany will to power or domination. Increased developments\nin science and technology will result in a globalization of\nthe challenges we must face.\n44\n\n\nMay we be able to make the best possible use of the\nvast potential open to us, so that our long-suffering peoples\nwill finally see the dawning of the era of peace and\nprosperity they so legitimately desire.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate the President sincerely on his\nelection to preside over the forty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am particularly pleased to see a\nrepresentative of a French-speaking African country occupy\nthis important position. We trust that the forty-ninth\nsession will, under his enlightened leadership, pay special\nattention to the political, economic and social problems\nfacing his continent, so sorely tried over these last few\nyears.\nNext year the United Nations will celebrate its\nfiftieth anniversary with a series of activities throughout\nthe world. The image of the United Nations in the eyes\nof world public opinion will depend largely on its status,\non the extent to which it has remained faithful, 50 years\nafter its founding, to the principles of the San Francisco\nCharter, which are still valid.\nI believe it must be a priority to strengthen the world\nOrganization in the spirit of Article 1 of the Charter, so\nthat it can effectively carry out its mission of maintaining\ninternational peace and security. Let us also recall here\nthe words of the great philosopher, Sir Karl Popper,\nrecently deceased, who wrote: \\\"Our primary objective\nmust be peace. But we must not hesitate to wage war for\npeace.\\\" We have given the United Nations the\nresponsibility of deciding when to use force to preserve\npeace. This weighty responsibility has to be exercised\nwhen necessary.\nThe Security Council is of paramount importance in\npreserving peace in the world. In order to maintain and\nstrengthen the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Security\nCouncil, Austria advocates a slight increase in its\nmembership. Every Member of the United Nations must\nbe able to see and understand how views develop within\nthat body. They must all be able to feel sure that\ndiscussions in the Council take account of the views of\ninterested countries, for example, countries contributing\ntroops for peace-keeping operations.\nThe importance of the United Nations must be\npreserved and developed, not only as a system for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, but also\nas a forum for discussion and an instrument for\ncoordination at the global level. On the first point, much\nremains to be done. In the social and economic sphere\nand in the field of development, important progress has\nbeen made, notably with the reform of the Economic and\nSocial Council, which has permitted better guidance of\noperational activities for development.\nA solid financial basis is absolutely vital to the\neffective discharge of the United Nations mission. Non-\npayment or late payment of mandatory contributions by\nMember States is a violation of the Charter and of the\nduty of international solidarity. The burden thus created\nfalls, above all, on those Members that are called good\n12\n\n\npayers and those that provide troops, expenditures that are\nreimbursed by the United Nations only after considerable\ndelay. This chronic problem, which is getting worse, can\nbe resolved only by timely and full payment of mandatory\ncontributions by all Member States. As one of the 20\ncountries that, in 1994, paid their full contribution in a\ntimely fashion to the regular budget of the United Nations,\nand as a regular participant in peace-keeping operations,\nAustria will, along with the Secretariat and other interested\ndelegations, seek a solution to this difficult problem.\nOn the eve of its fiftieth anniversary the United\nNations faces new challenges at the world level.\nSustainable development, the monitoring of world\npopulation growth, the elimination of poverty, the creation\nof opportunities for productive employment, social\nintegration, equality for women, better protection of human\nrights, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons - all are major\nthemes of our era and have been or will be the subject of\ninternational conferences. The task of the United Nations\nis to draw the necessary conclusions from the results of\nthese conferences and to define the outlines of sustainable\nhuman development at the world level. The Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s reports, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" and \\\"Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\", are essential elements in a discussion that\nhas already led to a broader understanding of the idea of\nsecurity.\nThe protection and promotion of human rights is one\nof the central tasks of the United Nations. The\naccomplishment of this task has benefited from the vital\nimpetus provided by the Vienna Declaration and\nProgramme of Action. While we can be pleased with the\noutcome of the World Conference on Human Rights, the\nlasting impact of the final document of Vienna will none\nthe less be measured by the continuing will of the\ncommunity of nations to give effect to its provisions more\nrapidly and to guarantee them more effectively than in the\npast.\nA crucial role is to be played in this connection by the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. Austria welcomes\nthe swift implementation of this central provision of the\nVienna document. In the few months that he has occupied\nhis post, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ayala Lasso has fully lived up to the\nexpectations arising out of his difficult and important\nmandate. His official visit to Vienna began a dialogue with\nall Governments. It seems to us a matter of priority to\npromote coordination of international protection of human\nrights within the United Nations system, and in this the\nHigh Commissioner will, of course, have a determining role\nto play. We should also strengthen the various mechanisms\nfor protecting human rights, as well as the role of the\nSpecial Rapporteurs. This should make it possible to\nreact more quickly to violations of human rights and to\nprevent them more effectively. The resources needed for\nthe High Commissioner\u2019s work should be provided as\nsoon as possible.\nEffective protection of human rights is not only a\nduty towards each individual; it is also an essential\ncontribution to ensuring stability, development and\nsecurity. History teaches us that we must resolutely\noppose all flagrant violations of human rights, such as\ngenocide in the Nazi concentration camps or by the\nKhmer Rouge, as soon as they are brought to light. This\nmakes it all the more difficult to understand that the\nresolution adopted by the United Nations Conference on\nHuman Rights relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina has\nremained a dead letter, thereby jeopardizing the credibility\nof our world Organization.\nIn this connection, I wish to pay a particular tribute\nto Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, former Prime Minister of\nPoland and Special Rapporteur of the Commission on\nHuman Rights, for his excellent work, of which the world\ncommunity should be proud. I would also hail President\nIzetbegovic\u00b4 of Bosnia and Herzegovina who, with great\nself-discipline and in a very constructive spirit, has\naccepted to speak with those who are committing a kind\nof genocide against his people. This is remarkable\nconduct from an extraordinary individual.\nThe effective protection of minorities involves great\ndifficulties in many countries. I am pleased to be able to\ninform the Assembly that, in 1992, Austria and Italy were\nable to resolve their dispute over the Southern Tyrol. The\ndispute related to the implementation of the 1946 Treaty\nof Paris on the situation of the German-speaking and\nLadino-speaking populations in Southern Tyrol. It was\nalso dealt with in General Assembly resolutions 1497\n(XV) and 1661 (XVI), adopted at the fifteenth and\nsixteenth sessions respectively.\nThe solution that was agreed to by both sides was to\nestablish relatively comprehensive autonomy in southern\nTyrol. This seemed on the whole to be an adequate basis\nfor ensuring the continued existence of the German-\nspeaking and Ladino minorities.\n13\n\n\nGiven the constant changes in the atmosphere -\nparticularly the economic and financial atmosphere - there\nhas to be a dynamic autonomy if its objective is to be\nattained. This will require ongoing flexibility and\nunderstanding on the part of the relevant authorities. A\nsolution to the minorities problem on the basis of territorial\nautonomy must, over the long term, aim at ensuring that all\nthose who live together under the same roof view such\nautonomy as a positive thing that protects their respective\ninterests.\nThe unanimous statements made by Prime Minister\nBerlusconi, Foreign Minister Martino and Interior Minister\nMaroni that they would not touch the autonomy of southern\nTyrol seem to us to be a guarantee that we shall continue\non the same road.\nAustria is proud, as one of the headquarters countries\nof the United Nations, to host a number of important\nprogrammes that meet the immediate interests of the\nindividual and also have a decisive impact on international\nrelations. These include protection from drug abuse, the\nstruggle against crime, questions on the use and control of\nnuclear power and on the preservation of the system for the\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons - all of these are\nmajor activities of the United Nations at Vienna, as is\ninternational cooperation on outer space and on the\npromotion of international industrial development.\nFollowing recent political changes, important new\nareas for United Nations activities have emerged in Eastern\nEurope and Central Asia. Vienna sees itself as an\nimportant point for coordinating activities to support and\nassist those States as they move towards democracy, a state\nof law and a market economy.\nOn the eve of its fiftieth anniversary, the United\nNations currently has more than 70,000 people in 17\ndifferent peace-keeping operations. More than three times\nthe regular budget is being devoted to those operations.\nAustria, which has been involved for decades in such\noperations, is aware of the enormous challenge that this\nposes to the United Nations and its Member States in terms\nof funds, personnel and organization.\nOne of the most important events to take place within\nthe framework of the activities organized in Austria in\nconnection with the fiftieth anniversary will be the very\nhigh-level conference set for early March 1995 in Vienna.\nThis conference will be devoted to the discussion, analysis\nand preparation of recommendations on how best to take up\nthe challenge of measures to preserve peace on the eve of\nthe new millennium. I am particularly pleased and\ngrateful that the Secretary-General has been kind enough\nto agree to deliver the opening address in Austria.\nAustria is in favour of strengthening civilian peace-\nkeeping operations and of stepping up United Nations\nactivities in preventive diplomacy. Thus, the Austrian\nFederal Government has established, in the city of\nSchlaining, a centre for civilian peace-keeping operations.\nThis year, we held our second seminar on the re-\nestablishment of peace and on preventive diplomacy, a\nseminar in which high officials of the United Nations\nparticipated. Also in Schlaining, we have a regular\ntraining programme, with international participation, for\ncivilian international operations relating to peace-keeping\nand peace-building.\nFor a quarter of a century, the non-proliferation\nTreaty has successfully prevented the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons and has also successfully prevented the\nabuse of nuclear power for military purposes. The 1995\nReview Conference will take a decision on extending the\nnon-proliferation Treaty. Our common goal must be the\nunconditional and unrestricted extension of the Treaty.\nAustria also has good reason to hope that the substantive\nnegotiations currently under way in the Conference on\nDisarmament with a view to the conclusion of a\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty will lead to nuclear\ndisarmament.\nAs the host country of the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency, Austria is aware of the importance of\nthis control mechanism for the application of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty. The success of any future agreement\non a nuclear-test ban will, in the final analysis, depend on\nthe effectiveness of the work done by organizations\nresponsible for its implementation and verification.\nA year ago, the Austrian Federal Government\ndecided to offer Vienna as headquarters for the future\norganization to be established under the nuclear-test-ban\ntreaty, and I would wish to extend this invitation again\ntoday before the General Assembly.\nThis year once again, our hopes of seeing an end to\nthe fighting in the territory of the former Yugoslavia have\nbeen dashed. Despite international initiatives and peace\nplans, the actual prospects for an equitable and lasting\nsolution are not very good. The reconciliation between\nthe Bosnian Croats and the Bosnians, which stemmed\nfrom the Washington Agreements, should not make us\nforget that the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina continues\n14\n\n\nto leave innumerable victims in its wake. The toll of dead\nand displaced persons grows daily more terrible. The\naggressor has gone so far as to attack or lay siege to cities\nthat have been declared United Nations protected areas.\nDespite repeated international condemnation, the\nSerbian side has continued its practice of \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\". Austria strongly condemns these crimes,\nwherever and by whomever they may be perpetrated, and\nwe shall never stop calling for an end to such practices.\nBasic principles of the international order continue to\nbe trampled underfoot and lose their credibility. Specific\nresolutions such as those on military guarantees for\nprotected areas or return of refugees to their home, have not\nyet been implemented. All international initiatives and\nefforts for the repatriation of refugees have been made a\nmockery by \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", which continues to be\npractised and, in the final analysis, continues to be tolerated\nat the international level. The arms embargo imposed by\nthe Security Council in September 1991 has a unilateral\nimpact, to the detriment of those countries that have taken\nover from the former Yugoslavia and that are threatened by\nSerbian ambitions. And so we have arrived at a situation\nwhere the legitimate Government of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is unable fully to exercise its right to\nlegitimate self-defence, while at the same time that State\ncannot even benefit from adequate protection under the\nsystem of collective security. On the other hand, we do not\nsee any attempt on the Serbian side to abandon the idea of\na Greater Serbia based on the illegal conquest of territories\nby force. This can be seen from the fact that the peace\nplans prepared by the European Union and the contact\ngroup have still not been accepted by the Serbian side,\nalthough on many points they do respond to their\naspirations.\nIn its resolution 943 (1994) of 23 September the\nSecurity Council set forth the conditions for a suspension\nof sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n(Serbia and Montenegro). The Belgrade Government must\nallow international observers to control the blockade against\nthe Bosnian Serbs. The observer Mission now being\nestablished along the Serbo-Bosnian border is, as Austria\nsees it, a step in the right direction but, and I stress the\npoint, it remains to be seen how effectively the Mission\nwill be able to carry out its task and whether credible\nconsequences will in fact be drawn from the conclusions\narrived at by the observers.\nIn Croatia also the situation remains largely\nunchanged: contrary to the provisions of the 1992 Vance\nplan which was approved by the Security Council, more\nthan one quarter of the country remains in the hands of\nthe rebel Serbs. So far there has been neither\ndemilitarization of these regions under the supervision of\nthe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops\nnor has it yet been possible for the civilian population to\nreturn. Recent protests show to what extent the situation\nhas become untenable for displaced persons within\nCroatia.\nAgainst the backdrop of the extremely harsh\njudgements often pronounced on Croatia one must not\nforget the very clear terms of the legal opinions of the\nBadinter Commission in January 1992. From these texts\nit is clear that, in principle, Croatia met all the conditions\nset forth by the European Union for recognition of new\nStates in Eastern Europe. I realize that in some areas,\nsuch as administration, practices vis-\u00e0-vis the minorities\nand the media, improvements are still much to be desired.\nBut we should not measure Croatia by different and\nharsher criteria than the criteria we use for other countries\nin central and south-eastern Europe because we have\ngreater access to Croatia and because there are more\ntransparent structures there, and there is no other country\nin Europe, apart from Bosnia and Herzegovina, that has\nbeen subjected for years to a violent military attack with\nwhich it has to cope under extremely difficult conditions.\nThe situation in Kosovo, which has been too\nneglected because of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nis continuing to deteriorate. The Belgrade authorities\nhave pursued their systematic action against the Albanian\nmajority of the population. There is still a danger that\nmass violence may erupt. Observer missions sent by the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(CSCE) which were expelled in 1993 have not been\nauthorized to return despite intensive international efforts\nto that end. In that region, which is almost 90 per cent\ninhabited by Albanians and has been fully autonomous\nduring the past couple of decades, we are witnessing the\nexercise of a kind of power that is tantamount to that of\nan occupying regime.\nThe situation in former Yugoslavia shows that what\nthe great French philosopher, Blaise Pascal, said in his\nPens\u00e9es remains as true as ever. He said that justice\nwithout force was powerless and that force without justice\nwas tyrannical. The collective security system of the\nUnited Nations which is part of the post-war order, has\nnot really been applied by the international community in\nthe case of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. The hope\nthat the collective security system would be used as an\n15\n\n\ninstrument of peace following its successful use after the\nIraqi invasion of Kuwait has proved disappointing.\nUnfortunately, Bosnia and Herzegovina is not an\nisolated case. It would be a serious mistake not to mention,\nat least, some other tragedies - Rwanda, Angola,\nAfghanistan, Haiti, Tajikistan, and so on. There is too long\na list of hotbeds of crisis and violence, where the law of the\nstrongest tramples underfoot the principles of the Charter of\nSan Francisco. At the same time we must draw strength\nand optimism from some positive developments, historic in\ntheir significance. I may mention, for example, free and\ndemocratic elections in South Africa, an end to the policy\nof apartheid, autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, and an end to\nthe state of war between Jordan and Israel. In South Africa\nand in the Middle East age-old objectives of the United\nNations have finally been attained or are about to be\nattained. Austria, in so far as it can, actively supports these\npeaceful processes, not only in the interests of the peoples\nconcerned but also in the interests of greater hope of\nresolving other similar problems.\nThe year 1994 is of historic significance to Austria.\nA huge majority - 66.58 per cent - of the Austrian people\ncame out firmly in support of joining the European Union,\na community of States that holds the same values as, and\nplays an increasingly important role in, the United Nations.\nThis was the largest support in a European State for the\nidea of European integration.\nWith that democratic force we will continue to support\nthis goal, and - as of 1 January I hope - as a member of\nthis community we will contribute in a spirit of solidarity\nand openness to the attainment of the objectives of the\nUnited Nations as we have done in the past.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure to attend the beginning of\nthis forty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations. Now that the threat of global war is\nreceding and local conflicts are proliferating, the untiring\nefforts undertaken by Boutros Boutros-Ghali on behalf of\npeace are increasingly arduous and deserve our deepest\nappreciation.\nMy congratulations go also to the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Amara Essy, who is serving as\nPresident of this important session of the Assembly.\nDuring its first half-century, the United Nations\npromoted highly important diplomatic negotiations,\nprevented disputes between nations, fostered the\nsettlement of regional controversies and prevented global\nconflicts. It also encountered serious limitations - and\nwas, at times, close to paralysis - in the attainment of its\nends. Its achievements and limitations alike have\nreflected the world power structure prevailing since 1945,\nas well as the efforts of its Members: countries that are\nequal and sovereign but diverse in their beliefs, cultural\nexpressions, geographical endowments and levels of\ndevelopment.\nThe United Nations is a child of its times, of the\nperiod following the Second World War. It was born\nwith a mission to work for world peace and security and\nfor development. At that time, peace meant avoiding the\nnuclear conflagration toward which the bipolar arms race\nhad been sweeping us since the 1950s. Global security\nthen meant avoiding the escalation of peripheral conflicts\ninto which the nuclear Powers could be drawn. At that\ntime also, world development depended on financing for\nrecovery and, therefore, on the recycling of resources by\nthe victorious Powers, which were net exporters of\ncapital, in the form, very often, of \\\"international aid\\\".\nThat peace, that security and that concept of development\nare no longer with us.\nToday, without the bipolar balance of power and\nfaced with the intense financial competition and the\nregional ethnic and religious conflicts of recent years, we\nrecognize that there are other ways in which the United\nNations should promote peace, security and development,\nas set forth in its founding Charter. Now, at the end of\nanother war - the cold war - it is time to recognize a new\ncontent in the objectives of our world Organization and\nnew conditions for providing deep-rooted, lasting\nresponses to the aspirations for justice and well-being\nshared by all mankind.\nWhat kinds of peace, development and solidarity are\nrequired at the end of this century? Today\ninternationalization of the economy is increasingly\npronounced and the cultural plurality of nations is being\nmanifested by the heightening of tensions in relations\nbetween groups, countries and regions. The major\ndilemmas of our times therefore stem from profound\ncomplexities in the economic and political spheres and in\nthe opportunities open to all peoples to attain a decent\nstandard of living. Thus, it is essential to find and apply\nnew solutions to the problems resulting from the end of\nthe bipolar confrontation and from the new economic\n10\n\n\ncontests between powerful regions, whose effects\nsometimes have an even greater impact on nations remote\nfrom these centres of finance and trade. Today the answers\nlie not in weapons, but in the will to build consensus; not\nin interference, but in the ability to coordinate development\npolicies within a framework of fair competition, ruled by\nstandards recognized by all participants.\nIn building up new hope, we must unquestionably\npersevere in our efforts to eradicate the nuclear threat and\nthe risks posed by chemical and biological weapons and the\narms race. Mexico has always taken part in contributing to\nreducing those dangers. My country is pleased at the recent\naccession by Argentina, Brazil and Chile to the Treaty of\nTlatelolco, and by the forthcoming accession announced by\nCuba, which fulfil the Latin American ideal of inhabiting\na nuclear-weapon-free region. We should now continue the\nnegotiations on, and put into effect, the comprehensive\nnuclear-test-ban treaty and the Convention on chemical\nweapons, signed in January 1993 and thus far ratified by a\nmere 14 States.\nBut this is not sufficient. In the political sphere, we\nface the challenge of keeping the peace while maintaining\nrespect for the sovereignty of nations and for their cultural\ndiversity and political plurality, which, far from succumbing\nto interference or being diluted into uniformity, demand\ntheir own spaces, both within our countries and within the\nUnited Nations. Faced with a painful experience in\nChiapas, in the south of our country, Mexico turned the\narmed challenge with which we were confronted on 1\nJanuary into political dialogue 10 days later; it listened\ncarefully to the voices of the neediest and committed itself\nto finding a political way to solve their problems through\ndialogue and in freedom, instead of attempting to crush the\nuprising, as was the custom throughout the world during the\ncold-war period. This is the spirit of political dialogue and\npeace with honour required by the new era; this is the path\nof new hope.\nThe world has certainly seen many achievements in\nrecent times. Mexico welcomes the progress made in\nnegotiations leading to lasting peace in various parts of the\nworld, especially in the Middle East. It would also like to\nexpress, once again, its satisfaction at the end of apartheid\nin South Africa and at the establishment of a democratic\nGovernment in that country.\nMexico will continue its enthusiastic and unwavering\nsupport for the peace processes in Central America and\ncongratulates the parties involved, which are making\nprogress along the path of dialogue and negotiation. As a\nmember of the group of countries that are friends of the\nSecretary-General, Mexico has taken part in the efforts to\narrange direct talks to put an end to conflicts between\nLatin American sister countries. That is precisely the\npath that might be followed, through the dialogue\nreopened regarding illegal migration, to put an end to the\nlongstanding differences in the hemisphere between the\nUnited States and Cuba, within a framework of full\nrespect for the sovereignty and the right to\nself-determination of the Cuban people.\nWith regard to the crisis in Haiti, Mexico reiterates\nits commitment to the re-establishment of the\nconstitutional and democratic order. It also reiterates the\nneed to give preference to peaceful and diplomatic means\nabove all others, as well as to foster specific forms of\ncooperation to ensure better living standards for the\nHaitian people, for without them democratic institutions\nwill be weak and short-lived.\nThe use of force and the threat of its use, when\nworld peace is not in danger, are no longer valid means\nfor sovereign nations to achieve their goals. What are\nneeded instead are economic exchanges, political dialogue\nand a common willingness to recognize and respect one\nanother, unconditionally and without exception. With that\nwillingness, which will benefit us all because it commits\nus all, we can undertake thorough reforms of international\norganizations, and in particular of the United Nations.\nRecognition of plurality, respect for sovereignty and the\nreaching of consensual accords are also bases on which\nthe United Nations can construct new forms of\ncooperation and technical assistance aimed at\nconsolidating democracy and at achieving the effective\nprotection of human rights.\nAs a form of political organization of peoples,\ndemocracy is certainly the best way to facilitate\ndevelopment with justice; it is also the system which best\nguarantees respect for human rights. For the civil and\npolitical rights recognized by the vast majority of the\nMembers of our Organization to be fully effective,\neconomic conditions in which all individuals can develop\ntheir potential are required. Hunger and unemployment,\ndrug-trafficking and the depletion of natural resources,\nforced migrations and new forms of trade protectionism\nimpair development and the full exercise of human rights\nand hinder the democratic participation of individuals in\nshaping their own destinies. Therefore, coordinated\naction by nations to deal with these grave problems of our\ntimes can help to broaden political participation and\n11\n\n\nensure better conditions to improve well-being and provide\nfor the protection of human rights.\nThe efforts made thus far by the United Nations in\nthis field - such as the creation of the post of High\nCommissioner for human rights - are notable but still\ninsufficient. Reconsidering the question of the defence of\nhuman rights and the strengthening of democracy also\ninvolves reconsidering the issue of development on the\nbasis of fair access to markets, capital and new technolo-\ngies. It is not by chance that democratic stability flourishes\nwhere there is economic stability and growth; nor is it by\nchance that more human rights violations occur where the\npopulation is prey to poverty, illiteracy and disease.\nMaking progress in democracy and respect for human rights\nrequires new efforts to eradicate inequalities between\nindividuals, groups, peoples and nations.\nIn the economic sphere, we are facing both the\nchallenges and the opportunities posed by interdependence\nand globalization. We must now make progress in the\nharmonization of financial, technological and production\npolicies within the world economy in order to achieve\ngeneralized growth. We are well aware that the\ndevelopment of the most industrialized nations may prove\nto be insufficient without sustained growth in the\ndeveloping countries. In the coming years the most\nimportant growth of markets for the products of\nindustrialized nations will occur in the developing countries.\nWe know, too, that aid may prove to be ineffective and\ninsufficient, when the basic need is to move toward equality\nof opportunities worldwide by opening markets to the\nproducts of developing countries.\nIn the past few years the world has undergone a\ntransition toward a liberalization of trade that is\nunprecedented in modern history. This movement toward\ntrue globalization, in which a large number of developing\ncountries are participating for the first time, is indicative of\nthe renewed confidence of nations in their capacity to\ncompete and gain integration into world markets. This new\nliberalization is also a reason for us to feel optimistic that\nfreer trade will contribute to the eradication of poverty.\nMore trade will translate into more and better jobs.\nNevertheless, there are still obstacles that must be\novercome: we must be wary of new protectionist trends;\nwe must recognize that the new financial resources are still\ninsufficient for the needs of the developing countries and\nthat many of those countries continue to experience less\nfavourable terms of trade as well as instability in interest\nrates. The challenge we face is to eliminate conditions that\nimpede the free circulation of goods and services, that\nlimit the creation of jobs and produce growing migration,\nthat exacerbate xenophobic attitudes and that stand in the\nway of world recovery.\nTo that end, we must consolidate the present opening\nof markets to competition. No instrument will be of\ngreater assistance in attaining that goal than the launching\nof the World Trade Organization, which will complement\nthe Bretton Woods institutions. It is essential for us first\nto guarantee that the results of the Uruguay Round are\nratified by countries that have not yet done so, and\nsubsequently to ensure the effective functioning of the\nnew world-trade system.\nToday, it is essential to maintain and expand large\nfree-trade areas and, in the new organization of world\ntrade, to build new forms of coordination and cooperation\nso that free-trade areas will act as an impetus rather than\nan obstacle to world trade. As progress is made in trade\nagreements and treaties, it is imperative to recognize the\nasymmetries between nations and to avoid conditioning\ntrade on such matters as labour and environmental issues,\nwhich, although legitimate aspects of trade, can be used\nartificially to conceal new forms of protectionism. These\nactions comprise the major tasks on our economic agenda\nfor the end of this century.\nIn the sphere of social justice - an element essential\nto peace - there is in the world a long-standing social debt\nstill to be paid. If we fail to pay it, it will be utopian to\nthink of progress in democracy or any widespread and\nenduring peace and security. To settle that debt, the\nUnited Nations must grant clear priority to development\nand cooperation within a framework of multilateral action,\nrather than giving priority to actions backed by arms to\nmaintain security. We have before us the opportunity to\nreorder our priorities as we deal at this forty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly with the topic of a new Agenda\nfor Development, and thereby to move toward lasting\npeace based on comprehensive, balanced worldwide de-\nvelopment.\nFully achieving development also presupposes the\nsustainable use of natural resources and the maintenance\nof the fragile balance of ecosystems that are frequently\noverexploited, resulting in the impoverishment of those\nliving under such systems. Here, the Agenda drawn up\nby the United Nations at the historic summit in Rio de\nJaneiro continues to be more an aspiration than a reality.\nIt is imperative to move on from words to deeds. In next\nyear\u2019s summit on social development, there will be a new\n12\n\n\nopportunity to respond to this link between environment\nand development, which is essentially one of justice.\nIn brief, we need a major cultural change based on a\nsimple truth: political pluralism within countries and\namong nations is not a hypothesis; it is a reality that defines\nand characterizes all human groups. Consequently, Mexico\nstresses its opposition to illusory assumptions that\nsovereignty is a vanishing concept. The globalization of\nthe economy, an undeniable fact in our times, must be\nreconciled with the existence of diverse and sovereign\nnations whose status and will to exist cannot be denied,\nmuch less violated, without seriously jeopardizing peace.\nOnly on the basis of recognizing and respecting\npluralism will we be able to implant new and better world\nmechanisms for coordinating economic matters to achieve\na better distribution of capital, technology and joint forms\nof production. Only on the basis of respect for the\nsovereignty of each nation and the right of all peoples to\nself-determination will we be able to build a broader and\nmore enduring political consensus. Only on the basis of\nthis awareness and of renewed solidarity will we be able to\nsustain action aimed at achieving effective justice in social\nmatters.\nWith this approach to the future, we will be able to\naddress existing imbalances by taking shared responsibility\nfor just and civilized coexistence. In brief, it is a question\nof adopting and recognizing pluralism as an expression of\nfreedom, and justice as an essential prerequisite for security\nin the coexistence of nations.\nIn Mexico, this approach is called social liberalism.\nIt has served as a guide for the changes that we have\nundertaken to respond appropriately to the challenges of our\ntimes. A product of our history and of our shared universal\naspiration to justice, social liberalism has led us to\nundertake far-reaching democratic reform, changes in our\neconomic structures, a frontal attack on poverty, and a new\nlinkage between Mexico and the world. We are forging a\nreformed State that depends not on its size but on its\neffectiveness in achieving, with freedom, conditions of\ngreater justice.\nIn 1990 I spoke to this Assembly about the objectives\nof Mexican change. Today we have results that strengthen\nour hopes and give us a better understanding of world\nchallenges. From social liberalism comes the difficult but\ngratifying task of building new forms of political consensus\nto make progress in democracy; from it come the enormous\nefforts made to correct our macroeconomic imbalances and\nimprove the competitiveness of our country; from it too\nstems the consolidation of our Programme of Solidarity\nto benefit those who have least; from it come our efforts\nto make environmental protection a component of\ndevelopment; and from it come our economic\ndiversification abroad, our entry into organizations such\nas the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, the\nestablishment of the North American Free Trade\nAgreement and similar agreements within Latin America,\nand our membership of the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development, in which new forms of\ninternational agreement and cooperation are being\ndeveloped.\nRecently, Mexico\u2019s federal elections proved to be an\nenriching democratic experience. More than 36 million\ncitizens participated in the elections, which is to say,\nmore than 77 per cent of registered voters. They were\nthe elections most closely monitored by political parties,\nnational observers and international visitors in our history.\nThe Mexican people opted for legality and peace. Here,\nI wish to express my gratitude for the technical support\nprovided by the Secretariat of the United Nations, at the\nrequest of the Mexican Government, in training and\nadvising groups of Mexican election observers.\nToday it is no longer possible to pursue peace,\nsecurity and development as isolated goals, whether in the\ninternational order or at the national level. The new\nworld balance calls for new mentalities and new\npriorities: a reordering of international realities in\naccordance with rules agreed upon on the basis of respect\nfor the sovereignty of each nation and recognition of the\npluralities of peoples. The new vision turns differences\ninto opportunities, opposing views into dialogue and\ncooperation and demands for justice into a commitment\nof solidarity among peoples.\nOur times call for making development a priority for\nworld peace and security by encouraging global policies\nof financial coordination and free trade with clear and\nequitable rules; by recognizing nature as an ally in the\ndevelopment of each nation, and the equally shared\nresponsibility of all nations in maintaining global\nbalances; and by deploying information networks to\neffectively combat drug-trafficking and terrorism, which\nconstitute attacks on the security of all. Fundamentally,\nour times call for the uniting of all our efforts, in\ndemocracy and freedom, to reduce poverty in the world.\nOtherwise there can be no possibility of peace and no\nlasting security.\n13\n\n\nThese new imperatives express not only enormous\nneeds but also the aspiration for the equality of nations in\nthe building of a future that will hold promise only if it\nbelongs to all of us. That is the meaning of \\\"international\ncommunity\\\" as embodied in the Charter of San Francisco:\na future that no one has the right to deny to future\ngenerations.\nToday, as then, peace can be preserved only through\nthe observance of law; today, more than in the past,\nsecurity requires the greatest development of every nation,\nevery country, so that together we can make a reality of the\nhope for a common future. The United Nations - our\nOrganization - continues to be the forum par excellence for\nthe achievement of those noble goals.\n"

        "file_text": "\nSpeaking from this high rostrum of the United Nations, I\nwould like first of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to the high office of the presidency of the General\nAssembly. I am convinced that, having received such a\nhigh honour, you will be successful in your conduct of this\nforum that is so important in the life of the world\ncommunity.\nReflecting on the past, we can state with satisfaction\nthat the United Nations, by traversing the difficult road\nof overcoming political and ideological confrontation, has\nsaved humanity from a new global catastrophe. Today\nwe can say with confidence that the United Nations is a\nuniversally recognized instrument of peace and\nconstruction.\nWe commend the United Nations peace-keeping and\nhumanitarian efforts in Tajikistan. I consider it my duty\nto convey the sincere thanks of the Tajik people to the\nUnited Nations, the donor countries, the international\norganizations - in short, to everyone who is doing\neverything possible to help our State in these hard times.\nThere is no need to describe in detail all the\nhardship that has befallen our long-suffering motherland.\nThe wounds of the civil war, that serious illness of our\nsociety, cannot be healed either by surgical intervention\nor by compulsory treatment. They are healed only when\nthe victim himself becomes aware of his affliction and\nmakes the most effective use of all possible means\nnecessary for recovery.\nTo the credit of the people of my country, it should\nbe said that they were able to put an end to bloodshed,\nlawlessness and terror and start a constructive life.\nExperiencing a severe lack of time and an extremely\nheavy burden of political, social and economic problems,\nwe were able to consolidate a tendency towards the\nstabilization of the situation in our country. Today we can\nstate with confidence that the situation differs radically\nfrom that prevailing at the beginning of last year.\n1\n\n\nRecognizing its responsibility for the destiny of the\ncountry, the Government of Tajikistan firmly declared its\ncommitment to values common to all humanity and its\nresolve to start building a democratic and secular State\nbased on the rule of law. In order to realize these\nintentions we have launched the constitutional process in\nour country.\nIn the course of drafting the Constitution we were\nguided by the experience of countries with established\ndemocratic traditions and advice given by highly qualified\nexperts of the United Nations and the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). We sought to\ntake into consideration the high standards set up in the\nbasic documents of the Helsinki process so that the new\nConstitution would ensure to the fullest extent possible the\nprotection of inalienable human rights.\nWe intend to conduct a referendum so the whole\npopulation can decide on the adoption of the new\nConstitution, the results of which will reinforce hope for\nachieving further progress in the development of society\nand the State. The proposed draft Constitution will provide\na legal basis for subsequent democratic transformations and\nreforms. It will undoubtedly accelerate them and make\nthem irreversible. Furthermore, the President of the\nRepublic of Tajikistan, elected by the whole population,\nwill enforce the Constitution and guarantee the State\u2019s unity\nand integrity.\nIn our domestic policy the principal issues for our\ncountry\u2019s political leaders have become the questions of our\nnation\u2019s spiritual revival, of the halting of senseless\nconfrontation and of the creation of a social basis for\nmutual understanding and forgiveness. The solution of\nthese problems will help achieve maximum progress\ntowards national reconciliation.\nLet me describe briefly to the Assembly our view of\nthe problem. Addressing the General Assembly at its forty-\neighth session, I stated that political dialogue was the only\npossible way of untying the internal Tajik knot and\nachieving national reconciliation and that it was one of our\nhighest priorities. A careful study of the state of society,\nand of public opinion in particular, gave us the idea of\nentering into dialogue with those who have never concealed\ntheir desire to seize power by force. In doing so we used\nall possible means, including regional and international\nmechanisms. Only the good will demonstrated by the\nleaders of Tajikistan made it possible to start and to\ndevelop the negotiating process.\nThe importance of the initiatives put forward by the\nSecretary-General, the decisions of the Security Council\nand the assistance of the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe in accelerating the national\nreconciliation process should be particularly emphasized.\nWe deeply appreciate the unwavering attention of\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali to all the problems of Tajikistan, and we\ntake this opportunity to express to him our sincere\ngratitude.\nWe appreciate no less deeply the activities of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy to Tajikistan, Mr.\nRamiro Piriz-Ballon, of the United Nations Observers in\nTajikistan and of the CSCE mission. All of them have\nmade a valuable contribution to the elaboration of the\nnegotiating mechanisms.\nI would like to note with satisfaction the hopeful\nresults of the political consultations between us and the\nTajik opposition, with the mediation of Mr. Ramiro\nPiriz-Ballon, which took place in Tehran in the second\nhalf of September 1994. The parties signed the\nAgreement on a cease-fire and stopping hostile actions,\nand we consider this to be an important step towards the\nachievement of national reconciliation, peace and stability\nin Tajikistan. The Security Council and the international\ncommunity noted with satisfaction the signing of that\ndocument. From this rostrum I would like to express the\nhope that the question of dispatching United Nations\nmilitary observers to Tajikistan will be resolved without\ndelay.\nI express our gratitude to the Governments and the\npeoples of the Russian Federation, the United States of\nAmerica, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and\nother concerned parties and countries for their assistance\nin the promotion of the inter-Tajik dialogue.\nHowever, I must state with regret that there have\nbeen recurrent outbreaks of violence, initiated by the\nunmotivated escalation of the armed opposition and\nmanifested in acts of terror, taking of hostages and other\nsubversive actions. We consider these actions a deviation\nfrom political methods of resolving contentious questions\nand reconciling existing contradictions. We also see them\nas showing disregard of the international community\u2019s\nappeal to the Tajik parties to show restraint and\ncountenance no action that might impede the process of\nnegotiations.\n2\n\n\nDespite those actions, the political leaders of\nTajikistan took a series of practical steps to strengthen\nconfidence-building measures. At its twentieth session the\nParliament of Tajikistan decided to postpone the\nreferendum and the elections. The aim of this initiative of\nthe members of Parliament was to involve the widest\npossible spectrum of political forces in the constitutional\nprocess, to give everyone wishing to return home an\nopportunity to do so and to let all our compatriots who had\nthe bad fortune to be outside the country take part in the\nelections. We are using this extra time to make proper\npreparations for addressing organizational questions\nconcerning the invitation of observers from the United\nNations, the CSCE, other international organizations and\ninterested countries to the elections.\nWe reaffirm our principled position to solve existing\ncontentious questions by means of dialogue. We are\nconvinced that the opposition\u2019s reliance on force and the\ncommensurate reaction to it may cause unpredictable\nconsequences leading to the undermining of the stabilization\nprocess and of the positive decisions reached during\nnegotiations.\nAt the same time I consider it necessary to draw the\nAssembly\u2019s attention to another very important aspect of\nthis problem. It seems that the irreconcilable wing of the\nopposition is cultivating plans of expanding the\ngeographical scope of the inter-Tajik conflict by instituting\nthe use of mercenaries in the armed confrontation. This\ncreates conditions for the internationalization of the conflict,\nwhich may in turn threaten to spread the confrontation\nthroughout Central Asia. It is easy to imagine what serious\nconsequences this may have.\nSpeaking from this rostrum, I must draw the\nAssembly\u2019s attention to our anxiety over the current\nsituation in the neighbouring Islamic State of Afghanistan.\nThe world cannot remain indifferent to the situation in that\ncountry, where internecine war came to dominate social\nrelations. The Afghan conflict has brought forth a\ndangerous phenomenon: the emergence of anarchic\ngeographical units that can become a base for international\nterrorism and unpunished trafficking in weapons and drugs.\nThe situation on the Tajik-Afghan border keeps a vast\nregion in tension. Central Asia\u2019s fragile backbone of\npolitical balance may not withstand the high pressure, and\nthe destructive processes taking place in Afghanistan right\nnow may lead to a regional cataclysm. We urge that the\nAfghan problem be given the world Community\u2019s most\nserious consideration. Furthermore, we are convinced that\nthe alleviation of tension in Afghanistan will significantly\nand positively influence the solution of the inter-Tajik\nconflict. We have no doubt that the people of\nAfghanistan will ultimately achieve reconciliation and\nrestore peace to their country. We sincerely wish the\npeople of Afghanistan success in achieving these goals as\nsoon as possible.\nIn current circumstances, with many hotbeds of\ntension caused by the cold war still existing, the\npeace-keeping efforts of the world community have a\nparticularly important role. It is evident that there are\ncertain rules limiting the use of United Nations\npeace-keeping forces, which reduces the effectiveness of\nmeasures taken by the Organization in this regard.\nI would once again like to draw the attention of the\nSecurity Council and the Assembly squarely to the\nquestion of giving to the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates (CIS) joint peace-keeping forces in Tajikistan the\nstatus of a United Nations operation. The CIS countries\nare helping Tajikistan with the protection of its southern\nborders, which are at the same time the borders of the\nCommonwealth. In this regard we recognize the special\nand leading role of Russia, which has been and remains\nthe guarantor of stability and security for all Central\nAsian States. We do not believe the presence of the CIS\npeace-keeping forces in our country contradicts the\ndecisions of the Security Council or the initiatives of the\nSecretary-General aimed at achieving peace in Tajikistan.\nMoreover, from our point of view, these forces are the\ndecisive factor in deterrence and in overcoming a state of\ncrisis on the Tajik-Afghan border. Taking a wider view\nof this problem, one might even see the outlines of a new\nconcept of security for the whole of Central Asia. We\nstill hope the Security Council will find it opportune to\nreconsider our initiative to call a special meeting of the\nCouncil to consider the situation in and around Tajikistan,\nas well as the question of giving the CIS joint\npeace-keeping forces the status of a United Nations\npeace-keeping force.\nThe tragedies of the peoples of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Rwanda, Somalia and the hot spots in the\nCIS all give evidence of the fact that the danger of\nnuclear catastrophe has been replaced by civil conflicts\ncaused by international, religious or ethnic differences and\nthat their recurrence is becoming the primary problem for\nthe world community.\nI should like to say a few words on the question of\nthe proposed reform of the Organization. On the whole\n3\n\n\nwe support the idea of expanding the Security Council.\nSuch a step, on the one hand, would reflect the global\nchanges taking place in today\u2019s world and, on the other\nhand, would give an opportunity to achieve a more\nbalanced representation in the Council.\nThe emerging consensus on the need to enlarge the\nnumber of seats in the Security Council will probably\nimprove the efficiency of this central body of the United\nNations. In other words, the Council will enhance its\npotential, acquire more dynamism, increase the variety of\ndecisions it takes and generate a wider spectrum of ideas.\nThe world is diverse and is thus unique. Its diversity,\nhowever, does not preclude the process of integration. A\npraiseworthy example is Europe. A better future for\nmankind is apparently based on these kinds of processes.\nTajikistan as a member of the world community sees\nthe future of its development in the integration processes on\nvarious levels, in cooperation with neighbouring and distant\ncountries, regions and international organizations.\nThe activities of the CSCE have proved to us the\nefficiency of such cooperation. Its informal approach to the\naccelerated integration of Tajikistan into the international\ncommunity and the realization of the mandate of the CSCE\nMission to Tajikistan will undoubtedly be among the major\nfactors in the achievement of national reconciliation in our\ncountry. To a considerable extent we rely upon CSCE\nassistance to enhance democratic institutions and create a\nsociety founded on the rule of law and on the basis of high\nstandards that will provide universal human rights and\nfreedoms for every citizen. While carrying out active\npreparation for the upcoming Budapest summit meeting, we\nhope to put forward at that important forum our view of the\nproblems and to define the areas of cooperation.\nUndoubtedly for us the question of participation in the\nCommonwealth of Independent States is vital.\nOur present position is that independence and\nsovereignty is not a sword but is rather the shield of a\nnation that must be strong but not heavy. Independence\nshould not burden human lives but on the contrary should\nmake everybody\u2019s life easier and give all people on Earth\nthe opportunity to be equal. Principles of independence and\nsovereignty in the current period of history must be flexible\nand diverse, for the main goal is to ensure that people who\nused to have deeply rooted historical ties now have an\nopportunity for a wider realization of their economic and\nspiritual potential in the interests of future generations.\nIt is precisely in this light that we consider the\ndevelopment of the Commonwealth of Independent States\nthat is trying to find a mutually acceptable form of\nintegration without harming national interests. Despite\nwell-known difficulties the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States pragmatically searches for ways to\nrationalize all mechanisms of interaction among its\nmembers.\nI am convinced that the leadership and the people of\nStates members of the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates have by now recognized the truth that it is\nunrealistic to expect that, alone, a country can expect to\nsolve the task of renewing society and of carrying out\nreforms. We are facing the historical reality of building\nour future by cooperative and coordinated efforts.\nIn the post-Soviet period, Russia - a permanent\nmember of the Security Council - has assumed a heavy\nburden and responsibility for peace-keeping on a greater\npart of the territory of the former Soviet Union. We note\nwith deep satisfaction that these supreme efforts of Russia\nhave started to bring results. The multinational nation of\nTajikistan highly appreciates and welcomes the\npeace-keeping activities of Russia.\nI should like to note in this context that the ideas of\nconcluding a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, of\nadopting the decision on the Non-Proliferation Treaty\u2019s\nopen-ended and unconditional extension, of developing\nregional programmes to strengthen peace and security,\nand other proposals put forward by Mr. Boris Yeltsin,\nPresident of the Russian Federation, in his address to the\nforty-ninth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly and aimed at strengthening international\nsecurity, all deserve the broadest support.\nTajikistan notes with gratitude the initiatives by\nUzbekistan to bring about a peaceful solution to the intra-\nTajik conflict and to ensure security and stability in the\nregion of Central Asia.\nWe highly appreciate our good-neighbourly relations\nwith the States of Central Asia. We hope that the sphere\nof their integration efforts will expand in the interests of\nall countries of the region of Central Asia. They deserve\ncareful study and support.\nNowadays it is universally recognized that alongside\npolitical questions, problems of social and economic\ndevelopment have assumed the same importance and\nurgency. The correctness of this statement is confirmed\n4\n\n\nby the conclusions reached at the end of the high-level\nEconomic and Social Council segment, that we support and\napprove. It is our firm conviction that the main aim of\nrestructuring the United Nations should be to preserve and\nincrease its potential to solve the whole range of\ndevelopment issues.\nFor the Republic of Tajikistan which has found itself\nin the hard grip of a transitional period aggravated by the\nconsequences of tragic events in recent years, the problem\nof economic survival has become a critical test. According\nto the \\\"development indicators\\\" data published by the\nWorld Bank, Tajikistan has been included in the group of\ncountries with the lowest level of per capita income.\nToday Tajikistan badly needs the help of the\ninternational community, not only to restore its economy\nbut also to create the conditions for long-term development.\nOur country, which is a land-locked State, is counting on\nspecial attention from the international community in\nmatters of economic and social development, and hopes that\nits appeal to include Tajikistan in the group of least\ndeveloped countries will be properly understood and\nsupported by the United Nations community.\nI assure Members that the highest objective for the\nleaders of the Republic of Tajikistan is the achievement of\nvalues common to all humanity, calmness and peace in our\nRepublic, the creation of a unified, peaceful, developed\nState of Tajikistan. And I hope that all countries of the\nworld will help us to achieve this noble objective.\nEighty years ago the fire of the First World War broke\nout, and very soon - in a few months - humanity will mark\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World\nWar. These dates will forever be inscribed in the history\nof the twentieth century, in the history of the world. Still,\nthe dates themselves are not as important as the lessons\nwhich these events have taught us.\nThe bitter experience of the Second World War\npersuaded the leading Powers of the necessity to create an\ninternational organization the aim of which would be the\nmaintenance and enhancement of peace all over the world.\nThe main achievement of the United Nations during the\nalmost 50 years of its existence has been saving humankind\nfrom the fire of a new world war, and its development has\ntaken place on the basis of enhancing mutual understanding\nand cooperation, taking into account the interests of all\nparties, and the equality of large and small nations in the\nname of preserving our planet for future generations.\nNow, at the end of the twentieth century, it gives us\ngreat hope that the world community will not only\nprevent the outbreak of a third world war but will do its\nbest to make sure that the twenty-first century will\nbecome a period of creativity and calm on the whole\nplanet.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish first to\nextend to Foreign Minister Essy and the people of the\nRepublic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire congratulations on his election to\nthe presidency of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. I pledge to him my delegation\u2019s full support as\nhe carries out the weighty responsibilities of his office. In\nwelcoming him and wishing him well in his stewardship of\nthe momentous work of this Assembly, I recall that he\nreplaces in this important office a son of my own\nsubregion, the Caribbean. Ambassador Rudy Insanally of\nGuyana served the presidency of the General Assembly\nwith distinction, and I thank him for demonstrating the\nability and talent of the Caribbean people.\nThe Caribbean people, their aspirations in the global\ncommunity and the place of the United Nations in their\nconsideration are at the heart of the presentation that I will\nmake here today. Thirteen years ago my country was\nadmitted to this body as an independent Member State. As\nForeign Minister at that time, I said to this Assembly:\n\u201cI represent a people living in the reality of\nunderdevelopment. I am before you as a\nrepresentative of the wretchedness that is the residue\nof colonialism, a wretchedness which includes\nunemployment and underemployment, inadequate\nhousing and insufficient medical facilities.\n\u201cAnd yet, despite our condition, my people are\npart of mankind\u2019s universal relationship; by our very\nexistence we are intertwined in the destiny of all\nhumanity. In that sense, regardless of the wealth of\nsome men, mankind will never be rich while we\nremain disinherited. dislocated and disenchanted.\u201d\n(A/36/PV.53, pp. 22 and 23-25)\nSince I spoke those words in this Assembly, there has\nbeen little action by the developed nations to help alter\nthese conditions in my country. Indeed, they have done\nlittle in the Caribbean as a whole. If anything, the terms of\nour involvement in international economic relations have\nworsened as prices for our commodities have decreased, the\ncosts of our imports have increased and our access to\npreferential markets has diminished. At the same time, our\ncalls on the conscience of the rich countries to be mindful\nof the conditions that fracture the economic and political\nstructures of our society seem to fall upon deaf ears. This\nbody knows well that the targets set within the United\nNations itself for official development assistance are met by\nonly a handful of nations.\nToday the Caribbean subregion occupies the\nattention of the international community because of events\nin Haiti. Eleven years ago it was events in Grenada that\ncatapulted the Caribbean into the consciousness of global\nconcern. In both cases what drove our subregion onto the\nagenda of international deliberation was not a remedy for\nthe conditions that precipitated crises in these countries,\nbut a desire by some to curtail a threat to security\ninterests \u2014 security interests that were defined, in large\nmeasure, by their own domestic considerations. It seems\nthat unless the Caribbean is perceived to pose a threat to\nlarger and more powerful States, we remain no more\nthan, on the one hand, picture postcards of white sand\nbeaches and swaying coconut trees, an idyllic playground\nfor tourists, and, on the other, a forgotten backwater of\nhuman and economic underdevelopment as represented by\nthe world-wide television pictures of today\u2019s Haiti.\nYear in, year out, the underlying problems that\nafflict our economic and human condition and that lend\nthemselves to the crises that we witnessed 11 years ago\nin Grenada and are witnessing today in Haiti go unnoticed\nand unattended. Yet in eight months\u2019 time we will mark\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the United\nNations Charter, a Charter that proclaimed that we are\ndetermined\n\u201cto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\nand small, and ... to promote social progress and\nbetter standards of life in larger freedom.\u201d\nBut can this body truly say that in almost 50 years\nit has overseen the promotion of social progress and\nbetter standards of life of nations large and small?\nBetween 1980 and 1988 real gross domestic product per\nperson in Latin America and the Caribbean steadily fell\nby an annual average of 0.9 percent. In some States real\nincome dropped by as much as one quarter during the\n1980s. With very few exceptions, most countries now\nhave per capita gross domestic products lower than those\nof a decade or even two decades earlier.\nDespite this decline in real gross domestic product,\nmany countries in our region are forced to repay debt that\nis wrapped tightly around their necks, strangling their\nefforts to breathe life into their economies. Mark you,\nthis is debt that they have repaid many times over if the\nonerous interest rates are discounted. Yet they are able\nto see little reduction in the sum of the debt. In the\nmeantime, the massive haemorrhage of foreign exchange\n15\n\n\noccasioned by this intractable debt burden seriously\nhampers the long-term social and economic prospects for\nsome of our States.\nFor example, debt servicing in the case of Jamaica is\nbetween 14 per cent and 16 per cent of export earnings; a\nrecent World Bank report suggests that 70 per cent of\nGovernment revenue in Guyana will be consumed this year\nby debt servicing repayments while as much as 43 per cent\nof the population lives in poverty. In my own country\u2019s\ncase, debt has been incurred by the Government acting as\na catalyst for economic development in the absence of\nsufficient official development assistance or private\ninvestment flows despite generous incentives. Our arrears\nhave been rising even with debt repayment and now amount\nto more than $200 million.\nThis burden of debt upon small countries calls for a\nchange in the rules of the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF) and the World Bank to allow for the forgiveness of\ndebt. It also urges a relaxation by Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries\nin particular of their position on bilateral debt. If our\ncountries are to maintain political stability and promote\neconomic progress, we need relief from the great burden\nthat debt places upon us.\nIt is significant that, as the IMF and World Bank mark\nthe fiftieth anniversary of their establishment this week,\nprivate aid agencies, led by the Oxford Committee for\nFamine Relief (Oxfam), have accused them of undermining\nthe relief of poverty, of making people poorer and giving\nshort-term economic aims, such as the reduction of\ninflation, higher priority than the reduction of poverty.\nOnly a few would today deny the need for drastic\nreform or the dismantling of State bureaucracies in favour\nof private investment and more open economies, but the\nstructural adjustment which this entails should do more than\npay lip-service to the challenges of providing better\neducation and health facilities in developing countries. The\nmultilateral financial institutions, and the major Powers\nwhich control them, must become less ideologically\ninflexible and more alert to the deleterious effect of some\nof their policies on poor States.\nIt is a startlingly telling measure of the wide\ndivergence of views between developed and developing\ncountries that this week developing countries rejected out\nof hand a proposal by major Powers in the IMF on ways to\nincrease world monetary reserves.\nThere is an urgent need for urgent, meaningful and\nsincere dialogue between representatives of the rich and\npoor nations to bridge this gap in consultation and\nconsensus-building. If such a dialogue does not begin,\nand begin soon, we may well witness a stand-off in\nrelations that will paralyse economic cooperation and\nprogress on a global scale.\nI urge that within the institutions of the Organization\nitself \u2014 specifically within the Economic and Social\nCouncil and the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) \u2014 such a dialogue should\nbegin with the resolve of reaching a practical programme\non which both rich and poor have agreed.\nIf the Organization and its Member States fails to act\nto promote such a dialogue I fear that it will reinforce the\nview that the United Nations is captive to the dictates of\nthe rich, and powerless to respond to the needs of the\npoor.\nWe in the developing countries of the Caribbean\nurgently need to develop our human stock and to widen\nthe space of economic opportunity; to provide more of\nour young people with better education; to provide\nfacilities that will keep our populations healthy and\nproductive; to provide incomes that will encourage our\npeople to save and to convert such savings into low-\ninterest loans for productive enterprise; and to concentrate\non exports and undertakings such as tourism to earn\nforeign exchange.\nIf we are to tackle this task effectively, the yoke of\ndebt in particular must be eased from our backs. It is not\nbeyond the international community to set standards to\nachieve both repayment of debt and an easing of the\nburden of such repayment. To do so, two standards\nshould be set. The first is on the extent of forgiveness of\nexisting debt.\nDebt forgiveness should be a minimum of 50 per\ncent of existing debt, the original principal of which, as\nI pointed out earlier, has long been repaid. Forgiveness\nof 50 per cent of debt is the only figure that makes any\nsense. A lower percentage would simply make realistic\nrepayment unachievable unless we were to impoverish our\ncountries even further.\nSecondly, the international community should also\nestablish a standard to set a fixed percentage of export\nrevenue for the repayment of debt. Without a standard,\nindebted countries will face the prospect of worsening\n16\n\n\npoverty for decades to come. We should recall that the\nprecedent of debt forgiveness was set by two members of\nthe Security Council, Britain and the United States. In\n1946 the terms of a large United States loan to war-torn\nBritain stipulated that interest should be waived altogether\nshould such interest exceed 2 per cent of British export\nrevenues in any given year. That standard helped Britain\nto survive. We ask for no more.\nWorsening poverty has grave implications for\ndevelopment and democracy in our region \u2014 implications\nwhich, in the long term, may cost the multilateral financial\ninstitutions and their wealthier members more than the debt\nthey could forgive, or cause to be forgiven, in the short\nterm.\nAmong these implications is the problem of refugees.\nWe should recall that apart from large-scale violence,\ndifficult economic circumstances are what creates refugees.\nRefugees are not only those people who clamber on board\nboats and take to the open sea hoping to reach an\naccommodating shore where economic conditions are better.\nThey are also people, many highly qualified, who\nreluctantly leave their homelands, illegally settling in other\ncountries in search of jobs and better living conditions.\nThe migration of such people causes problems both for the\ncountries from which they move and the countries which\nreceive them. In the case of the receiving countries,\nincreasing numbers lead to destabilizing immigration\npressures, particularly in inner cities. For the sending\ncountries vital skills are lost, skills that could contribute to\nthe social and economic development of the sending\ncountries.\nEven at its summit meeting in January 1992, the\nSecurity Council acknowledged that threats to international\npeace and security can come from\n\u201cnon-military sources of instability in the economic,\nsocial, humanitarian and ecological fields\u201d. (S/23500,\np.3)\nIn this regard, preventive measures need to be taken by the\ninternational community, led by this Organization, to\nmitigate root causes of emigration. Among such preventive\nmeasures must be action to guarantee stability in developing\ncountries.\nWe in Latin America and the Caribbean are not simply\nsitting on our hands in the expectation that our fortunes will\nsomehow be dramatically altered by a sudden change of\nheart on the part of the richer States of the world. Within\nthe Caribbean subregion, the member States of the\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) are working at\ndeepening our integration arrangements to explore ways\nin which we can strengthen our economies by our own\nefforts. The measures we have adopted, such as a\ncommon external tariff and open markets, have been\ndifficult for some of us in the short term, but we have\ntaken the medicine, bitter though it is, in the expectation\nthat in the medium to long term we will have created a\nstronger subregional economy, one capable of sustaining\nus all. We have also looked beyond the insular Caribbean\nto the wider Caribbean, including every country of the\nlittoral.\nI am proud to say that on 24 July this year, 25\nStates of the Latin America and the Caribbean region\nestablished the Association of Caribbean States (ACS).\nIts objectives are economic integration and the creation of\nan enhanced space for free trade and cooperation among\nthe countries of the Caribbean. We expect that one of the\nmajor benefits of the ACS will be the promotion of the\ninterests of our grouping in international economic and\ntrade forums. These actions, which we ourselves are\ntaking, are part of the set of preventive measures to\nguarantee stability in our region.\nIt is a tribute to the commitment of the people of the\nCaribbean to the processes of democracy that we have not\nwitnessed greater upheaval and that in 11 years the\nUnited Nations has had only two new crises from our\nsubregion with which to deal. The international\ncommunity should not assume, however, that the crisis in\nHaiti arose only from internal factors. Much of its\ngenesis resides in the attitude of major international actors\nmotivated by their own domestic concerns.\nHaiti\u2019s independence in 1804, born of the uprising of\nblack slaves against the colonial Power, caused it to be\nostracized from the world community. When Toussaint\nLouverture led his successful revolt, Haiti was the richest\ncolony in the world, producing more and trading more\nwith Europe and the United States than the rest of the\nCaribbean colonies combined. But the hostile\ninternational environment in which it was born reduced it\nfrom the richest colony in the world to the poorest nation\nin the Western Hemisphere.\nThe price for its limited participation in international\ntrade was an agreement in 1825 to pay its former colonial\nmaster an indemnity of 150 million gold francs in six\nannual instalments. As the respected historian and former\n17\n\n\nPrime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Mr. Eric Williams,\nput it,\n\u201cThus was imposed on the infant independent State a\nheavy financial burden which effectively crippled\ndevelopment of its social services.\u201d\nSince then, international actors have continued to\ninfluence events in Haiti, accommodating in their own\ninterests dictatorial regimes and military Governments and\nignoring the country\u2019s growing poverty and the utter\ndisregard for human rights. Is it any wonder that Haitians\nrisked their lives in the most dangerous conditions on the\nopen sea to become refugees?\nIn this context, let me digress for a moment to take\nthe opportunity to call upon the United States and Cuba to\nopen a dialogue to end the impasse that has characterized\ntheir relationship for the past 30 years, threatening the\nstability of Latin America and the Caribbean. Recently\nthose two countries demonstrated in this very city their\ncapacity to sit at the table of peace and negotiate an\nagreement to end the movement of so-called refugees from\nCuba to the United States. Surely the capacity to reach\nsuch an agreement shows that other agreements are\npossible. The willingness of the United States and Cuba to\nact now in their own interest would avert not only the\ncontinued hardship the Cuban people endure, but would\neliminate any perception of threats to their individual\nsecurity and the security of our region as a whole.\nMy small country agreed to provide a safe haven for\nHaitian refugees, just as we agreed to contribute one eighth\nof our small military force to the multinational expedition\nauthorized by Security Council resolution 940 (1994). We\ndid so out of genuine concern for the lives of many\nthousands of Haitian people. We did so because we wanted\nto see an end to their suffering. We did so because we\nwanted to stamp out the cancer of dictatorship and human\nrights abuse in our subregion. As it turned out, our\nmotivation to bring order and justice to Haiti coincided with\nthe motivation of others who have the resources to commit\nto the military undertaking, which became imperative after\ndiplomatic efforts, especially by representatives of the\nUnited Nations itself, had been fully exhausted.\nBut while Antigua and Barbuda supports the objectives\nof Security Council resolution 940 (1994) and the use of\nforce contemplated in it to remove the C\u00e9dras regime in\nHaiti, I am still troubled by the increasing resort to Chapter\nVII of the Charter as a basis for acting to end conflicts\nwithin a State. Since the end of the cold war the Security\nCouncil has had to invoke Chapter VII, which provides\nfor \u201cAction with respect to threats to the peace, breaches\nof the peace, and acts of aggression\u201d, in relation to Iraq,\nLiberia, Somalia, the former Yugoslavia and, now, Haiti.\nIn each of the countries where the Security Council\ntook action, there was clearly a need for humanitarian\nintervention. My Government supports the growing body\nof opinion that holds that the international community\nmust not remain a passive spectator when Governments\nmassacre their own people or cause them to starve. In\nsuch cases the United Nations must act, and should be\nallowed to do so under the Charter, without having to\nresort to Chapter VII.\nTherefore, it is my view that the nations of the\nworld should amend the Charter of the Organization to\nconfer power on the United Nations to intervene in cases\nwhere humanitarian intervention is warranted. But in\ndoing so they absolutely must balance safeguarding\nhuman rights with protecting a State\u2019s right to autonomy.\nWe must all be mindful that respect for State sovereignty\nis a fundamental cornerstone of the international legal\norder. Intervention for humanitarian purposes must not\nbe capable of use for violating the sovereignty of States\nin pursuit of the interests of any member of the Security\nCouncil.\nAs co-Chairman of the Commission on Universal\nGovernance, Sir Shridath Ramphal said recently:\n\u201cAn activist United Nations will not long survive as\na legitimate andeffective actor if it is used simply as\na cover for the intervention of major Powers.\nIntervention should follow principled criteria and\nshould be consistent and even-handed. Above all,\nintervention should not be unduly influenced, much\nless determined, by the interests or domestic political\nagendas of powerful nations acting within a region\nor globally.\u201d\nIn this connection, and particularly if we pursue the\nnotion of amending the Charter to provide for United\nNations-authorized humanitarian intervention, the\nmembership of the Security Council itself must be\nrevisited to change the anachronistic nature of the Council\nand make it more representative of the nations of the\nworld.\nNo State or group of States can proclaim the\noverarching importance of democracy, nor can any nation\nor group of States claim to intervene in another State in\n18\n\n\nthe interest of upholding democracy, if that nation or group\nof States is unwilling to democratize the Security Council\nitself. The time has come to move away from the\nanachronism of five permanent members and to establish\narrangements which are capable of change with the passage\nof time and the evolution of events. The time has come for\nequity for all nations \u2014 large and small \u2014 in the\nmembership of the Council.\nI return now to the point at which I started \u2014 the role\nthat the United Nations has played in the almost 50 years\nsince the Charter was signed \u201cto promote social progress\nand better standards of life in larger freedom\u201d.\nFor much of its existence the Organization was\nhampered by the cold war and the struggle for supremacy\nbetween the major Powers. Witnessing events and\nresponding to them through this prism of cold-war rivalry,\nthe United Nations has not been as effective as it could\nhave been in defining a world, strong in the pursuit of order\nand justice, where States could live in peace and the rule of\nlaw would replace the law of the jungle.\nDuring the greater part of the life of the United\nNations, the strong have dictated to the feeble, the big to\nthe small, the mighty to the weak. While there has been\norder, it has been without justice and without equity. In\nthis context, while the United Nations has been a symbol of\nhope for people from small countries such as mine, much\nremains for it to do before it can represent to them an\norganization which champions their dignity and worth as\nhuman beings, which upholds the rights of their small\nnations, which promotes their social progress and better\nstandards of life.\nAs the United Nations approaches its fiftieth\nanniversary no longer shackled by the cold-war rivalry of\nthe major Powers as it looks to the future, it has an\nextraordinary opportunity to fulfil the aspirations of the\nCharter which have so long remained mere words. In\ndoing so, it can advance the interests of all mankind by\nproviding a meaningful forum for genuine dialogue between\nthe rich and poor for the establishment of conditions for\ndevelopment, and thus, for peace.\nAs the Secretary-General has himself pointed out:\n\u201cIt must be remembered that the sources of\nconflict and war are pervasive and deep. Political\nstability is not an end in itself; it is a prerequisite for\neconomic and social development. The inseparable\nlinks between peace and development must be\nacknowledged and fully understood because the\ndeterioration of economic and social conditions can\ngive root to divisive political strife and military\nconflict.\u201d\nThe end of the cold war should encourage a\nreformed, refreshed and representative Security Council\nto look beyond conventional security to security born of\npolitical stability and economic progress for all nations \u2014\nlarge and small. My own small country is willing to do\nits part. It is my hope that the larger, richer and more\npowerful States Members of this Organization can\nrecognize the need \u2014 and act on it \u2014 to apply\ndemocratic principles to their relations with poor States\nby contributing to the creation of a world free from the\nthreat of military and economic pressure, a world strong\nin the pursuit of equity and justice for all, a world in\nwhich the United Nations is cast in a pivotal role as a\npowerful mediator for good in the interest of all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish, first of all,\nto warmly congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session,\na responsibility he will discharge effectively with the\nproven diplomatic skills with which he has served his\ncountry and his region so well. I take this opportunity also\nto applaud the good work and leadership of his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, who presided over\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nIt is appropriate that on the eve of the fiftieth\nanniversary of this Organization we enter a new era in\ninternational relations, an era untainted by the cold-war\npolitics that held peace and positive change hostage for too\nlong. Opportunities now abound for change and lasting\npeace. This new era demands that all Member States take\na global view of how the Organization can best meet the\nobjectives set out in the Charter.\nPresident Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin\ndemonstrated this new hope for peace at the opening of the\ngeneral debate, when both addressed the General Assembly\non the same day instead of on consecutive days, as was the\nold practice. In a spirit of cooperation, these two world\nleaders described their intent to reduce their nation\u2019s\nstockpiles of nuclear and other weapons of mass\ndestruction. But disarmament must start from the heart.\nAnd I hope that this is the case with the step these two\nPresidents have taken towards the betterment of all\nhumankind.\nToday, we would recall that peace and hatred come\nfrom within people - the mirror of a nation, the image of a\nregion and the living treasure of the global community. In\norder to build a peaceful and safe world for future\ngenerations, our resolve to reduce nuclear and other\nweapons of mass destruction must lie within the hearts of\nour leaders and policy makers throughout the world. We\nmust therefore seize this opportunity and work together to\nbuild a better world.\nIn this regard, Solomon Islands welcomes the\nvarious peace initiatives that continue to bring hope to the\nworld community. The noble efforts of President\nMandela to chart a new direction for South Africa must\nbe commended. In his first address as the first President\nof the new democratic South Africa, President Mandela\nacknowledged the efforts of the international community\nin this way:\n\\\"The universal struggle against apartheid and its\nfinal dismantlement was not an act of charity arising\nout of pity for the majority of South African people\nbut an affirmation of our common humanity.\\\"\nProgress towards a lasting peace in the Middle East\nhas renewed the hope of the international community for\nstability in that region. The parties involved in these\nnegotiations deserve our sincere acclaim and praise and\nour continuing support. Replacing guns with meaningful\nhandshakes often takes leaders beyond their physical\nnature and leads them to resort to their spiritual\nmindsets - a dimension that is often ignored but which is\nan essential ingredient in a recipe for conflict resolution.\nThe cease-fire in Northern Ireland has changed\npeople\u2019s perception of the impossibility of the simple\nreality of living without guns and bullets. These are\ntelling achievements for our times, and their roots are\nembedded in the human spirit of love and kindness.\nDespite United Nations interventions to restore\nintra-State and international peace and security, the world\nis still riddled with trouble spots and endangered by\nhuman-induced threats such as the potential impact of\nclimate change and sea-level rise. We witness with\nhorror the human suffering in Rwanda, Somalia, Angola,\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and Haiti. Solomon Islands\ncalls on the parties concerned to lay down their arms and\nresort to non-violent means of negotiating peace. True\nand real peace has to spring from within the warring\nparties, replacing animosity.\nClose to home in the Solomon Islands is the five-\nyear-old crisis on Bougainville, a province of Papua New\nGuinea. It spilled over into Solomon Islands and caused\n15\n\n\na rift between the two countries. Nevertheless, through a\nprocess of mutual dialogue between the National\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea and the Bougainville\nRevolutionary Army, several important agreements have\nbeen signed. These include the Honiara commitments to\npeace, the cease-fire agreement and the historic\npeace-keeping agreement on Bougainville. The role of the\nSolomon Islands Government in this conflict has been\nconciliatory, facilitating peace negotiations amongst the\nparties concerned. Solomon Islands supports the\nBougainville Peace Conference, expected to be convened on\n10 October. This reflects our commitment to restoring\npeace and normalcy on Bougainville.\nSolomon Islands pledges its support and commitment\nto the ideals of the United Nations. We believe it to be the\nonly world body capable of maintaining world peace and\nsecurity. Solomon Islands shares the views of New\nZealand\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign\nAffairs and Trade, the Right Honourable Don McKinnon,\nwhose statement at the general debate provided six\nimportant management issues that should be addressed\nwhile conducting United Nations peace-keeping operations.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that all of us want an\neffective United Nations - an Organization that meets the\nobjectives it sets out to achieve, an Organization whose\nCharter is valid because its actions are reliable.\nSolomon Islands welcomes the current initiatives\nundertaken by the Secretary-General in reforming the\nOrganization and supports proposals made by other\nMember States for further reforms. These reforms, in our\nview, must also reflect the needs of small island developing\nStates such as my own, particularly the need to remove \\\"the\nfloor\\\" to enable Member States to meet their financial\nobligations. Some want to pay their assessed annual\ncontributions but do not have the capacity to do so; hence\na relative and fair formula should be worked out.\nIn his report (A/49/1) on the work of the Organization,\nthe Secretary-General has identified peace, the economy,\nthe environment, justice and democracy as the five\ninterlocking pillars of development. These will provide the\nfoundations for the kind of development that will ensure\nhuman progress.\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" paved the way forward from\nthe dark ages of the cold war; the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development was a\nreawakening initiative to save planet Earth; the Second\nWorld Conference on Human Rights sought to establish\nuniversal rights for all peoples throughout the world\nirrespective of race, creed, political affiliation or sex; the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\nsaw the need to control the soaring world population,\nwhich now stands at 5.7 billion; and next year the World\nSummit for Social Development and the World\nConference on Women will address poverty,\nunemployment, social integration and the empowerment\nof women to take their rightful place in society. These\nare efforts of Member States committed to the noble\ncause of securing a peaceful, safe and sustainable world\nto live in. To achieve these noble goals, an effective\nglobal partnership is of paramount importance.\nTechnology has made the world\u2019s smaller economies\nbecome more interdependent.\nAgenda 21, the outcome of the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development, made a\nspecial case for small island developing States because of\ntheir peculiar vulnerabilities. The response to this call\nwas the convening of the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates in Barbados in April this year. The passage from\nRio to Barbados, at least for small island developing\nStates, was a Programme of Action outlining national,\nregional and international actions. Our collective support\nis needed to implement this. If we agree that\ndevelopment takes many forms and requires different\nresponses, then our task will be made easier if we act\ntogether. Solomon Islands fully supports the Barbados\nProgramme of Action and calls on the members of the\ninternational community to honour their commitments as\nspelled out in Agenda 21. The successful implementation\nof the Programme of Action will depend on these\ncommitments.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nin his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" report to the Security Council,\nstressed that cooperation with regional arrangements and\norganizations could be of great benefit to Member States\nif their activities were consistent with the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter and governed by the provisions\nof Chapter VIII. Some of those bodies have already\ngained observer status at the United Nations. This shows\nthe useful role these arrangements and organizations can\nplay in international affairs. Therefore, the strengthening\nof regional arrangements and organizations that are\nworking closely with the United Nations is a critical\nissue.\nIn this regard, Solomon Islands strongly supports the\ndecision by the South Pacific Forum to seek United\nNations observer status at the forty-ninth session of the\n16\n\n\nGeneral Assembly. We acknowledge with gratitude the\nrole of Australia, the current Chairman of the South Pacific\nForum, in guiding this initiative through the United Nations\nsystem on the Forum\u2019s behalf. We thank Member States\nthat have expressed support for this call and invite others to\ndo likewise.\nAs a member of the South Pacific Forum and the\nMelanesian Spearhead Group, Solomon Islands endorses the\nForum Communiqu\u00e9 issued following the meeting of the\ntwenty-fifth South Pacific Forum held in Brisbane,\nAustralia, this year. We are a party to the Joint Declaration\non Economic and Trade Cooperation signed in Solomon\nIslands this year between Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and\nSolomon Islands. Solomon Islands calls upon the\ninternational community to support our regional\narrangements and organizations from which our strength for\ncollective action is derived and which are responsible for\nour flow of communication.\nForestry and fisheries resources remain my country\u2019s\nmain income earners. The Solomon Islands Government is\ngravely concerned about the unsustainable utilization and\nmanagement of these resources and has taken steps to\nensure sustainable harvesting and conservation measures\nand to form a national policy. We are party to Agreements\nreached in Brisbane at the meeting of the South Pacific\nForum to cooperate on a wider basis in order to ensure\nsustainable development of fisheries and forestry resources\nin our region. Because of the fragility of our ecological\nsystem, our biodiversity resources, including forestry and\nfisheries and other marine living resources, are threatened.\nIt is heartening to note that after 12 years of\nnegotiations the world will witness the coming into force of\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in\nNovember this year. However, we strongly feel that further\ncooperation is still needed from the distant water fishing\nnations regarding sustainable harvesting of straddling fish\nstocks and highly migratory fish stocks, including\nnon-targeted species. We therefore urge distant-water\nfishing nations to come to grips with the need to complete,\nas soon as practicable, negotiations on a legally binding\nagreement on proper conservation and management and\nsustainable utilization of high seas fisheries resources.\nEducation is a priority sector in my country. It is a\nkey to the effective management of my country\u2019s natural\nresources as well as a means of achieving the advancement\nof women to take their rightful place in society. There is\na direct link between the education of women and\npopulation control. We welcome the outcome of the Cairo\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\nand look forward to the World Conference on Women, to\nbe held in Beijing in 1995.\nThe World Summit for Social Development also has\nprofound implications for capacity-building, institutional\nstrengthening and the transfer of technologies and their\nappropriate use. Human-centred activities, including\ntourism development and skills training, are important for\nthe development of human resources. We endorse the\n1994 Human Development Report of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for its emphasis on\nhuman-centred development, an approach that has positive\nripple effects in solving other social problems.\nDrug trafficking and the criminal activities\nassociated with it worry us in the Pacific, and we are not\nalone in this. We need international cooperation to stop\nthe movement of illegal drugs from one region to another.\nSolomon Islands supports the South Pacific Forum\nposition that the non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) should be\nextended indefinitely. However, we would like to see\nfirm commitments from the nuclear-weapon States to\nshow the world a leadership role in reducing their\nstockpiles. We also wish to see a rigid review\nmechanism set up to be a safeguard instrument as an\nintegral part of the indefinite extension agreement.\nIt is encouraging to hear the United States, the\nRussian Federation and China speak in support of the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty and the comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty. It is hoped that a level of harmony between the\nNPT, the comprehensive test-ban treaty and the cut-off\nconvention may be maintained to enhance the elimination\nof weapons of mass destruction in an integrated manner.\nSolomon Islands urges the post-Forum dialogue\npartners that have not yet done so to ratify the South\nPacific nuclear-free zone Treaty. Nuclear testing in the\nPacific is not part of our vocabulary.\nConsistent with our belief in a nuclear-free world,\nwaste dumping in the Pacific Ocean is not to be\nencouraged. We strongly oppose those who may violate\nthis natural rule. We also firmly oppose the\ntransshipment and transboundary movement of plutonium\nin the South Pacific region.\nWe need to see some further movement towards a\nspeedy implementation of the Matignon Accords. In this\nregard, we request the Government of France and the\n17\n\n\nterritorial authorities to increase their efforts to achieve real\neconomic and social rebalancing.\nSolomon Islands welcomes the move to formulate an\nagenda and proposals to promote trade and investment\nbetween the United States and the Pacific Islands, which\nwill be the subject of a meeting at the East-West Centre in\nHawaii later this year.\nApart from the other vulnerabilities that plague small\nisland developing States, the potential impact of climate\nchange and rising sea levels poses a great threat to Pacific\nislands. There is overwhelming scientific evidence pointing\nto the danger we now face.\nIn this regard, Solomon Islands supports the Alliance\nof Small Island States, which has submitted to next year\u2019s\nConference of the parties to the Convention on Climate\nChange an additional protocol aimed at securing a reduction\nof the emission of greenhouse gases to the 1990s level by\n2005, a protocol to which the industrialized countries would\nbe obliged to be parties.\nWe in Solomon Islands firmly believe that the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan has much to contribute to the\nwork of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in\nterms of international cooperation and development. This\nRepublic, with a population more than 58 times that of my\nown country and highly technologically advanced, deserves\nto be admitted as a Member of the United Nations. The\nfull participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the\nimportant work of the United Nations would be an\naffirmation of the Charter and of democracy and a\nmanifestation of the human spirit\u2019s pursuit of a better\nquality of life for humankind. In my Government\u2019s view,\na move as noble as the admission of the Republic of China\non Taiwan would be not an obstacle to reunification, but a\ncatalyst in the process. In our view, the Secretary-General\nshould use his good offices to encourage the establishment\nof a committee specifically to facilitate and/or work\nprogressively towards the re-entry of the Republic of China\nto membership of the United Nations.\nPresident Ernesto Samper Pizano of the Republic of\nColombia, speaking from this podium, described Colombia\nas\n\\\"a country searching for peace because it so loves\nlife.\\\" (Official Records of the General Assembly,\nforty-ninth session, Plenary Meetings, 5th meeting, p.\n8)\nWe in Solomon Islands, too, love life very much, and our\nsearch is for a better quality of life, which should flow\nfrom the wise and sustainable development of our\nresources.\nCollectively, however, our search must be for world\npeace so that we can live up to our dreams, visions and\nGod-given potential. I believe that the answer to the\nproblem of bringing about world peace lies in our own\nhearts, not in the barrels of guns or military might. Here,\nin this great world Assembly, let our hearts enkindle a\nnew torch to shine on the new path to world peace, from\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and beyond.\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the United\nNations General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. May\nI also express our appreciation to Ambassador Samuel\nInsanally of Guyana for having successfully guided the\nwork of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session\nand further enhanced its centrality.\nThe cold war has ended, and totalitarianism has met\nits nemesis. At this very critical stage in history, we must\nseize the opportunity to redesign the international order so\nas to realize the aspirations of the global community. We\nmust meet this challenge and collectively reconstruct a truly\njust order for our time and for the generations to come.\nIndeed, the global community has reached many\nsignificant milestones. More nations have agreed to resolve\ntheir disputes by peaceful means. South Africa has\nemerged from its political catharsis as a nation free of\napartheid and with majority rule; Cambodia experienced\nfree and democratic elections; and lasting peace in West\nAsia came closer to realization with the Israeli-Palestinian\naccords.\nHowever, the initial euphoria will be somewhat\nshort-lived. The path ahead is strewn with uncertainties\nand pitfalls. The end of the cold war has yet to reward\nus fully with its promise of global peace and security. It\nhas instead unleashed the demons of parochial\nnationalism, tribalism, religious fanaticism \u2014 as\nwitnessed in the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in Bosnia \u2014 tribal\nwarfare in Rwanda and religious dissension in some\ncountries. The North-South divide in wealth, power and\ncontrol over resources is still too pronounced to be\nignored, and the redistribution of global prosperity is far\nfrom being realized.\nThe paramount challenge facing the global\ncommunity today is to fulfil the promises made in recent\nyears of systemic change in the global environment. This\nis to be achieved through sustained efforts in regard to\neconomic development and through the strengthening of\ncivil society and multilateral institutions.\nDevelopment is the only secure foundation for global\npeace and security, for the origins of conflicts are often\nvery deeply rooted in socio-economic deprivation and\ndisparities. As for civil society, its growth into maturity\nrequires the establishment of institutions for a stable and\nresponsive social order, a democratic participatory\narrangement as a means to channel political energy, and\nan environment in which culture can flourish.\nIn all these areas, it is the people that matter \u2014 their\nfreedom, security and development. All great traditions\nof mankind, East and West, concur in the sanctity of the\nhuman person, the family as a fundamental unit of\nsociety, and the primacy of moral and ethical values as a\nfoundation of civilizations. The sanctity of the human\nperson warrants the State\u2019s protection of the inalienable\nrights of all to freedom, to participate in social, political\nand cultural processes and to optimize the potential of the\nhuman person through development. The rights of the\nindividual must be safeguarded inasmuch as the stability\nof society cannot be compromised. It is within this\nframework that we conceive the restoration of human\nrights in any society, industrial or developing, as a\ncontinuing endeavour which we must never abandon.\nThe promise made at the 1992 Rio Summit remains\nunfulfilled. If no increased official development\nassistance is forthcoming and the international target of\n12\n\n\n0.7 per cent is not met, this will represent a serious\nreneging on the Rio commitments, notwithstanding the\nGlobal Environment Facility.\nThis will raise questions as to the commitment of the\nNorth to pledges made at major conferences. The World\nSummit for Social Development will take place next year,\nand what will be the value of assiduously negotiated\ndocuments when, as with the Rio Agenda 21, no real means\nare provided for their implementation? The recent\nInternational Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting at\nMadrid highlighted the preoccupation of the major\ndeveloped countries, often at a tangent from the needs and\nrequirements of developing countries.\nAt the Rio Summit, the developed countries declared\nthat the tropical forests belonged to the whole world. It\nwas maintained that these forests must always remain in\norder to maintain biological diversity and sustain ecological\nbalance. Today, South-East Asia is covered in thick haze,\nadversely affecting the health of the people. Hundreds of\nthousands of hectares of virgin forest are burning, and\nvaluable species are being lost.\nIf indeed the tropical forest is the heritage of mankind,\nthe responsibility for its protection must necessarily be\ncollective. While the South-East Asian countries will take\nthe necessary measures, we appeal to the global\ncommunity, especially the richer members, to help us put\nout this fire on an urgent and priority basis.\nWe regard the issue of global population as\ninseparable from the overall concern of development.\nReductions in fertility mainly come about from investment\nin education and health care for women. While we share\nthe fundamental objectives of the Conference on Population\nand Development in Cairo, we deplore the attempt to\nimpose views without regard for the values of others.\nThe peace dividend that we aspire to reap will not be\nrealized without sustained growth in the global economy.\nHowever, growth prospects are often hampered by short-\nsighted policies and structural crises within the industrial\neconomies. Viewed in this light, the popular call for\nmacroeconomic stabilization should not be confined to the\ndeveloping countries alone but instead should encompass\nboth the developing and the industrial economies.\nThe United Nations will soon commemorate its fiftieth\nyear of existence. It would be uncharitable to ignore\naltogether the outstanding contributions made to humanity\nby this world body and its agencies. It has provided a\nplatform for international cooperation in the fields of\neducation, law, health, culture, economics, refugee relief\nand so on. But more significantly, it has, by its very\nexistence, prepared the groundwork for a global order that\nwould be truly democratic and multicultural.\nHowever, as we draw up the balance sheet of that\nera and contemplate the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury, we must take into serious account our many\nlimitations. Clearly, the United Nations as it exists today\nis unable effectively to deal with critical global issues. In\nthe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina the Security Council\nremains paralysed in the implementation of its own\nresolutions. Should we also ask then: if the Council was\nready to plunge into the Gulf crisis a few years ago, how\ncan that be reconciled with the political timidity and clear\nabsence of resolve to take effective action in the case of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, even after the rejection of the\nso-called peace plan by the Serbs?\nWithin the United Nations itself, the peace-keeping\noperations decided on by the Security Council provide no\nclear institutional structure for consultation, especially\nbetween non-Security-Council member troop-contributing\ncountries and Security Council members. Yet the major\nPowers are resisting the urgent need for regular\nconsultations between the Security Council and troop-\ncontributing countries.\nWhile the situation in Somalia clearly reflected the\nneed for some form of United Nations involvement, if not\nintervention, there have been other operations where even\ncountries in the region have been totally opposed to\nUnited Nations involvement. My delegation, which has\nbeen deeply involved in United Nations peace-keeping\noperations, is concerned about operations which serve\nquestionable interest groups.\nIn the Security Council, while agreement between\nthe Permanent Five has removed obstacles and facilitated\nsettlements of disputes, the momentum behind the push to\nsolve issues, if not properly checked and balanced by a\nprocess of accountability and non-selectivity of issues,\nmay prove to be the undoing of the Council itself and of\nits moral authority. The role of major Powers, at least\nthose that still deserve that status, is explicitly recognized\nin the Charter of the United Nations. However, many of\nus will not be willing to agree that these Powers should\ncontinue to be Charter-privileged to intervene wherever\nthey wish and only when their own interpretations of\npeace and security warrant intervention.\n13\n\n\nReform of the Security Council is necessary to reflect\na more equitable geographical representation and towards\nmaking the Council more accountable to the general\nmembership. Resistance from a few, whose own claims to\nbeing major Powers are becoming increasingly\nunpersuasive, should not be allowed to stand in the way of\nchange. The issue is not one merely of enlarging the\npermanent membership but is one of enhanced participation.\nAs the Council is unrepresentative, the first step towards\nreform must be to increase the numbers of non-permanent\nmembers. The veto, a creation of the power politics of the\npast, must be part of the total reform of the Council.\nThe United Nations still represents the best recourse\nfor developing countries to advance their interests in global\naffairs. Hence, we cannot allow the present uncertainties\nabout the structure and role of the United Nations to remain\nunresolved. The United Nations, despite financial\nproblems, cannot be allowed to become a mendicant of the\npower brokers at the expense of the principles of the\nCharter.\nThe United Nations is the only institution capable of\nproviding the vehicle for a comprehensive and integrated\napproach to peace and development. A revitalized\nEconomic and Social Council has the potential to\ncoordinate and, it is hoped, harmonize policies emanating\nfrom separate bodies such as the G-7 and the Bretton\nWoods institutions. In this regard priority must be\naccorded to an Agenda for Development which would\nprovide the new framework for international development\ncooperation, the basis for a truly global partnership.\nThe United Nations must also spearhead the struggle\ntowards total and complete nuclear disarmament. The\nmajor Powers must not slacken the momentum towards\neffective non-proliferation and comprehensive test-ban\ntreaties, critical to our collective resolve to halt the arms\nrace and eliminate the utilization of weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nMalaysia is prepared to make an early commitment to\nthe goals of true globalism and, with a genuine mechanism\nreposing in the United Nations, to a new world system for\ninternational peace, security and development. We will\ncontinue to participate actively in the work of the\nmultilateral system.\nInternational society has grown fourfold since 1945.\nThe world is heterogeneous and multicultural. Meaningful\ndiscourse cannot be limited by the narrowness of\nparameters or an overbearing sense of cultural supremacy.\nWe must strive to overcome and transcend\nunproductive polarizations. We all need to purge\nourselves of the arrogance and myopia embedded in the\nold mind-set. We must learn to honour diversity of\nopinion and the multiplicity of world views and\nperspectives on life and society. None the less, they must\nnot impede efforts to seek and implement genuine\nsolutions for our common good and shared problems.\nWe must accept the new realities, particularly the\nfar-reaching systemic transformations in the global\neconomy. The growing economic strength of East Asia\nand the newly industrializing countries will invariably\nbring about a new equation of power and responsibility in\nglobal affairs.\nWe are fully aware of the many shortcomings\ninherent within East Asia; its remarkable economic\nperformance is far from miraculous. Nevertheless, its\nexperience portrays the path of change towards the\nqualitative search for excellence. Political stability was\nappropriated to garner efforts for economic growth which\nultimately became the means to empower the people. Its\nstrength, as in the case of Malaysia and other South-East\nAsian countries, is to accept and to experience the\nproposition that development and democracy are not\nmutually exclusive; and the exercise in responsible liberty\nby the ordinary people and their participation in public\nlife does not necessarily result in social indiscipline and\npolitical instability. Development is enriched by\nmulticulturalism where the practice of tolerance and\nmoderation has turned religious and ethnic diversity from\nbeing a source of conflict into an ingredient for success.\nIn a world torn by ethnic and religious passions and\ncultural prejudices, the experience of South-East Asia in\nmulticulturalism may provide some clues for devising the\nmeans for peaceful coexistence and productive partnership\namong citizens of the global village.\nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, when reflecting on the state of\nthe world almost 40 years ago, was perhaps less\nexuberant than we are at the prospects of globalism.\nWith the memory of war still fresh, he said:\n\u201cWe must serve our apprenticeship and at every\nstage try to develop forms of international\ncoexistence as far as is possible at the moment.\u201d\nThat apprenticeship has now been served. The\nUnited Nations must innovate and renew itself to address\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. It must\nprogress and transform itself from being a theatre for the\n14\n\n\nconcert of a few powerful nations into an effective and\nrepresentative vehicle for global governance. And, beyond\nthat, it must be animated by the spirit of justice and a bias\ntowards compassion. In short, the very legitimacy of this\ninternational body hinges upon its realizing the ideal of\nbecoming the conscience of the global community.\n"

        "file_text": "My congratulations, Mr.\nPresident, on your election to this high office. You are\nwell known in United Nations circles and your election is\na tribute to your country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and to you.\nMay I also congratulate Ambassador Insanally and\nthank him for his great contribution. We are proud that a\nfellow member of the Commonwealth has served the\nUnited Nations with such skill and distinction.\nIt gives me great pleasure to welcome South Africa\nback to the General Assembly. We have long admired\nthe courageous leadership of President Mandela in his\ncountry\u2019s struggle for freedom. He now faces equally\ngreat challenges in rebuilding South Africa. We wish\nhim success.\nI must also congratulate the people of Palestine on\ntheir courage and vision in signing the historic Peace\nAgreements. The people of Palestine also face the\nchallenge of putting their painful past behind them and of\nbuilding a peaceful and prosperous future. To succeed\nthey will need the support of the international community\nand the United Nations.\nIn our region the people of Cambodia are also\nstruggling to build a new future. The United Nations\nplayed a crucial role in Cambodia, but some obstacles\nremain. My country supports the efforts of King\nNorodom Sihanouk and his Government to rebuild and\nreunite Cambodia. We wish them success.\nThe end of the cold war has placed economics at the\ntop of the international agenda. The challenge is how to\nincrease economic cooperation through more trade and\ninvestment. The world now needs a stable international\nenvironment to allow this to happen. We must resist the\ntrend towards protectionism. Instead, we must encourage\nand reward those who liberalize and open up their\neconomies.\n\n\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies can\nhelp in this. But the end of the cold war has stretched the\nresources of the United Nations. Bosnia, Rwanda, Somalia,\nHaiti and other trouble areas are consuming much of the\nlimited financial and manpower resources of the United\nNations, and this has reduced its role in promoting\ndevelopment. It is tragic that problems of development are\non the back-burner. This is not the fault of the United\nNations. The United Nations can do no more than its\nMembers are willing to do.\nOne way to reduce the drain on United Nations\nresources is for regional organizations to work with the\nUnited Nations in accordance with Chapter VIII of its\nCharter. We may not have fully used the potential of\nChapter VIII. As the Secretary-General has pointed out,\nregional arrangements can help to reduce the burden on the\nUnited Nations. The United Nations takes the primary\nresponsibility for international peace and security, but\nregional organizations such as the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) can reduce its load through\npreventive diplomacy and regional economic cooperation.\nThey can complement the United Nations.\nOf course, there are many regional organizations;\nevery region has its own. But not all of them work. If we\nare to realize the potential of Chapter VIII, we need fresh\napproaches to regional arrangements. Regional\norganizations must be realistic in their goals. They have to\nbuild a framework for cooperation which suits their\nconditions.\nASEAN, of which Brunei is a member, has achieved\nsome success. ASEAN offers one possible vision of\nregional cooperation and development. We do not have set\ninstitutions and legal undertakings, as does the European\nUnion. Our aim is more modest. We seek to foster a\nculture of cooperation. Through consultation, consensus\nand cooperation, we have been able to contain, resolve or\nreduce our differences. We have concentrated on working\ntogether for our common interests. This is a process of\nenlarging a set of shared values. Since ASEAN was\nformed in 1967, its members have evolved an informal\nstyle of sorting out their differences. Cooperation is not the\nresult of formal agreements but comes from a strong sense\nof common purpose.\nWe are not without our problems. Most ASEAN\ncountries have unresolved territorial questions with one\nanother. Sensitive questions of ethnicity, culture and\nreligion are often involved in our relations with each other.\nWe do not deny the existence of these issues, but we\ncontinue to work together wherever we can. Differences\namong us do not stop cooperation for mutual benefit.\nIt is wiser for regional organizations to start with\nless ambitious goals. It took ASEAN a quarter of a\ncentury, from 1967 to 1992, to establish habits of close\ncooperation and consultation. Only after this was\nachieved did ASEAN feel confident enough to take the\nsignificant, though modest, decision to set up an ASEAN\nFree Trade Area (AFTA) within 15 years from 1992. We\nare now discussing how we can speed up AFTA and\ncomplete it within 10 years.\nWe have also formed a number of growth triangles\nstraddling the adjacent territories of three or more\nmember countries. We are all members of the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC), an\norganization for economic cooperation and trade\nliberalization, which will give greater opportunities to all.\nBecause of such cooperation and the general stability of\nthe region, trade and investments have greatly increased.\nAll ASEAN countries are industrializing rapidly, with\nhigh growth rates.\nI offer these comments on ASEAN in the hope that\nthey can contribute to discussions that will strengthen the\nUnited Nations system. ASEAN is well aware of its own\nlimits and limitations. ASEAN does not exist in a\nvacuum. We could not have succeeded without a\nfavourable international environment.\nASEAN is not an alternative to the United Nations.\nWhere ASEAN succeeded, as in Cambodia, it was\nbecause we worked with the major Powers within a\nframework defined by the United Nations. Otherwise, we\nwould have failed. We will and must continue to work\nclosely with the United Nations. All regional institutions\nneed the over-arching framework of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations, and particularly the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, must retain primary\nresponsibility for international peace and security.\nNo regional organization can succeed if it shuts itself\noff from the world. Our goal is an ASEAN of all South-\nEast Asian countries. We are gradually creating what can\nbe loosely described as a culture of peace and security in\nSouth-East Asia. We hope to extend it by linking up with\nother regional organizations in the Asia-Pacific region.\nASEAN wants to engage all the major Powers in a\npattern of constructive relations throughout the Asia-\nPacific region. The ASEAN Regional Forum, inaugurated\nin Bangkok in July, brings together all major and middle-\n2\n\n\nsized Powers - the United States, Japan, the European\nUnion, China, Russia, Canada, Australia, South Korea and\nNew Zealand - in a common framework. We want the\nUnited Nations and all major Powers to associate\nthemselves with ASEAN\u2019s Treaty of Amity and\nCooperation.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is\napproaching. It is an appropriate occasion for us to rethink\nhow we can strengthen the United Nations system to enable\nit to face successfully the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury. I offer my comments in the spirit of contributing\nto our common goal of strengthening an open world that\nwill benefit all countries.\n"

        "file_text": "I warmly congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Your\nelection is a tribute not only to you personally but also to\nyour great country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. I am confident you\nwill carry forward the high tradition set by your\npredecessor, Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, to\nwhom we owe our deep appreciation.\nThe untiring efforts of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to renew, reform and\nrevitalize our Organization deserve our special tribute.\nAs we stand at the threshold of the United Nations\nfiftieth anniversary, one goal remains paramount, namely,\nthe need to promote human development and human\nsecurity in all its manifold aspects. The role and\nrelevance of the people are enshrined in the very first\nwords of the Charter. People form the key link that bind\nour global society, the source of democracy, the object of\nhumanitarian concern, the spirit of justice in ensuring\nhuman and minority rights. They are the cause and\nobject of all our endeavour.\n8\n\n\nToo often, people have been ignored, to our peril. As\nwe see the stricken faces of men, women and children\naround our world, the dead, the brutalized, the frightened\nand dispossessed, the hungry, diseased and despairing, this\nlesson is dramatically brought home by the media. And yet\nour sense of purpose and achievement is ennobled as we\nwitness the new light of hope dawning in South Africa, the\nMiddle East, Cambodia and in many other States and\nsocieties where the painstaking process of peace, democracy\nand development take root and where solutions are\ncharacterized with a human face.\nIndividuals find identity in nations and nations derive\ncognition in universalism. The success or failure of the\nUnited Nations stems from the contribution each Member\nmakes to promote its goals. The Organization\u2019s principal\nmotivation arises out of the responsibility borne by each\nnation for the stability and welfare of its own people. It is\nthe sum total of these individual efforts that marks the\nUnited Nations measured progress towards maintaining\npeace, securing justice and realizing the Charter prerogative\nof \u201csocial progress and better standards of living in larger\nfreedom\u201d.\nThe limitations of Governments are also painfully\nevident. International cooperation has become an\nimperative, not only because it is possible or necessary, but\nbecause it is indispensable in a world that has moved from\ninteraction to interrelationship to interdependence.\nAs we seek to seize opportunities and confront\nchallenges at every level \u2014 individual, national or\nglobal \u2014 we are deeply aware of the contradictory forces\nat work, forces that emanate from both within and without\nour nations. The way we channel these forces into\nproductive activities will determine the success of our\ncommon endeavour to forge a just and stable world order.\nOn the positive side, ideological walls have tumbled,\ndemocracy has spread worldwide, more caring and\nresponsible Governments have come to power and\neconomic empowerment and social imperatives have\nlessened reliance on military culture. Pragmatic cutbacks\nin strategic weapons and a heightened focus on the\ndestabilizing capabilities of conventional weapons have\nopened doors for more productive use of human, financial\nand material resources. Historic political changes in the\nMiddle East and South Africa and political settlements in\nAsia and Central America can have a far-reaching positive\nimpact on those regions.\nAfter a long period of stagnation the global economy\nis poised for its first significant expansion. The\nsuccessful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the\ncreation of the World Trade Organization as a universal\nforum for trade negotiations and the settlement of disputes\nhave brightened prospects for increased trade and long-\nterm growth. More importantly, the desire and ability of\ndeveloping countries to contribute to the growth of the\nworld economy and help to mitigate common global\nconcerns as participants and not as bystanders has\nsignificantly increased.\nYet, negative impulses everywhere challenge peace\nand security, democracy and human rights, economic\nprogress and social cohesion. Together, they call for a\nconcerted response, nationally and internationally, that is\nnew and imaginative. Today, issues of territorial security\nare being overshadowed by concerns over human security.\nThere is increasing recognition of non-military threats to\nsecurity. Nation States are under siege from multiple\nforces from within and without that are retarding their\ncapacity to act effectively and independently.\nWithin States resurgent micronationalism and\nfactionalism based on narrow self-interest, ethnic and\ncultural rivalries, bigotry and extremism have contributed\nto unprecedented human misery. Political instability has\nfuelled economic breakdown, and economic backwardness\nhas fired political upheaval in a never-ending vicious\ncircle. Poverty, unemployment and social exclusion\npushed by the population explosion, rapid urbanization,\nenvironmental degradation and a crisis in values, together\nwith rising expectations, have led to social dislocation,\nalienation and sometimes violent confrontation.\nDemagogues, political separatists and fringe elements are\nbeing encouraged and supported by powerful external\ngroups to challenge the capability and legitimacy of\nGovernments to sustain socio-economic reform, peaceful\nprogress and political stability.\nNew global forces have emerged that no State acting\nalone can control but which threaten the legitimacy of all\nStates. Pollution, ecological damage, the spread of\ncommunicable diseases and the massive speculative\ntransfers of monies by electronic means have been the\ncause and manifestation of a host of cumulative ills.\nThese have been exacerbated by corrosive new threats \u2014\norganized crime, drug lords, traffickers in women and\nchildren, arms smugglers, money launderers and\nterrorists \u2014 that eat into all societies, vitiating values and\ncrippling development. Furthermore, rapid technological\nprogress and transnational processes are reducing the\n9\n\n\nscope of nation States to act on their own, to regulate\ndomestic policies and the international movements of\ngoods, services, labour and capital.\nOn another plane, fears are surfacing that the bipolar\nworld of the past 50 years could now assume a new\nconfiguration, a North-South polarity, not between opposing\npolitical and social systems but between rich and poor\nnations. Anxiety is increasing in the South that its interests\nare being marginalized; that there is a diversion of\nresources away from the South; that its potential to act as\na partner in revitalizing the world economy is being ignored\nand new constraints, aid conditionalities, rigid adjustment\nmeasures, standards of human rights and good governance,\nenvironmental criteria and military scrutiny are being\nselectively imposed. There are signs that, while social and\nenvironmental issues are being highlighted, vital economic\nand development imperatives are being sidelined, although\nboth are integrally related and mutually reinforcing.\nIndeed, there is a crisis in development policy, which\nmanifests itself in stagnation, absence of dialogue,\nselectivity and insufficient interest, participation and\ncommitment.\nIt is against the backdrop of those prospects and\nproblems that I now turn to the position and priorities of\nour Government. There is strong recognition in Bangladesh\ntoday that to promote representative and constitutional\ngovernment, strengthen human rights and ensure socio-\neconomic emancipation a country must increasingly depend\non itself. Individual self-reliance must be bolstered by\ncollective self-reliance through South-South cooperation in\nconcrete and practical areas of cooperation such as food\nproduction, manpower planning, trade, investment and joint\nventures. The critical catalyst, however, remains a\nreactivation of a constructive North-South dialogue leading\nto a more conducive external environment that can\nsupplement individual efforts.\nReaching out to the attainment of these goals,\nBangladesh has a development policy that embraces a\nfourfold perspective: addressing structural and\nmacroeconomic reform; stimulating the market economy;\nincreasing the quality and amount of productive\ninvestments; and concentrating on human-resources\ndevelopment, particularly the empowerment of women.\nThese perspectives are all linked together by the unifying\ntheme of the alleviation of poverty. The cardinal emphasis\nis on the connection between structural adjustment and\nalleviation of poverty \u2014 that is, the quantity and quality of\nprogrammes favouring the needs of the poor and most\nvulnerable.\nOur efforts at reform and consolidation have led to\nsome positive results. Bangladesh is enjoying today\nperhaps the longest period of macroeconomic stability in\nits history. The budget deficit has been reduced. Imports\nand exports have increased. Foreign-exchange reserves\nare comfortable, inflation is at an all-time low, and there\nis increased self-reliance in financing our annual\ndevelopment plans. Today we are financing 38 per cent\nof our development projects from our own resources. We\nhave achieved near self-sufficiency in food production,\nand the overall gross-domestic-product growth rate has\nreached 5 per cent. The incidence of absolute poverty\nhas decreased and some headway has been made in\nadvancing our human-development policy.\nWe can reasonably be proud of our efforts to\nstabilize population growth and contain and mitigate the\nimpact of natural disasters. A concerted and determined\nfamily-planning programme has yielded positive results.\nPopulation growth has fallen from 3 per cent to\n2.03 per cent, accompanied by progress in reducing\nfamily size; declining infant, child and maternal mortality\nrates; and expansion of the immunization programme to\ncover 74 per cent of all children.\nWe believe that the recent successfully concluded\nCairo International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment has strengthened our efforts in dealing with\nthree critical, interlinked issues \u2014 namely, a holistic\napproach to development, of which population policies are\nbut one essential element; informed choice in accordance\nwith the laws and culture of each society; and the vital\nissue of garnering and allocating additional resources.\nPreparedness and planning for disasters helped us\ncontain the consequences of the devastating cyclone of\n1994 without recourse to outside help. Bangladesh was\nable to save countless lives by timely evacuation of\nhundreds of thousands of people and to get on with\nrehabilitation and reconstruction measures on its own.\nDemocracy has taken firm root in Bangladesh. Like\nall democracies we have our share of domestic\ndifferences, but we remain fully committed to working\nout our differences through democratic dialogue and the\nrule of law. Fragile democratic institutions and traditions\nin new democracies need strong and sustained\ninternational support. Our experience has demonstrated\nvividly that without improved standards of living and a\nvision of the future that can sustain hope, democracy will\nwither. Equally, without people\u2019s participation the\npotential for socio-economic progress cannot be achieved.\n10\n\n\nIt is also clear that, to survive within States, democracy\nneeds to be sustained through democratization among States\nso that it can expand universally as an essential foundation\nfor cooperation. We firmly believe that the restoration and\nconsolidation of democracy worldwide within States and\namong States is a vital bed-rock for peace.\nWe are indeed happy that the 1993 World Conference\non Human Rights, in Vienna, upheld the right to\ndevelopment as a basic human right and as a vital catalyst\nin mutually reinforcing the interrelationship of democracy,\ndevelopment and human rights. Widespread poverty and\neconomic deprivation seriously vitiate the protection and\npromotion of human rights in many societies, despite the\nbest of intentions. These realities need to be recognized for\na realistic evaluation of human rights in developing\ncountries.\nFor national efforts to succeed, it is essential to create\nan atmosphere of peace within our own region. Bangladesh\ncontinues to sustain the momentum and viability of the\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation\n(SAARC), not only to promote its fundamental socio-\neconomic mandate but also to create a more receptive\nclimate for broad-based confidence building, to reduce\ntension in the region and to contribute to the resolution of\noutstanding differences through dialogue and negotiation.\nA major endeavour of Bangladesh, as the current\nChairperson of SAARC, has been to consolidate\ncooperation between members so that they may, in the\nwords of our Prime Minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, turn into\npartners of development to combat poverty in the region\nand meet the most important challenge to security from\nhunger, disease, ignorance and prejudice. The Prime\nMinister stated that the options of unilateralism and\nbilateralism might seem tempting in the short run but in the\nlong-term interests of the SAARC spirit we need to display\nmore commitment for multilateralism and for building a\nbetter regional consensus.\nBilaterally, we have taken important steps to strengthen\nconstructive relations with all our immediate neighbours in\npursuit of our policy of friendship, cooperation and peaceful\ncoexistence with all countries of the world. The exodus of\n250,000 Myanmar refugees to Bangladesh since 1991 has\nimposed an enormous socio-economic and environmental\nburden on our country. The rate of repatriation is still\nslow, and we hope that with the policy of mass registration\ncarried out by the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) the pace of\nrepatriation will pick up and all the refugees will return to\ntheir country.\nThere has been some improvement in our relations\nwith our largest neighbour, India, on the issue of the\nreturn of Chakma refugees and on that of economic\ninteractions. However, the critical issue of sharing\nGanges waters remains unresolved. Meanwhile, one dry\nseason has followed after another without any water\nflowing to the Ganges and this is having a cumulatively\ndisastrous effect on the economy and environment of one\nthird of our country and on the socio-economic survival\nof 40 million people. We earnestly hope that India, our\npartner in the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation and our neighbour, would agree to a fair\nsharing of common rivers, including the Ganges. We\nhope our common friends would recognize the\nimplications of the situation and encourage the support of\nan early and equitable solution.\nNational efforts in the absence of global cooperation\nhave only limited prospects of improving the human\ncondition and ensuring peace, justice and development.\nRecognizing this fact, we are engaged in perhaps the most\ncomprehensive exercise ever undertaken to streamline our\nOrganization, to reform and restructure its main organs\nand, together, to forge a more meaningful agenda, one\nthat is action-oriented, cost-efficient and adequately\nfunded. The Secretary-General has set the stage with his\nproposals put forward in An Agenda for Peace and in An\nAgenda for Development. The structure and shape of this\nworld agenda that is leading us into a new century has\nbeen given more refined substance by a variety of\nconcentrated suggestions: the outcome of world\nconferences and the follow-up to them, making possible\nlegislation and new and innovative proposals. They form\na continuum that is closely integrated and interrelated.\nBangladesh has been an active participant in this\nconcerted build-up. Certain key imperatives strike us as\nparticularly important. The end of the cold war should\nnot mark the end of competition to support development\naround the world. The global society is only as strong as\nits weakest link. The world cannot prosper if the poorest\ncontinue to decline. Peace and development are\nintrinsically interlinked, and peacemaking and peace-\nkeeping must go hand in hand with peace-building.\nResolving social issues must be based on the\nrecognition of the centrality of the individual, the\nacceptance of human equality, and the worth and dignity\nof the human person. Yet social development is\npredicated on progress in economic development.\nTogether with environment and population, it forms the\nlogic of comprehensive sustainable development. These\n11\n\n\nare not separate concerns, but integrated within a composite\nwhole. The core of development and its main impetus will\nremain accelerated economic growth fuelled by the input of\nadditional resources and by resource generation.\n\nThe growing divide between rich and poor among and\nwithin nations is of central concern. The plight of the least\ndeveloped countries assumes special poignancy at a time\nwhen the world economy has yet to show convincing signs\nof recovery, macroeconomic coordination is weak and\npoverty is inexorably deepening. The unabated\ndevelopment crisis calls for urgent remedial action,\nespecially to implement quickly the 1990s Programme of\nAction for the Least Developed Countries. A proper\nresponse to these problems requires accelerating growth,\nwriting off debts, wider and preferential access of exports\nto markets of developing countries markets, enhanced flow\nof foreign direct investment and supportive action in the\narea of services and labour.\nThe phenomenon of widespread and increasing\nunemployment and underemployment in both developing\nand developed countries needs to be addressed as a matter\nof urgency. Today, even food availability is determined by\naccess to employment and financial resources. Rectifying\nthe situation of jobless women and combating poverty\namong women are major priorities.\nReducing damage to the ecosystem and mitigating the\nconsequences of natural disasters continue to be a great\nburden for all concerned. Unchecked consumption of\nresources, production patterns triggered by developed\ncountries and the real plight of the poor need to be dealt\nwith through remedial action rather than analysis.\nThere has been an increase in the movements of\npeople across borders as migrants, persons seeking asylum,\nrefugees or displaced persons. Much closer introspection\nis required to analyse and solve this crisis. A key factor\nwould be the promotion of socio-economic development\nand the protection of migrants.\nStrengthening the rule of international law is\nimperative, inasmuch as it offers certainty, predictability\nand the assurance of the legitimate interests of all States.\nThis continues to be the only real protection for smaller and\nweaker States, especially in areas where the absence of law\ncan mean a serious potential for conflicts such as the\nscarcity and sharing of water, maritime jurisdiction,\ntransboundary pollution and environmental damage, and\nso on. In this context, we welcome the entry into force,\non 16 November 1994, of the International Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea.\nA critical yardstick for all these concerns is the issue\nof limited resources and the need for new and additional\nresources. At the heart of the matter is the need for a\ncommitment to enhance the entire development cause\nrather than particular interests. It calls for balancing\nlong-term interests that will not only address continuing\nemergencies and immediate conflicts but will face up to\nthe underlying silent crisis of development.\nThe absence of peace in our world is a continuing\nreality. It is manifest in an immense array of conflicts,\nno two of which are alike. They call for solutions that\nmust be adapted to widely differing circumstances in new\nand creative ways. Past, present and potential conflicts\nhaunt us. Many nations bear the burden of recent\ndevastation and ethnic strife. No one is safe from the\nthreat of nuclear overkill and nascent nuclear\nproliferation. The ongoing arms race, the potential of a\nreturn to antagonistic spheres of influence, and the threat\nof regional hegemony all carry within them the dangers\nof conflict and destabilization. Yet today, the real heart\nof our concern is the recognition that any viable solution\nmust be directed towards promoting development as a\nfundamental impetus for, and long-term measure of,\npeace.\nAmong Bangladesh\u2019s major priorities are the\nfollowing.\nFirst, of key importance is the preservation of the\nsecurity of smaller and weaker States and the\nstrengthening of the rule of law. The enhanced role and\ncontribution of the International Court of Justice now\nassumes much greater relevance.\nSecondly, the reduction of military expenditures is\nessential for development and peace. Escalating arms\nexpenditures continue to consume too large a share of\nproductive resources and capacities. From 1987 to 1992,\nthe cumulative peace dividend resulting from reduced\nmilitary expenses and cut-backs in arms amounted to\nsome $500 billion in both developed and developing\ncountries. Little of this dividend was channelled into\ndevelopment. Reduced reliance on military security must\nalso be buttressed through monitoring, regulating and\nlimiting the growing traffic in arms, especially the\nclandestine arms trade.\n12\n\n\nThirdly, regional efforts and regional disarmament are\nvital imperatives to stabilize peace. Regional groups can\nand must harness durable structures of stability at the base,\nthrough confidence-building measures and broad-based\nsocio-economic cooperation. For the first time, in the wake\nof the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(CSCE) process, Asia has begun to look hard at steps\ntowards Asian security. The United Nations Centre for\nDisarmament Affairs has initiated over the past five years\na vital process of dialogue and interaction that has opened\nup useful prospects and potential. These provide an\nanalytical base that strongly supports the goal of promoting\nregional security arrangements under Chapter VIII of the\nCharter.\nDisarmament and arms control are the major vehicle\nto reduce the threat of destabilization, economic decline and\ntensions leading to war. A new momentum has been\ngenerated that needs to be pushed and sustained. Progress\ntowards negotiating a comprehensive nuclear test ban, the\nsigning of the chemical weapons Convention, the\nestablishment of a Register on conventional arms \u2014 these\nare important milestones on this road. A strengthened\nnuclear non-proliferation regime has gained in significance\nwith important advances in nuclear disarmament. A critical\nconcern is the objective of extending the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty (NPT) either indefinitely or for limited periods,\ncontingent on progress on the other objectives of the\nTreaty, nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear\ntechnology. Bangladesh is committed to support the\ncontinuation and strengthening of the NPT, and we look\nforward to actively participating in the 1995 review and\nextension Conference.\nBangladesh has purposefully contributed to United\nNations peace-keeping efforts, and stands proud of its\nrecord as the fourth largest contributor of troops, dispersed\nover 10 conflict areas. We strongly add our voice in\nconcert with those who seek to make peace operations a\nmore effective instrument of collective security and to\nenhance the structural framework for performing and\nmanaging peace-keeping, including strengthened staff,\nstronger logistic capability and greater coordination,\nstandardization and support for training.\nIn the formulation of critical follow-up guidelines to\nstrengthen peace-keeping we would like to pinpoint the\nfollowing matters.\nFirst, there is a need to define clear-cut mandates with\ndefinite time frames, objectives and rules of engagement\nand with secured financing. This must keep in view the real\nconstraint identified by the Secretary-General, that\ntraditional assumptions relating to the consent and\ncooperation of parties, upholding of agreements and\nminimum use of force have all been under challenge in\nrecent peace-keeping developments.\nSecondly, there is a need for impartiality, full\ntransparency and continuous consultations with troop-\ncontributing countries so that mandates can be constantly\nreviewed, updated and amended. The role of the General\nAssembly must be enhanced in this regard.\nThirdly, there should be clear-cut political directions\nand a clearly defined command and control structure for\neach operation.\nFourthly, contributions to peace-keeping operations\nare mandatory and arrears must be paid in full.\nResources for peace-keeping should not be at the expense\nof resources for development activities of the United\nNations.\nFifthly, decisions on peace-keeping operations should\ninclude provisions for the safety of personnel, appropriate\nstandardized compensation of all personnel and timely\npayments.\nIntimately connected to the process of peace-building\nin both its political and economic dimension are efforts to\nreform and revitalize the main organs of the United\nNations \u2014 the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil. Bangladesh has been an active participant in\nthis exercise and will continue to play a constructive,\nmoderating and flexible role to promote the realization of\nthese efforts for greater democratization, efficiency,\neffectiveness and legitimacy.\nI turn now to some of the critical political issues on\nour agenda.\nBangladesh\u2019s consistent and categorical position on\nthe Middle East question and the issue of Palestine needs\nno reiteration. We believe the Palestinian cause to be\nfounded on justice. We have always stood for a\ncomprehensive solution, which must be based on serious\na commitment by Israel to abide by Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978); the\nprinciple of returning land for peace; restoration of Arab\nsovereignty over occupied lands; and recognition of the\ninalienable national rights of the Palestinians, including a\nState of their own. We believe that a historic momentum\nhas been initiated since the Madrid Peace Conference in\n13\n\n\nOctober 1991, the signing of the Declaration of Principles\nbetween Israel and Palestine in September 1993, the Cairo\nagreement on Gaza and Jericho and the common agenda\nagreed between Jordan and Israel this year. We welcome\nthese vital steps in the peace process, and hope they will\nlead to a viable and durable settlement.\nWe hail the establishment of a united, democratic and\nnon-racial Republic of South Africa, a long-cherished goal,\nand applaud all parties for their relentless and courageous\nendeavour to this end. Our special tribute goes to President\nNelson Mandela and Mr. de Klerk. Bangladesh looks\nforward to consolidating our relations with South Africa in\nmore concrete ways, bilaterally and in all multilateral\nforums.\nWe are deeply concerned over the vicious cycle of\nstarvation, factional fighting, breakdown of central\nauthority, economic stagnation and exodus of refugees in\nvarious parts of Africa, exemplified by the situation in\nRwanda. We are committed to supporting the Security\nCouncil\u2019s effort, especially through peace-keeping\noperations, to break this cycle through a comprehensive\nprogramme of action that could provide vital relief\nassistance, consolidate cease-fires, curtail violence and\nbring about national reconciliation. We welcome the efforts\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the Arab\nLeague to promote and supplement these efforts.\nIn our own region we are anguished by the continuing\nstrife in Afghanistan, and urge all Afghan leaders to resolve\ndifferences through peaceful dialogue based on accords\nsigned in Istanbul, Mecca and Tehran. We fervently hope\nthat they can reach a broad-based consensus leading to the\nformulation of a durable government through free and fair\nelections. We welcome efforts, including those of the\nSecretary-General of the OIC, the United Nations and\nspecial representatives aimed at bringing about a\ncomprehensive and peaceful settlement in Afghanistan.\nThe tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina continues.\nPlans, deadlines, hopes for settlement have proved\ninfructuous. The latest plan drawn up by the Contact\nGroup of representatives from the United States, Russia, the\nUnited Nations and the European Union has been rejected\nby the Bosnian Serbs. At the heart of the issue is the\ndismemberment of a sovereign Member of the United\nNations, justified on the basis of pragmatic reality. The\narms embargo imposed on the Bosnians crippled them from\nthe outset, making any agreement artificial. Serbian\naggression and genocide appalled the world, yet too little\nwas done to stop it. Bangladesh believes that much more\nneeds to be done to ensure justice, including strengthening\nthe mandate and numbers of the United Nations\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR), lifting the arms embargo,\nextending exclusion zones and ultimately making the\nwhole of Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe haven.\nThe international community has repeatedly affirmed\nthe inviolability, territorial integrity and political\nindependence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We feel that\ncontinuing pressure must be maintained on the former\nYugoslavia to recognize Bosnia and Herzegovina and\neffectively realize a just and negotiated settlement. If\npresent efforts of the Contact Group fail to result in a\npolitical settlement we fully support the convening, under\nUnited Nations auspices, of an appropriately structured\ninternational conference on Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe are glad that there have been exhaustive attempts\nat a peaceful resolution of the problem of Haiti.\nBangladesh has pledged its fullest support to this end,\nguided by two key principles: commitment to the\npreservation and restoration of democracy wherever it is\nthreatened in the world, and willingness to serve in peace-\nkeeping operations under United Nations command\nmandated by the Security Council. We hope that will\nremain a cardinal point for the future as well.\nI may say in conclusion that Bangladesh remains\nfully committed to the United Nations as the only forum\nthat can deal with the cooperative management of the\nworld\u2019s problems and where we can successfully meet the\nchallenge of the future by drawing upon our combined\nsolidarity to confront it together.\n"

Your well-deserved\nelection, which honours all of Africa, is a tribute to your\ncountry, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, with which the Central African\nRepublic enjoys excellent relations of friendship,\nfraternity and cooperation.\nSince 1994 has been called the year of Africa, my\ndelegation and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\nmemory of the late President Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny.\nWe welcome the presence in this Hall of the sister\nRepublic of South Africa, and we congratulate it on the\narrival of democracy there.\nIt is with genuine pleasure that my Government\ncongratulates the President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-eighth session, Mr. Samuel Rudolph Insanally, and\ncommends him for the competent and intelligent way in\nwhich he discharged his mandate.\n\n\nWe also congratulate the Secretary-General, a worthy\nson of Africa, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who, as head of\nthe Organization, made the preparations for the year of\nAfrica. His admirable dynamism, realism, patience and\nwisdom have effectively helped to contain many\ninternational problems, despite meagre resources. We wish\nto reiterate our firm support for him and our best wishes for\nevery success in his multifaceted initiatives for peace,\nsecurity and development.\nIn the wake of the Second World War the United\nNations was created as a successor to the League of\nNations. It set itself the objective of, inter alia, settling of\ndisputes in order to promote the economic, social and\ncultural development of nations.\nWhat has happened since that time? The world was\ndivided into two camps \u2014 one capitalist, the other\ncommunist \u2014 while in between the two the third-world\ncountries described as non-aligned gradually achieved\ninternational sovereignty. This situation led to the advent\nof regimes born of military coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in almost all the\ncountries of the third world, especially in Africa. Those\nmilitary regimes, which were anti-democratic because they\nwere not elected, seized power and held freedom hostage,\nthereby curtailing the economic, social and cultural\ndevelopment of our nations. They plunged their\npopulations into unprecedented impoverishment.\nWhile the international community and the wealthy\ncountries indulged and fostered this policy of domination,\nwaste, corruption and mismanagement, the colonized and\ndominated populations fought unceasingly for access to\ndemocracy, the basis of all development. At last, near the\nend of 1990, the populations\u2019 cries of alarm were heard by\nthe international community, which then quickly facilitated\nthe third world\u2019s access to democracy.\nA new era dawned, starting in the East, where\ncommunism crumbled. The wind from the East blew\nthrough the African continent, where exhausted and\ntraumatized populations accepted unprecedented sacrifices\nand waged a ruthless battle against the military regimes in\npower.\nCertain African countries opted for the formula of\nsovereign national conferences, while others chose free,\ndemocratic and transparent elections. The Central African\npeople resolutely chose the latter path, at all cost.\nIn this context, the Central African Republic, which I\nrepresent today at the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly, elected me President, Head of State of the\nRepublic, in a setting of serenity and transparency, and\nover eight other candidates who enjoyed broad support\nfrom abroad. This was a victory not only for me and my\nParty but also for the entire Central African people. It\nwas a victory won through change in favour of a new and\ntruly democratic Republic.\nI take this opportunity to thank earnestly, once again,\nthe friendly countries and international institutions that\nparticipated unfailingly in the process of democratizing\nthe Central African Republic. I would like to mention in\nparticular France, the United States of America, Germany,\nJapan, the Republic of China in Taiwan, the European\nUnion, the World Bank and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP).\nThe Central African Republic would like to base its\nhopes on the concrete decisions that the General\nAssembly will be taking to eradicate the last remaining\nhotbeds of tension in the world at large and in Africa in\nparticular.\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Burundi, Angola,\nLiberia and other countries must find peace again, as did\nSouth Africa \u2014 and we welcome the presence here of\nSouth Africa\u2019s hero: the illustrious, democratically\nelected President, His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela,\nbeacon of the struggle against apartheid and for a new,\nmulti-racial and fraternal South Africa.\nIn this context, firmly convinced of the importance\nof humanitarian action in Rwanda, we supported\nunhesitatingly the helpful intervention of France, whose\ncourage and determination we extol. That intervention\ncurbed human suffering and restored peace to Rwanda.\nI also take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of\nmy country, congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Bill\nClinton, President of the United States of America, and to\nthe American people for their intervention in Haiti aimed\nat restoring democracy and returning the democratically\nelected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to office.\nAt its forty-ninth session the General Assembly must\ntake concrete and urgent measures to prevent and contain\nconflicts by establishing and strengthening legal\ninstruments. For weapons have never provided any\nlasting solutions. It is only if these legal instruments are\nestablished that the so-called poor countries will be able\nto begin to lay the foundations of their economic, social\nand cultural development in peace and tranquillity and\n2\n\n\nthat the intervention of the international community and the\nwealthy countries will be only complementary.\nAs to the Central African Republic, since my election\non 27 September 1993, we have endeavoured to lay the\ngroundwork for real democracy by giving priority to\ndialogue and concord between all the sectors of the Central\nAfrican nation.\nA truly democratic constitution, which reflects the\nprofound aspirations of my people, is being drafted and will\nsoon be submitted to a referendum, in December 1994.\nThis constitution, which is the result of a broad consensus,\nplaces great emphasis on justice, on fundamental freedoms,\nand on social and family well-being achieved through work.\nIt applies the mechanism of decentralization, along\nwith its corollary, regionalization in order, on the one hand,\nto bring the people closer while, on the other, to mobilize\nall available local resources for the agro-industrial\nprocessing of raw materials and mineral resources, for our\nsubsoil is very rich, so as to improve the standard of living\nin the countryside and the provinces.\nHow will the Central African Republic, a land-locked\ncountry, accomplish such a programme if its neighbours,\nthe countries of its subregion, are not at peace? A good\nportion of our exported and imported goods pass through\nneighbouring countries such as Cameroon and Congo.\nFurthermore, at the domestic level, the work of our\npeaceful peasants is systematically undermined by a\nphenomenon known as \u201czaraguinas\u201d, or those who block\nthe road. These \u201czaraguinas\u201d are simply a reflection of the\npolitical and military situation of our neighbours.\nThe General Assembly will understand why the\nCentral African Republic agreed to act as mediator between\nthe Government of Chad and a politico-military group with\na view to restoring peace to that fraternal country in its\nnorthern sector. This is because peace in Chad, in\nCameroon, in Congo, in Sudan and in Zaire will allow the\nCentral African Republic to develop harmoniously,\npromoting a dynamic and fruitful policy of good-\nneighbourliness and of the complementarity we require.\nMy country has embarked on the path of mediation\nbetween the parties in Chad because it believes in the\nvirtues of dialogue and harmony in a spirit of tolerance and\nunity within a diversity of political opinions.\nToday, the agreement reached between the\nGovernment of Chad and the National Salvation Council for\nPeace and Democracy in Chad (CSNPDT) of Moise Kette\nNodji is entering the stage of implementation in the field,\nthanks to the follow-up committee of Bangui II, since this\nKette movement, which in the past was a politico-military\nmovement, has now basically become a political party of\na conventional type, which is officially recognized.\nThe Government of Chad, on the initiative of the\nmediator, has just announced an amnesty for the\ncombatants of the CSNPDT in order to rebuild confidence\namong all Chadians and to create conditions conducive to\ngenuine reconciliation within Chad before the forthcoming\nelections in the country.\nWe are also prepared to make our contribution to the\nsettlement of internal conflicts in those neighbouring\ncountries that have appealed to us for assistance.\nI have elaborated on the major problems of concern\nto my country, the Central African Republic, and also\nthose of neighbouring countries as concerns lasting peace\nin Central Africa and in the world at large, and the\nAssembly will understand that I am deeply committed to\nrespect for human rights and for the rule of law. I am a\nfree man, and I say what I believe. I tell the truth,\nbecause the truth makes one free. I am a biologist, and\nI know that a good metabolism requires both\nmacro-elements and oligo-elements.\nTherefore, it is impossible to claim respect for\nhuman rights and for the rights of nations if, in one way\nor another, we promote discrimination for whatever\nreason.\nIn the past, it was discrimination between the East\nand West blocs, whose consequences, in the form of the\ncold war, plunged a large part of mankind into a\ncatastrophic situation. In the past, it was discrimination\nbetween the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization. In the past, it was racial discrimination in\nSouth Africa. Today, we still see discrimination:\nbetween the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Republic\nof China in Taiwan.\nAnd yet, the Berlin Wall has fallen, as did the walls\nof Jericho in days gone by, marking the end of the East-\nWest bloc system. The conflict between Israelis and\nPalestinians has yielded to coexistence between the State\nof Israel and the State of Palestine. The criminal\nfoundations of apartheid have crumbled and given way to\na new, democratic South Africa with a human face.\n3\n\n\nWhy not today help the two Chinas to overcome their\ntemporary divergences, which arise out of past history, in\norder that China might be reconciled with itself in the\nhigher interests of the Chinese people and of the peoples\nthat are friends of the two Chinas? Why exclude the\nRepublic of China in Taiwan from the great family of the\ninternational community? Why reject a State that has\n21 million inhabitants? Where is our respect for them?\nWhy encourage the conflict between the Chinas, when we\nknow that the two exchange technologies and complement\neach other?\nFor my part, and on behalf of the Central African\nRepublic, I reaffirm that we intend to maintain diplomatic,\neconomic, cultural and social relations with the two Chinese\nStates without restriction. The choice resides solely with\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China or the Republic of China in\nTaiwan.\nThe same applies to the two Koreas, because we want\nto benefit from the technology of all these friendly\ncountries for our development. Towards this end, we base\nourselves on the fundamental principle of the United\nNations Charter: there are no large nations; there are no\nsmall nations.\nThat is why my country, a co-sponsor of the draft\nresolution on the \u201cConsideration of the exceptional situation\nof the Republic of China in Taiwan in the international\ncontext, based on the principle of universality and in\naccordance with the established model of parallel\nrepresentation of divided countries at the United Nations\u201d,\ndeeply regrets that this item was not placed on the agenda\nof the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The\nrace towards the great market of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina should not obscure the problems of discrimination\nthat exist between the Chinese peoples. I am still\nconvinced that patience and wisdom will prevail one day,\nas they have recently in many of the countries we\nmentioned earlier.\nOur Organization will soon celebrate its fiftieth\nanniversary. It is appropriate at this time to draw up the\nbalance-sheet for this half-century and conduct a real\nassessment in order to set general policy guidelines for the\nyears to come. Loyal to our policy of decentralization in\nCentral Africa, we would also propose that the Assembly\nbe decentralized at the level of each continent, and that it\nhold its sessions in New York only every two or three\nyears, in accordance with a mechanism to be established\nafter a study by experts. In this way, the other bodies of\nthe United Nations system would also be brought closer\nto the peoples of the different continents.\nAs regards the Security Council, Africa has achieved\nmaturity, and, with one third of the world\u2019s population, is\nentitled to a permanent seat and also to the right of veto.\nThis is the proposal for adaptation to present circumstance\nthat we draw to the Assembly\u2019s attention.\nBefore concluding my statement, I should like to\nremind to General Assembly that the late Barth\u00e9lemy\nBoganda, founding President of the Central African\nRepublic, had a prophetic vision of the development of\nthe African continent. He proposed regrouping States into\npolitical and economic entities, with a view to launching\nthe economy of the African countries at the subregional\nand regional levels. The guiding idea was to establish the\nUnited States of Africa. Unfortunately, those ideas,\nwhich were put forward at such an early date by the late\nBarth\u00e9lemy Boganda, were not well understood by his\npeers and therefore were systematically fought and\ndiscarded. The individual countries, out of national\nchauvinism and egoism, chose to make their own way.\nToday, Africa has regressed. It is absent at the\ninternational level as regards trade and industrial and\nagro-industrial development. And yet Africa has a wealth\nof all kinds of raw materials. Why have our economies\nbecome so fragile? Why have our education and training\nsystems not attained their objectives \u2014 true technical,\nscientific and socio-professional instruction, the essential\nbasis for a real policy of reconstruction in our countries,\nwhich are in an unprecedented state of dilapidation? Why\ndo our health-care systems no longer meet the aspirations\nof our populations? Why are our roads in such a state of\ndisrepair that it is virtually impossible to travel freely\nfrom one country to another? In a word, why must we\nstart all over?\nAll this has happened because of different\nideologies, based on the selfish interests of individual\nnations. It is also due to a lack of active solidarity\namong African nations.\nContrary to other regions of the world, where there\nare clear signs of the resumption of economic growth, the\npersistence of poor economic results in Africa remains a\nsource of concern and of constant disquiet. In fact, at the\npresent time, Africa accounts for under 2 per cent of\ninternational trade transactions. It is being crushed under\nthe weight of debt, and various programmes for structural\nadjustment have done nothing to change the worsening\n4\n\n\nstandard of living of the entire continent, which does,\nhowever, have an enormous potential in its peoples and its\nnature.\nThe trend towards a decline in the prices of raw\nmaterials and commodities is continuing inexorably, and the\ntransfer of technology is proceeding in an unsatisfactory\nmanner, placing Africa on the sidelines. What we need to\nsave the continent is a real Marshall Plan, because at the\npresent time multilateral and bilateral assistance remain\ninsufficient to promote sustained and lasting growth.\nWithout this growth, which is necessary to raise the\nAfrican people\u2019s standard of living, lasting peace can be\nonly an illusion. In a word, the Central African Republic\nappeals for international solidarity in favour of the poorest\ncountries, with a view to the relaunching of their\ndevelopment.\nIn this context, my country expresses the hope that\nthis session will mark a new stage in effective cooperation\nfor progress and peace in the entire international\ncommunity.\nThe Central African Republic believes that tolerance\nand peace for development must henceforward be the motto\nof the United Nations.\nLong live the General Assembly!\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, let me\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I wish you\nevery success and pledge you the full support of my\ndelegation. I also wish to commend your predecessor, His\nExcellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for\nthe excellent and able manner in which he conducted the\nwork of the forty-eighth session.\nUnder his wise guidance, the Member States of the\nUnited Nations, during the forty-eighth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, engaged in a creative and constructive\ndialogue on a question likely to have a great impact on the\nfuture work and credibility of the United Nations, that of\nequitable representation on and increase in the membership\nof the Security Council. The report of the Working Group,\nwhich was adopted on 14 September by the General\nAssembly, makes it clear that these discussions have had a\npositive beginning and that much more work in a\nconstructive and open-minded spirit remains to be done in\norder to find a solution acceptable to all Member States.\nEven though detailed discussion of this sensitive issue must\nbe continued by the Working Group, I should like to\nreiterate at this juncture that the Government of\nLiechtenstein attaches the utmost importance to maintaining\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the work of the Security\nCouncil, and that at the same time it holds the view that the\ndiscussions of the Working Group should cover not only\nthe enlargement of the Council, but also, and to no less an\nextent, its working methods.\nThe second session of the Preparatory Committee for\nthe World Summit for Social Development, which will take\nplace in Copenhagen in March 1995, concluded its work\njust three weeks ago. The Liechtenstein Government is\nencouraged by the results of this session, which prove that\nthe preparatory process is on the right track, and we are\nconfident that the consultations to be held by Ambassador\nSomav\u00eda during the last week of October will lay a solid\nbasis for the work of the third session and bring Member\nStates closer to achieving the important goal of a final\ndocument which can be adopted by consensus. The\nWorld Summit for Social Development can be a crucial\nevent for the future of mankind, and we must not miss\nthis opportunity to promote social progress and better\nstandards of living in greater freedom, which is one of the\nmost noble goals of this Organization. This gathering, as\nthe draft final document acknowledges, is closely\ninterlinked with other important conferences, notably the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\nwhich was successfully concluded on 13 September in\nCairo, and the Fourth World Conference on Women, to\nbe held in Beijing in September 1995.\nAmong other subjects under consideration by the\nGeneral Assembly, the draft final document also mentions\nthe International Year of the Family, which we are still\ncelebrating. I wish to underline that, in the view of the\nLiechtenstein Government, a concise summary and\nanalysis of the activities undertaken within the framework\nof the International Year of the Family, at both the\nnational and the regional levels, can make a substantive\ncontribution to the successful outcome of the two United\nNations world conferences in 1995, and at the same time\ncan help achieve the goal of making the International\nYear of the Family not an isolated event, but, rather, one\nwhich will have a continuing and long-term impact on\nnational policies as well as on regional and international\ncooperation. Liechtenstein has undertaken manifold\nactivities in order to celebrate the International Year;\namongst other things, it dedicated the commemorative\nactivities for its National Day on 15 August to the\nobjectives of the International Year. The Government of\nLiechtenstein therefore wholeheartedly welcomes the\ndecision of the General Assembly, taken in its resolution\n47/237 of September 1993, to hold an international\nconference on the family, which will take place here in\nNew York on 18 October, and hopes to be in a position\nto contribute to giving the International Year a lasting\nimpact.\n\nIn our view, preventive diplomacy, as outlined in\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", could and should be used more\noften and more efficiently. We commend the activities of\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(CSCE). Especially since the 1990 Summit meeting in\nParis, when the leaders of 36 States signed and committed\nthemselves to the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the\nCSCE has shown that it can play a most useful role in\n8\n\n\nmonitoring specific situations and in initiating negotiation\nprocesses. We are of the opinion that improved\ncoordination of the activities of the Conference and those\nof the United Nations can achieve very fruitful results.\nThe international political environment has changed.\nHaving been accorded its rightful place in the promotion\nand maintenance of international peace and security, the\nUnited Nations now has as one of its central tasks that of\nplaying a more active role than ever before in conflict\nresolution. Unfortunately it must be stated again this year\nthat the sheer number and magnitude of the conflicts\nsurpass the abilities of this Organization. There is no\nregion in the world without a conflict of some sort; regional\nconflicts have become a major threat to international peace\nand security. We are aware that peace-keeping must be and\nwill remain one of the Organization\u2019s most important\ninstruments for maintaining peace and security in the world,\nbut peace-keeping operations have to be provided with clear\nmandates and be set within a reasonable and realistic time-\nframe. Since Liechtenstein became a member of the United\nNations in 1990 the expenses for peace-keeping operations\nhave increased dramatically. We are aware that the\nchanging global situation has made an increase of\npeace-keeping activities unavoidable, but it should also be\nnoted that these costs increasingly constitute a heavy burden\nfor national budgets.\nIn this connection, we should note that we welcome\nthe creation of the post of an Under-Secretary-General for\nInternal Oversight Services and the appointment of Mr.\nKarl Theodor Paschke to this post. We hope that this\nimportant step will lead to improved financial management\nof the United Nations and at the same time to timely and\nfull payment of assessed contributions by all Member\nStates, both into the regular budget and for peace-keeping\nactions.\nThe Liechtenstein Government attaches the utmost\nimportance to the promotion and protection of human rights\nand I wish to emphasize that the Declaration and\nProgramme of Action adopted by the World Conference on\nHuman Rights in Vienna in June 1993 can, if it is followed\nby full implementation of its provisions, constitute a\nmilestone in the history of the United Nations. The\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session took a first and\nvery important step by adopting the mandate for the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, a post which had been\nunder discussion for a very long time. I wish to thank\nAmbassador Ayala Lasso for all the efforts he has\nundertaken so far in fulfilling his very difficult task and to\nassure him of our full support. However, more and\ndetermined action by the General Assembly is needed,\nincluding the allocation of an increased percentage of the\noverall budget of the United Nations to the Centre for\nHuman Rights in order to enable it to carry out its tasks\neven more efficiently.\nThe United Nations is approaching its fiftieth\nanniversary and preparing to commemorate that event in\na dignified manner. I should like to thank\nUnder-Secretary-General Gillian Sorensen for her untiring\nefforts with regard to the commemorative activities of the\nOrganization. The jubilee is also a good opportunity to\nbring the purposes and the work of the United Nations\ncloser to the individuals, the people, who are the central\nsubject of the Organization\u2019s endeavours. Liechtenstein\nwishes to contribute to achieving this goal and has\ntherefore scheduled several activities, information on\nwhich will be provided in due course. I should like,\nhowever, to avail myself of this opportunity to refer\nbriefly to a project which is of particular importance to us\nand, we believe, of direct relevance for the United\nNations.\nIn one of Liechtenstein\u2019s first contributions to these\ngeneral debates after becoming a Member of the United\nNations, His Serene Highness Prince Hans Adam II,\nRuling Prince and Head of State of Liechtenstein,\nintroduced at the forty-sixth session of the Assembly an\ninitiative on certain aspects of self-determination, and he\nelaborated on it at later sessions, including the\nforty-eighth. Self-determination has been of very great\nimportance in the history of the United Nations and is, of\ncourse, enshrined as a principle in its Charter. As\nrepresentatives of Liechtenstein have outlined on several\noccasions, our initiative seeks to open up for discussion\nby the international community certain aspects of the right\nof self-determination and to encourage a more flexible\nand practical implementation of that right.\nLast year, at the request of the delegation of\nLiechtenstein, a new sub-item was included in the agenda\nof the General Assembly, entitled \\\"Effective realization of\nthe right to self-determination through autonomy\\\" . We\nhad a very interesting debate in the Third Committee, at\nthe close of which Member States, while agreeing to\nconsider the matter further at a later stage, preferred not\nto do so during this present, forty-ninth, session of the\nGeneral Assembly. Reactions and comments made during\nand surrounding the debate by a large number of\ncountries, as well as developments on the international\nscene, have confirmed our view that this initiative is\ntimely and potentially valuable for the international\n9\n\n\ncommunity. We will therefore be pursuing it as\nconstructively as possible.\nIt seems to us that at this stage it would be most\nappropriate, and most likely to lead to fruitful results, for\nthis subject to be developed further within an academic,\nrather than a political, framework. His Serene Highness\nPrince Hans Adam II has therefore, as one element of\nLiechtenstein\u2019s contribution to the commemoration of the\nfiftieth anniversary, given a grant to Princeton University\u2019s\nWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs\nto establish a research programme on self-determination to\nbe conducted under the auspices of the Woodrow Wilson\nSchool\u2019s Center of International Studies. Two conferences\nare to be organized in March and June 1995 within the\nframework of this research programme. They will be open\nfor participation to all Member States of the United\nNations, and I wish to extend an invitation to all States to\ncontinue working together with us to make further progress\non this crucially important question.\nInternational law is the best guarantee of respect for\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms as well as of\ninternational peace and security. In the case of\nLiechtenstein, it is also the only guarantee. I therefore wish\nto reaffirm our commitment to cooperate with all States in\nfurther strengthening international law in order to achieve\na secure, a peaceful and a prosperous future for the\ngenerations to come.\n"

I am\nconfident that under your guidance the Assembly will at\nthis important session contribute to progress in the\ncarrying out of the important task with which the\nOrganization is charged - the constant quest for peace.\nI also take pleasure in paying tribute to Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, whose intelligent\nand expert leadership have given the world fresh hope, as\nwe are about to enter a new millennium, so that we may\nbe optimistic about the future, even though there are still\ngrounds for concern.\nThe twentieth century, which is drawing to a close,\nhas witnessed momentous events for mankind. Two\nworld wars, which cost an enormous number of human\nlives and immense physical, economic and cultural losses,\ndemonstrated the extent to which man is capable of\ndestruction - above all, self-destruction. The world\u2019s\npolitical map has been changed many times, with\npredictable consequences.\nScience and technology have made remarkable\nprogress. The discovery of antibiotics has provided\nundreamt-of opportunities for surgery. Surgeons have\n6\n\n\nconverted the human body into a fruitful field for\noperations capable of correcting natural defects and injuries\narising from circumstances prevailing in an increasingly\ncomplex society. Life expectancy has risen steadily, and\nterrible endemic diseases that used to claim countless\nvictims have vanished almost completely.\nCommunications have been the greatest marvel of this\ncentury. The twentieth century has been the era of radio\nbroadcasting and television. Important events occurring in\nany part of the world are immediately known in the most\ndistant regions. The fax has supplanted the mails and\nimproved on the telegram and the telex. Communications\nare the principal reason why the inhabitants of this planet\nare gradually recognizing their role as members of a single,\nvast community of nations.\nOf necessity, institutions have endeavoured to keep in\nstep with the rapid and unremitting march of events. Both\ninternal and international juridical norms are subject to\nconstant change. Fundamental concepts of nationality and\nsovereignty are being reconsidered, and formulas are being\nsought so that inalienable and traditional rights may exist in\nharmony with the requirements of the supranational\ncommunity. Amongst these values are the self-\ndetermination of nations and non-intervention, as laid down\nin the Preamble to our Constitution. Accordingly,\nVenezuela has been and remains permanently disposed to\npromoting the peaceful spread of democracy to every nation\non Earth, and especially to those of our continent. We\nhave consequently supported efforts aimed at reintroducing\na fully democratic system in those Latin American\ncountries where it is not at present established. Their\nsituation is inevitably of deep concern to us by reason of\nhistory and natural affinities. For the same reason, though,\nVenezuela did not support military intervention in Haiti,\ndespite the fact that the United Nations has lent it\nmultilateral and institutional support.\nAt the same time, regional integration is expanding,\nwith profound effect on the exercise of rights within every\ncountry. This process is rapidly leading to hemispheric and\nuniversal integration. For Latin Americans, the bicentennial\nof the birth of Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, the young man who\nconsolidated our independence at the battle of Ayacucho,\nwill provide an opportunity to reassert the unbreakable links\nof our solidarity. As we see it, the objective of the\nforthcoming meeting of Heads of State or Government,\nconvened by the President of the United States, will be the\nencouragement of a genuinely democratic system in the\nAmerican continent and throughout the world. It is our\nhope in this regard that there will be a commitment to fight\nwithout quarter against poverty and an effective\nagreement to stamp out corruption.\nThe United Nations has managed to avoid most of\nthe obstacles that caused the failure of its immediate\npredecessor, the League of Nations. Next year it will\ncelebrate its first 50 years of existence: a time in which,\namidst contradictions and disappointments, it has provided\na unique forum for constant dialogue, in every language\nand in the most contrasting tones. It has made\nuninterrupted progress and shown a willingness to accept\nthe structural changes that changing times have imposed.\nFor this reason we are awaiting further changes, such as\nthe expansion of permanent representation on the Security\nCouncil to Latin America by granting Brazil permanent\nmembership. Latin America has every right to this by\nvirtue of its spiritual strength and its constant espousal of\nliberty and international friendship.\nHowever, despite all the progress achieved, it is\nundeniable that we are still a very long way from having\nestablished a stable, universal peace or a harmonious\ncoexistence amongst nations. Nor have we developed\nstandards of living that permit all social strata in the\nvarious continents to enjoy a fitting human existence, with\na satisfactory world-wide level of equity in social\nrelations.\nThe struggle for human rights has spread\nsignificantly, and international treaties have been signed\nto ensure that protection of such rights transcends all\nborders. But the basic human right to life itself, the right\nto work and the right to have enough to eat for healthy\nliving are far from having been secured for a considerable\npart of mankind.\nThe momentous International Conference on\nPopulation and Development, recently held in Cairo,\nseemed to be based on the assumption that it is\nimpossible to guarantee development interpreted as\nparticipation by the whole human being and by all human\nbeings in economic and social processes - if the\npopulation continues to increase. This is because many\ncountries have not ensured, as is essential, that everyone\nwho is born will have the means to enjoy a decent\nexistence. In my country, at the beginning of the century,\na time of manifest poverty and backwardness, there was\na saying that every child was born with an arepa under\nthe arm. \\\"Arepa\\\" is a bread made of maize and is a\npopular staple of the daily diet. This saying has now\ndropped out of popular usage.\n7\n\n\nIn spite of the dramatic repercussions of the events\nfollowing the destruction of the Berlin Wall, peace has not\nyet been achieved. Just as we were ready to thrill with\nemotion at the arrival of universal peace, the Gulf War\nawakened us from that dream. Recent conflicts in the\nformer Yugoslavia and in Rwanda, two countries so\nfundamentally different one from the other, have stirred up\nvestiges of barbarism that had supposedly disappeared for\never. Religious conflicts and ethnic antagonisms, thought\nto have been overcome once and for all, have re-emerged\nwith unbelievable bitterness. Events recall the Biblical\ncommentary of the Peruvian Victor Andr\u00e9s Belaunde, an\nillustrious Latin American, greatly appreciated in the United\nNations, who said that human beings bear the weight of a\ncurse implicitly imposed by God when He cast them out of\nthe Garden of Eden: Since they refused to be governed by\nGod, they would have to govern themselves.\nThe United Nations faces a constant challenge: the\nquest for peace. It is clear that peace will not be achieved\nsimply through political discussion or diplomatic\nnegotiation, still less through the mere use of force. It has\noften been said by knowledgeable speakers that peace is the\nfruit of justice: that is, without some degree of justice,\npeace is unattainable.\nThat was understood by the negotiators at Versailles\nat the end of the First World War when they included in\ntheir Peace Treaty a lengthy clause devoted to the\nInternational Labour Organization and inspired by the\nnotion of social justice. Undoubtedly, however, the need\nfor justice goes far beyond international conventions and\nrecommendations with regard to labour, and meeting that\nneed is becoming a matter of increasing urgency.\nThe rapid process of globalization we are witnessing\nis unstoppable and unavoidable. The steps being taken in\nthis direction are dictated by the state of today\u2019s world and\nthe demands of the immediate and mid-term future. The\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round and the creation of the\nWorld Trade Organization represent undeniable progress for\nmankind. The bilateral and multilateral agreements reached\non all continents are signs of progress and stimulate the\ncreation and exchange of wealth. It is nevertheless\nessential to introduce into relations between States\ninstruments that will prevent commercial interchange from\nbecoming an economic war to the death. It is inappropriate\nto transfer to social relations the concept of the struggle for\nexistence in the sense that nature itself, through this\nstruggle, will automatically ensure the survival of the fittest -\nin other words, the absolute predominance of the strongest\nand the disappearance of the weakest. The acceptance of\nsuch an idea would be a crime against humanity.\nIt must be recognized that the United Nations and its\nimportant subsidiary bodies have made great efforts to\nalleviate the sufferings and shortages of those sectors of\nhumanity where the standard of living is below what is\ndeemed humanely indispensable. It is encouraging to\nnote that institutions directly related to the United Nations\nsuch as the World Bank and the International Monetary\nFund recognize that the fight against poverty must be a\ntop priority. It is not, however, enough to give\nhumanitarian assistance to the neediest. It is essential to\nafford nations the conditions they require to enable all\ntheir inhabitants to compete efficiently, to ensure their\nhealthy survival and to encourage their progress.\nIt is true that economic-liberalization measures in\nless-developed countries have produced positive\nmacroeconomic results, but in some countries that point\nwith satisfaction to the tremendous economic progress\nthey have achieved one can note, at the same time, a\ngrowing concern about that portion of the population that\nis living in poverty and, even more distressing, in critical\nand even extreme poverty.\nI share the aspiration voiced by the President of\nColombia to a new model of development for our\ncountries, for an \\\"alternative model,\\\" as he put it when\naddressing the Assembly. He proposed the establishment\nof\n\\\"a new and more productive citizen in the economy,\na citizen who participates to a greater degree in\npolitics and who is more supportive in the social\nsphere.\\\" (Official Records of the General Assembly,\nForty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th meeting,\n[p. 27])\nIn recent years my country, Venezuela, has faced a\ndifficult economic situation and disquieting social\ncircumstances. Undeniably, the blame lies largely with us.\nGrievous mistakes in running the country and the\npoisonous plague of corruption are the principal causes of\nthe acute crisis we are experiencing, but external factors\nhave also played a part. I am not here to pronounce\njudgement on the past. As I have pledged to my\ncompatriots, I must find ways of restoring the confidence\nthat is indispensable if coming generations are to be able,\nwith training and hard work, to avail themselves of the\nopportunities the country has to offer. Serious\ninstitutional problems - such as the legal proceedings\n8\n\n\nagainst two former Presidents of the Republic, one of\nwhom was suspended from office while still President -\nhave been handled within the legal system with strict\nadherence to the Constitution. The people\u2019s conduct has\nbeen truly exemplary. The natural resources with which\nprovidence has endowed us and the favourable prospects\nguaranteed by our human resource, our people, who have\nalways demonstrated intelligence, creative audacity and\ncourage in times of danger, inspire us with optimism. We\nrealize that we must seek within ourselves the essential\nelements that will enable us to win the struggle for\ndevelopment to which we are so seriously committed. We\nhave put forward an economic stabilization and recovery\nprogramme that has been in large part accepted. It lays out\na feasible and clearly defined course that will ultimately\nlead to a solution of the crisis. However, we feel that we\nare in duty bound to explain to international forums, and\nmost particularly to this world forum, the need for\nfavourable prospects to open up that can help us to avoid\nexerting our efforts in vain and ensure instead that they will\nbe successful and will contribute to a better future for\nmankind.\nFor example, when considering the need to strengthen\ntrade relations throughout the world we must call for\nguaranteed access to the markets of the developed\ncountries, where mechanisms are sometimes in place that\nare skillfully used to exclude our competition. We agree\nwith the need for environmental protection for the benefit\nof the world\u2019s inhabitants, and we are certainly ready to\ncontribute to that goal. However, we must make the point\nthat on more than one occasion the ecological struggle for\na healthy environment has been hypocritically used as a\nway to prevent developing countries from gaining access to\nthe markets of wealthy nations. We further believe that\ntransfer of technology must be wide ranging and genuine,\nfor if it is not the gap between us and the developed\ncountries, which increases every year, will ultimately\nbecome impossible to bridge and will lead to a sharp and\nbitter rift between two sectors of mankind, with\nunforeseeable but undoubtedly disastrous consequences.\nAccess to capital is a requirement that is becoming\never more acute as technological advances make productive\nprocesses more capital- and less labour-intensive. At the\nsame time, there must be fair payment for the raw materials\nthat represent the principal contribution of the\nunderdeveloped countries to international trade but that are\nconstantly losing their relevance in end products.\nConsequently, access to capital must be arranged on\nequitable terms to protect the interests of producers, who\nare often obliged to accept conditions that are little more\nthan adhesion contracts. This struggle to obtain better\nprices for raw materials, which are almost invariably\nsubject to conditions imposed by consumer countries\nwithout any real participation by the producers, and the\nestablishment of reasonable terms for international loans\nare part of the struggle for justice and an integral part of\nthe struggle for peace.\nThe external-debt problem of the developing\ncountries is still far from being solved. It is true that\nthere have been negotiations on restructuring and that\nthey have temporarily alleviated the dreadful burden that\nproblem represents for the debtor countries, but as the\nrepayment deadlines fall due the burden for those in debt\nbecomes harder to bear with the passing of every year.\nTo cite a concrete example: in my country next year\u2019s\ndebt servicing payments will amount to 35 per cent of the\nnational budget, and in coming years the situation will\nbecome even more acute. The drop in the price of our\nmain export has made it very difficult to meet the basic\nneeds of our population. We have never given any\nthought to disavowing our obligations. We are resolved\nto meet them, but we consider that this subject must be\nplaced on international agendas and that a search must\nbegin for a broad solution that will open up new horizons\nof justice and peace.\nI believe that as we approach the beginning of the\nsecond half of the United Nations first century the\nfundamental aim of the United Nations must be the search\nfor justice in relations among peoples.\nSocial justice has been one of the most important\nachievements of this twentieth century that is now\ndrawing to a close. This demands of every individual and\nevery group whatever is required for the common good.\nAbove and beyond the numerical equality of commutative\njustice, it also requires of all of us that we make a\ncontribution to the community of nations in proportion to\nour individual possibilities. This concept has still not\ngained acceptance in the international field. It is true that\nthere have been some minor concessions to the most\nneedy countries but there is a lack of any clear course\ntowards the achievement of universal well-being. It is not\nonly States that should be the agents. Once the door was\nopened by the International Labour Organization (ILO),\ninternational organizations also provided access for\nunofficial bodies. The large transnational corporations\nwhich have and exercise real power must become\ninvolved in the management of programmes that will seek\npeace through justice; economic justice in so far as it\n9\n\n\nconcerns them; and respect for the sovereignty of both\nlarge and small States.\nThose of us who love freedom; those of us who have\nstruggled to achieve it, regardless of cost and sacrifice;\nthose of us who consider democracy and respect for human\nrights as priority objectives; those of us who sincerely\nyearn for friendship and fruitful understanding among all\nnations; those of us who believe in dialogue and resolutely\nsupport the endeavours of the United Nations to encourage\nit - all of us desire to see the United Nations displaying\nunflinching determination that the search for justice - and\nI shall never tire of repeating this - must play a key role in\nthe building of peace.\nIf peace is our goal let us strive to make justice its\nfoundation. In this way we shall realize the ideal which\nour Liberator, Simon Bolivar, visualized as the most\nimportant goal of the best system of government: \\\"the\ngreatest possible degree of happiness\\\", in other words,\nhappiness for all.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to join preceding speakers in\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nI should also like to pay a tribute to His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally for his successful leadership as President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nTaking advantage of this opportunity, I should like to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and I should like to thank him for his substantive contribution to enhancing the authority of the United Nations and his efforts with a view to the maintenance of peace in various regions of the planet.\nFor me, it is a great honor to address the Assembly today from this lofty rostrum on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\nJust recently, Uzbekistan marked the third anniversary of the proclamation of its independence. During this time, our country has undertaken significant efforts to strengthen the sovereignty of the States based on the principles of democracy and to set up a free market structure.\nProfound economic and political transformations are taking place in the Republic with a view to the formation of a socially oriented market economy.\nToday, a process of reform in Uzbekistan has reached a new qualitative level. The Parliament and the Government have adopted a number of significant and fundamental laws and decrees which are now opening the way to developing entrepreneurship and privatization. New legislation guarantees the protection of private property. A number of legislative and economic incentives for potential foreign investors have been provided, and an extremely favor\nfavorable environment has been created for their activities in the Republic's markets. For example, all limitations on the importation and exportation of foreign investments have been lifted. Customs duties for goods imported into Uzbekistan have also been canceled. Joint ventures are exempt from taxes for five years.\nThe process of privatization of State property is under way in the Republic. Commodity, currency and stock exchanges, as well as real estate markets, are being set up.\nThe most important process of introducing the national currency was recently completed in Uzbekistan. Implementation of the measures jointly agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund will make it possible to have a firm fiscal policy and will strengthen the national currency.\nPerhaps there is no country in the world that has sufficient experience to extend ready advice on how to change social and economic structures smoothly. The complicated and very often controversial processes of the transition to democracy and a market economy are being carried out mainly on an empirical basis, and sometimes in a highly contradictory situation.\nAn extremely complicated task for the people of Uzbekistan is the perception of the basic principles of democracy and the socially oriented market economy, while at the same time preserving the development of its own rich history and unique culture and traditions. This is assuming today a decisive significance in the successful realization of the task of renewing our society and in the construction of an independent State.\nThe steps the Government of Uzbekistan has been undertaking in order to reshape the political structure of the State have one more important aspect. They are not a goal in themselves; they are aimed at establishing conditions of social justice. In fact, in many countries, social justice has already long been recognized as a fundamental principle of social life. In essence, if we look at the future in the long term, without justice there cannot be any kind of stability, peace or security. There cannot be any social development, any freedom for the individual, human dignity or an acceptable quality of life for all.\nThe Constitution of Uzbekistan grants to all citizens of the Republic basic rights and freedoms and provides for their equality before the law without distinction as to sex, race, nationality, language, religion, social standing, or personal beliefs.\nThe number of political parties and social movements which are operating on the basis of the laws and decrees that have been adopted and incorporated into the political system is gradually increasing. They will be taking part in the parliamentary elections which will be held in Uzbekistan in December 1994 on a multi-party basis.\nSpeaking about political processes, I should like to touch upon the issue of human rights. First of all, allow me to point out that the modem concept of the basic rights and freedoms of individuals was formed mainly on the basis of a Western system of values and elaborated over a long period of time, under specific cultural and social conditions, and developed as part and parcel of economic growth and better standards of living in Western countries. This experience is hardly one that could be mechanically transferred to other countries.\nWe do believe, however, that universally accepted human rights concepts should be adapted to the national, religious and historical characteristics of different countries. International practice has in many cases demonstrated that unless society has reached a sufficient level of maturity and sustains it, it will be compelled to a certain extent to constrain the freedom of the individual for the sake of the preservation of the constitutional order.\nToday we live in a multidimensional world. Each nation is eager to establish its own political, social and cultural systems on the basis of respect for the national sovereignty of other States and the principle of noninterference in their internal affairs. Therefore, we consider the question of human rights in close connection with that of the need to guarantee to the country stability and peace as the primary conditions for democratic development.\nI hope that the recent seminar of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) on general issues, held in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, provided an opportunity to the international observers and its participants to see the gradual evolution of our society towards democracy. At the same time, the seminar has deepened our knowledge on possible ways to make progress in the field of human rights.\nUnfortunately, the end of the confrontation between two social and political systems, which reached its peak in the military sphere, has not brought about universal peace. The threat of global thermonuclear war has been reduced. Yet the world has encountered the emergence of several regional military conflicts. In this regard, I would like to make known Uzbekistan's position on the situations in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\nFirst of all, we consider that settlement of these conflicts is solely the internal affair of Afghanistan and Tajikistan. At the same time, one should keep in mind the fact that these States are the geographical neighbors of Uzbekistan and that there is a potential danger of the regional escalation of these conflicts. That is why we view the situation in these countries with great concern and we are interested in the earliest possible settlement of these conflicts by political and diplomatic means.\nI should particularly like to emphasize that today this region is becoming a dangerous zone of open production of and trade in drugs and weapons. These conflicts are exacerbated by the fact that certain forces are secretly seeking to maintain tension in order to strengthen and expand their influence by making use of various religious and nationalist slogans. Moreover, there are some influential groups of drug and weapon dealers interested in continuing the military confrontation for the sake of the preservation of their illegal profits.\nIn general, crises of this nature have revealed the inadequacy of the existing instruments to settle them through traditional means, given the new security demands of the post-cold-war era.\nIn this context, Uzbekistan welcomes any initiative by individual countries or groups of countries, as well as by the United Nations, aimed at settling the conflicts. The new possibilities of the United Nations could expand the spectrum of military-political measures for stabilizing situations in such explosive regions, including within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). At the same time, taking into consideration the importance of ensuring the sovereignty of countries that have recently achieved independence and embarked on their own path of development, we believe it would be expedient to have recourse to such measures, with the agreement of Governments interested in such United Nations assistance or with the agreement of the parties to the dispute to a mediating role by the United Nations.\nFor its part, Uzbekistan has been taking steps to improve the situation in the region. At the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, President Karimov of Uzbekistan proposed the convening in Tashkent of a standing seminar on security issues under the auspices of the United Nations. Today, plans for this idea are becoming clearer. About 15 States have already expressed their interest in participating in the seminar. We hope that in the near future the first seminar of this kind will take place. We are ready to welcome its participants to the ancient and peaceful land of Uzbekistan.\nUzbekistan is also proposing for consideration at one of the forthcoming meetings of the Security Council the question of imposing an embargo on the sale of weapons and ammunition in zones of regional conflict.\nI should like to take this opportunity to note that there are certain groups in some countries which are intentionally spreading false information about ostensible interference by Uzbekistan in the internal affairs of Afghanistan by taking sides with one of the conflicting parties. In fact, the only support Uzbekistan is rendering to this neighboring country is humanitarian aid for its suffering people, as requested by the Government of Afghanistan, as well as to Tajik refugees who fled to Afghanistan. This assistance is extended through the representation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the City of Termez.\nI should like to pay tribute to the active role the United Nations and the CSCE are taking in this process through their special envoys. We also highly appreciate the productive activities of the regional representation of the United Nations in Uzbekistan.\nI should now like to touch upon one more problem which is a threat for many countries - illegal drug-trafficking. In the Republic of Uzbekistan, on the basis of the laws of Uzbekistan and according to Conventions of the United Nations of 1961, 1971 and 1988, preventive measures to cut off illegal activities related to the drug trade are now being undertaken.\nIn general, narcotics come to Uzbekistan through neighboring countries, where, owing to unstable political situations, control over the drugs business has been weakened. Moreover, most of these narcotics are in transit to European countries.\nIn 1993 more than 14 tons of narcotics, with a value of more than $600 million, were seized from criminals in Uzbekistan and were destroyed. The majority of these were intended for sale in Russia and in European\ncountries. In this connection, we call for the imposition of effective measures to prevent the illegal trafficking in drugs and to coordinate international efforts. An example of the successful cooperation between law-enforcement institutions is the Agreement signed in 1992 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan and its counterparts in Russia, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Belarus and Ukraine.\nSince October 1993 the Republic has been maintaining close cooperation with the United Nations International Drug Control Program. The visit of the Deputy Executive Director of this United Nations Program, Mr. Georgio Giacomelli, to Uzbekistan was an important event in the development of cooperation on this issue. A document defining a long-term program of collaboration against narcotics was signed during the course of that visit.\nI should like especially to draw attention to the important role that regional representatives involved in the United Nations Program have been playing in the coordination of international efforts to solve this global problem. This process was begun in Tashkent at the invitation of the President of Uzbekistan.\nWe shall do our utmost to cooperate with all interested countries and organizations to bring the narco-business to an end.\nI must not miss this opportunity to refer briefly to environmental issues. We are grateful to the United Nations and to the specialized agencies concerned with environmental control and with the prevention of global ecological disasters. We are ready to provide all possible assistance in this noble task.\nCentral Asia, like many other regions of the world, has experienced ecological disasters of global dimensions. I refer, first and foremost, to the tragedy of the Aral Sea. Over a period of several years the volume of water has dropped more than three times, the area has diminished two times; and the shoreline has receded 80 kilometers. Owing to these factors the desert has eaten up more than 2 million hectares of arable land. The dust-storm radius has increased by more than 300 kilometers. These developments have had a negative effect on the sanitary situation in the region. It is the opinion of United Nations experts that, in terms of ecological and socio-economic implications, the Aral Sea tragedy is one of the greatest disasters of the twentieth century.\n \n\nThe death of the Aral Sea, which is possible, could have unpredictable consequences for the whole world. This is why we are appealing to the international community to help to save the Aral Sea and the Aral region.\nOne possible means of solving this global problem is the creation of an international commission of experts under the auspices of the United Nations, which would initiate projects and make recommendations. The Government of Uzbekistan, for its part, would provide all possible support for the activities of the commission.\nThe profound changes that have taken place in the world over the past half century require adaptation to new realities. There are now about 200 States, and the roles of many countries have changed. Some now have the right to be regarded as great Powers. Huge economic unions are being formed by States. Regional and global cooperation is an increasing trend. Because of the need for effective management of the processes of economic integration Governments are voluntarily transferring some of their sovereign rights to newly created joint political institutions. On the other hand, these trends underline the fact that a State should be recognized as a sovereign member of the world community so that such cooperation may be possible.\nThe time is now ripe for the full realization of the fundamental principles of the United Nations, which were set down when the Organization was founded nearly 50 years ago. The United Nations procedures must be rejected; these procedures came into being largely under the influence of the spirit - which until recently had prevailed within these walls - of the cumbersome, often ineffective and over-bureaucratic confrontation between the United States and the USSR.\nThe necessary reforms are already producing results. I refer in particular to the recent decision to establish the Office of Internal Oversight Services. As an Under- Secretary-General, the head of this Office will be able to initiate a more substantial discussion on the impending phases of reform of the Organization.\nThere is no doubt that the evolution of the Security Council is still the most important and most complicated issue. How are we to reconcile the need to increase the number of permanent members, so that they are representative of all the regions of the world, with the need to make the Council more effective towards the solution of urgent international problems?\n\nFlow can the desire to reduce the level of bureaucracy in the United Nations be reconciled with the efforts to increase the number of permanent members of the Security Council? And will the exercise of the right of veto remain predominant, or should consensus become the main means of adopting decisions?\nThese and many other issues are multidimensional and complex. They affect the interests of many countries, which often have quite different points of view, both in terms of the internal procedures of the United Nations and in terms of the means of settling international problems. It is obvious that this process will be difficult and time- consuming. We have no doubt that, ultimately, the question of increased membership of the Security Council should be considered in the context of the principle of rotation. Countries that now have the necessary capacity and sense of responsibility in respect of the maintenance of peace and security throughout the world, and at the same time are representative of the various regions of the world, should become additional permanent members of the Security Council.\nOur country bases its foreign policy on the realities of the contemporary world. It aims for integration with the world community through equal partnership with all other countries. Of course, our current capabilities are limited, for a number of understandable reasons. None the less, we are ready to contribute whatever is necessary for the resolution of global problems. We are eager to cooperate with countries that are interested, and we are prepared to do so both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the United Nations. We believe that the greater the number of parties involved in the discussion of international problems and of the question of increasing the effectiveness of the international institutions, the more fruitful will be the outcome. Harmonization of the rights of individuals, nations and people, together with a common interest in securing peace and development in the world, should become the main tool for resolving problems.\n\n\n"

He may rest assured\nthat the Hungarian delegation stands ready to assist him\nin carrying out his responsible tasks. Sincere words of\nrecognition should also go to Ambassador Insanally, the\noutgoing President, for the outstanding and\nforward-looking manner in which he conducted the work\nof the previous session of the Assembly.\nAs a representative of the newly elected coalition\nGovernment of the Republic of Hungary, may I be\npermitted first to assure this Assembly of nations that in\nits foreign policy Hungary will continue to serve the\ncause of international peace and stability, with special\nregard to the Central European region. We are committed\nto further developing our political and economic\ntransformation in order to consolidate democracy and\nstabilize the market economy in Hungary.\nOur foreign policy rests on three closely interrelated\nmain pillars, which we treat on an equal footing. First,\nwe are determined to promote the full integration of\nHungary into the Euro-Atlantic institutions. Secondly, we\nseek genuine good-neighbourly relations with all the\ncountries in our region, especially with countries\nbordering ours. And, thirdly, we advocate respect for\nhuman rights, with particular emphasis on the minority\nrights of the millions of Hungarians who live beyond our\nborders. All in all, we intend to conduct our foreign\npolicy in a most pragmatic and realistic manner and will\nact accordingly in our bilateral relations and in\nmultilateral forums as well.\n10\n\n\nOn the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, and in the present post-cold-war era,\nmankind is facing enormous challenges. The euphoria we\nfelt and the great expectations we entertained only\nyesterday, when a new and promising world seemed to be\nemerging, have now taken on a bitter quality.\nAs the bipolar world was falling apart and freedom\nand democracy were sweeping across the globe we had to\nrecognize some negative aspects of those fundamental\nchanges, such as the outbreak of violent nationalism and\nethnic hatred fed by economic and social tensions. The\ninternational community, and notably the United Nations,\nhas proved sometimes unable - and on a number of\noccasions its Member States unwilling - to meet the\ndramatic challenges of our times.\nNew and violent manifestations of intolerance, which\ncaught the world unprepared, aggressive wars and bloody\nethnic conflicts accompanied by crimes against humanity\nand the abhorrent practice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" are today\nunanimously considered issues that ought to have been\ntackled in a timely and resolute way. It is with deep regret\nthat we note that the United Nations, together with other\nrelevant international organizations, instead of preventing\nthe outbreak of crises in a number of areas of the world,\nhas, rather, been trying to react to them, either without the\nnecessary determination or by belated action. Indisputably,\nthe means available to the Organization for coming to grips\nwith the many international problems were stretched far\nbeyond existing capacities. We believe, however, that the\ntime has come to take a good hard look at the role the\nUnited Nations is called upon to play and to devise new\nways and means by which it can fulfil its raison d\u2019\u00eatre in\nour troubled contemporary world.\nWe therefore reinforce our support for the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Agenda for Peace and continue to regard it as a\nforward-oriented plan of action for the years to come. In\nthis regard, we consider that special efforts should be made\nto resolve the problems facing United Nations\npeace-keeping operations, with a view to improving their\nefficiency and capability.\nIn the event we are unable to find adequate answers to\nour failures and missed opportunities, we may well be on\nthe verge of losing the precious benefits we have gained\nand the potential prospects that opened up at the end of the\ncold war for the international community, including the\nUnited Nations, to create a qualitatively new, cooperative\nworld order.\nAs has often been stated, we live in a time of great\ncontrasts that are also reflected at the United Nations.\nWe welcome the momentous results and encouraging\nprogress in South Africa just outlined by His Excellency\nPresident Nelson Mandela, as well as those in the Middle\nEast. The assumption of office by the first democratically\nelected President and Government of South Africa and its\nnormalization of relations with its neighbours, the signing\nof the Declaration of Principles by Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and the beginning of its\nimplementation, the breakthrough in relations between\nJordan and Israel and the hopeful evolution of talks\nbetween Syria and Israel, are all truly historic\nachievements and bode well for the future.\nThe forthcoming 1995 Conference of the Parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nwill be an event of cardinal importance which can further\nenhance the aforesaid positive tendencies. Hungary is\nkeenly interested in ensuring the indefinite and\nunconditional extension of the Treaty and is ready to\ncontribute to achieving this important goal. Recent events\nhave once again reinforced our conviction with regard to\nthe critical significance of such an act.\nIf the United Nations wants to live up to the\npromising processes, it must, first of all, adjust itself to\nthe new realities. It would, therefore, do well to get rid\nof outdated, anachronistic resolutions which have nothing\nmore to do with present-day developments.\nIt must, however, be admitted that attempts to tackle\ncrises in the former Yugoslavia, in Somalia, in Rwanda\nand elsewhere have not yielded conclusive evidence of\nthe ability of the United Nations to find the right answers\nto major hotbeds of tension.\nBecause of its geographical proximity, Hungary has\nfollowed with particularly grave concern the devastation\nand suffering across its southern borders, first and\nforemost in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia. We\nhave supported to the best of our abilities the efforts of\nthe international community aimed at finding a just\nsolution to that human drama. The basis for the solution\nof this unprecedented crisis in the heart of Europe exists.\nThe principles of the United Nations Charter and those\nadopted by the International Conference on Yugoslavia\nare there. They include respect for the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of countries, the inadmissibility of\nacquisition of territory by force, the elimination of the\nconsequences of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", the return of refugees\nand displaced persons and the protection of human rights,\n11\n\n\nincluding the rights of minorities. These principles should\nnever be ignored if we are to reach a just and lasting\nsettlement in Bosnia, Croatia and elsewhere.\nHungary has a vital stake in the restoration of peace\nand international legality in the former Yugoslavia. The\nvolatile situation of the sizeable Hungarian ethnic\ncommunity in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia\nand Montenegro), the interruption of traditionally close\neconomic ties with our southern neighbours, the serious\nlosses we have suffered as a consequence of the sanctions\nregime imposed by the Security Council on the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, all inspire us towards an active\ninvolvement in the search for a durable and equitable\nsettlement in those tortured lands. In achieving that goal\nwe expect the international community to uphold the\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and to\nenforce the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\nWe also expect that appropriate ways will be found in the\ncourse of post-conflict peace-building there to alleviate the\nburden of losses incurred as a result of the sanctions regime\nby the countries most directly affected, such as Hungary.\nHungary is following with keen interest the\nencouraging process of the revitalization of the United\nNations. In this respect, I wish to reaffirm that we attach\nparticular importance to the question of the reform of the\nSecurity Council with a view to ensuring its transparency,\nrepresentative character and effective functioning, in order\nto better reflect the realities of our contemporary world. In\nthis context we fully concur with others in supporting\npermanent membership in the Security Council for\nGermany and Japan.\nHungary welcomes the ever-growing recognition that\nin maintaining international peace and security regional\norganizations should be given a more decisive role. In our\nview, the time has come to work out the necessary\narrangements whereby regional organizations can effectively\ncontribute to conflict resolution, namely, preventive\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking and post-conflict\npeace-building. We endorse the proposition that by\ninvolving the regional organizations under the umbrella of\nthe United Nations, and in particular of the Security\nCouncil, in the safeguarding or restoration of international\npeace and security, our world can indeed be made a much\nsafer place. We, for our part, are prepared to share in\nefforts at securing wider participatory action.\nThis autumn Hungary is honoured to act as host in\nBudapest of the next Review Conference and summit\nmeeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (CSCE). We expect the Conference and the\nsummit meeting not only to contribute to the better\nfunctioning of this important regional arrangement but\nalso to serve as a useful vehicle in the efforts towards a\ndemocratic and integrated Europe where rationalism may\nprevail over nationalism. Furthermore, we are convinced\nthat success within the CSCE is not only beneficial to the\npeoples living in the CSCE region but that it can also\nunderpin efforts at conflict prevention and crisis\nresolution in other parts of the world. In this context we\nbelieve that the realization of the Dutch-German proposal\nto establish a genuine and practical division of\nresponsibilities between the CSCE and the United Nations\nin the settlement of conflicts within the CSCE region,\nwhile upholding the principles and provisions embodied\nin the relevant chapters of the United Nations Charter,\ncould well be a major step forward.\nFollowing the Budapest Summit, when Hungary is\nto take over for a year the duties of the\nchairmanship-in-office of the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), I personally intend to pay\nparticular attention to the consolidation of mutually\nadvantageous cooperation between the CSCE and the\nUnited Nations which is so promisingly unfolding.\nPromotion and protection of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms are a high priority of Hungary\u2019s\nforeign policy. In this connection, I would like to recall\nthat in the Vienna Declaration of the World Conference\non Human Rights it was solemnly stated that the\npromotion and protection of all human rights is a\nlegitimate concern of the international community.\nConsequently, we find it indispensable that, in this spirit,\nthe United Nations should act in the defence of human\nrights, irrespective of where violations of those rights\noccur.\nIn our world of interdependence and growing\ninteraction, Hungary calls for the development by the\nUnited Nations of an integrated response-capacity to\ncombat the repeated waves of human rights violations.\nWe view with serious concern the alarming increases in\nthe reported cases of gross violations of human rights, as\nwell as the frequent occurrence of such violations in\nsituations of internal armed conflicts or ethnic strife.\nThese developments have serious repercussions affecting\npeace, security and stability in the given region and\nbeyond. In this regard, we should be mindful of the\nrequirements laid down in the Vienna Declaration for all\nGovernments to promote and protect human rights in their\nown countries, regardless of their political, economic and\n12\n\n\ncultural structures. On the one hand, an open and active\ndialogue, simultaneously constructive and critical, needs to\nbe established and sustained in order to promote the\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. On\nthe other hand, a stronger commitment to economic and\nsocial development in various areas of the world would\nconsiderably facilitate the observance of these universal\nvalues.\nBy the same token, we believe that the United Nations\nhas not yet exhausted the means available for the\ninternational protection of human rights. We urge the\ninternational community to seek new and innovative means\nand methods to safeguard the rights and freedoms of our\nfellow human beings, wherever they may live. We wish to\nsee the United Nations embark in a timely manner - within\nthe framework of preventive diplomacy - upon the road of\ninternational protection of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms. Rather than responding only to reported human\nrights violations, the United Nations should build effective\npreventive mechanisms into its activities whenever the need\narises. The notion of preventive protection should also\ninclude adequate international monitoring.\nFollowing decisions of the competent organs of the\nUnited Nations, such as the Security Council or the\nCommission on Human Rights, civilian human rights\nmonitors could be deployed if in any part of the world the\nhuman rights situation so warranted. Hungary, for its part,\nis prepared to participate with monitors in joint actions of\nthe international community in this field.\nIn these endeavours, we also count on the effective\nparticipation of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nThe High Commissioner has had our full support ever since\nhe assumed his office, and we pledge our cooperation in the\ncarrying out of all aspects of his mandate. We would like\nto reiterate that adequate financing of the human rights\nactivities of the United Nations should be ensured through\nthe regular budget.\nI cannot conclude without mentioning the issue of\nsustainable development, with its many aspects covering\nindustrial and agricultural development, trade, human\nresources, regional cooperation, protection of the\nenvironment, and so forth. Clearly, what is at stake here is\nour ability to tackle these global issues without delay. The\ngrowing sensitivity with regard to these questions cannot\nbut be welcome. We consider the work of the United\nNations Conference on Population and Development, held\nrecently in Cairo, to be an important step in that direction\nat a time when contrasts between requirements of human\ndevelopment and limited resources are becoming more\nand more evident.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that Hungary\ncontinues to be a strong supporter of multilateralism.\nNations are looking to this Organization for protection\nand assistance. We must not let them down in these\ncritical times. In spite of failures, we should keep faith\nwith the United Nations and meet the challenges which,\nin the final analysis, will determine mankind\u2019s destiny in\nthe new millennium.\n"

        "file_text": "May I congratulate Foreign\nMinister Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. I am confident that he will steer our work to a\nsuccessful conclusion, and I pledge him the full support of\nmy delegation.\nI wish also to take this opportunity to express my\nGovernment\u2019s satisfaction that South Africa, which now\ntakes its place as a full and respected member of the\ncommunity of nations, has been reinstated in the General\nAssembly.\nIt is a much-vaunted truth that the end of the cold war\nhas released the United Nations from the bondage of a\nworld obsessed with military security. But there is another\nchange at work - perhaps less abrupt but equally\nepoch-making - in the international system which has far-\nreaching implications for our world Organization. I refer\nto the progressive intertwining of the destinies of the\ndifferent peoples of the world, the globalization of the\nworld economy, the communications revolution and the\nincreasingly transnational nature of the issues of human\nsurvival, be they environmental problems, poverty,\nrefugees or population pressures, and the eroding capacity\nof the nation-State to address them single-handedly.\nGlobal interdependence is causing greater demands\nto be made on the United Nations than at any previous\ntime. The will to cooperate is gradually replacing the\nspirit of confrontation throughout the world. At the same\ntime, it is not clear that we have created an organization\nequal to the task of meeting the host of new demands.\nThough adept at analysing their sources, we are still\ninclined to deal with conflicts only after they arise instead\nof preventing them. The dangers we face may be novel,\nbut the structures we draw on to cope with them derive\nfrom a world that has largely vanished from view. Last\nbut not least, we saddle the United Nations with new\nresponsibilities without providing adequate resources to\ntackle them. In this way, a discrepancy has come about\nbetween our expectations of the United Nations and the\nability to deliver on them.\nWhile our main challenge should be to seek to\ntransform the United Nations into a more effective\ninstrument for dealing with issues that truly are beyond\nthe compass of the nation-State, we should also bear in\nmind that the United Nations was not designed to be a\nsubstitute for national Governments. Wherever possible\nthe United Nations should work with its Member States\nin areas where they are competent and draw to the\nmaximum extent possible on regional organizations. In\nso doing, we reduce the burden on the United Nations and\nfacilitate the setting of priorities.\nLooked at in this perspective, a number of\ndevelopments over the past 12 months give the United\nNations reason for encouragement. Democracy and the\nprinciples of the free market are making new inroads, and\nthe protection of human rights is gaining momentum in\nmany parts of the world. In Eastern Europe the process\nof democratic change is now irreversible. The negotiated\nwithdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic States has\nremoved from the European continent one of the last\nvestiges of the cold war. In Northern Ireland there is for\nthe first time since early this century a realistic chance of\nlasting peace and stability. In the Middle East the\nbreakthrough achieved last year has been consolidated\nwith the Gaza-Jericho Agreement and a peace accord\nbetween Israel and Jordan, hopefully paving the way for\na comprehensive peace settlement in the entire region.\n18\n\n\nIn South Africa, the spirit of dialogue has finally\ntriumphed over the forces of hatred and racism, offering a\nmodel of tolerance for other countries on the troubled\nAfrican continent. In Western Sahara, there are brightening\nprospects, provided that all the relevant parties do their part\nin creating the necessary climate of confidence to enable\nthe people of Western Sahara to decide their own destiny\nin a democratic election.\nBut there have also been setbacks. Gross violations of\nhuman rights have continued in places as far apart as Haiti\nand East Timor. The tragic injustice in the former\nYugoslavia, the chaos in Somalia, as well as the terrible\ncarnage inflicted on the people of Rwanda by their own\ncompatriots, demonstrate the intractable nature of many of\nthe conflicts that our Organization is being called upon to\ndeal with. Unlike the inter-State conflicts which\ntraditionally have preoccupied the United Nations, these are\nconflicts taking place within the confines of the nation-\nState, where legitimate authority has either collapsed or\nbeen emaciated by civil strife. As the Organization adapts\nitself to the new demands of the post-cold-war era, ways\nmust be found to address such internal crises in full\nconformity with the United Nations Charter.\nTo heed this call, greater attention must now be\nconcentrated on the preventive dimension. Much effort has\nin recent years been devoted to peace-keeping, which now\nextends to non-military operations, including electoral\nassistance, the provision of humanitarian relief and human\nrights monitoring. This is as it should be, and countries\ncontributing substantially to such peace-keeping operations\ncertainly deserve both our gratitude and respect. At the\nsame time, we must make sure that the necessary resources\nare also allocated to development.\nOne of the lessons we have learned in recent years is\nthat we must focus more intently on the link between peace\nand development. Increasingly, we have come to\nunderstand that peace and security require solutions to\nsocial and economic problems, that without development\nthere can be no peace. In this connection, I wish to pay\nspecial tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, whose agenda for development, submitted\ntwo years after his pathbreaking Agenda for Peace, has\nsharpened our awareness of the need for creating an\ninfrastructure of peace.\nFor there to be a stable and lasting infrastructure of\npeace, a number of elements must be in place: a\ncommitment to democracy and respect for human rights, a\nsound social fabric, a growing economy and a sustainable\nnatural environment.\nAs a representative of one of the world\u2019s oldest\ndemocracies \u2014 one which celebrates the fiftieth\nanniversary of its second republic this year \u2014 I cannot be\naccused of underrating the redeeming virtues of\ndemocracy, which, as was pointed out earlier in this\ndebate, fosters the greatest force behind social and\neconomic progress: individual creativity. Democracies,\nas a rule, also tend to honour human rights. By\npromoting tolerance and respect for the dignity of the\nindividual, we contribute to preventing cultural, ethnic\nand territorial conflicts. For good reason, human rights\nare therefore increasingly being considered as an integral\npart of the notion of extended security. It is thus to be\nregretted that the efforts of the United Nations in this\nimportant field continue to be strained due to lack of\nfinancial resources.\nThe effective implementation and monitoring of\nhuman rights standards, not least with respect to\nvulnerable groups, should be a matter of priority for the\nUnited Nations. The plight of children in some parts of\nthe world gives cause for grave concern. Four years ago,\nthe largest gathering of world political leaders assembled\nhere in this Hall of the General Assembly and endorsed\nthe principle that children should have the first call on the\nresources of society essential to their survival, protection\nand development. Next year we will assess how far we\nhave come in honouring the commitments undertaken by\nthe Summit for Children. At the same time we will be\ncelebrating the half-centenary of the United Nations. In\nthe view of my Government, this milestone event should\nbe used to give new impetus to efforts to ensure that\nchildren are given the best social conditions the world\ncommunity can offer.\nAs it happens, the fiftieth anniversary celebrations\nwill coincide with the Beijing Conference on the status of\nwomen. The timing is significant as the goals of\nachieving equality, empowerment and security for women\nare key to the social agenda of the United Nations as it\nmakes the transition into its second half-century.\nImproving the status of women is of paramount\nimportance for the well-being of the family, and has\npositive multiplier effects on overall levels of education,\nhealth and population growth in society as a whole.\nConversely, where society has broken down or social\nsafety-nets are inadequate, women assume the largest\nburden. There is therefore a direct link between the\n19\n\n\nFourth World Conference on Women, the recent\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\nheld in Cairo and the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, to be held in Copenhagen next spring. The\nCopenhagen summit will afford us a much needed\nopportunity to focus attention on the social ills that\ncompromise the ability of nations to develop their full\npotential, be they poverty or disease, homelessness or\nhunger, joblessness or social exclusion, crime or violence.\nFifty years after the United Nations avowed in its Charter\nto promote social progress and better standards of living in\ngreater freedom, the time has come to put sustainable\nhuman development at the top of the Organization\u2019s\nagenda.\nIn relieving the plight of the most underprivileged\nsegments of the world\u2019s population, the role of economic\ngrowth can hardly be overstated. The abolition of trade\nbarriers is the single most important factor for world\neconomic growth. Just as a rising tide lifts the boats, so an\nincrease in world trade will create new jobs and raise\nincomes around the world. My Government therefore\nstrongly welcomes the establishment of the World Trade\nOrganization and urges other signatory States to ratify the\nUruguay-Round Agreement without undue delay.\nFocusing on economic progress must not, however,\nblind us to the need to keep an eye on other areas, which,\nif neglected, might strip us of the harvest of increased\nprosperity. One such area is the environment. Over the\npast few years the United Nations has made significant\nheadway in its efforts to promote sustainable development\nworldwide. The results of the Rio Conference on\nEnvironment and development provide a sound basis for\nfurther work. As we now assume the momentous task of\ndevelopment, measures must also be taken to protect the\nenvironment from detrimental patterns of production and\nconsumption.\nWhile recognizing the need to take a balanced view of\nthe ecosystem as a whole, Iceland remains particularly\nconcerned over the deteriorating condition of the world\u2019s\noceans. It is a hopeful sign that the international\ncommunity has shown increasing awareness of the\nimportance of the sustainable utilization of the living\nresources of the sea. It has been estimated that the poorest\ntwo-thirds of the world\u2019s population get about 40 percent of\ntheir protein from fish, and that food production must more\nthan double just to keep pace with the growth in demand in\nthe decades ahead. To meet this growth, it will be\nnecessary to rely not only on agriculture but also - and to\nan increasing extent - on the sustainable utilization of the\nliving resources of the sea.\nSuch considerations notwithstanding, the ecosystem\nof the sea is now in greater danger than ever before from\npollution and overfishing. Protecting the oceans against\nthe repercussions of economic and industrial expansion\nwill pose a major challenge to the international\ncommunity in the years ahead. Although much has been\naccomplished, existing conventions aimed at containing\nthe pollution of the marine environment cover only a part\nof the problem, as no global scheme addressing pollution\nfrom land-based activities is in place. For this reason,\nIceland attaches great importance to the Conference on\nthe Protection of the Marine Environment from\nLand-based Activities, to be convened in Washington next\nyear under the auspices of the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme. We urge all States and relevant\ninternational agencies to participate actively in the\npreparatory process, commencing officially in Reykjavik\nin March next year.\nThe responsible use of fisheries resources is,\nhowever, no less important than combatting the threat of\nmarine pollution. The universal acceptance of the\nsovereignty of the coastal State over its adjacent waters\nwas a necessary precondition of the effective management\nby the world community of the living resources of the\nsea. The application of the United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea, which extended the rule of law to\nover two thirds of the Earth\u2019s surface, has contributed\nmore than any single undertaking to the furtherance of\nthat goal. Against this background, Iceland particularly\nwelcomes the fact that this Convention, a crowning\nachievement in the progressive development of\ninternational law under the auspices of the United\nNations, will come into force in only a few weeks\u2019 time.\nMy country remains strongly committed to the\nestablishment of an international regime governing all\naspects of the utilization of living marine resources,\nincluding the high seas. For this reason, Iceland has\nactively supported the drafting of a legally binding and\ncomprehensive instrument that would ensure the effective\nmanagement and conservation of fisheries outside the\neconomic zone of the coastal State. In Iceland\u2019s view,\nthis goal could best be achieved by establishing regional\nfisheries management organizations or arrangements open\nto States with legitimate interests in the relevant fisheries.\nSuch provisions should not, however, be understood as\nimplying approval of existing forms of cooperation based,\nin some instances, on unilateral decisions by a few States\n20\n\n\naimed at excluding other neighbouring States,\nnotwithstanding the latter\u2019s overwhelming dependence on\nand proximity to the fisheries in question. Indeed,\nunjustified discrimination would defeat the very aim of\nestablishing a new high seas fisheries regime for the benefit\nof all nations.\nThe global challenge of development calls for bold\nnew thinking, backed by the solid commitment of the\ninternational community to the goals enshrined in the\nUnited Nations Charter. It also demands that we try to\nestablish consensus on the restructuring and reform of our\nOrganization in the near future. Efforts must be made to\nimprove the representational capacity and efficiency of the\nSecurity Council and at the same time preserve the\nconstitutional balance between the various organs of the\nOrganization, not least between the Council and the General\nAssembly.\nWe find ourselves on the threshold of a new era. Yet,\nwe are far from having rid ourselves completely of the\nlegacy of the cold war, which includes immense quantities\nof armaments and the technology for producing them. It\nwould certainly be disastrous if the recent transformation of\nthe international security environment were to be\nundermined by the growing proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction.\nIn this connection, my Government deems it of the\nutmost importance that the Convention on chemical\nweapons enter into force next year and that the Convention\non Biological Weapons be further reinforced. In addition,\nthe indefinite and unconditional extension of the\nnon-proliferation Treaty would be the single most\nsignificant measure against the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons. This should be followed up by universal\nadherence to the nuclear-test moratorium and the conclusion\nof a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\nAs we inaugurate the second half-century of the\nUnited Nations, what better gift could the community of\nnations bestow on itself? And in what better way could we\nmake a clean break with the cold war era?\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to\nextend to Mr. Amara Essy the warmest congratulations of\nthe Greek Government on his election to the presidency of\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are\nparticularly pleased that his presence this year will provide\nthe African States, with which Greece maintains excellent\nrelations, with a further opportunity to make an essential\ncontribution to the successful outcome of our work. I\nwould also like to thank Ambassador Insanally for the\nconstructive and efficient manner in which he performed\nhis duties as President of the General Assembly during its\nforty-eighth session.\nI wish to take this opportunity to address sincere\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is striving with\ncourage, energy, political will, vision and perspicacity for\na new world, a world in which law and ethics will prevail,\nand for the restructuring of the Organization to enable it to\nmeet the challenges of our time. He has our full support in\nhis efforts to fulfil his mission.\nThe Foreign Minister of Germany, in his capacity as\nPresident of the Council of the European Union, delivered\na statement yesterday on behalf of the European Union and\nits member States. My Government subscribes to its\ncontent. However, I should like to address some issues of\nparticular interest to Greece which, apart from the statement\nof my German colleague, Klaus Kinkel, are further\nelaborated in the European Union\u2019s memorandum.\nThe United Nations is facing the challenges and\npreoccupations of our times. And now, more than ever, it\nmust become the forum to which all those who are\nsuffering injustice will naturally resort, knowing that justice\nwill be done. To this end, it is the duty of all to abide by\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which\nthey have accepted of their own free will, and to observe\nthe rules, to the development and establishment of which\nthey have contributed. In this context, all must respect\nUnited Nations resolutions, particularly those of the\nSecurity Council, the body on which the international\ncommunity has conferred primary responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This is the\nonly way in which we can strengthen the moral stature of\nthe United Nations and contribute to the attainment of its\ngoals.\nBearing this in mind, we welcome and strongly\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General in the area of\npreventive diplomacy and the maintenance and promotion\nof international peace and security, within a broader\nframework which, in addition to the political and military\naspects, also has an economic and social dimension,\nparticularly with respect to the protection of human rights\nand fundamental freedoms.\nRespect for human rights constitutes one of the most\nimportant factors for the maintenance of international\npeace and security and must be regarded as a prerequisite\nfor development in all areas and for democratic existence.\nThe Vienna World Conference on Human Rights was an\nimportant milestone, as was the establishment of the post\nof High Commissioner for Human Rights, whose mandate\nwe fully support, and the mission of the Centre for\nHuman Rights. The principles of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration\nand Programme of Action, as well as other international\nacts and instruments, should guide the actions of all\nMember States on a daily basis.\nThe international community is called upon to\nconfront many problems among the Members of the\nOrganization. Fortunately, considerable progress has been\nachieved during the past year with regard to some of\nthem.\nI should like first to refer to the case of the Middle\nEast. Greece, a neighbouring country and a traditional\nfriend of the peoples in the region, is particularly pleased\nby the continuous and promising steps taken recently to\nstrengthen peace and security and to arrive at satisfactory\narrangements for the Palestinian people, steps which will\nopen up prospects for a final, generally acceptable,\nsettlement of the long-lasting Middle East crisis.\nThe other case I should like to mention is that of the\nrestoration of democracy in South Africa. Who would\nnot agree that the peaceful change achieved in that\ncountry by leaders such as President Mandela and\nVice-President De Klerk, is an example to follow? This\nchange was made possible, however, only because both\nmen had the will to abolish the system of apartheid and\nto establish a democracy based on tolerance and respect\nfor human rights.\nIn both cases Greece did its utmost to contribute to\nthe successful outcome of the efforts pursued to achieve\nthese results.\n23\n\n\nHowever, during the same period of time, mankind\nhas had to endure crises which have caused incalculable\nloss of human life and tremendous suffering.\nUnfortunately, there are many such examples that could be\nmentioned in Africa, Asia, Central America and Europe.\nRwanda, whose tragedy borders on genocide, is one of the\nmost telling cases. Greece, as a member of the European\ntroika, took part in a mission of the European Union to\nRwanda and its neighbouring countries, in order to assist in\nthe task of finding solutions to this tragic political conflict\nand to the problem of the refugees.\nAs a representative of a Balkan country that has a\nprimary interest in stability in the Balkans, and contributes\ndecisively to its consolidation, I will now refer specifically\nto the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, which continues to\nbe a source of serious concern to the international\ncommunity, and to European countries in particular.\nIn spite of the major efforts of the international\ncommunity, war is raging in the region for the fourth\nconsecutive year. The victims on all sides are countless\nand the number of refugees is increasing dramatically.\nGreece actively participates in all international\npeace-making efforts. During the first part of this year\nwhen Greece held the presidency of the European Union,\nmy country undertook a series of initiatives, aimed at\narriving at a political solution of the conflict through\nnegotiations.\nThe proposals of the contact group constitute a\nrealistic basis for a settlement and must be accepted by the\nBosnian Serb side as well. President Milosevic\u2019s decisive\nstance vis-\u00e0-vis the Bosnian Serbs strengthens this\napproach, and we hope that it will lead the Bosnian Serbs\nto accept the peace plan. In this context, we welcome\nSecurity Council resolutions 942 (1994) and 943 (1994).\nThe concentration of efforts aimed at ending the war\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina does not mean that less\nattention should be paid to a solution of the problem of the\nKrajinas, nor that its importance should be underestimated.\nGreece is willing to contribute actively to the\nrapprochement of the parties involved, so that a mutually\nacceptable settlement might be achieved.\nWe have, however, inherited yet another problem since\nthe dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, that of the Former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It lies in the fact that\nthe new State insists on calling itself \\\"Macedonia\\\". The\nGreek people and the Greek Government cannot accept this\ndenomination because, together with provisions of the\nConstitution of Skopje, of the Former Yugoslav Republic\nof Macedonia, the propaganda against our country, as\nwell as the appropriation of Greek national and historical\nemblems on their flag, it indicates irredentist claims\nagainst Greece. We hope that the good offices of Mr.\nVance, on the basis of Security Council resolution 817\n(1993), and the ensuing negotiating process within which\nGreece has demonstrated its good will and constructive\napproach, will soon bear fruit.\nAnother serious international and European problem,\nwhich is of considerable interest to the United Nations,\nthe European Union and Greece in particular and which,\nunfortunately, remains unsolved, is that of Cyprus. More\nthan 20 years after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and 20\nyears after this body, in this very Hall, demanded the\nimmediate withdrawal of all foreign occupation troops, a\nconsiderable part of Cyprus is still under occupation.\nBasic human rights are still being violated, and the\ntragedy of the refugees and of the missing and enclaved\npersons persists. Furthermore, in spite of the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions, the mass establishment of\nTurkish settlers continues unabated, thus distorting the\ndemographic composition of the island.\nThe Secretary-General, in his latest report to the\nSecurity Council, unequivocally acknowledged that it is\nthe lack of political will of the Turkish Cypriot side that,\nover a number of years, has impeded any progress in the\npeace process. In spite of the many face-saving efforts\nbeing made, the Secretary-General\u2019s conclusion cannot be\nquestioned. But even if some would wish to deliberately\nhide from the truth, the recent decision of the Turkish\nCypriots, which rejects the very basis for a settlement -\nnamely the Federation - that had been agreed and sought\nfrom the start, as well as the unequivocal and\nunconditional support that this decision received from\nAnkara, revealed the true Turkish sentiments and\nobjectives: contempt for the United Nations resolutions\nand the preservation of illegally acquired territories\nfollowing the invasion and the occupation.\nThere can be no doubt that this Turkish attitude of\nprovocation is supported by the Turkish military presence\non the island, which has gone unpunished for so many\nyears. That is the reason why we believe that the efforts\nof the international community should focus, as a matter\nof priority, on the withdrawal of the Turkish occupying\ntroops. In this context, President Clerides\u2019 fair and\nbalanced proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus\nshould be duly taken into consideration.\n24\n\n\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s recent efforts are in progress,\nand we are awaiting their results. However, mere verbal\nsupport by the international community for the Secretary--\nGeneral\u2019s initiative will not suffice. The time has come to\nassist the Secretary-General with concrete actions aimed at\nAnkara, which is, of course, the key factor for\ndevelopments in Cyprus. If, however, those efforts are not\nsuccessful, as has happened in other cases, the international\ncommunity will have to consider new, alternative methods\nand measures that will ensure the implementation of United\nNations resolutions calling for the restoration of the\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic\nof Cyprus, together with respect for the rights and freedoms\nof all its citizens.\nThe strengthening of good-neighbourly relations on the\nbasis of respect for international law, national sovereignty,\nhuman rights and non-intervention in the internal affairs of\nother States is the cornerstone of Greek foreign policy. The\nimplementation of those principles bears particular\nimportance with regard to the relations between Greece and\nits neighbours. In this context, it is the sincere wish of the\nGreek Government that relations between Greece and\nTurkey be normalized.\nIt goes without saying that such a normalization of\nGreek-Turkish relations presupposes a just and lasting\nsolution to the Cyprus problem and the restoration of the\nrule of international law with regard to Cyprus. Moreover,\nrespect for international law and human rights, in\nconformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United\nNations, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris, is\nthe only possible basis for the establishment and\nconsolidation of a climate of mutual trust between Greece\nand Turkey.\nGreece abides by the same principles in its foreign\npolicy towards Albania. We aspire, through a dialogue\nwhich we have repeatedly sought, to the development of\ngood-neighbourly relations and cooperation in all areas,\nwithin a framework of mutual respect for territorial\nintegrity and national sovereignty and of the unconditional\nimplementation of international instruments that safeguard\nrespect for human rights.\nAmple evidence of this policy is provided by the\nextensive and multifaceted economic and humanitarian\nassistance that my country has extended to Albania in\nrecent years, in support of that country\u2019s reconstruction\nfollowing a long period of totalitarian rule and in support\nof its economy by various means, including, inter alia, the\nmassive flow of remittances from illegal Albanian\nimmigrants, hundreds of thousands of whom live and\nwork illegally in Greece.\nOn the other hand, the large Greek minority in\nAlbania had been deprived by the previous regime of all\nits fundamental rights and had hoped that a change in\nGovernment would lead to a change in their conditions.\nUnfortunately, however, the new Albanian Government\nhas pursued the same policies of its predecessors.\nMembers of the minority are persecuted, and many\ninternationally recognized fundamental human and\nminority rights are being violated in practice and not\nadmitted to, in spite of the verbal assurances to the\ncontrary of the Albanian Government. This is the case,\nfor instance, in the field of education, with which the\nHigh Commissioner for National Minorities of the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Mr.\nVan Der Stoel, with whom the Greek Government is\nharmoniously cooperating, has been especially concerned.\nThe oppressive policy of the Albanian Government\nhas culminated in the harsh sentences delivered against\nfive leading members of the Greek minority, after a\nparody of investigation and judicial procedure, as\nwitnessed by unprejudiced observers from international\norganizations. All the above justifies the impression that\nthe Albanian leadership is promoting a climate of\nharassment against the Greek minority, so as to force its\nmembers to abandon their ancestral homes.\nGreece reaffirms that, as it has assured the\nSecretary-General, it sincerely favours the development of\ngood-neighbourly relations and constructive cooperation\nwith Albania, and calls on the Albanian Government, in\nconformity with its international commitments, to respect\nthe human rights and the individual freedoms of the\nGreek minority, so as to create the conditions necessary\nto ensure the development of such relations.\nThere are many other problems on which I would\nlike to express the views of my country. However, time\nis limited and I will constrain myself to addressing those\nwe deem particularly important.\nSignificant and daring steps have been taken in the\narea of disarmament. In spite of the end of the\nconfrontation between East and West, however, arms\ncontrol and disarmament remain issues of primary\nimportance due to the appearance of new sources of\ntension which jeopardize our efforts towards the\nnon-proliferation of arms.\n25\n\n\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) has played an important role to this day,\nand we believe that its unconditional and unlimited\nextension at the coming Conference of 1995 will further\nstrengthen the overall legal status of non-proliferation.\nWe also hope that negotiations for a comprehensive\nnuclear-test-ban treaty will soon yield positive results.\nMoreover, Greece hopes to contribute to the entry into\nforce of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical\nWeapons at the earliest possible date by promoting without\ndelay the relevant ratification procedures.\nFurthermore, my country is deeply concerned about\nthe problem of the increasing presence of mines and other\nunexploded devices and has decided to declare a\nmoratorium, without exception, on the export, sale or\ntransfer of all anti-personnel land-mines. We call on all\nStates to adopt similar measures.\nIt is time to accelerate and strengthen multilateral\nnegotiations in the area of disarmament. The international\ncommunity should prove that it is ready and willing to take\nthe steps which will bring about practical solutions to the\nproblem of disarmament and international security. We\nbelieve that an increase of the membership of the\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva would greatly\ncontribute to that end.\nIn addition, special attention should be given to the\nAfrican continent, not only regarding the settlement of\npolitical disputes between various States but also with\nregard to the establishment of the necessary political,\neconomic and social conditions for the restoration of peace\nand security and the improvement of the economic situation\nin all African countries.\nThe United Nations rightly places special emphasis on\nthe economic and social fields, which are so essential to\npeaceful coexistence among peoples. We must all\nthoroughly consider the Agenda for Development and\nattempt to find a way for developing countries to benefit\nfrom the achievements of industrialized States. We must\nwork together to find a new form of economic relations,\ntaking into account the difficulties with which we are all\nconfronted.\nThe International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment which has just taken place in Cairo, the\nforthcoming World Summit for Social Development, in\nCopenhagen, in March 1995, and the Fourth World\nConference on Women, in Beijing, in September 1995, as\nwell as all the other meetings that took place last year on\neconomic and social issues, are paving the way in the\nright direction.\nMoreover, I feel it necessary to underline the\nimportance that Greece attaches to the struggle against the\ninternational scourge of terrorism. My country\nunequivocally condemns all terrorist acts and actively\ncontributes - working within the framework of close\ncooperation with third countries and competent\ninternational organizations - to all actions and efforts\naimed at their elimination. However, I want to stress that\neconomic and social development, safeguarding the rule\nof law and respect for human rights and individual\nfreedoms are the most efficient and radical means to do\naway, once and for all, with this international scourge.\nIn concluding, I would like to express my country\u2019s\ninterest in the future development of the institutional\naspects of the Organization, in particular with regard to\nthe Security Council, and to stress that Greece is willing\nto contribute actively to the consultations currently under\nway on these issues so as to achieve the best possible\nresult for all Members of the United Nations.\nIn the same spirit, I would like to reaffirm Greece\u2019s\nfull and unwavering commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples of the Organization within the context of\ninternational cooperation and solidarity. We undertake to\ncontribute with all our means to the struggles and efforts\nto create lasting conditions that will ensure, at the dawn\nof the next millennium, that all peoples fully enjoy the\nbenefits of freedom and development within a peaceful,\ndemocratic and creative environment.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, first, to express my sincere satisfaction on the\noccasion of your election, Sir, as President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session and to wish you every\nsuccess in your work.\nI should like also to thank the President of the last\nsession, Mr. Samuel Insanally, for the work he did.\nI express my deep gratitude to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts to\nstrengthen peace and security throughout the world. I\nshould like to extend to him my very special appreciation,\nespecially for his keen interest in the problems of our\nyoung State, which is going through a complicated period\nof its history.\nIt is with a sense of excitement and pride that I am\naddressing this Assembly from the podium of the most\nauthoritative international forum. For the first time, the\nPresident of an independent Azerbaijan is representing his\ncountry before the international community, a country that\nhas been recognized by this community and has joined it\nas an equal among equals.\nThe Azerbaijani people have striven for freedom for\ncenturies. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union\nthey gained their national independence. Our Republic\nhas embarked upon the road of constructing a law-based,\ndemocratic and civilized State. This is a complicated\nprocess; it cannot be completed overnight, but we are\nsteadily moving towards our goal. During a short period\nof time a great deal has been accomplished, and all the\nconditions have been created for the formation of a\nlaw-based, democratic society. We have evolved in our\nRepublic a multi-party system, firmly based on the\nprinciples of political pluralism and freedom of the\nindividual, speech, the press and conscience, as well as\nprinciples of respect for human rights and the rule of law.\nAll citizens of multinational Azerbaijan enjoy equal\nrights, irrespective of their racial, religious and linguistic\naffiliations.\nPolitical changes and the democratization of the\ncountry have created the conditions for carrying out deep\n\n\neconomic reforms, ensuring a transition to a market\neconomy. We fully encourage the development of free\nenterprise and private initiative. We are on the way to\nrealizing a large-scale privatization programme, using world\nexperience based upon common human values - on the\nexperience of leading countries that have already achieved\ngreat success in constructing civilized, prosperous and\ndemocratic societies.\nLocated at the important geopolitical junction of\nEurope and Asia and the focus of the keen interest of many\nPowers, possessing rich natural resources and a substantial\nindustrial potential and guided by the firm will and\nconfidence of the Azerbaijani people, we are carrying out\nthe strategy of strengthening our independence and\nimplementing democratic market reforms. Today, from this\nlofty rostrum, I firmly declare that no one will be able to\nmake the Azerbaijani people stray from this path. We look\nto the future of our country with optimism.\nOur optimism is also linked with historic processes\ntaking place in the world as well as with profound changes\nin the system of international relations. A world order\nbased on equal rights and replacing military and ideological\nconfrontation will certainly form the future basis of this\nsystem. Partnership and enduring peace and security for\neveryone, in accordance with international law and the\nprinciples and provisions of the United Nations Charter, are\nbecoming the fundamental principles of the new world\norder. We see the light at the end of the tunnel, a tunnel\nleading from a world of hostility based on the use of force\nto an era of cooperation and prosperity. We are ready to\nwalk along this road together, hand in hand with all the\nother countries and peoples of the world.\nHowever, the threats looming over mankind have not\nbeen totally eliminated. Old stereotypes still exist, and\nnumerous problems, accumulated over decades of\nconfrontation, especially problems in the sphere of\ndisarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction, have not yet been overcome. Relations\nbetween States with different economic potentials still\nsuffer from the maladies of the past. Time is presenting us\nwith new challenges, challenges linked with environmental\ndifficulties and population and development problems.\nAggressive nationalism and separatism, giving birth to\nconflicts in the Caucasus, the Balkans and other hot spots,\nhave become realities following the collapse of the old\nworld order. These conflicts not only hamper the\ndevelopment of independent States and directly threaten the\nvery existence of fledgling democracies, but also threaten\ninternational security as a whole.\nThat is why, in a post-confrontational world, a\nspecial responsibility rests on the shoulders of\nauthoritative international organizations as well as on\nthose shoulders of the big Powers. Using their political\nweight and their economic, financial and military\nresources, they must more actively direct their potential\ntowards extinguishing the flame of conflicts and towards\nthe consolidation of peace, stability and security\nthroughout the world.\nIt goes without saying that in the construction of a\nnew world order there is a leading role for the United\nNations, which will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary next\nyear, and for its Security Council, which has extensive\nexperience in resolving a number of conflicts and crises.\nHowever, the Security Council will still face the difficult\ntest of proving to the international community its\nefficiency under new conditions. Today, as never before,\nthe Security Council is required to be more persistent in\nachieving guaranteed implementation of its resolutions.\nWe hope that enlargement of the Council will contribute\nto its strengthening.\nWe attach great importance to the role of the\nGeneral Assembly, which is primarily seen as ensuring\nthe closest possible interaction between States in the\ndecision-making process, on the basis of compromises\nand the balance of interests.\nUnder present conditions, one should mention the\nincreased importance of the efficient use by the\nSecretary-General of his powers, as well as the support\nthat must be given him by Member States, which share\nwith him the responsibility for strengthening international\npeace and security.\nGenerally speaking, the Azerbaijani Republic is\noptimistic about the future of the United Nations. We are\ndetermined to continue to protect the lofty principles of\nthe United Nations and to seek improvement in the\nauthority and efficiency of the Organization.\nFor many of those present the notion of war and\narmed conflict may, fortunately, be associated with\nhistory or faraway events. But for my people it is a cruel\nreality and a bloody daily routine.\nFor six years the flame of war has been blazing on\nthe land of Azerbaijan. The Republic of Armenia, under\n2\n\n\nthe pretext of realizing the right to self-determination of an\nethnic group of Armenians living in the Nagorny Karabakh\nregion of Azerbaijan, is openly carrying out plans to annex\nthe territories of our State, to forcibly change its State\nborders and to expel the Azerbaijani people from their\nhomes.\nAll this is cloaked by an arbitrary interpretation of the\nright of peoples to self-determination as meaning a right of\nany ethnic community to proclaim itself independent and to\njoin another State. Such an interpretation of the right to\nself-determination blatantly contradicts the principles of\nState sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any attempt to\nmake this right absolute results in cruel conflicts, which we\nhave witnessed in our region and in other parts of our\nplanet.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has\nexpressed his concern on this issue, saying:\n\\\"... if every ethnic, religious or linguistic group\nclaimed statehood, there would be no limit to\nfragmentation, and peace, security and economic\nwell-being for all would become ever more difficult to\nachieve.\\\" (A/47/277, para. 17)\nI fully agree with Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali that:\n\\\"The sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nindependence of States within the established\ninternational system, and the principle of self-\ndetermination for peoples, both of great value\nand importance, must not be permitted to work\nagainst each other in the period ahead.\\\"\n(ibid, para. 19)\nBeing aware that the international community is\ninsufficiently, and sometimes unilaterally, informed about\nevents in our region, I should like to brief the Assembly on\nthe real situation.\nHaving created a powerful military build-up on the\nterritory of the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, the\nRepublic of Armenia started intensive military activities\nagainst our Republic. With the occupation of the town of\nShusha and of the Lachin region, the annexation of\nNagorny Karabakh was completed, and about 50,000\nresident Azerbaijanis were ousted. Using the Nagorny\nKarabakh springboard, Armenian armed forces then\noccupied another six regions of Azerbaijan: Kalbajar,\nAgdam, Fizuli, Djebrail, Zangelan and Kubatli, which, like\nthe Lachin region, are situated outside the former Nagorny\nKarabakh autonomous region, with a territory four times\nbigger than that of Nagorny Karabakh.\nAs a result of the aggression, more than 20 per cent\nof the territory of Azerbaijan is under occupation by the\narmed forces of the Republic of Armenia. I must\nmention here the huge losses on the Azerbaijani side:\nmore than 20,000 killed, about 100,000 wounded and\n6,000 taken prisoner. In addition, more than 1 million\nAzerbaijanis - about 15 per cent of the population - have\nbecome refugees and live in tents. In their own country\nthey have been deprived of shelter, and they suffer from\nheat, cold and epidemics, and experience shortages of\ntheir basic needs. Seven hundred towns and villages have\nbeen levelled on the occupied Azerbaijani territories;\npractically all the houses, schools, hospitals, and ancient\nmonuments have been burned down and looted.\nI think there is no need to prove that here we are\ndealing not with the realization of the right to\nself-determination, but with a gross violation of\ninternational law, in the form of aggression against the\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence\nof a United Nations Member State.\nThe war has created unbearable conditions for my\npeople. It aggravates social tension and hampers the\nimplementation of economic and political reforms aimed\nat the democratization of Azerbaijani society.\nAs a result of the war, the Azerbaijani people have\nsuffered a huge material loss, amounting to billions of\ndollars. As for the moral damage inflicted on human life\nand destiny, there is hardly anything to compare to the\nsorrow and pain of my people.\nBlood is being shed now, not only in Azerbaijan, but\nalso in other hot spots of the world. Peoples must not\nremain indifferent to these tragic events. Collective\nefforts should be made in order to prevent the escalation\nof armed conflicts and to achieve their just and lasting\nresolution.\nDuring the past two years the Security Council\nadopted four resolutions and its President has made six\nstatements in connection with the occupation of\nAzerbaijani territories by armed forces of the Republic of\nArmenia.\nIn all its resolutions the Security Council reaffirms\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani\nRepublic; emphasizes the inadmissibility of the use of\n3\n\n\nforce for the acquisition of territory; it strongly demands\nthe immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of\nall occupying forces from all the occupied regions of\nAzerbaijan; and calls for the return of refugees to their\nhomes.\nBut all these decisions have so far been completely\nignored by the Republic of Armenia. Moreover, Armenia\ncontinues to build up its military presence in the occupied\nterritories of Azerbaijan.\nOn the other hand, the Security Council has also failed\nto put into effect the mechanism for implementing the\nresolutions. Here we face a question: to what extent is the\nSecurity Council consistent and resolute, and how is the\ndegree of application of its powers in each case defined?\nNon-compliance with the decisions of the Security\nCouncil does not serve the interests of the United Nations,\nand may undermine confidence in its abilities to achieve its\nmain objective: the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nExperience gained in the process of settling regional\nconflicts shows that the efforts to implement resolutions\nsucceed only when endorsed by the political-military means\nenvisaged in the United Nations Charter.\nThe duty of the most authoritative international\norganization in the world community is to take effective\nmeasures with respect to the aggressor State, which is\nblatantly violating norms of international law.\nIn the efforts to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijani\nconflict, we rely on such an authoritative organization as\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(CSCE). The Minsk Group, created by the CSCE for the\nsettlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, also\nproceeds on the basis of the necessity for the evacuation of\nall the occupied territories and the complete withdrawal of\nthe occupying forces beyond the boundaries of Azerbaijan.\nIt also calls for respect for the sovereignty, territorial\nintegrity and internationally recognized borders of\nAzerbaijan.\nHowever, unfortunately, the numerous mediation\nefforts of the CSCE have not yet brought about any\ntangible, concrete results, due to the lack of appropriate\nmechanisms.\nOnly now do we have the first positive result. At the\ncost of enormous efforts, and owing to active mediation by\nthe Russian Federation and the CSCE Minsk Group, a\ncease-fire has been achieved in the conflict zone. The\nfighting and bloodshed have been stopped for more than\nfour months. We greatly appreciate all this. But the\nsituation still remains very complicated and the truce is\nvery fragile.\nThe Republic of Armenia has put forward an\nillegitimate condition, that of exchanging part of the\noccupied Azerbaijani territories for independent status for\nthe Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic.\nIt demands that it keep its military presence in this\nAzerbaijani region and that it control the town of Shusha\nand the Lachin region of Azerbaijan, which implies\nconsolidation of its annexation of our territories.\nArmenia completely excludes the restoration of the\ndemographic composition of Nagorny Karabakh as it was\nat the beginning of the conflict and the return of the\nAzerbaijani population, including its return to one of the\nancient centres of Azerbaijani culture, the town of\nShusha. On these conditions, Armenia, ignoring the\nSecurity Council\u2019s resolutions, proposes the deployment\nof an international separation force along the perimeter of\nthe occupied Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan,\nthus trying to turn it into a tool for freezing the situation\nand to make it a hostage of its annexationist policy.\nThe position of the Azerbaijani Republic has always\nbeen constructive and peace-loving. Despite all the\ndamage inflicted upon us, we propose peace to the\nArmenian side on the basis of international law, justice\nand humanism. We are prepared to provide guarantees to\nthe Armenian population of Nagorny Karabakh. We\nfavour the restoration, on a mutual basis, of\ncommunications in the region, including the humanitarian\ncorridor between Nagorny Karabakh and the Republic of\nArmenia. We are also prepared to discuss the status of\nNagorny Karabakh within the Azerbaijani State.\nHowever, there are norms and principles that we\nconsider eternal: the sovereignty and territorial integrity\nof our country, the evacuation of all the occupied\nterritories and the return of refugees to their homes,\nincluding the return of 50,000 Azerbaijani refugees to\ntheir native land in Nagorny Karabakh.\nThe Azerbaijani Republic, while it still wants a\npeaceful political settlement, considers that only the\nelimination of the consequences of aggression, through\nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions, will\nmake it possible to carry on a stable and productive\n4\n\n\nnegotiating process, with the goal of establishing a durable,\nstable cease-fire and ensuring security for all the people of\nthe region. Here we count on the assistance of the world\ncommunity to ensure the realization of coordinated peaceful\ndecisions on the basis of a precise mandate for peace-\nkeepers in accordance with international norms.\nWe highly appreciate the cease-fire agreement. We\nrealize that it does not mean peace yet, but it creates the\nnecessary conditions for its rapid achievement. On several\noccasions we have voiced our firm resolution to observe the\ncease-fire regime until the peace agreement is reached and\nthere is a total cessation of the military conflict. I repeat\nthat today from this lofty rostrum of the United Nations.\nWe support the peace-keeping activities of the CSCE\nMinsk Group and the Russian Federation, and favour the\nconsolidation of their efforts against any kind of\ncompetition in the process of settling the conflict. Such\ncompetition could only complicate the achievement of\npeace, which is needed equally by the peoples of\nAzerbaijan and of Armenia.\nOur demands for the complete evacuation of all\noccupied Azerbaijani territories are legitimate; they are in\nfull conformity with Security Council resolutions. Attempts\nto annex any regions are unacceptable to us and go against\nthe norms of international law.\nAs a result of a war thrust upon us, an extremely\ndifficult humanitarian situation has emerged in the\nRepublic. Every seventh person in a country with a\npopulation of 7 million is a refugee, lacking a home, work\nand means for existence. Suffering from harsh miseries,\nrefugees and displaced persons are staying in tent camps.\nThe severe winter conditions and the lack of necessary food\nand medicines have created a threat of epidemics and\nfamine among the most vulnerable group of the population.\nOvercoming the extremely grave refugee situation has\nbecome one of the major concerns of the Azerbaijani State.\nInternational organizations and a number of States\nhave responded to the urgent appeal of our Republic, and\nwe express our most sincere gratitude to the Governments\nof Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan,\nSwitzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark, which have\nbecome the largest donors to the United Nations\nprogrammes of humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan. We\nare also grateful to the Governments of Turkey, Iran, Saudi\nArabia and other countries for their considerable\nhumanitarian assistance within the framework of bilateral\nrelations, and to the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees, the International Committee\nof the Red Cross, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund,\nDoctors Without Borders and numerous non-governmental\norganizations which have rendered invaluable assistance\nto the refugees and displaced persons in Azerbaijan.\nThe role and place of my country in international\nrelations are influenced by its geographical location and\nsocio-political orientation, as well as the historical-cultural\ntraditions of a land where Western and Eastern\ncivilizations have merged. It is with an awareness of\nthese peculiarities and the challenges of change that we\nare building, step by step, our cooperation with the\noutside world. Since the international recognition of the\nAzerbaijani Republic, we have established equal, balanced\nrelations with the overwhelming majority of States, and\nwe have joined a number of world and regional\norganizations. We have made serious efforts to expand\nour international relations and to restore the links that\nwere lost due to certain conditions. Attaching special\nimportance to historical, geographical, economic and\nhumanitarian links with the independent States that have\nemerged on the territory of the former Soviet Union, we\nfavour the development of equal cooperation with them,\nin particular with Russia, both on the basis of bilateral\nrelations and within the framework of the Commonwealth\nof Independent States.\nAzerbaijan is developing friendly relations with the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, France and China.\nClose good-neighbourly ties link us with the countries of\nour region and of adjacent regions, countries such as\nTurkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan, with\nwhich we closely cooperate within the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference.\nAzerbaijan\u2019s accession in May this year to the\nPartnership for Peace programme of the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization was an important event in the\npolitical life of our country. This programme attracts us\nwith the idea of cooperation and interaction in the\ninterests of common security. I welcome the accession of\nthe former members of the Warsaw Pact to this\nprogramme. This fact gives hope to the whole of the\nEurasian continent for peaceful cooperation, thereby\nensuring security, progress and prosperity for all peoples,\nand thereby eventually eliminating the possibility of the\nemergence of new adversarial blocs. We hope that\nparticipation in the NATO programme will enhance the\nrole of our country in the building of a new European\nsecurity structure.\n5\n\n\nThis year the Azerbaijan Republic was accorded the\nstatus of Observer in the Non-Aligned Movement, a step\nthat provides us with a broad opportunity for the\nestablishment of bilateral contacts in various fields and for\nthe rapprochement of our positions with those of the States\nmembers of the Movement.\nThe accession of the young Azerbaijani State to the\nUnited Nations as a full Member in January 1992 marked\nthe most important stage in the development of our country.\nThe scope of our cooperation with many United Nations\ninternational agencies has been expanding ever since.\nWe appreciate especially the cooperation we enjoy\nwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World\nBank. Concrete projects that are of great importance for\nthe socio-economic development of our country have been\nelaborated as a result of the practical work of experts\nrepresenting these large financial institutions. We assume\nthat many possibilities exist for our fruitful cooperation\nwith international financial institutions. We understand the\nprudence and concern demonstrated by the heads of the\nIMF and the World Bank with regard to the war conditions\nin which the Azerbaijani Republic has been engaged. At\nthe same time, however, the IMF has given a structural\nadjustment loan to Armenia, which is in a state of war with\nus. We consider that justice requires at least a balanced\napproach in this matter.\nWe are expecting a great deal from the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) in the way of technical\nassistance in the drawing up of national programmes for the\ndevelopment of market economy infrastructures, and\nassistance to enable our country make progress towards\nmodern management methods and the application of\nadvanced technologies.\nWe attach especial attention to international economic\ncooperation, and it is with deep satisfaction that I should\nlike to inform you that on 20 September 1994, as a result\nof long and difficult negotiations, the Azerbaijani Republic\nsigned a contract with a consortium of large international\noil companies for the joint development of the off-shore\noilfields for a 30-year term in the Azerbaijani sector of the\nCaspian Sea.\nThis landmark economic endeavour testifies to our\npolicy of openness to the whole world, as well as to our\npolicy of liberalizing the economy and attracting foreign\ninvestment. The signing of this unique contract will\npromote the strengthening of cooperation and\nrapprochement among the peoples and countries\nparticipating in its implementation, that is, Azerbaijan, the\nUnited States, Russia, the United Kingdom, Turkey,\nNorway and Saudi Arabia.\nIn mentioning this, I should like once again to\nunderline the fact that the Azerbaijani Republic is seeking\nfull-fledged integration into the world community and has\nthe full capacity to do so. For that reason the core of its\npolicy is the aspiration for peace, and we pin great hopes\non the United Nations in assisting us to achieve this\npeace.\nThe Azerbaijani people have placed great confidence\nin me in electing me President of a young, independent\nState, and today it has been my privilege to convey to\nyou its deepest aspirations. I leave this lofty rostrum of\nthe General Assembly in the hope that the voice of my\npeople will be heard by the members of the Assembly\nand that it will pave the way to their hearts.\n"

        "file_text": "At the dawn of the twenty-first century, our\nplanet is seeking a new world balance. Five years have\npassed since the struggle for world hegemony came to an\nend and the arms race became less frenzied. Unfortunately,\nthe problems afflicting mankind remain unchanged: death,\ndisease, war, famine, poverty, hotbeds of tension, and the\ntragic wandering of entire populations. The East-West\nblocs have been replaced by North-South blocs. The\nwealthy North is worried because the poor South is a threat\nto its serenity and comfort.\nFar from making the international climate better, the\nend of the cold war has unleashed instability in the southern\nhemisphere. Our world is facing a threefold crisis \u2014\npolitical and economic crises and a crisis of human\nsociety \u2014 which is sorely testing international solidarity\nand the interdependence of States. The many hotbeds of\ntension in Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa arouse\nanxiety and concern in our Organization. A number of\nideas have been put forward to check these evils on a\nglobal scale, with greater or lesser degrees of success, but\nwe feel that the best approach lies in the old saying: \u201cAn\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\u201d.\nPreventive diplomacy seems to us to be decisive in\nmaintaining and promoting peace, as recent world history\nshows. Indeed, it is clear that many current conflicts\nmight have been avoided had the international community\ninvolved itself in time to prevent them from worsening.\nFor obvious reasons, I should like to dwell on the\ncrisis in Rwanda.\nA review of the roots of this tragedy shows that the\nimplementation of preventive diplomacy could have\nprevented it or at least mitigated its effects. If we go\nback to the earliest manifestations of the ethnic conflict\nbetween Hutus and Tutsis, we see many opportunities to\nresolve it which the international community passed up.\nBut let us look at recent history.\nIt is clear that if the parties involved had respected\nthe Arusha Agreements, the Rwandese tragedy would not\nhave taken on its current dimensions. It is equally clear\nthat the international community could have guaranteed\nrespect for these Agreements. Moreover, the presence on\nRwandese soil of foreign and international troops shortly\nbefore and during the massacres could have prevented\nthem.\nThe Zairian delegation has recalled the past so that\nwe can learn the lessons it teaches for present and future\nproblems. What are these problems?\nMillions of Rwandese left their country and took\nrefuge in neighbouring countries. This mass exodus\ncaused immeasurable damage and created extremely\nserious social and economic imbalances in those\ncountries. Zaire, for instance, had to absorb nearly 3\nmillion people in less than three months. The little city\nof Goma, with a normal population of 200,000, on 14\nJune alone took in 10,000 refugees a minute. The\nmodern world has never seen such an uprooting of\npopulations.\nThe effects of such a situation could only be tragic:\nthe swamping of infrastructures, the re-emergence of\nendemic disease, housing shortages, the devastation of\ncrops, environmental destruction, disputes among people\nliving in close quarters, insecurity, and countless other\nexamples. In addition to all this, the nationality problem\nis worsening \u2014 and it was already a matter of concern in\nthat part of Zaire.\nThe current situation in countries bordering Rwanda\nmeets all the preconditions for preventive intervention by\nthe international community. Of course, it is already\nengaged in humanitarian operations on behalf of the\n15\n\n\nrefugees. My delegation takes this opportunity to thank all\nthe countries and organizations involved in these operations.\nFrance in particular deserves a special tribute for having\nsaved so many lives in \u201cOperation Turquoise\u201d. But it is\nhigh time that the international community moved beyond\nthe humanitarian aspect towards a solution of the\nfundamental causes of the Rwandese tragedy and its effects\non neighbouring countries.\nThese causes relate to the displacement and presence\nof refugees in countries that are in no way equipped to take\nin such human masses. Thus the solution lies in the return\nof refugees to their country of origin. Yet we note that\nnone of the countries directly concerned by this\nphenomenon can cope on its own with the situation without\nassistance from the international community.\nLet us take the case of my country and of Rwanda.\nThe tragedy of Rwanda, which occurred shortly before the\ninstallation of our current Government in Zaire, could\nbenefit only from stop-gap measures on the part of our\nGovernment, given the already disturbing situation of the\neconomy in Zaire \u2014 and the problems remain unsolved.\nFrom this rostrum, Zaire issues a fervent appeal to the\ninternational community for support equal to the difficulties\nexperienced by our population.\nWe know that the return of refugees to their countries\nis being thwarted by various factors: their administrative\nand political organizations were reconstituted in the camps;\nthe militia, who are difficult to identify, and the former\ncivilian and military authorities, are intimidating the\nrefugees; the commitment by the new masters of Kigali to\npersuade their compatriots to embark on a voluntary, secure\nreturn seems inadequate, to say the least; in an effort to\nrespect the spirit of the relevant Organization of African\nUnity convention on refugees, the Government of Zaire,\nwith no means, is confronted with enormous difficulties in\ntrying to remove the former soldiers from the borders.\nAll of these factors should lead the international\ncommunity to realize the gravity of the situation \u2014\nparticularly as the evolution of the Hutu-Tutsi conflict risks\nswinging back and forth: today we are witnessing a mass\nreturn to Rwanda of Tutsi refugees who were driven into\nexile 30 years ago; if the international community is not\ncareful, however, tomorrow we will witness another tragedy\nin Rwanda, this time tied in with the return of the Hutu\nrefugees.\nIt is thus urgent that the world help these two ethnic\ngroups to learn how to live together again in harmony.\nWe believe that solutions to the tragedy in Rwanda\nshould include the four following elements: power\nsharing between the parties involved; the establishment of\na multi-ethnic army; the establishment of guarantees for\nthe safe return of refugees; and assistance by the\ninternational community to the countries of asylum and of\norigin.\nHaving sketched out the very dark and disturbing\npicture of the situation that prevails in the Great Lakes\nregion, I would now like to turn to the situation in my\nown country, Zaire.\nSituated in the heart of Africa, Zaire is a country in\ndeep crisis. Since the beginning of this decade, Zaire has\nbeen experiencing a serious institutional crisis, punctuated\nby individual events which have contributed to destroying\nall the basic balances of our economy.\nOur country just barely averted a crisis which could\nhave been comparable to the one in Rwanda. As we\nknow, the democratization process initiated in Zaire on 24\nApril 1990 was one of the most tumultuous of the entire\nAfrican continent. A national conference which lasted\nalmost two years was unable to reconcile the political\nactors. National unity was harmed by the reappearance\nof centrifugal and sectarian movements. Ethnic tensions\nerupted here and there throughout the country. In short,\nwe might well have experienced the same phenomena of\nmassacres and mass displacements of populations we\ndeplore in Rwanda.\nZaire succeeded in averting this great tragedy owing\nin large part to the timely assistance provided by the\ninternational community.\nWe do not wish to minimize either the wisdom and\nthe work done by the internal forces in Zaire, or the\nongoing support from what we call the troika: the group\nof countries consisting of Belgium, France and the United\nStates of America.\nWe should also like to recognize that it was under\nthe good offices of the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization that meetings were held that brought\ntogether all of the political trends in Zaire.\nThe results of these meetings were of major political\nimportance because they put an end to the duplication of\n16\n\n\nconstitutional texts as well as of institutions of transition\ntowards a new democratic republic.\nOn 11 July 1994 the transitional parliament established\na Government which represents the majority of the people\nof Zaire. This Government intends to conduct the nation\u2019s\npolitics exclusively through parliamentary control.\nIn Zaire as elsewhere, democratization is a lengthy\nprocess which requires considerable material and financial\nresources. I am thinking not of the resources needed at\nparticular moments \u2014 for example to organize and hold\nfree and transparent elections. I am referring to the\nsubstantial resources needed to stabilize the economic and\nsocial environment, which will provide the framework for\ndemocratization. This stability has long been ignored, but\ntoday is increasingly being recognized as the prerequisite\nfor progress towards democracy.\nIf this is truly the case, then many countries in Africa\nand throughout the world have small hope of completing\ntheir democratization, or at least of completing it within a\nreasonable time-frame. For in these countries, politics are\ngrossly distorted by ills such as poverty, malnutrition,\nignorance, violence and so forth.\nWhen a country relies only on its national efforts to\nresolve all of those ills, it very quickly gets locked into a\nvicious circle which only exacerbates its problems.\nThe second crisis facing mankind is economic in\nnature. This crisis dates back to the 1970s and derives\nfrom fundamental inadequacies in the economic system\nestablished at the end of the Second World War. The\ngranting of independence to countries that were colonies at\nthe time completely changed the international situation.\nThis crisis derives from structural lacunae and from\nthe imbalance in interdependent areas such as those of\ncommodities, trade, energy, currency and finance.\nFor this reason, we would propose that the concept of\npreventive diplomacy be transposed into the economic area.\nThis would imply action being taken on the part of the\ninternational community to deal with the imbalance in a\nnational economy before that imbalance leads to a\nwidespread social crisis.\nSocio-economic conditions have worsened\nconsiderably in Zaire since the beginning of\ndemocratization. In the last five years, the basic balances\nof the Zaire economy have been completely destroyed. As\na result, there is a particularly acute economic and\nfinancial crisis.\nThis economic crisis has been accompanied by a\nprofound moral crisis, which has led to plundering and\nsystematic destruction of the economic fabric.\nIt goes without saying that such an economic\nsituation can hardly lead us to the blossoming of\ndemocracy, due to its negative impact on the living\nconditions of citizens.\nIt is equally obvious that Zaire cannot emerge all on\nits own from this situation. The current Government has\nof course included in its programme specific short-term\nmeasures to slow down somewhat the continuing\ndeterioration of social conditions. But these measures and\nthe Government\u2019s recovery plan as a whole can be\neffective only if they are supported by strengthened\ncooperation between Zaire and its bilateral and\nmultilateral partners.\nHowever, as is known, this cooperation has been\nsuspended, and most of Zaire\u2019s partners are making the\nresumption of such cooperation conditional on tangible\nprogress being made towards democracy and progress in\neconomic management. Thus, we find ourselves faced\nwith a complex conditionality. The assistance my country\nneeds to move towards democracy and good management\nis made conditional on the prior achievement of\ndemocracy and good management.\nMy country is not an isolated case. This kind of\nconditionality is increasingly a determining factor in\ncooperation between developing countries, particularly in\nAfrica, and their multilateral and bilateral partners. In\nother words, many countries today are confronted by a\nvicious circle that obstructs their access to the resources\nof the international community.\nOur Organization must find some means of breaking\nthis circle because the survival of vast numbers of the\nworld\u2019s citizens \u2014 if not that of the human race as a\nwhole \u2014 is at stake. It is important to note that the\nsearch for these means must lead us off the beaten track\nso we can find new and imaginative paths. In our search\nwe must create new solutions, such as those that made it\npossible to rebuild Europe after the Second World War.\nThe third ill afflicting the world today is the crisis of\nsociety. Human society is falling prey to the re-\nemergence and supremacy of force and violence over the\n17\n\n\nrule of law in relations between States, in contempt of all\nthe rules of good conduct. Two thirds of the human race\nsuffers from hunger, endemic disease, malnutrition,\nundernourishment, unemployment, lack of information,\nacculturation \u2014 in short, total underdevelopment. The\npolitical and economic crisis also has a negative effect on\nsociety.\nThe Government of which I am the head is a\nGovernment of transition between an old order and a new,\nemerging republic in which we will recognize every\ncitizen\u2019s right to freedom of thought, expression,\nassociation and movement, a new republic where justice is\nindependent, where the police and the army must serve to\nprotect the citizen, a new republic where the press is free.\nMy Government intends to make respect for human\nrights in Zaire one of its fundamental priorities of action.\nFrom this rostrum I make an appeal to the specialized\nagencies of our Organization to share their enriching\nexperience with us and to help us effectively in realizing\nour aims.\nThe establishment of institutions for our new,\nresolutely democratic republic will involve the organization\nin the near future of free, transparent and honest elections.\nMy Government hopes to see the United Nations\ncommunity join Zaire in this last stage of our long journey\ntowards our goal \u2014 a State of law \u2014 by assisting in the\npreparation, organization and monitoring of these elections\nat all levels.\nBefore concluding, I would just like to express to you,\nMr. President, the great satisfaction my delegation feels at\nseeing you presiding over the General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session. We are all aware that your election is\na tribute to your country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. But it also\nrepresents the international community\u2019s recognition of your\nqualities as a statesman and knowledgeable diplomat. Your\ncompetence and experience are without any doubt a\nguarantee of the success in our work. We also wish to\ncongratulate all the members of the General Committee.\nI would be remiss if I did not say how greatly my\ndelegation appreciates the way in which your illustrious\npredecessor presided over the forty-eighth session.\nWe extend our best wishes and our support to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ncommitment and his tireless efforts to promote peace and\nrespect for human rights.\nI wish to take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute\nto the people of South Africa for their political maturity,\nwhich, along with the assistance of the international\ncommunity, made it possible to do away with apartheid\nand to bring democracy to that country. It is with great\njoy and genuine pleasure that, on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Zaire, I congratulate the\nnew, democratic, multiracial Republic of South Africa on\nits return to the United Nations.\nFinally, I should like to congratulate the political\nleaders of the State of Israel and of the Palestine\nLiberation Organization, as well as all those who served\nas mediators, for their contribution to a comprehensive\nand definitive settlement to the conflict in the Middle East\nand the question of Palestine.\nTo sum up, I would simply say that I came here\nwith three messages. The first one is that of the\ninterdependence of nations in mutually beneficial\ncooperation and with no exclusions. My second message\nis that, in its action, my Government attaches the highest\npriority to the swift establishment of a new Zaire, a State\nof law where fundamental freedoms and the rights of\ncitizens will be the major concern of those in power. My\nthird message is a call for the effective implementation of\nthe concept of preventive diplomacy to promote peace\nand eradicate poverty in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "I wonder how historians\nwill judge the last decade of this century, and what future\ngenerations will read about these years. My opinion is\nthat we are experiencing an exciting period of arduous\nchallenges and great expectations for peace.\nThe installation of the administration of the\nPalestinian National Authority in Jericho gave us strong\nhope for a peaceful future.\nThe excessive crises and wars that have recently and\nsuddenly broken out and the revival and intensification of\nold ones in too many parts of our planet call for the\ninvolvement and intervention of the international\ncommunity. Let me also stress that not only should such\nintervention be firm, but it should also be legitimate and\ncorrect. In the effort to restore peace, the international\ncommunity should act fairly, respecting the legitimate\nreasons and opposing the illegitimate ones, with all due\nregard for man and human dignity.\n13\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nFrom the top of our Mount Titano, on a clear day, one\ncan see the coast of the former Yugoslavia. In the fourth\ncentury, San Marino\u2019s founder fled from that coast to\nescape religious persecution.\nNow, in this forum, on behalf of the people of San\nMarino, I launch an appeal for peace for those tormented\nregions, for Sarajevo, and for the recognition of the equal\nrights of all human beings, without distinction of any kind,\nas well as for the dignity of those deprived of their right to\nlife.\nThe public response to the important Conference on\nPopulation and Development, which brought representatives\nof many countries to Cairo in an effort to solve some of the\nproblems hindering the fair and balanced development of all\npeoples, has now faded away. The decisions taken during\nthat Conference, whose aims have been distorted and\nmisinterpreted, are only a small step forward. However, it\nis encouraging to see how it has been generally recognized\nthat our common concerns cannot and must not lie only in\na necessary reduction of rapid population growth. All the\nproblems related to this issue must be addressed, thus\nensuring all people\u2019s rights to existence, to good health and\nfree development, and the disposal of their resources as\nthey see fit.\nThe Republic of San Marino participated in the\nConference, which was held in Egypt, prompted by the\nconviction that it was its duty to offer a contribution. My\nfellow citizens are well aware that a small country like ours\nwill never be in a position to play a substantial role in the\nchoices to be made and the decisions to be taken.\nNevertheless, our foreign policy is clear, and reflects our\ndeep-rooted historical traditions.\n\nIn line with the policy adopted, we feel compelled to\ncall for respect for human rights and dignity. The latter\nimplies the right to make free choices, the right to\ndevelopment, to democratic progress, equality, equal\nopportunities, and the right to live in peace.\nIt seems that the United Nations has given to the\nCairo, Copenhagen and Beijing conferences the task of\noutlining a feasible solution to all the problems related to\nsocial development and the status of women.\nIt is clear that in declaring 1994 the International Year\nof the Family the General Assembly made a precise and\nwell-considered choice. By this decision the Assembly\u2019s\naim was to celebrate an essential part of society, in the\nconviction that the family, the smallest democracy at the\ncentre of society, is the first and most important element\nof any country\u2019s structure and deserves special attention\nby all States. In a national and international context\ncharacterized by a disquieting crisis of values, by\nincreasing economic and social difficulties and by a\ngrowing lack of models for young people, the family,\nwith its various historical, cultural and religious\ncomponents, represents the last hope for mankind.\nAgainst this background, all Governments have the\nprimary task of formulating policies capable of helping\nand supporting the family and its components while\nrespecting its autonomy and specific features. The\nRepublic of San Marino considers all family issues to be\nof the utmost importance, and it has recently taken new\nmeasures for the protection of motherhood and\nfatherhood, in addition to the laws already in force. The\nwidespread development we all hope to achieve has its\nroots in the family, in respect for it and within it, and\nmeans in practice gender equality and equal dignity\nbetween men and women.\nOn the other hand, development and its equitable\ndistribution can be obtained only if our projects include\nthe safeguarding of the environment. It is a notorious\nfact that too often protection of the natural environment\nis sacrificed for economic and national reasons that\ndamage the interests of other people and the common\nwell-being. The richest and most industrialized countries\nare regularly destroying the natural environment inside\nand outside their borders.\nTherefore, we deemed it necessary and fair to\ninclude the environment, along with peace, economic\ngrowth, social justice and democracy, as items on the\nAgenda for Development \u2014 the project proposed by the\nSecretary-General for the solution of the problems that\nwill face our planet within the next century.\nIn my country especially, where the protection of the\nterritory is of basic importance because of its small size,\npublic opinion in general and young people in particular\nare extremely sensitive to environmental issues and ask\nthat choices be made that respect the interests of the\ncommunity and the individual in a spirit of true solidarity.\nIn San Marino we have created the Foundation for the\nEnvironment, with very ambitious programmes, and we\nhope in the future to have the cooperation and support of\nthe United Nations.\n14\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\n\nWe all share the opinion that economic development\ngoes hand in hand with social development. Therefore, it\nis high time for all States to adopt appropriate social\npolicies and develop structures in support of the poorest and\nweakest groups of the population. Unfortunately,\nunemployment, poverty, the absence of economic security\nfor the elderly, and exploitation of labour are still a very\nsad, indeed tragic, reality.\nMy appeal to the world for solidarity is not just\nrhetorical. Solidarity is not only spiritual sharing but also,\nand above all, the substantial support offered by the rich\ncountries to the poor ones, the solidarity of the upper\nclasses with the lower classes, and even distribution of\nwelfare, equal rights and opportunities. Solidarity not only\nmeans substantial aid but also implies tolerance, a noble\nfeeling but one that is hard to achieve.\nWe are still witnessing with amazement shameful anti-\nSemitic, xenophobic and racist attitudes, showing that a\nculture of tolerance, dialogue and respect has still to be\ndeveloped at all levels. The concept seems to me to be\nvery simple: all men are equal and no one can claim to be\nsuperior. However, respect for others seems to be difficult\nto achieve, since it cannot be imposed by law or by a\nGovernment decision. This ambitious goal can be attained\nonly through an educational process even if a long-lasting\none \u2014 that involves future generations and calls upon\nnational and supranational institutions to carry out their own\nresponsibilities.\nThe United Nations is surely in a position to meet\nthese challenges and to offer the right and appropriate\nsolutions to the States. The role played by the United\nNations as it approaches its fiftieth anniversary \u2014 an event\nwe are about to celebrate \u2014 confirms all that.\nInternational peace and security, the solution of many\ndomestic crises, the settlement of disputes, the beginning of\nsocial and economic development, respect for human rights,\nhumanitarian help, decolonization and other legal rules in\ninternational relations are all fields in which the United\nNations is working. However, continuous attention to all\nthe achievements of the United Nations is needed.\nThe Organization, by adapting its structure to new\ncircumstances and needs, will be able to offer a stronger\ncommitment and to be the authoritative and dynamic guide\nthe world needs for the future.\nFurthermore, San Marino gives particular importance\nto a reform of the Security Council that will lead to an\nequitable distribution of its seats and to a greater\ntransparency in its work. The proper functioning of the\nSecurity Council, its close and coordinated relationship\nwith the General Assembly, and the widest possible\nrepresentation are the best guarantees that the United\nNations will be able to carry out its tasks.\nIn this context I believe it is appropriate to\nremember that small States, willing and capable of\nmaking a contribution, must enjoy equal rights and\ndignity, since both the big Powers and the various small\ncommunities are interested in the peaceful future of the\nworld, in the establishment of democracy and in the\nstrengthening of freedom.\nMore than 50 years ago, in June 1944, the world\nconflict brought death and ruin even to the neutral\nmountain of San Marino, which had no part in the\nconflict and where thousands of poor refugees, deprived\nof everything except their lives, had sought shelter. The\nappeal for peace launched almost 50 years ago by the\nsignatories of the San Francisco Charter is still\ndramatically up to date. Some might think that a peaceful\nworld is a mere Utopia, and they might be right. But I\nam firmly convinced that everyone must contribute to the\nachievement of this wonderful Utopia.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to express my deep pleasure at Mr. Amara\nEssy\u2019s election to preside over the General Assembly this\nyear. This is a well-deserved tribute to your country, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, which is held in high esteem by the international\ncommunity.\nMy distinguished German colleague, Mr. Klaus\nKinkel, speaking on behalf of the European Union,\nindicated the role it intends to play in international relations\nand described its positions on the major political questions.\nThese positions are fully shared by my country.\nConsequently I will limit my remarks to certain points\npertaining to the functioning of our Organization.\nOver the past few years, we have lived through the\nend of the cold war and far-reaching upheavals in the\ninternational arena. These changes have had important and\nlasting effects on many people, on the populations of many\nStates that lived under authoritarian forms of government\nand have now conquered the freedom to exercise their\nfundamental rights; on peoples freed of the constraints\nimposed upon them by the competition between the two\nsuper-Powers, which enabled dictatorial and repressive\nregimes to act with full impunity; and, finally, on the\ninternational community as a whole, which is no longer\nforced to live with the fear of nuclear conflagration\nthroughout the planet.\nDemocracy has made a historic breakthrough. It will\nbe restored in Haiti. In the Middle East the peace process\nis making progress. In South Africa apartheid has been\ndefinitively abolished, and this shining victory is shared by\nour Organizat ion, which fought apartheid\nuncompromisingly. Let us give careful thought to the\nformidable lesson of political courage, tolerance and\nreconciliation given us by Presidents Mandela and de Klerk.\nThese advances are offset, however, by the\nemergence throughout the world of areas of tension\nwhich, no longer masked by a bipolar structure, are now\ngrowing in intensity. For three years now war has been\nraging in the former Yugoslavia, with an increasing toll\nof death, suffering and destruction. In Rwanda, we\nwitnessed the unleashing of barbarism, which in a few\nmonths killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and\nprovoked a refugee problem of exceptional dimensions.\nSimilarly, elsewhere - in Africa, the Caucasus, Central\nAsia - other regions are faced with new types of conflict,\nresulting from the break-up of States and the resurgence\nof nationalist, ethnic and religious passions.\nNever before has the United Nations found itself so\nmuch at the centre of world politics. The United Nations\ntoday finds itself forced to face entirely new challenges,\nto deal with an ever-growing number of demands and\nmissions that are increasingly complex. I hail the\ndedication of our Secretary-General, who has persistently\ndevoted his energies to the difficult mission of adapting\nthe Organization to a new international environment, and\nof strengthening it to enable it to fulfil its new tasks. I\nwish to pay tribute to the United Nations peace-keeping\nforces which have intervened in recent times in an\nimpressive number of conflicts. They have contributed,\nat times in a decisive manner, to protecting civilian\npopulations, to preventing the spread of conflict and to\nfacilitating the process of transition to democracy. A\nsignificant number of them have given their lives in what\nare often highly dangerous operations.\nThe growth of peace-keeping operations has been\nexponential. In the past five years, the Organization has\nlaunched more peace-keeping operations than during the\nprevious 40. Moreover, the Organization is now\nembarked upon activities which far surpass the traditional\npeace-keeping concepts to which we had grown\naccustomed. Indeed, most of the recent conflicts have\nemerged not between States but within States; the Charter\nhardly contemplates such situations. We shall therefore\nhave to give thought to the conditions under which the\nUnited Nations should act in such cases, and ask\nourselves whether it has the necessary resources and\ninstruments to fulfil its new missions.\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" provides a framework for\nthe future evolution of our Organization in this field of\npeace-keeping. A number of the ideas put forward by the\nSecretary-General have been constructively put to use by\nthe Security Council and by the General Assembly. But\nrecent experience has shown us, at times pointedly, that\n24\n\n\nthere are often serious shortcomings to the way in which\nthe United Nations conducts these military operations.\nMajor operations can no longer be decided upon\nspontaneously; in the area of peace-keeping, the United\nNations needs to strengthen its organizational, management\nand planning capacities. It must be able to rely on a\npermanent high command structure capable of\nsimultaneously conducting several multi-dimensional large-\nscale operations and which has adequate means for\ninformation processing and coordination.\nEffective crisis management implies the capacity to\nreact quickly, which is why it would be desirable to\nenhance the United Nations capacity to rapidly carry the\nnecessary personnel and equipment to the theatre of\noperations. In the recent past there have been too many\ninstances in which the Secretary-General has been forced to\ndelay operations approved by the Security Council owing\nto a lack of personnel or equipment. This implies that we,\nthe Member States, should contribute the necessary peace-\nkeeping troops for future missions and that we should be in\na position to put them rapidly at the disposal of the United\nNations. These contributions should not be limited to\nmilitary personnel, but should also include civilians, from\npolice to election observers. Indeed, peace-keeping requires\nmany skills, including that of being able to intervene\nbetween opposing parties, of being sensitive to cultural\nparticularities, and of being able to act as a mediator. The\npersonnel who are called upon to intervene in these\ncomplex, difficult and dangerous situations should therefore\nbe properly prepared and trained. Uniform training and\njoint exercises constitute the key to the effective integration\nof different national contingents in a multinational\noperation.\nFinally, there is a need for a substantial strengthening\nof the safety provisions for the Blue Helmets.\nDriven to the limits of its financial and organizational\ncapacities, the United Nations will increasingly need to\ncount on regional organizations and structures in order to\ncarry out these peace-keeping operations. Cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and such organizations is\nprovided for by the Charter, and it has been developed, for\nexample, in the former Yugoslavia, in Somalia and in the\nCaucasus. It should be further strengthened.\nOnly the United Nations has the international\nlegitimacy to decide to use force or to impose peace\nenforcement measures. But in the sphere of peace-keeping\nand preventive diplomacy, the activities of regional\norganizations would have the advantage of relieving the\nUnited Nations of part of its work. Often having a better\nunderstanding of the conflicts in their areas, such\norganizations could act with greater effectiveness.\nWith respect to the European continent, the United\nNations should intensify its cooperation with the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(CSCE), the Council of Europe and the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO), taking into account the\ncompetence of each of those organizations.\nDoes international law authorize the United Nations\nto intervene within a country? Does not the Charter\nassert the principle of non-intervention in the internal\naffairs of a State?\nI welcome the fact that for some time now the\ninternational community has been treating that principle\nin a more flexible way. That principle should no longer\nserve as a shield for flagrant and massive violations of\nhuman rights. That is what occurred in 1991 in Iraq,\nwhen the international community came to the aid of the\nKurds, harshly repressed by Saddam Hussein, or, again in\n1992 in Somalia, when the task was to protect the supply\nof humanitarian aid to a population threatened by famine.\nOn each occasion, the international community\ncourageously assumed its duty to assist, though it is true\nthat in Somalia a political solution remains to be found.\nDid the international community show similar\ndetermination when, last spring, a virtual genocide was\nperpetrated in Rwanda, especially when the Tutsi\ncommunity became the target of a deliberate act of\nextermination undertaken by officials of the Hutu\ncommunity?\nThe United Nations, after hesitating for a moment,\ndecided to reconstitute the United Nations Assistance\nMission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in order to provide\nprotection to the population that was threatened. But the\nSecretary-General\u2019s appeal was not heeded. The action\nfinally taken by France and the Africans - and for this I\npay a tribute to them - succeeded at least in putting the\nbrakes on this infernal machine. I hope in any case that\nan international tribunal will be created without delay to\nbring to trial those responsible for this crime against\nhumanity.\nIn this era of interdependence, efforts with a view to\ncollective maintenance of peace and security cannot be\nreduced to peace-keeping operations alone, but must\nnecessarily take into account economic and social factors.\n25\n\n\nFamine, underdevelopment, the flow of refugees, over-\npopulation, environmental deterioration, drug abuse and,\nfinally, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are\nall serious threats to our global balance and, hence, to\nworld peace.\nIn the economic sphere, too, our security depends on\nthat of others. In all sectors that give rise to concern,\nwhether we are dealing with military, trade, environmental\nor health problems, no nation can isolate itself from others.\nWe are all affected by what happens beyond our borders,\njust as our own actions within our borders inevitably have\nrepercussions on the community of nations as a whole.\nOur security is increasingly indivisible. We cannot\ndisregard the links that exist between development,\neconomic growth, protection of the environment and\npopulation movements. If the situation deteriorates in any\none area, the whole can be destabilized.\nHaving a global mandate in political, economic and\ncultural matters, the United Nations is the ideal forum in\nwhich to carry on the quest for lasting development that is\ncompatible with preservation of an environmental balance\nand with the needs of social development.\nWe express our satisfaction at the recent issuance by\nthe Secretary-General of his \\\"Agenda for Development\\\",\nwhich is a supplement to his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\".\nWe hope that at this session of the Assembly we will\nsucceed in identifying the priority sectors in which we\nshould undertake in-depth reforms.\nThe promotion of progress and of economic, social\nand environmental development needs greater attention if\nwe wish to overcome the long-term threats to international\nsecurity. We must give our Organization the necessary\ntools to strengthen international cooperation, while national\nGovernments make efforts to overcome increasingly\ncomplex problems relating to development.\nOur vision of the future cannot merely accept poverty\nand privation in far too many parts of the world, where\npopulations are deprived of their fundamental right to food\nand education and even to water, health and a roof over\ntheir heads. Wishing to make its contribution to a much-\nneeded international solidarity, the Government of\nLuxembourg has undertaken to double, by the year 2000,\nthe percentage of its gross national product earmarked for\nofficial development assistance so as to reach the target of\n0.7 per cent.\nThe agenda for humanity, if I may use the\nexpression of our Secretary-General, is the true challenge\nfaced by the United Nations at the end of this twentieth\ncentury. From Rio to Cairo, through Vienna, Copenhagen\nand Beijing, major international conferences are supplying\nglobal answers to these global questions. Mankind,\nhuman development and commitment to his community\nare at the heart of those concerns, whether we speak of\nthe Earth Summit, the World Conference on Human\nRights, the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, the World Summit for Social Development\nor the Fourth World Conference on Women. Improving\nthe status of women and of women\u2019s general access to\neducation and health is one of the keys to the success of\nthis vast undertaking.\nMillions of people in many parts of the world\ncontinue to fall victim to flagrant violations of their\nhuman rights. The Vienna Conference reaffirmed the\nuniversal validity of those human rights.\nThe creation at the last session of the General\nAssembly of the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights should encourage\ngreater respect for those principles. However,\nundertakings assumed are valuable only if they are\ntranslated into practical action. Thus, we must ensure that\nthe United Nations has the necessary support and means\nin this sphere to implement its programme of action. We\nmust take the necessary measures to increase the\nresources and strengthen the functioning of the United\nNations Centre for Human Rights, as well as that of the\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nNon-governmental organizations, through their\nactions, are also now a part of the international\nconscience, including its conscience in regard to respect\nfor human rights. Thus, our Organization and all its\nMember States should recognize and facilitate the\nimportant role played by those organizations.\nAs we draw near to the celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, our Organization has\nbeen undertaking a series of negotiations with a view to\nrevising its working methods. The work with a view to\nthe necessary reform of the Security Council has\ncontinued over the past year. It will be necessary to\npersevere in our search for a solution that will reconcile\nthe need for a more balanced composition with the\nconcern for effective functioning.\n26\n\n\nIt is also imperative to improve the methods of work\nof the Council and ensure greater transparency in its work\nand better communication with the members of the General\nAssembly. Although the latter do not participate in the\ndeliberations of the Council, they are bound by its decisions\nand they are regularly requested to apply sanctions and to\nprovide funds or personnel for the implementation of peace-\nkeeping operations.\nThe Secretariat is a key institution of the United\nNations system. It must have the necessary means to carry\nout the innovative work it has been undertaking\nenergetically and courageously. At the same time,\nhowever, we should combat the proliferation of institutions,\nsince this exhausts the limited resources of our\nOrganization and compromises the cogency of its efforts.\nIn this period of limited resources, it is also imperative\nthat Member States seriously take up the question of\neffective management. Strict budgetary discipline is\nneeded, and resources should no longer be wasted on\noperations with ill-defined goals. In that connection, we\nwelcome the various steps taken by the Secretary-General\nwith a view to making better use of the resources provided\nto the Organization and creating a more rigorous financial\ninspection system.\nOur Organization, in the end, will succeed only\nthrough the way in which each State discharges its own\nresponsibilities under the Charter. They include financial\nresponsibilities. The obligation of solidarity that is binding\nupon all States of our Organization should motivate them\nto discharge their budgetary obligations to the United\nNations in full and on time.\nOur Organization, which is the only forum that brings\ntogether virtually all the States of the world, needs the\ncommitment of its Members. It needs decisions that are\nwell thought out. It needs measures for proper follow-up.\nOnly in that way will it be able usefully to contribute to\nchannelling international efforts to realize our common\ngoal: which is to make our planet a place where peace,\nsecurity and greater prosperity for all peoples of the world\ncan prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me join the\nrepresentatives who have spoken before me in\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. You represent a country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which\nhas played and continues to play an active role in the\nframework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nand in the United Nations. You bring to the presidency\nvast experience in the area of international relations as\nwell as diplomatic skill and acumen, which puts you in\n13\n\n\ngood stead to steer the deliberations of the General\nAssembly to a successful conclusion. You can count on\nmy delegation\u2019s unqualified support and cooperation.\nI also wish to express my delegation\u2019s sincere\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who presided\nover the work of the forty-eighth session with great\ndistinction and rare personal attributes.\n\nOur distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, has continued to provide outstanding\nleadership in the discharge of his duties. Zambia is\nparticularly grateful to the Secretary-General for his\nuntiring efforts in pursuit of world peace and security,\ndevelopment and international cooperation.\nThe past year has been one of mixed blessings on the\ninternational scene, a year of notable achievements and\nfailures. In the view of Zambia, the most positive\ndevelopment of the year was the achievement of majority\nrule in the Republic of South Africa. My delegation is\nreally delighted to see in our midst the delegation of a\ndemocratic and non-racial South Africa, led by President\nNelson Mandela. President Mandela was the symbol of the\nliberation struggle in South Africa and it is therefore\nbefitting that he, an icon of the liberation struggle, should\nbecome the first President of a new South Africa.\nThe return of South Africa to the family of the United\nNations is without a doubt due to the tenacity,\nuncompromising commitment and dedication of our\nbrothers and sisters in South Africa who bore the brunt of\nthe evil system of apartheid. At the same time, it cannot be\ndenied that South Africa\u2019s victory over apartheid and its\nrejoining the United Nations is a concrete manifestation of\nthe seminal role played by this Organization.\nIn order to consolidate the democracy achieved in\nSouth Africa and address the negative social and economic\nlegacy of apartheid, substantial international assistance is\nimperative. In this regard, Zambia endorses the appeal\nmade by President Nelson Mandela for international support\nto South Africa to enable the effective implementation of\nits reconstruction and development programme.\nA democratic, peaceful and prosperous South Africa\nwill no doubt have a positive impact on southern Africa and\nthe African continent as a whole. Indeed, South Africa\u2019s\ncontribution as a member of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community has already begun to be felt and\nappreciated. It has, together with Botswana and\nZimbabwe, also played a highly commendable role in the\npeaceful resolution of the constitutional problem in\nLesotho. We have every confidence, therefore, that South\nAfrica will contribute positively to the work of the United\nNations.\nAfrica has had a few other bright spots. We are\ndelighted with the peaceful resolution of the territorial\ndispute between Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\nThe positive developments in Burundi towards a peaceful\nresolution of the long-standing conflict are commendable.\nHowever, the situation remains volatile. There is\ntherefore a need to sustain international engagement.\nWith regard to Angola, it is indeed gratifying that\nthe talks between the Government of Angola and National\nUnion for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),\nwhich have been taking place in Lusaka, Zambia, for the\npast eleven months under the chairmanship of the United\nNations Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative,\nMr. Alioune Blondin Beye, have made tremendous\nprogress. We therefore look forward to a successful\nconclusion of the talks by the end of October, culminating\nin the signing of a peace agreement, by the middle of\nNovember 1994, on the basis of the Bicesse Accords, and\nthe pertinent resolutions of the Security Council.\nIn this regard, we take this opportunity to commend\nboth the Angolan Government and the UNITA delegation\nfor their seriousness and commitment to the task of\nfinding a peaceful solution to their country\u2019s fratricidal\nwar. We also thank the observers to these talks, namely\nthe United States, the Russian Federation and Portugal.\nSustained international assistance to Angola will be\nnecessary in the post-agreement era and Zambia will\ncontinue to assist the people of Angola during this period.\nIn Mozambique, we look forward to the holding of\nthe first multiparty elections, scheduled to take place on\n27 and 28 October. We commend the Mozambican\nGovernment and RENAMO for committing themselves to\nthe United Nations peace initiative and to the Rome\nAgreement. We applaud the role that the United Nations\nhas played through its peace-keeping efforts and in\nhelping to prepare the people of Mozambique for the\nforthcoming elections. As a gesture of solidarity with the\npeople of Mozambique, Zambia has made a modest\ncontribution to the United Nations peace-keeping\noperation.\n14\n\n\nIn Malawi, we welcome the recent peaceful and\ndemocratic transition to a multiparty system of government.\nWe endorse the appeal made by President Bakili Muluzi for\ninternational assistance to consolidate democracy and to\nassist in the reconstruction of the country. My Government\nalso commends the technical and advisory services provided\nby the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat of the\nUnited Nations.\nZambia welcomes the positive trend towards\ndemocratization on the African continent. Why should\nAfrica democratize? Africa should democratize because it\nis our firm belief that democratic systems of government\npromote good governance, transparency and accountability\nin the administration of public affairs, independence of the\njudiciary, and respect for human rights and the rule of law.\nThese qualities lay a firm basis for peace and stability and\nare thus conducive to sustainable development. We would\ntherefore urge all of our development partners to take\naccount of all these positive developments in the\nformulation of their development policies towards Africa.\nThey should also endeavour to explain to their taxpayers\nthe significance of these democratic changes and their\ncorrelation to sustainable development. The electorates of\nthe North must be made to appreciate that it is in their\nenlightened self-interest to support developing countries.\nThere is now much hope in Africa. Indeed, Africa, in the\nlong run, holds the promise of a positive and prosperous\nfuture.\nIn the Middle East, we welcome the positive\ndevelopments in Palestine following the agreements and\ndeclarations between the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO) and Israel, as well as between Jordan and Israel. It\nis our sincere hope that progress can also be achieved in\nthe negotiations with the Syrian Arab Republic and\nLebanon. International assistance is urgently required for\nthe reconstruction, rehabilitation and other essential needs\nof the Palestinians.\nWe commend the efforts deployed by the leadership\nof the PLO and of Israel, their tenacity and their\ndetermination to work for peace. We also commend the\ncrucial catalytic roles played by the United States of\nAmerica and the Russian Federation as co-sponsors of the\ntalks. The Kingdom of Norway also deserves our gratitude\nfor its contribution to the peace talks. The sustained\nsupport and commitment of the Arab League to the peace\nprocess also merit special mention.\nOn the other hand, negative developments abound in\nAfrica and elsewhere on the international scene. These\nconflict situations continue to defy durable solutions\nthrough dialogue, reconciliation and negotiation, in stark\ncontrast with the exemplary cases I have just cited.\nThus, in our region, the civil wars in Liberia,\nRwanda, Somalia and the Sudan torment us all because of\nour aversion to fratricidal and ethnic violence and the\nserious humanitarian crises they have engendered. In this\nconnection, Zambia also strongly condemns ethnic\nviolence wherever it occurs, including in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nWe deplore the further deterioration of the situation\nin Liberia. We regret the lack of progress towards\ndisarmament, demobilization and general elections. We\nappeal to all the parties to commit themselves to the\nCotonou and Akosombo Peace Agreements. We also\nwish to stress the need to maintain the Military Observer\nGroup of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOMOG) in Liberia and to provide it with the\nrequisite logistical support.\nAs for Rwanda, we and the entire world community\nhave been deeply shocked by the genocide and the most\ndehumanizing spectre of violence in that country,\nresulting in one of the worst humanitarian and refugee\ncrises in the history of mankind. Zambia has expressed\nits strong condemnation of the genocide and mindless\nviolence in Rwanda. We strongly feel that those\nresponsible for the massacres must be brought to trial\nthrough an international tribunal. Conditions of peace,\nsecurity, stability and confidence should be created in\nRwanda in order to facilitate the repatriation of refugees\nfrom overburdened neighbouring countries. We hope that\nthe new Government will commit itself to carrying out its\ndeclared intention to work for reconciliation, rehabilitation\nand reconstruction in Rwanda. Substantial assistance for\nhumanitarian, rehabilitation and reconstruction purposes\nis thus crucial. The neighbouring asylum countries also\nneed assistance.\nThe role and efforts of the United Nations\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in creating\nconditions of stability and security in the country are\ncrucial. We therefore deeply regret the delay in the\ndeployment of UNAMIR troops to the level of 5,500 in\naccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nIn this regard, African countries have been ready and\nwilling to send sufficient troops. However, the major\nconstraint has been inadequate logistical support.\n15\n\n\nAs a token measure, Zambia has contributed a\npeace-keeping contingent of civilian and military personnel\nto the UNAMIR operation, thanks to the generous logistical\nsupport, in materiel, from the Netherlands. Furthermore,\nthe Zambian Peace Corps, a non-governmental organization,\nhas organized activities to raise funds to purchase\nmedicines, food and other humanitarian requirements for\nthe displaced people in Rwanda.\nWe remain concerned by the continuing crisis in\nSomalia and by the lack of progress. We note, however,\nthe genuine efforts being deployed to resolve the crisis.\nNotwithstanding the difficulties, we strongly believe that\nthe continued presence of the United Nations in Somalia is\ncritical.\nIn Sudan, the continuing civil war and factional\nfighting in the south and the deteriorating human rights\nsituation nationwide are a cause of serious concern to us in\nZambia. We urge the parties to reach a negotiated\nsettlement.\nAs to Haiti, Zambia reaffirms its support for the\nefforts of the Organization of American States and the\nUnited Nations to restore democracy and respect for human\nrights there, in accordance with the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nWith regard to Cuba, we reaffirm our belief that the\ntime has come for the economic, commercial and financial\nembargo against Cuba to be lifted. We hope that our two\nfriends the United States and Cuba will resolve their\ndifferences peacefully. In this regard, we are encouraged\nby the recent dialogue between the two countries.\nZambia attaches great importance to the role of\nregional organizations in addressing conflict situations. In\nthis respect we note with satisfaction the increasingly active\nrole played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nincluding at regional and subregional levels, to address the\nroot causes of conflicts and to prevent, manage and resolve\nthem.\nIn particular, in June of last year the OAU established\na mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution\nof conflicts in order for Africa to deal effectively with\nconflict situations on its own. For too long and too often,\nAfrica has relied on external assistance to resolve its\nconflicts. The time has come for Africa to handle these\nsituations resolutely. Conflicts continue to sap Africa\u2019s\nenergies, to waste its scarce resources and to retard its\ndevelopment. They must be eliminated in order to create\nan environment conducive to economic and social\ndevelopment.\nZambia therefore appeals to the international\ncommunity to contribute generously to the OAU Fund\nestablished to sustain the Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention, Management and Resolution. International\nsupport is critical to the effective implementation of this\nimportant initiative. It is warranted by the fact that the\nUnited Nations, through the Security Council, exercises\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\npeace and security.\nIt is now evident that peace and development not\nonly are interrelated but are indivisible. This has been\nbrought into prominence by the comprehensive reports of\nthe Secretary-General entitled \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" and\n\\\"Agenda for Development\\\". Indeed, in a number of\nconflict situations poverty and deprivation have been the\nunderlying causes. There is, therefore, a compelling case\nto bring development and related issues to the centre\nstage of the United Nations, in order to promote the cause\nof peace in its most comprehensive perspective.\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s\npreliminary report on the \\\"Agenda for Development\\\". My\ndelegation fully supports the views of the Group of 77 on\nthis subject, as reflected in its Ministerial Declaration of\n30 September 1994. In particular, an Agenda for\nDevelopment must be action-oriented and focus on the\neconomic growth and development of the developing\ncountries, especially the least developed amongst them.\nThe Agenda for Development must strengthen the role of\nthe United Nations in the area of international economic\npolicy-making and coordination.\nAfrica is in economic crisis. It continues to face\ngrave economic difficulties. Africa therefore needs a\nfavourable international economic environment for the\npromotion of investment flows, increased official\ndevelopment assistance, technological transfer, improved\ntrade opportunities and better terms of trade. Africa\nfurther needs a viable and comprehensive solution for its\nhuge debt burden. Such a debt strategy should include\ndebt cancellation. In this regard, we fully support the\npositions of the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned\nMovement.\nZambia welcomes the conclusion of the Uruguay\nRound and the Agreement to establish the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) with effect from January of next\nyear. It is our expectation that the World Trade\n16\n\n\nOrganization will promote a non-discriminatory and\npredictable trading system and protect the rights and\ninterests of the developing countries.\nIn view of the increasing economic disparity between\nthe developed and the developing countries, the WTO will\nnot start on a level playing field. In this connection, it is\nthe strong view of my delegation that the implementation\nof the Uruguay Round must be monitored constantly to\nensure that the interests of developing countries are\nadequately protected. Compensation should be provided to\nthose developing countries that are facing difficulties,\nparticularly the least developed.\nLet me now address Zambia\u2019s economic and political\nsituation. On the economic front, we have followed,\nresolutely, a credible macro-economic reform programme\nwhose main objective is to promote growth with stability\nbased on an equitable allocation of resources. The main\npolicy thrusts of the programme include strict control of the\nmoney supply and credit, with the aim of keeping inflation\nto minimal levels; liberalization of the economy with\ngreater reliance on market forces; and implementation of\nthe privatization programme, through which previously\nState-owned enterprises are to be turned into private\nconcerns in order to reduce direct Government participation\nin the economy.\nAlthough these measures are expected to yield positive\nresults in the long run, they have had some short-term\nnegative effects, such as a drastic reduction in employment\nlevels in the formal sector, a decline in income level, and\na marked increase in both the level and the intensity of\npoverty, especially in the rural areas and among the\nvulnerable segments of the population. To cushion the poor\nfrom these adverse effects of economic adjustment, a social\nsafety net has been created to assist those who lose their\njobs or who are unable to meet their basic needs or obtain\nsocial services. It is going to be a long haul, but the\nZambian Government is determined to rise above these\nchallenges.\nI should be remiss if I did not express gratitude to all\nour development partners for the economic, financial and\ntechnical support rendered to our country. The support\nprovided Zambia by our development partners will serve to\nunderpin our structural adjustment programme, to which our\nGovernment remains committed. More importantly, such\nassistance will help to consolidate our democratization\nprocess, which we initiated in 1991 with the reintroduction\nof plural politics. In this regard, my delegation is pleased\nto assure the international community that Zambia\u2019s\ndemocratization process remains firmly on course.\nThere is a strong connection between the plan of\naction adopted at the Cairo Conference on Population, the\nWorld Summit for Social Development, to be held in\nCopenhagen early next year, and the World Conference\non Women, to be held in Beijing, next September. The\nWorld Summit on Social Development will be an\nopportunity for the international community to renew its\ncommitment and political will to effectively address a\nnumber of social and economic problems.\nThe contribution made by women to development\nefforts is very clear, although it is often underestimated.\nWe therefore look forward to Beijing\u2019s programme of\naction, which we trust will ensure the full and equal\nparticipation of women at all levels of human activity.\nWith regard to the environment, the international\ncommunity is faced with the major challenge of giving\npractical effect to the concept of sustainable development\nas reflected in Agenda 21. To do this, effective\ninternational cooperation is vital. In particular, practical\nsteps must be taken to provide access to appropriate\ntechnologies and to mobilize new and additional financial\nresources for the countries in need: the developing\ncountries. My delegation therefore calls on the developed\ncountries to fulfil the solemn commitments undertaken at\nthe Rio Earth Summit. At the same time, the task at hand\nis global and must thus be shared globally. It involves\nindividuals, community groups, non-governmental\norganizations, Governments and financial institutions. In\nthe language of the Earth Summit, \\\"common but\ndifferentiated responsibilities\\\" (A/CONF.151/26 (Vol. I)\nPrinciple 7) is now imperative.\nZambia attaches high priority to environmental\nissues. As a reflection of our commitment, we have\nformulated a National Environmental Action Plan aimed\nat integrating environmental concerns into our\nsocio-economic development plans. We have taken\ndeliberate measures to increase the level of public\nawareness of environmental issues, particularly through\nthe active involvement of non-governmental organizations\nand community groups.\nMy Government is firmly committed to the\npromotion and protection of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. We believe that it is the duty and\nresponsibility of all Governments to do so, regardless of\ntheir political, economic or cultural systems.\n17\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the Vienna World Conference on\nHuman Rights, we should work to implement its important\nrecommendations. Accordingly, my delegation will support\ngenuine efforts in this direction during the current session.\nMy delegation welcomes the establishment of the Office of\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights and the\nappointment of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ayala Lasso to this high office.\nMr. Lasso has already proven his suitability for the\nappointment, and we commend his important initiatives\nconcerning human rights situations in Africa and elsewhere.\nMy delegation also supports the strengthening of the United\nNations Centre for Human Rights in Geneva.\nMy Government has also established a Human Rights\nCommission, which is responsible for investigating alleged\nhuman rights violations in Zambia, including those\ncommitted prior to the reintroduction of plural politics in\n1991. In the spirit of our policy of transparency, the\nGovernment will publish the Commission\u2019s findings in a\nreport to be made available to the general public. Zambia\nis thus firmly committed to the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and to other relevant international covenants\nand instruments.\nIn the area of disarmament and arms control, my\ndelegation strongly supports efforts to accelerate the\nelimination of nuclear weapons and to conclude a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. We also fully support the\nreview and extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty\n(NPT), which is scheduled to take place next year.\nHowever, we share the view that any extension of the NPT\nshould be linked to progress on nuclear disarmament and to\nthe conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\nZambia welcomes the significant progress achieved in\nthe Geneva negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\nWe further support the case for a convention on\nconventional weapons and welcome the introduction of the\nUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms with a view\nto promoting transparency and confidence-building.\nZambia welcomes the successful conclusion during the\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly, of the\nagreement relating to the implementation of part XI of the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which\nopened the way for the universal acceptance of the\nConvention and its provisions.\nLet me now turn to the United Nations itself. As we\nmeet in this session on the threshold of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we have\nto recognize that the fundamental meaning of the United\nNations Charter has remained unchanged; that the United\nNations has undergone periods of both triumph and\ndisillusionment; that the United Nations is still an\ninternational organization for the people as well as of the\npeople and it is therefore supposed to be a democratic\ninstitution. It is now time to reflect on a United Nations\nthat will serve mankind for another 50 years after 1995.\nIt will have to be a new United Nations, one which will\nsuit the exigencies of the twenty-first century. It will be\nnecessary to sharpen the mechanisms that were\nestablished to give effect to the declared principles and\npurposes of the Charter. It is only by going through this\nmetamorphosis that our Organization will be able to adapt\nto a changed and changing environment, to new demands,\nnew opportunities and new challenges.\nIn this connection, my delegation is of the\nconsidered view that expansion of the membership of the\nSecurity Council is extremely important. Regions of the\nworld, such as Africa, that are not represented at the level\nof permanent membership should be so represented. It\nwill, therefore, be incumbent upon those regions to agree\non which country or countries should represent them as\npermanent members.\nApart from dealing with the Security Council, we\nmust fashion the United Nations in such a way as to\naccord a central role to issues of the development of the\ndeveloping countries. The Economic and Social Council\nshould therefore be attuned to meeting this challenge. We\nwould like to see a stronger Economic and Social Council\nwith a mandate adequate to coordinate the policies of all\ndevelopment programmes and activities, as well as the\nactivities of the specialized agencies, including the\nBretton Woods institutions, for the promotion of sustained\neconomic growth and development.\nWe now live in a world in which there has been a\nmajor recasting of international relations ranging from\npolitical to economic, environmental to humanitarian\nissues. In this new atmosphere, the United Nations is the\nlinchpin of our collective security, the repository of our\nhope for progress and prosperity. In this atmosphere, the\nUnited Nations has no greater contribution to make in the\nservice of its ideals than to help the world find its way\nfrom the era of fear from which we are emerging into a\ntime of hope and progress for all mankind.\nWe wish this great creation more success for the\nbetterment of the entire world.\n"

Its\nreadmission into the community of nations signifies victory\nin its long and difficult struggle for justice and equality.\nFor the African continent, it marks the closing chapter in\nthe total decolonization of the continent; and for the United\nNations, it concludes an extraordinary collective struggle\nagainst the policy of apartheid.\nIn this context, I must add that the recent decision by\nthe General Conference of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency to redesignate South Africa as Africa\u2019s\nrepresentative on the Agency\u2019s board was indeed\nappropriate and welcome.\nHowever, in welcoming South Africa back to our\ninternational Organization, we should also heed the words\nof President Nelson Mandela - uttered from this rostrum\nonly a week ago - that his country needs massive\nfinancial and material aid to cope with the problem of the\nmillions of poor and unemployed people in his country.\nWhile the triumph of democratic forces in South\nAfrica is cause for celebration, the tragic situation in\nAngola continues to be a source of major concern to my\ndelegation. We are gravely concerned at the continued\nconflict in that country. If the peace accord negotiated in\nLusaka is not signed by the end of October, the Security\nCouncil should immediately impose economic sanctions\non UNITA, as agreed in resolution 864 (1993). We\ncannot continue delaying and postponing action while\nwaiting for a peace that does not come. However, if the\npeace accord is signed, the United Nations, for its part,\nshould stand ready to deploy a greatly increased\npeace-keeping force to supervise the cease-fire.\nIn Mozambique, despite delays in the\nimplementation of the General Peace Agreement, we are\nhopeful that peace and stability will soon be realized.\nThe forthcoming national elections, planned for 27 and 28\nOctober, should produce results acceptable to all\nMozambicans so that they can live in peace and harmony.\nThe international community and the United Nations\nshould continue to provide the material assistance that is\nneeded to realize that peace in Mozambique.\nMembers are aware of the crisis situation that had\nbeen developing in the Kingdom of Lesotho since the\nbeginning of the year, which culminated in the attempted\nunseating of the democratically elected Government. We\nhave just heard a statement by the Prime Minister of\nLesotho himself, Mr. Mokhehle, describing to us the\nevents that took place in his country. Consistent with the\nOrganization of African Unity mechanism for the\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts, the\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC)\ncharged Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe with\nundertaking a regional initiative to resolve the crisis in\nLesotho.\nWe are happy to report that this joint mediation has\nresulted in the restoration of constitutionality and\nconstitutional Government in that country. Prime Minister\nMokhehle has adequately described that situation, and I\nneed add nothing more.\nIn Rwanda, the horrendous acts of genocide we have\nwitnessed will surely haunt every one of us for a long time\nto come, both those among us who had the means to act\nbut did not do so and the many who, while desiring to help,\nlacked the means. We call for the strengthening of the\nUnited Nations presence under the United Nations\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), as an essential\nconfidence-building measure to provide the displaced\npeople of Rwanda with tangible assurances that they can\nsafely return to their homes. A few days ago we heard a\nstatement by the President of Rwanda, Mr. Pasteur\nBizimungu, inviting an increase in the size of UNAMIR in\norder to achieve precisely what we are asking for:\nconfidence-building.\nIn both Rwanda and Burundi, the tensions are still too\nclose to the surface for anyone\u2019s comfort. In Somalia, the\ndeterioration of the security situation and the resurgence of\ninter-clan fighting, banditry and lawlessness are still a\nsource of great concern to my delegation. The people of\nSomalia should take full advantage of United Nations\npeace-keeping efforts and of the OAU mediation effort led\nby President Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, and forge a\npolitical settlement based on sharing the power among the\nSomali nation as a whole. Zimbabwe has contributed two\nbattalions to peace-keeping in Somalia. As we start\ngradually withdrawing those battalions, we hope they will\nnot be called back to a Somalia where law and order have\nbroken down again.\nWe are glad that the Identification Commission of the\nUnited Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western\nSahara (MINURSO), has begun its work, and we urge both\nparties speedily to resolve any outstanding impediments to\nthe holding of the referendum in that country - and we\nknow from debates in this Hall that there have been many\nimpediments. The quest for self-determination in Western\nSahara has taken too long, and has remained on our\ninternational agenda for a long time. It should therefore not\nbe delayed any further.\nMy delegation also welcomes the recent major\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process which have\nbrought the people of Palestine closer to their inalienable\nright to self-determination. While we fully support that\npeace process, we believe that it should proceed on the\nbasis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973) and 425 (1975), and that the international\ncommunity should continue to monitor developments in\nthat region closely so as to generate and maintain the\nmomentum for change. The people of Palestine still need\nand deserve our continued support until they reach the\ngoal of nationhood in a Palestinian State with its capital\nin Jerusalem.\nWe from the African region are particularly mindful\nof the inextricable link between peace, security and\nstability on the one hand and socio-economic\ndevelopment on the other. There can be no economic\ndevelopment without peace and stability. Central to these\nfundamental concerns about peace and stability are the\nbasic issues of protecting human rights and democratic\ngovernance. We believe that high priority must be given\nto these issues in our national policies. Consequently,\ndictatorial and non-democratic regimes should be shunned\nand isolated by all of us and by the international\ncommunity at large, as well as by regional organizations.\nThe curtailment of people\u2019s participation in\ndecision-making processes undermines the capacity of\ncountries to provide all their people with even the basic\nnecessities of life including food, water and shelter and\nbasic social services such as education and health.\nZimbabwe believes that international efforts to\npromote peace, stability and security where these do not\nexist or are threatened can largely be facilitated through\nregional organizations and good neighbours. We in\nAfrica have taken concrete measures in this regard by\nestablishing a permanent mechanism of the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) for the prevention, management\nand resolution of conflict. It is in keeping with the spirit\nof regional arrangements that the countries belonging to\nthe Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) joined hands in addressing the situation in\nLiberia - work that still continues - and that we in the\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) took\nthe initiative in Lesotho to which I have already referred.\nIn our view, such arrangements could also be devised to\naddress situations elsewhere in our continent, for example\nin Rwanda, Burundi and Somalia. What we are urging is\nthe involvement of regional organizations, subregional\norganizations and neighbourly countries in conflict\nresolution and conflict management, because they know\nthe problems and they know the issues.\nFor such regional arrangements to become\nsustainable it is essential that other regional organizations\nand the United Nations extend a helping hand by\n8\n\n\nproviding financial and other material assistance. For\nindeed, what are initially regarded as internal or local\nconflicts have the potential, if left unattended, to grow into\ntrouble spots threatening international peace and security\nitself.\nThis is an auspicious time for the family of nations to\nfurther the goal and achieve the objective that the founding\nfathers of our Organization had foremost in their minds: -\nthat of disarmament. In this context, my delegation is of\nthe view that the extension and review Conference of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\nscheduled to be held in March 1995 is a unique opportunity\nfor practical steps to be taken to ensure the total elimination\nof nuclear weapons. Clearly, the treaty itself is\ndiscriminatory and the nuclear-weapon States have not fully\nimplemented their obligations under article VI of the\nTreaty. Several speakers today have referred to the\ninadequacies of the Treaty. We will not support any\nindefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT in its\npresent form. The nuclear-weapon States must undertake\nto reduce and eliminate their nuclear arsenals within an\nestablished and binding timetable. As a demonstration of\ntheir good faith they must also stop impeding the early\nconclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Only then\nwill a nuclear non-proliferation regime be meaningful.\nLast year the Non-Aligned Movement submitted a\ndraft resolution asking the Assembly to request an advisory\nopinion from the International Court of Justice on the\nlegality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.\nThis was in pursuance of a long-standing position of the\nNon-Aligned Movement favouring complete disarmament.\nRegrettably, that draft resolution was not brought to the\nvote. We are, however, glad that the Non-Aligned\nMovement has this year decided to submit the draft\nresolution once more, and to press it to the vote in the\nAssembly. This initiative is deserving of the strongest\nsupport of all members. In recent years nuclear\ndisarmament has become a bilateral issue; yet the\ninternational community has a right to play a central role in\nensuring that the nuclear threat, which affects all mankind,\nis removed forever. If the Assembly were to request an\nadvisory opinion from the International Court of Justice,\nnuclear disarmament would be brought back into the\nmultilateral forum where it belongs, so critical issues\nrelated to nuclear proliferation and nuclear controls could\nbe discussed openly and commented upon in the General\nAssembly. It would also be consistent with the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s recommendation on resort to International Court\nof Justice advisory opinions in his report entitled \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\" and would give impetus to the process\nof nuclear disarmament, which has begun to flag in the\npost-cold-war era. The Non-Aligned Movement is to be\ncongratulated for having taken this initiative this year; we\nhope it will gain the support of the Assembly.\nWe all agree that there have been so many changes\non the international scene that the present Charter and\nmethods of operation of the United Nations should be\nrevised to meet the challenges and aspirations of a new\nand changing world order.\nIn this regard, my delegation has already put forward\nsome very specific proposals, which I will not recapitulate\nin any detail here. Those proposals are now part of the\nAfrican common position paper which refers to the\npowers of the Security Council, the General Assembly\nand the relationship of those bodies to the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions and to the specialized agencies. This subject\nhas been referred to by a number of speakers from this\nrostrum; indeed, the speakers from Africa have repeated\nthe African common position.\nIt is quite clear that the present arrangement, where\nAfrica and the Latin American region are not represented\nat all amongst the veto-wielding permanent members of\nthe Security Council, should not be allowed to continue.\nThe underrepresentation of these two regions is both\nundemocratic and unfair, and I hope that the matter will\nbe addressed at the appropriate time in terms of the\nAfrican common position.\nFurthermore, any exercise in the revitalization of the\nUnited Nations should envisage coordination of the\nactivities of the Bretton Woods institutions to which I\nhave already referred.\nWe are pleased that world-wide socio-economic\nproblems of equitable utilization and distribution of\nresources are going to be fully addressed at the Far Social\nDevelopment World Summit in Copenhagen next year.\nSeveral important conferences have recently been held\nwithin the framework of the United Nations: the Rio\nConference on Environment and Development and the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\nheld in Cairo in Cairo. We are now looking forward to\nthe World Summit for Social Development, to be held in\nCopenhagen next year, and the Fourth World Conference\non Women, to take place in Beijing later next year.\nThese conferences all address matters that are vital\nto the South and/or to the third-world countries as a\nwhole, and we hope that the social development Summit\n9\n\n\nwill focus on growing poverty in the world and how to\nattack it. The rapid development of science and technology\nis taking place in the middle of increasing poverty and\ndisease amongst large population groups, especially in the\nthird world. It is time we took enormous steps to eradicate\nworld poverty and to create full employment. We hope that\nthe combined efforts of the environment and population\nConferences, to which I have already referred, and the\nsocial development Summit and the Beijing Conference will\nmobilize the international community for a final and\nsustained attack on world poverty.\nZimbabwe believes that at the national level it is\nimperative that development put people first by promoting\nsocial development through employment-creation\nopportunities and other poverty- eradication programmes.\nIn our view, the provision of adequate food, water and\nshelter as well as such basic social services as education,\ntraining and health is an absolute imperative. In the\npromotion of opportunities for increased popular\nparticipation, the enhancement of the role and status of\nwomen requires paramount attention.Employment creation\nrequires greater private initiative and increased investment.\nThus domestic policies have to be pursued with the aim of\ncreating a favourable environment for investment.\nThe critical economic situation in Africa - the least\ndeveloped and most marginalized of all the regions of the\nworld - has to be addressed if global economic growth and\ninterdependence are to have any meaning at all. With 90\nper cent of all poverty stricken people in developing\ncountries, the eradication of poverty remains a major\nconcern at both the national and the international levels.\nYet neither the economic reform measures which we are\ncarrying out nor our efforts to alleviate and eradicate\npoverty can be expected to succeed without the provision\nof adequate financial resources on a predictable, assured\nand continuous basis, and we appeal to those countries that\nhave surplus resources to increase their support and aid to\nthe developing countries.\nFor most developing countries the issue of resource\nflows cannot be dissociated from that of the external debt\nproblem, a problem that has also been addressed in many\nstatements to the Assembly. Figures available clearly\nindicate that the overall debt of the developing countries is\nstill on the increase - from some $800 billion in 1982 to\n$l.4 trillion in 1992 - and it continues to rise. Combined\nwith the interest rates, the figures are constantly growing,\nindeed becoming staggering. We believe that new,\ncomprehensive and coordinated approaches to the debt and\ndebt- servicing problems have to be adopted, including\noutright cancellation or at least the application of the\nmeasures proposed under the Trinidad terms for low-\nincome developing countries.\nZimbabwe believes that the expansion of\ninternational trade is essential to economic growth and is\nindeed an integral part of development. We therefore\nconsider the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of\nmultilateral trade negotiations to be an important\nachievement which deserves to be welcomed by\ndeveloping and developed countries alike. We also\nwelcome the landmark agreement to create the new World\nTrade Organization, which we hope will reinforce the\nmultilateral trading system. We welcome the meetings\nthat have been arranged both in Africa and elsewhere to\nstudy the impact of the Uruguay Round agreement and\nthe World Trade Organization on our economies.\nWe reiterate the hope that these developments will\nimprove the access of developing countries\u2019 exports to\nmarkets in developed countries, and that the new\nconditionalities or new forms of protectionism under the\nguise of social or environmental clauses will be avoided.\nParticular attention has also to be paid to the critical need\nfor the diversification of the African economies. In that\nregard, we once again reiterate the need for the\ninternational community to support our proposal for the\ncreation of a diversification facility for the development\nof the African commodity sector.\nFinally we would urge the big Powers - and\nespecially the United States - to adopt a policy of\ndialogue rather than confrontation in resolving disputes\nwith smaller Powers around the globe. In particular, we\nwould urge full-scale discussion and dialogue with Cuba\naimed at normalizing relations with a small neighbouring\ncountry in the American region, dialogue with Libya in\norder to get a fair and just trial for those suspected of\ncausing the Lockerbie air disaster, and the continuation of\nthe meetings with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea in order to resolve the issues related to nuclear-\nweapons development and, hopefully, pave the way for\nthe reunification or North and South Korea.\nWith the end of the cold war, global peace - so\nmuch coveted -is now within our reach. A concerted\neffort by regional organizations and the international\ncommunity can get us to the promised land of\ninternational peace. We should try and try again, but the\nattainment of peace is not the task of international\norganizations alone: it is also the task of national\nGovernments and national leaders.\n10\n\n\nIn this context we would like to appeal to the leaders\nin the Gulf to pursue the path of peace that has been\ncharted for them by the United Nations in several\nresolutions, and to assure them that any attempt at\noccupying other countries in the Gulf, such as the one we\nwitnessed in 1991, will not be accepted by the Assembly or\nby the international community as a whole.\n"

        "file_text": "As we\nprepare to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding\nof the United Nations, the memory of the cold war is\nfading rapidly from our minds. We recall the nostalgia\nwith which we heralded the end of the era and the\nconcomitant universal aspirations to a world of peace and\nprosperity.\nThe world has witnessed the triumph of democracy in\nseveral areas and the resolution of conflicts that had\noriginated in a war maintained by the earlier East-West\nconfrontation. However, the images of violence, famine\nand destruction that flicker daily on our television screens\nsuggest some urgency for the world community to attempt\nto put an end to the violence and the senseless destruction\nof human lives.\nIt is against this backdrop, Sir, that we welcome\nsomeone with your wide diplomatic experience and wisdom\nas President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. I am confident that you will make an important\ncontribution to the further success of our deliberations on\nthe vital and major issues of our time.\nYour predecessor, our Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) and West Indian brother Ambassador\nSamuel R. Insanally, has established a superb record of\nachievements, on which I would like to congratulate him\nwarmly.\nAt this juncture in the history of the United Nations,\nour Organization is fortunate to have a Secretary-General\nlike Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a person eminently suited\nby training and disposition to guide the membership of\nthis body towards a new era of peace and prosperity that\nwe hope will emerge from the debris of the cold war.\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to welcome the\nnew South Africa into our midst as an equal Member of\nthe Organization, ready to participate in all its activities\nin accordance with the purposes and the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter. We now join the courageous\npeople of South Africa as they celebrate with happiness\nand pride their victory over the struggle of the century:\nthe fight against apartheid. At long last they have rid\nthemselves of the shackles of that abominable crime and\nhave finally removed the greatest blemish from the\ncontinent of Africa. We congratulate Mr. Nelson\nMandela and salute his determined march from prison to\nPresident. He symbolizes the aspirations of the South\nAfrican people and the values of non-racialism,\ndemocracy and peace. Indeed, this is a lesson in\nperseverance and faith in the human spirit.\n\n\nThe voice of the international community was clearly\nheard as it worked to mobilize public opinion against the\ninjustice of apartheid, and we are now greatly relieved that\nthe question of its elimination will finally be removed from\nthe agenda of succeeding session of the General Assembly.\nMy delegation hailed the historic Agreement on\nmutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization, which was signed on\n13 September 1993 in Washington, D.C. We also\nwelcomed the historic breakthrough that gave impetus to an\noverall Arab-lsraeli settlement when Prime Minister Yitzak\nRabin and Jordan\u2019s King Hussein met in Washington last\nJuly and laid the foundation for the establishment of a\npeace treaty between the two countries. The international\ncommunity must also be heartened by the establishment of\ndiplomatic relations between Israel and Morocco and by an\napparent thaw in relations between Israel and Syria. We\nare all looking forward with great anticipation to the\ncommencement of negotiations between the two\nGovernments. It is our hope that these initiatives signal the\nbeginning of the end of one of the longest standing and\nmost intractable conflicts of our time and that they herald\nan era of peace, security and political stability in the\nMiddle East.\nThe recent peace overtures in the Middle East are yet\nanother demonstration of the dramatic changes in\ninternational relations that have taken place since the\ncollapse of communism and the end of the cold war. In\nthis context my Government is optimistic that the still-\nunresolved major international political issues will be\nsimilarly settled. I refer in particular to the problem of\nNorth and South Korea and that of the People\u2019s Republic\nof China and the Republic of China in Taiwan.\nIt is the view of the delegation of Saint Vincent and\nthe Grenadines that the time has come when serious\nconsideration should be given the eligibility of the Republic\nof China in Taiwan to become a Member of the United\nNations. That is why my Government, in association with\nother like-minded countries, requested the Secretary-General\nto include an item on the agenda of the forty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly entitled \u201cConsideration of the\nexceptional situation of the Republic of China in Taiwan in\nthe international context, based on the principle of\nuniversality and in accordance with the established model\nof parallel representation of divided countries at the United\nNations.\u201d We trust that this item will soon secure a place\non the agenda of the General Assembly and that when it\ndoes every Member State of this noble institution will give\nits full support to this initiative. We cannot preach about\nthe universality of the United Nations while at the same\ntime we ignore the aspirations of over 20 million people\nin the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nCertain present-day international political trends, as\nI mentioned earlier, give us renewed encouragement and\nhope of relations being conducted between and within\nStates in accordance with the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations Charter. This, however, does not\nmean that the world is now free from tension and\ninternational disputes.\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a\npersistent crisis which continues to shock us all. Efforts\nmade to date by the international community to halt the\naggression by Serbia and Montenegro and to settle the\ncrisis by peaceful means have been in vain. The\nGovernment of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines regrets\nthat the recent proposals for a political settlement of the\nconflict have been rejected by the Bosnian Serbs. That\nrejection carries with it the danger of the continuation and\neven grave escalation of the conflict. We urge the\nBosnian Serbs to accept the proposals of the Contact\nGroup and to resolve their remaining differences in the\nspirit of peaceful negotiation and reconciliation, thus\ntaking irreversible steps towards a just and durable peace\nin Bosnia.\nAs a country blessed with freedom and the absence\nof racial and religious bigotry, we will always raise our\nvoice against any form of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d. We also\nlook forward to the reunification of Cyprus and to the\ndeparture of foreign occupation troops from all countries.\nThe vicious cycle of starvation, violence, the\nbreakdown of central authority, and endless conflicts\ncontinues to bedevil in varying ways the situation in\nSomalia, Zaire, Angola, Liberia, Mozambique, Burundi\nand Rwanda. We call upon the United Nations to\ncontinue its struggle to establish peace in these areas.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines places a high\nvalue on its relations with the Americas since we are part\nof the same hemisphere. We share the same burning\ndesire for meaningful economic, political and social\ndevelopment. Over the past decade there has been a\nnoticeable and commendable trend towards democratic\nrule.\nThe Convention establishing the Association of\nCaribbean States, which was signed at Cartagena on\n24 July 1994, represents an achievement in the areas of\n2\n\n\neconomic cooperation and regional integration, with the\nultimate objective of launching new opportunities for the\npursuit of collective initiatives by 40 Latin American and\nCaribbean States, comprising some 200 million people and\nunited by the waters of the Caribbean. The further\nstrengthening of the inter-American system remains a major\nobjective of the Government of Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines.\nMy delegation is very pleased that the use of force\nwas averted in Haiti and that, at long last, democracy and\nconstitutional legitimacy will be returned to that land. We\nare equally delighted to learn that General Cedras has\ndecided to relinquish power, thus paving the way for the\nreturn of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\nMy delegation wishes to commend President Clinton\nfor the leadership and determination he has shown in\nsupport of the international community\u2019s effort to restore\ndemocracy to Haiti and hope and dignity to the Haitian\npeople. The Government of Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines will continue to be an active participant in all\narrangements aimed at ensuring the safe return of President\nAristide and in the eventual rebuilding process.\nAmong the goals that the founding fathers of the\nUnited Nations set for the Organization were promoting\n\u201csocial progress and better standards of life in larger\nfreedom\u201d\nand recognizing development as an inalienable right of\nmankind. Regrettably, third-world countries like Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines feel very strongly that this goal\nhas so far been very elusive. With the end of the cold war\nand the relative success of the United Nations in its peace-\nkeeping, peacemaking and peace-enforcement roles, the\ninternational community must now attempt to grapple more\nseriously with the developmental problems faced by third-\nworld countries.\nIf countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are\nto survive in this harsh world environment, careful and\nurgent consideration must be given by the international\ncommunity to the following measures: first, revitalizing\ngrowth in developed countries; secondly, liberalizing trade,\nespecially to give market access to the products of\ndeveloping countries; thirdly, reducing debt and the debt-\nservice burden; fourthly, reversing the deteriorating\nmarketing situation for the primary products of developing\ncountries; fifthly, increasing official development assistance\nand humanitarian aid; and sixthly, creating a sensitivity to\nthe reduction in net capital flows from bilateral and\nmultilateral sources, as well as to the negative\nconsequences of the graduation of some countries, such\nas ours, from concessionary funding arrangements of a\nnumber of multilateral institutions.\nThe changing world environment dictates the need\nfor the revitalization and restructuring of the various\norgans of the United Nations. At the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\ncalled for enlargement of the membership of the Security\nCouncil to reflect the current global reality. Today we\nrepeat that call.\nMy Government attaches very high priority to\nrevitalizing and strengthening the role of the United\nNations in the promotion of international cooperation for\neconomic and social development. We share the view\nthat the United Nations should be encouraged to develop\nits full potential in the area of international economic\ncooperation and should be endowed with the necessary\nresources to enable it to contribute to solving the serious\neconomic and social problems facing developing countries\nin their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and\ndevelopment.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines hopes that the\nSecretary-General\u2019s Agenda for Development, together\nwith the conclusions of, and the follow-up to, the Rio\nConference and the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, which\nwas held in Barbados, as well as summits and\nconferences such as the International Conference on\nPopulation and Development, the World Summit for\nSocial Development, the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen and the Second United Nations Conference on\nHuman Settlements, will all contribute to better\nunderstanding of the problems faced by developing\ncountries and assist the evolution of a global consensus\nand the mobilization of adequate resources to address\nthese problems effectively.\nWe do not, however, support the creation of new\nbureaucracies. There are already enough institutions.\nWhat we need are better terms and a speedier reaction to\nestablished needs.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines continues to be\nplagued by the modern-day problem of the illicit\nproduction, trafficking and consumption of drugs and\npsychotropic substances. This scourge poses a serious\n3\n\n\nthreat to the well-being of our people and threatens to\ndestroy the social and moral fabric of our communities.\nThe archipelagic nature of our State, its many bays\nand cays and the mountainous terrain and rich alluvial soil\nof mainland Saint Vincent are characteristics that attract\nmany visitors to our shores and provide scarce foreign\nexchange to assist us in the development of our country.\nThese very features, however, operate against us in our war\nagainst the illicit production of drugs and their distribution\nby drug barons and their associates. Due to our limited\nresources, we are unable to police and control our borders\nand coastlines effectively.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines supports every\nsingle measure taken by the United Nations to cope with\nthis serious problem, and calls for continued efforts to\neliminate this global scourge.\nAt the local level, we have been taking forceful steps\nto confront this evil \u2014 pursuing a dynamic drug-abuse-\nprevention drive and at the same time launching major\nadministrative, legislative and judicial initiatives against the\nmarketing and trafficking of drugs.\nMy country has viewed with great interest the\nmeasures taken by the Secretary-General to revitalize the\nUnited Nations so that it is better prepared to attain the\nobjectives of the Charter. In particular, I wish to\nemphasize the active peace-keeping role of the Organization\nin the resolution of conflicts that originated before the end\nof the cold war and of new tensions emerging in hot spots\naround the world. The peace-keeping forces operating\nunder the United Nations flag perform a fundamental role\nby paving the way to dialogue and negotiation, thus\npreventing prolonged confrontations.\nWe wholeheartedly support this major peace-keeping,\npeacemaking and peace-enforcing thrust of the United\nNations. However, we feel that the criteria used in\nfinancing the forces involved must be re-examined. The\ncost of such operations is beginning to prove quite\nburdensome for both the Organization and its Member\nStates, especially those, like Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines, with a limited resource base. We look forward\nto efforts to alleviate the financial burden placed on small\ndeveloping States by the frequent deployment of such\noperations.\nToday, as we prepare to mark an important milestone\nin the history of the United Nations, and as we approach\nthe beginning of the twenty-first century, we look forward\nto a world where democracy, peace, sustainable\ndevelopment and human welfare are be available to all.\nMankind has spent almost half a century in pursuit of\nthese goals. Let us continue the struggle and never tire\nin its pursuit.\n"

        "file_text": "I\nwish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly. I feel sure that with\n5\n\n\nyour experience you will guide this session to a successful\nconclusion.\nIn my capacity as President of the Eastern Republic of\nUruguay, elected by the free vote of our citizens, I have the\ngreat honour of addressing the General Assembly.\nMy country has been linked to the United Nations\nsince the very moment of its creation. It not only has kept\na legal and formal link with the Organization but has\nbecome an active participant in its political and social\nactivities.\nAs the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\nUnited Nations approaches, this is an appropriate\nopportunity to undertake a critical analysis of the\nOrganization itself and to analyse the world situation\nfollowing the crucial events of the last few years.\nThe consequences of the end of the bipolar are and the\ncold war still affect the life of all nations. Although it has\nbeen stated that there is now a new world order, this is\ncontradicted daily by events that occur in all parts of the\nworld. We can say that the old order no longer exists and\nwe can also say that the world is currently undergoing a\nprocess of complete reordering.\nWe cannot yet see the end of that process, but there\nare a number of different actors, of various origins. Super-\nPowers and nations are no longer the only influences at\nplay in the international arena. Today, we can discern new\ncentres of power that have an unquestionable influence on\ninternational life. I would refer - and the list is far from complete -\nto the mass-communications media that standardize and\ntransmit opinions throughout the planet, thereby becoming\nguidelines that form opinion and actions and exert an\nundeniable influence.\nSimilarly, we could mention the re-emergence of\npolitically militant religious movements, both domestic and\ninternational, which use philosophical currents to create\ngenuine political leverage. Although economic interests\nhave, since the beginning of mankind\u2019s history, always been\nfactors in the power equation, market regionalization has\ntoday strengthened the power of economic and financial\nelements which, in America, Europe and Asia, are emerging\nas the main protagonists of national life.\nOf course, in this analysis we cannot fail to mention\nthe crucial and significant role played by international\norganizations, particularly our own Organization, the United\nNations.\nPainful experience has taught us how far mankind\nstill is from successfully expanding international law in\nrelations among countries. We are currently living in the\naftermath of the reordering process I have mentioned, and\nthe redistribution and relocation of the world\u2019s centres of\npower.\nAs part of this process, collective security\nmechanisms must be thoroughly analysed. Several States\nhave called for review of United Nations institutions, but\nwe must approach that task very carefully, for our\nprogress will be meagre indeed if we confine ourselves to\nagreeing that the new role of the United Nations should\nbe simply to reflect the new distribution of power that\nresults from the new world order. We believe, pursuant\nto the Charter, that the main issue of international\npeace-keeping and security is to be found in the extent to\nwhich international society is able to guarantee full and\ncomprehensive observance of all of the Charter principles.\nHere, emphasis should be placed on distinguishing\nbetween reforms of the institutional mechanisms designed\nto implement collective security and the integrity of the\nprinciples of international conduct, observance of which\nis the very foundation of this society.\nIt is indeed appropriate to enunciate these principles:\nprohibition of the use of force against the territorial\nintegrity and the independence of States; equality of rights\nand free self-determination; the duty of non-intervention\nin internal affairs - a principle that is clearly of Latin\nAmerican origin; the sovereign equality of States; the\npeaceful settlement of disputes and good-faith cooperation\namong nations. This is not a set of abstract measures or\npostulates that are overtaken by the present global\ncontext. These principles form the essence of\ninternational conduct for all States, the practical, direct\nand unavoidable end product of international relations.\nFull, comprehensive and continuing respect for these\nprinciples will determine whether or not the international\nsecurity and stability the world so needs is achieved and\ncan be maintained, particularly in this era of such great\nchange. Speaking realistically, they could be rated as\npossibilities that could, were they realized, lead to hoped-\nfor, feasible and compelling results. Thus, the creation,\nestablishment and maintenance of a climate and\natmosphere of international security are responsibilities\nthat are incumbent mainly on those States with the\ngreatest power and the greatest decision-making capacity\nin the international order, although other States bear equal\nresponsibilities in this respect.\n6\n\n\nThese principles are part of a whole, and they must\nnot yield to possible distortions, one of which calls for\nchange on the grounds that the world context has changed,\nleading to the justification of intervention on humanitarian\ngrounds, and another of which is embodied in the\ntemptation to exaggerate some of these principles to the\ndetriment of others, for example invoking self-determination\nas a pretext for violating the territorial integrity or national\nborders of other States.\nSpeaking in the Security Council on 4 May 1965, my\ncompatriot, Ambassador Carlos Maria Velasquez, stated\nwith perfect clarity:\n\\\"As I said only a short time ago in this very\nchamber on assuming the office of representative of\nUruguay on the Security Council, my country has long\nrealized from its own historical experience, which has\nbeen no less unhappy than that of other Latin\nAmerican countries, that the world must be governed\nby real respect for the rules of international law and\nmorality. Without this, harsh reasons of state will\ncontinue to be the predominant factor in international\nrelations and the fate of small countries will remain\nprecarious and uncertain.\n\\\"Our attitude is not what some realistic minds\nmight describe as one of sanctimonious legality.\nThere are very real grounds - and the case we are now\nconsidering is an example - for the small countries\u2019\nbelief that strict and faithful application of juridical\nprovisions governing what is termed security under\nlaw represents one of the corner-stones of our own\nsecurity.\\\"\n\\\"If I may say so, the great Powers can give such\ninterpretation to texts as they see fit because if, in\nfact, political decisions are to be based on will rather\nthan on reason, it is they who have the power to\ndictate them. We smaller nations need to adhere\nunswervingly to the rule of law. In our own national\ninterest, we need to know how far we can go and,\nperhaps more important still, the extent to which we\ncan be compelled.\\\" (Official Records of the Security\nCouncil, Twentieth Year, 1198th meeting, paras. 33\nand 34)\nIn this ever-changing world, diverse threats and\ntensions are multiplying, even in those regions where peace\nand security would seem to be firmly established.\nIt therefore seems urgent that the international\ncommunity effectively show that its commitment to the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter is\nnot a mere formal commitment or a passive expression of\nhope.\nIt is indeed deplorable to see that from one session\nof the Assembly to the next new confrontations continue\nto occur in various parts of the world, leaving their tragic\naftermaths of death and grief. This sad reality means, as\nnoted in the document submitted by the Secretary-\nGeneral, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", which clearly\nemphasizes the unavoidable responsibility of each and\nevery one of us in this area, priority must be given to the\nwork of the United Nations.\nCaught up as we are in a vicious circle of distrust,\ncivilized and fruitful coexistence will be possible only to\nthe extent that States carry out their actions in their\nparticular areas of interest in accordance with the\ninternational legal order and in strict accordance with the\nobligations incumbent upon them under the United\nNations Charter.\nAccordingly, Uruguay, in a constructive spirit, has\nparticipated actively in various peace-keeping operations\nin response to the needs of the international community.\nOur participation has been based on a number of\nfundamental principles that govern our foreign policy,\nnamely, non-intervention in internal affairs, peaceful\nsettlement of disputes, self-determination of peoples, and\nnon-use of force to achieve peace.\nOur assessment is that, in general, peace-keeping\noperations have shown positive progress in the settlement\nof conflicts, although several operational matters still have\nto be improved and resolved.\nFirst, we believe that peace-keeping operations must\nbe carried out in full compliance with the principles of\ninternational law as enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations. In this sense, and on the basis of our\nexperience, we believe that actions under Chapter VII of\nthe Charter or operations with a broad mandate should be\nundertaken only as a last resort, after the political means\ndescribed in Chapter VI of the Charter have been\nexhausted.\nFurthermore, we believe that action of this type can\nbe undertaken only when there are, clearly, emergency\nsituations that pose a real threat to international peace and\nsecurity. In addition, we have to bear in mind the views\n7\n\n\nof regional organizations and those of neighbouring\ncountries in the areas of conflict.\nOn the other hand, peace-keeping operations must\nhave a feasible and precise mandate, as well as a realistic\nschedule. Security Council decisions to send a mission\nshould not take account of the strategic or political\nimportance of the different regions and, thereby, simply\nhighlight differences that should not affect this type of\ndecision.\nUruguay has participated, and will continue to\nparticipate actively, in activities of this kind. We are\ncurrently taking part in seven operations - in India/Pakistan,\nMozambique, Iraq/Kuwait, Western Sahara, Liberia,\nRwanda and Georgia. Overall, more than 950 persons are\ninvolved. Given the relatively small number of people in\nour armed forces, these figures represent a high degree of\ncommitment, hardly matched in the international\ncommunity.\nOur country provides contingents for peace-keeping\noperations in the belief that we are contributing in a spirit\nof solidarity to the attainment of a collective goal that\ntranscends exclusively national interests. We believe that\nwe have a right to declare that such solidarity must also be\nmanifested by other members of the international\ncommunity in support of this effort.\nDespite its effort and the degree of its commitment,\nhowever, Uruguay does not see a similar return from the\ninternational community. It has not received compensation\nderiving from the depreciation of equipment and materials\nand from the contribution of contingents, which often pay\nwith their lives for their commitment to the international\ncause.\nWe support the various efforts with a view to\nadjusting the Charter of the United Nations to the changes\nin the international situation - in particular, those referred\nto in General Assembly resolution 47/60.\nReform of the Charter must be effected within the\nframework of the need to attain greater democratization and\ntransparency in decision-making, and to strike a balance\nbetween the existing Powers of the different bodies.\nUruguay favours an increase in the number of\nmembers of the Security Council to make it more\nrepresentative and to facilitate the fulfilment of its tasks.\nHere, the main challenge is to prevent an increase in the\nmembership of the Security Council from compromising its\nefficiency. Uruguay favours a minimum of 20 members\nand a maximum of 25. Uruguay does not oppose the\ninclusion of new categories of members -\nsemi-permanent, for example - under the principle of\nequitable geographical distribution, so long as this would\nprovide for more appropriate representativeness and equal\noperational opportunity. Nevertheless, we understand that\nsuch an innovation must be based on the idea that \\\"more\nprivileges entail more obligations\\\", including financial\nobligations.\nNew members should be elected for fixed terms to\nrepresent the various regions, and they should have a\nmandate encompassing regional interests. We would\naccept their re-election provided that the members in\nquestion had the support of the States in their own\nregions.\nThere are certain legal matters affecting the\nOrganization that deserve our attention. In this\nconnection, I should like to refer first to the situation\nprovided for in Article 50 of the Charter, which affects us\ndirectly. Reality has shown the need for a mechanism to\nensure reparation for third States that are economically\naffected by the application of sanctions imposed under\nChapter VII of the Charter. In our opinion, such a\nmechanism should be permanent and should operate\nautomatically.\nSecondly, we must pay more attention to the\nquestion of responsibility for attacks on United Nations\nand associated personnel, given the ominous increase in\nthe number of such attacks. This is a situation with\nwhich our country is very familiar.\nThe problems facing the international community\ntoday include issues of a global nature affecting all\nMembers of the United Nations, as well as other\ntemporary issues which concern one or more individual\nStates but which may have implications for the rest of the\ninternational community.\nWe shall refer to both, beginning with those of a\nglobal nature: international terrorism, international\ncooperation against crime, and human rights.\nActs of international terrorism are serious\ncommon-law crimes, which violate the most elemental\nprinciples of individual and collective security,\nirrespective of the political excuses invoked for their\nperpetration. They are a flagrant violation of human\n8\n\n\nrights and must be fought, domestically and internationally,\nwith efficient and energetic measures.\nUruguay is aware of the various efforts in different\ninternational forums, but we are concerned about the lack\nof practical, concrete and global action to deal effectively\nwith this serious and complex problem. Although the\nmaintenance of internal order and security is the\nresponsibility of each State, cooperation between countries\nis essential to coordinated prevention and punishment of\ncrimes that have international implications.\nThese mechanisms could include full respect for the\nnorms of extradition in accordance with the law, which are\nthe tangible expression of the political will of States to\ncooperate in the preservation of the legal rights protected by\ninternational agreements and by domestic legislation.\nAmong the many rights for the protection of which we\nare directly responsible are the human rights of the child.\nIn this very building, in 1990, we held what was described\nas the World Summit for Children. On that occasion we\nadopted an extensive document intended to set the\nguidelines for highly ethical action, through which nations\nundertook to protect the future of mankind - our children.\nThis document included pragmatic issues such as the\nprotection of children in situations of armed conflict and the\nadoption of appropriate measures to protect them.\nThe conflict afflicting the Balkans has given rise to\nepisodes that disturb the conscience of mankind. The\nconsequences have been particularly atrocious for the\nchildren in the region - innocent victims of an immoral\nconflict. We have brought this case to the attention of the\nrelevant agencies. We considered that under the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child there was a case for\nseeking a truce to allow for the evacuation of children from\nbattlefront areas. Unfortunately, nobody got beyond written\nwords, and our Organization was not able to prevent even\nthis aspect of the barbarism prevailing in that area.\nIn the same spirit, it is necessary that our Organization\nfully enforce this Assembly\u2019s resolution establishing the\nneed for effective action against the sexual exploitation of\nchildren in order to prevent and eliminate such abuse.\nUruguay is aware of the need to preserve the quality\nof the physical and human environment and of the dangers\narising from the degradation of natural resources. This is\nwhy it has adopted the programmes in Agenda 21 of the\nUnited Nations. Our National Parliament enacted a law\ngranting priority to the protection of the environment\nagainst any form of depredation, destruction or pollution\nand making environmental impact assessments mandatory.\nAs a State located in the Southern Cone of the\nAmerican continent, our country has a particular interest\nin all issues relating to climate changes that affect us. At\nthe tenth session of the Intergovernmental Committee, as\na contribution to the research on this topic, Uruguay\noffered to host the permanent headquarters of the\nsecretariat of the Convention on Climate Change.\nAll these actions and initiatives have been taken in\nthe framework of the strategy - which my country\nshares - to promote lasting economic and social\ndevelopment without prejudice to the environment or to\nnon-renewable resources, thus achieving solid and\nsustained growth for both the present and future\ngenerations.\nThe work of the United Nations and the specialized\nagencies in the social field has earned a well-deserved\nrecognition. The present times call for a more crucial\nrole by the United Nations system and for the broadening\nof activities to meet the new challenges, for example, the\ngrowing imbalance between the wealthy countries and the\ntwo thirds of mankind who live in poverty.\nIt is urgent that we check deteriorating social\nconditions in the developing world, so as to prevent these\nsituations from becoming threats to international peace\nand security. Accordingly, Uruguay enthusiastically\nsupports the convening of the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, to be held in Copenhagen in March 1995.\nThis event will provide an opportunity to discuss global\nstrategies for strengthening international cooperation for\nboth wealthy and developing countries.\nOur country is deeply concerned about the\ncontinuing deterioration of the world economy, which\nseems to be accelerating day by day. The persistence of\nrecession and inflation, the rise in unemployment, the\ninstability in foreign exchange markets, the disorder in the\nbalances of payments in industrialized regions, the\nrecurring protectionist currents that continuously depart\nfrom GATT rules - all this inevitably delays economic\nprogress in the developing countries, the majority of the\nStates gathered here.\nFree trade is still one of the bases on which to\nachieve and to strengthen development processes; it is\ntherefore important that we have been able to conclude\nthe so-called Uruguay Round of GATT - but this can only\n9\n\n\nbe seen as the end of one stage. Although in principle the\nresults can be described as encouraging, they will be\nmeaningless unless free trade is broadened in the future.\nThat is why the various agreements reached must be\ncomplemented by further reducing support and subsidy\nlevels and by eliminating non-tariff obstacles to trade.\nThere is no doubt that the tasks to be undertaken by\nthe World Trade Organization will be of critical importance\nin strengthening the process of free trade. Therefore,\nprompt ratification of the Marrakech Agreements by all\ncountries is necessary in order to allow this new\norganization to begin operations on 1 January next year.\nIn the context of reorganizing current international\ntrade relations, Uruguay firmly supports the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s initiative in his report, \\\"Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\", which is a positive contribution in the\nsearch for a revitalized approach to the concept of\ndevelopment, as it includes the objectives of peace,\nfreedom, justice and progress.\nBefore I turn to items on particular situations, let me\ntake up one last global topic, that relating to progress in\ninternational law, an area dear to my country, which is a\nfervent advocate and a jealous guardian of its application.\nWe are convinced of the need to promote the\nevolution of international law as the most effective tool to\ngovern relations among States. We wish to affirm our\nsupport for the implementation of General Assembly\nresolution 44/23, the objective of which is to promote the\npeaceful settlement of disputes and to achieve compliance\nwith the decisions of the International Court of Justice,\nwhile encouraging the codification of international law, a\ngoal our country has long desired.\nIn addition, we are pleased to see the entry into force\nof the Convention of the Law of the Sea - which was\nratified by our country - and we are hopeful that some\nStates will be able to overcome their difficulties with\ncertain points and accede to the Convention, thus achieving\nits full acceptance.\nIn conclusion, I would like to refer to three\ninternational situations in which my country has a particular\ninterest, as their outcome may have consequences at the\ninternational level and affect the credibility so necessary to\nour Organization at this time of restructuring and\nrevitalization.\nFirst of all, my country wishes expressly to mention\nthe situation in the Middle East, given our traditional\nbonds with many of the States of the region. We have\nalways been concerned with the various approaches to\nachieving peace in the Middle East. In this connection\nwe recall Uruguay\u2019s co-sponsorship of the repeal of\nresolution 3379 (XXX), which illogically and unjustly\ndetermined that Zionism was a form of racism.\nUruguay has always supported all actions, in\naccordance with international law and with the resolutions\nof the Security Council, aimed at achieving peace through\nthe negotiation of agreements among the parties involved,\nas the only valid alternative allowing the parties the\npossibility of living within safe and recognized borders.\nWe have recently witnessed an acceleration of these\nnegotiations, with considerable progress in the\nachievement of border agreements, the opening of air\ncommunications and the recognition of the State of Israel.\nAt the same time, however, we note with concern the\nrecurrence of terrorist attacks aimed at crippling this\nprocess - the final goal of which is desired by the\noverwhelming majority of the international community:\nthe achievement of permanent peace in that region.\nWe understand that this session of the Assembly can\nbe instrumental in furthering progress in the peace\nprocess, by the Organization\u2019s adoption of a realistic and\nup-to-date position on the current negotiations, modifying\nthe contents and style of General Assembly resolutions in\nkeeping with this new stage.\nWe in the American hemisphere believe that the\nCuban situation must be seen in the light of two\nconsiderations: on the one hand, the view - shared by our\ncountry - that pluralist and representative democracy and\nthe protection of human rights must be fully consolidated\nin our continent without any exceptions; and, on the\nother, the perspective of respect for the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter regarding non-intervention and the\nself-determination of peoples.\nObservance of these precepts and of general\ninternational law implies the adoption of unambiguous\ncriteria regarding the economic, commercial and financial\nblockade of Cuba. In this sense, our country, true to its\nconsistent policy, will support the resolution that\nestablishes the need to eliminate the unilateral application\nfor political purposes of economic and commercial\nmeasures against another State - without, however, any\n10\n\n\nimplications of recognition or acceptance of the type of\nregime prevailing in that country.\nLastly, the position of Uruguay on the crisis in Haiti\nis well known. Our country has invariably opposed any\nkind of military intervention lacking the necessary legal\nsupport. Under the Charter of the Organization, the use of\nforce is limited to cases in which the community is\nconfronted with a clear threat to international peace and\nsecurity.\nRegardless of the dynamics of events, we still believe\nthat political instances and dialogue are the best instrument\nfor preserving the principles of international law and\nsettling situations of this nature.\nInternational, and particularly hemispheric, relations\nmust take place against a backdrop of realism and legal\nsecurity: realism to adjust to ongoing change in the internal\nand external aspects of each country; and legal security to\nfind in law the criteria of equity and justice that make the\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States feasible and\ncredible.\nMay the upcoming commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations be an opportunity to\nreflect on what has been achieved and - as was so well said\nby the Secretary-General - to learn the lessons of the past\nas a challenge for the achievement of future goals.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all allow me to say how pleased we are\nat your election as President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session. Since you are such an eminent\nstatesman, we are certain that this session will be a\nresounding success. We hail the work accomplished by\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who presided\nover the recently concluded session of the General\nAssembly. We are grateful to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nSecretary-General of the Organization, for the fine job he\nis doing, reflecting his constant concern with helping to\nbuild a more just and progressive world society on the basis\nof the purposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter.\nThis past May, the Panamanian people completed an\nirreproachable electoral process. The results now make it\npossible for us to undertake the democratic reconstruction\nof the State, with broad-based and cooperative participation\nby all of Panama\u2019s various social groupings.\nThis has made it possible for us to develop promising\nnew relations of understanding and cooperation with the\nGovernment of the United States, grounded in a common\nresolve to fulfil on schedule the timetable established by the\nTorrijos-Carter Treaties on the Panama Canal and\nassociated territories. Furthermore, we are seeking to\nextend our relations, as partners and friends of the United\nStates, into fields that will facilitate the solution of regional\nand world problems affecting the stability of areas of\ncommon interest to both nations. With maturity, and an\nintense sense of dignity and patriotism, the Government of\nPanama is embarking on a new era in our relations with the\nUnited States.\nThus these Treaties today are becoming once more for\nour two nations what we intended them to be when they\nwere signed 17 years ago: the feasibility of a great Power\nand a small country working together, peacefully, to\nachieve mutually beneficial results on matters that\npreviously gave rise to confrontation. Furthermore, this is\nin keeping with the principles of international law and gives\nus all new cause for hope concerning the new era the world\nis now seeking to establish.\n\nPursuant to those Treaties, the Government headed by\nMr. Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares intends in a responsible\nmanner to put into effect the timetable of reversion to\nPanama of all the lands, waters and installations that form\nthe Canal and its contiguous area. Similarly, we intend to\nensure full demilitarization of the waterway and,\nconsequently, we are planning as of now the prompt\nconversion of the foreign military installations there into\nindustrial and trading posts of international interest, whose\noperations will be carried out just a few scant yards from\nthe vessels that pass through day by day, heading towards\nall points of the compass.\nThe decisions we have taken will ensure that this\nstrip of territory will become one of the most attractive\nareas for investment in the Atlantic, the Americas, and the\nPacific Basin.\nDespite Panama\u2019s intense economic and cultural\nenergy, it is a small country. Hence developing this\nproject will require international cooperation. In the short\nterm, the new Panamanian Government intends to\ncoordinate this cooperation in order to take the best\npossible advantage of a tremendous potential.\nIn this context, we shall convene in 1997 the World\nCongress on the Panama Canal to commemorate the\ntwentieth anniversary of the signing of the Torrijos-Carter\nTreaties. This event will bring together the users of the\nCanal and the potential users of the associated facilities -\nshipbuilders, industrialists, financiers, technical experts,\nplanners and leaders of higher education - to consider the\nscope and orchestration of the entire development project\nfor the Panama Canal and the Panamanian nation.\nThis Congress will also be an arena for the display\nof technology-, media- and communications-related\nproducts, as well as for interoceanic and intercontinental\ntrade. It will therefore be of particular importance in\ngauging the scope of the new world trend which we now\ncall \\\"globalization\\\". For this reason, we intend to plan\nthis Congress with the cooperation of the United Nations\nas well as that of the two countries which, in their time,\nwere engaged in the construction of the Canal - France\nand the United States.\nThere is another facet to this situation, however. We\nPanamanians have convincingly proved our ability to\nefficiently administer and operate the existing Canal; we\nshall demonstrate this once again at the World Congress.\nYet we wish to make further use of these skills, and this\ndesire forms the basis for the projects tied in with the\ncurrent, final phase of implementation of the Torrijos-\nCarter Treaties: by this, I mean the international\nuniversity conglomerate that we call the \\\"Ciudad del\nSaber\\\", \\\"the City of Knowledge\\\". In this area, and with\nthe excellent infrastructure facilities that will soon revert\n22\n\n\nto Panama, we can bring together, in the best possible\nphysical environment, faculties and departments of the\nmajor universities interested in studying subjects related to\nthe next century and its prospects - subjects such as\ncommunications and telecommunications, naval and air\ntransport, computer technology, international trade, the\nenvironment and sustainable development, as well as\neconomic and business relations between our Americas and\nthe Pacific basin.\nThus conceived, the City of Knowledge will replace\nmilitary bases and foreign soldiers with an international\nconglomerate of universities and a great army of students\nand teachers from all corners of the world. This will be the\nbest possible way to celebrate the end of the cold war and\nthe development of new world circumstances, while at the\nsame time making the new era accessible to many\nthousands of our young people. We are certain that this\nproject will receive the necessary international cooperation\nand the support of the United Nations system.\nThere is another issue of similar, worldwide interest\nthat deserves the attention of this forum. Although it is an\ninteroceanic passageway, the Panama Canal is fed\nexclusively by fresh water. For this reason, its existence,\nthe quality of its services and the possibility of expanding\nthem depend on the renewal of its forests and the attention\nto the environment that is indispensable to feeding its basin,\nguaranteeing the water supply and making it possible for\nthe Canal to operate.\nThis basin has suffered disturbing deterioration, which,\nshould it continue, could jeopardize the services provided\nto the world by the Canal. Conscious of its responsibilities,\nour country has begun a series of national and international\nconsultations with a view to devising a campaign that\nwould secure the technical and financial resources needed\nto ensure the environmental conditions required for the\nimprovement and optimal use of the Canal. This campaign\ncould perhaps serve as a symbol of international\ncooperation in ensuring appropriate use of resources\nnecessary to mankind.\nOur country has recently rejoined the Rio Group - of\nwhich we were one of the initial promoters - as a full\nmember. With respect to foreign policy, we fully concur\nwith the purposes, declarations and agreements adopted by\nthis group.\nWe Panamanians are sincerely resolved to expand our\npolitical dialogue and economic cooperation with\nneighbouring countries. To this end, we are pursuing the\nprocess of integration with the countries of Central\nAmerica in all ways that can be mutually beneficial.\nBecause of its history and traditions, as well as for\nreasons of geographical proximity and economic affinity,\nPanama will be promoting links and integration with its\nSouth American neighbours, with which it shares the\nideals of Bolivar.\nAt the same time, the great trading opportunities\nafforded us as a result of the reversion of the Panama\nCanal and its adjacent areas make it incumbent on us to\nstrengthen our links with the countries of the Pacific\nbasin, and to work together on projects and activities of\nmutual benefit.\nFor similar reasons, Panama, which already has a\nspecial relationship with the United States - a relationship\nthat is taking on special significance today - intends to\nseek membership in the North American Free Trade\nAssociation, whose current members, Canada, the United\nStates and Mexico, are certain to play a significant role in\nensuring the best possible use of the Canal areas that will\nrevert to Panama.\nIn recent times, the international community has\nnoted symptoms of repeated crises in certain parts of the\nCaribbean area. Indeed, on certain specific conditions,\nPanama has offered parts of its national territory to help\nprovide a temporary solution to the problem of the\nHaitian and Cuban raft and boat people. This gesture has\nbeen motivated solely by humanitarian considerations,\nwithout political or diplomatic implications. We shall\ncontinue to act in this manner, especially when it is useful\nin providing a grace period during which a peaceful, and\nagreed solution to the underlying causes of these\nproblems may be found.\nIn the case of Haiti, my Government is particularly\ngratified that an agreement was reached which allowed\nfor the landing of multinational forces in accordance with\nthe relevant Security Council resolution and without the\ntrauma of an invasion by force. We believe, none the\nless, that Haiti\u2019s problems will be solved only when all\naspects of the Security Council resolution are fully\nimplemented and, in terms of socio-economic issues,\nprovided the international community helps eradicate the\ncauses of the poverty and backwardness which persist\nthere.\nWith respect to the situation in the fraternal Republic\nof Cuba, we believe that the causes underlying the\n23\n\n\nconflict must be addressed. For this reason, my\nGovernment favours reforms which, through the exercise of\nself-determination, would guarantee the establishment of a\nmulti-party democracy there. Furthermore, my Government\nis in favour of lifting the economic embargo that is such a\nburden on that country. Only by acting simultaneously on\nboth fronts will it be possible to overcome this crisis. We\nare fully ready to assist the fraternal Caribbean nation of\nCuba.\nWith the conclusion of the cold war, the world is\nfocusing most of its attention on other problems, new and\nold, which now make up the world agenda - problems such\nas the current restructuring of systems of economic\nrelations and international politics.\nIt must be stressed that in the handling of the\nphenomena known as \\\"globalization\\\", it is vital to establish\na new order which will take into account the realities,\ninterests, sovereign rights, and just aspirations of the small\ncountries and the developing nations in general. Any\ndevelopment which, out of selfishness, indifference,\ninattention, or the like, fails to meet this requirement, will\ninevitably condemn us to a world riddled with yet further\nimbalance, marginalization and instability.\nMankind\u2019s hopes for the twenty-first century will be\nrealized only if together we are able to build a much fairer,\nmore equitable and more balanced future. This applies to\nall countries, be they rich or poor, weak or strong.\nSpecifically, such a future requires that we embark\nimmediately on a vigorous programme of common and\ncoordinated actions to eradicate mankind\u2019s greatest\nproblem: poverty. Panama declares again today, before the\nAssembly, that it is willing to join the international\nprogrammes to combat poverty and promote solidarity and\nsocial equity, as well as those aimed at promoting a better\nquality of life for the sectors that are most deprived and\nleast fairly treated. In particular, Panama will commit itself\nto efforts to improve the social situation of the family and\nof women and children.\nIn respect of this universal aspiration, women in\nPanama have already attained positions of relative\nimportance in both political and professional arenas.\nToday, for the first time in the history of our Republic, the\ndeserving President of our legislative organ is a woman\nwho is a popular leader, while in our last elections another\nprominent female politician was a candidate for the\npresidency of the Republic of Panama, and she now leads\nthe major opposition party. We are also proud to see\nPanamanian professional women serving in the Cabinet of\nMr. Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares and as judges on our\nSupreme Court of Justice. In short, women in Panama\nplay a leading and powerful role in all aspects of our\npolitical and private life, and they are often at the\nforefront of our technical, scientific and professional\ndevelopment. For this reason we shall continue to\nsupport actions that make it possible for women to\nachieve full and effective equality of rights and\nopportunities in an increasingly competitive world.\nOn another question, my country has decided to\ntackle firmly and unequivocally the problems of drug-\ntrafficking, money-laundering and terrorism. We are\ncurrently devising a strategy to combat these terrible evils\nthat imperil the very existence of our nations. We favour\nthe development of joint, coordinated action on the\ninternational level. The community of nations faces a\ngreat challenge in these grave problems, and we fervently\nappeal to the Governments and the peoples of Latin\nAmerica to create a powerful organization to combat\nthem.\nIn another area, Panama is particularly attentive to\nthe discussions aimed at defining a new role for the\nUnited Nations and the corresponding structural reforms\nthis world Organization requires. With regard specifically\nto the structure of the United Nations, Panama believes it\nis necessary to increase the representativity of its most\nimportant decision-making bodies. In particular, my\ncountry believes that the Security Council must be\nenlarged. Panama wishes to reiterate that, whatever\napproach is taken, Latin America\u2019s participation in that\nbody should be increased and Latin American countries\nshould be given consideration as possible permanent\nmembers.\nI am pleased to state that the new democratic\nGovernment of Panama fully accepts the commitment to\nbolster and enhance its presence in international agencies,\nwhere it is a Latin American and Caribbean voice that\nremains faithful to the rightful aspirations of the\ndeveloping countries. This decision is reflected in the\nspeech delivered by Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares when he\nwas sworn in as my country\u2019s President. He said:\n\\\"This is the new face that Panama is showing to its\nfriends abroad. We are no longer at the stage of\nseeking solidarity on the Canal Treaty in order to\nregain the benefits of our geographic position. Now\nwe want to begin our participation in the new world\nthat is challenging us all and to make known the\n24\n\n\npotentialities of our geographic position, our desire to\ntake advantage of all opportunities properly, fairly and\nrespectfully, in the pursuit of an aggressive foreign\npolicy free of complexes and capable of helping us\nsurmount the challenges of the next century. We are\nfriends to all. We are foes of none.\\\"\nWe look with optimism on the development of\nmankind and, in particular, that of my country. We will\npass the baton to our young people on our country\u2019s path\nof progress, peace and justice.\nFinally, on this occasion I also take pleasure in\nwishing you, Mr. President, every success in your task of\nleading the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "Our world is moving into a\nnew era which has not yet taken a permanent shape. This\nprocess of change entails profound transformations, some\nof which promote development, the rule of law, respect for\nhuman rights and care for the environment, while others\npresent a serious threat to life and to the world itself.\nDuring this process cultural, social and political principles\nwhich once seemed to be of eternal value are superseded by\nnew ones.\nIn many parts of the world instability reigns, causing\ntragedy and chaos.\nIn these challenging times, Sir, your unanimous\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\nninth session merits compliments. Your election to this\nhigh office is a demonstration of the Member States\u2019\nconfidence in you. The Republic of Suriname is\nconvinced that under Your Excellency\u2019s guidance our\ndeliberations during this important year will produce\ntangible results.\nWe pay tribute to Ambassador Samuel Insanally of\nGuyana for the excellent way in which he presided at the\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\nThe vital, extraordinary and excellent manner in\nwhich Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali fulfils his mission as\nSecretary-General of the United Nations in these critical\ntimes of intensified disputes, war and violence earns our\ngratitude, admiration and respect. We wish to thank him\nmost heartily and, at the same time, congratulate him on\nhis important role in shaping the future of the\ninternational system.\nEvents during recent years have confronted the\ninternational community with the reality that the demise\nof the confrontational clash of ideologies did not\nautomatically usher in the stability and prosperity to\nwhich we all aspire. Immense problems persist in the\npolitical, social and economic spheres and at the national,\nregional and international levels.\nWe are witnessing the eruption, the continuation and\nthe spreading of severe national and ethnic rivalries, as in\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda. These conflicts\nand disputes have given rise to the emergence of a large\nnumber of displaced persons, who are subjected to the\nworst kind of harassment, starvation and deprivation.\nThese manifestations are compounded by practices\nthat once again leave a shameful blot on our civilization.\nThe international community cannot close its eyes to\nthese practices or fail to act in the face of such horrifying\nand unacceptable situations. Such crises, regardless of the\nvarious causes and motives from which they may ensue,\ntend to have in common the fact that masses of innocent\nwomen, children and elderly people pay the price and\nbear the brunt of conflicts and wars.\nThe real concern is not only the number of victims\nclaimed or the scale of the destruction that may ensue but\nalso the possibility that the seeds of those conflicts will\nspread, both in the developed and in the developing\ncountries, in the absence of the attention of a world order\ncapable of containing and addressing their causes.\n5\n\n\nIt is legitimate for the international community to\nregard these problems as a shared burden and to strive for\ntheir peaceful and prompt solution on the basis of practical\ncooperation. We should in the short term resort to such\nmechanisms as are deemed practical to come to the\nimmediate rescue of those who are suffering. Furthermore,\nwe should increase our efforts to eliminate the deeprooted\ncauses of the unresolved national conflicts, to ensure the\ncivil and human rights of ethnic minorities and to promote\npeaceful coexistence through respect for each other\u2019s race,\ncolour, ethnicity, religion and sex. If we fail to do so, the\nsuffering will be prolonged and will threaten regional and\ninternational peace and security.\nAs we discuss the issues now confronting our world,\nwe cannot but refer to the importance of building a new\nreality that aims at the full development of the people\u2019s\npotential through the establishment of peace, the building of\ndemocracy and the shaping of sound economies.\nWe know that it is a difficult process to establish\ndemocracy, dependable democratic institutions and a\ndemocratic culture. Notwithstanding the commitment or\nvigour with which our Governments strive to achieve this\nobjective, the process is bound to be slow and full of\ncomplications. Suriname is convinced, however, that we\nmust endeavour to reach this goal, led by the perception\nthat the core of democracy, as we see it, is not merely\nadherence to an ideal system but one of the most important\nprerequisites for a stable, united and integrated society that\ncan swiftly settle its differences, realize its aspirations and\nenjoy and preserve its cultural, political and socio-economic\nachievements.\nThe commitment of Suriname to the cause of\ndemocracy is strengthened by the distressing experience of\nthe rule of dictatorship under which its people had to live\nsome years ago. There are indeed tremendous efforts\ninvolved in bringing a democratic system back on track.\nOur involvement in the building of a new national\npolitical reality establishes a link between us and the\nregional process of political renewal, in which Governments\nof the region are faced with the complex task of restoring\nand safeguarding democracy.\nIndeed, in Latin America and the Caribbean,\ndemocracy has suffered some severe setbacks.\nThe problems of Haiti are of particular concern to us.\nThe violent and illegal interruption of the democratic\nprocess in this country has led to continued violations of\nhuman rights, to increased poverty and to suffering for\nthe Haitian people, as well as to the flight of thousands\nfrom their home country. It is against this background\nthat my Government has granted a request to provide a\ntemporary safe haven for Haitian refugees and has\npledged its support to the multinational force.\nFurthermore, my Government decided to make\nmembers of the national army and the police force\navailable to the United Nations mission in Haiti, which,\nwithin the framework of the implementation of Security\nCouncil resolution 940 (1994), will become operational\nsimultaneously with the restoration of the democratic\nGovernment under the leadership of President Jean-\nBertrand Aristide.\nMy Government\u2019s decision to support and participate\nin the United Nations mission in Haiti was inspired by its\nconception of regional and international responsibility to\ncontribute to the safeguarding of constitutional democracy\nin the region.\nWe believe that our hemisphere is in need of\npermanent mechanisms to guarantee swift and direct\naction when democracy is threatened - for example, by\nthe unconstitutional take-over of Governments.\nThe significant efforts made by the United Nations\nand the Organization of American States, including the\nvarious resolutions adopted, the missions sent to Haiti and\nthe threat of an immediate military intervention, have\nfinally convinced the military leadership to step down not\nlater than 15 October.\nIn a general sense, we are hopeful that current\ndevelopments in Haiti, which are the result of initiatives\ntaken within the framework of the United Nations, will\nlead to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. Suriname\nwishes to emphasize that all efforts to restore democracy\nin Haiti will appear to have been in vain if the rich\ncountries do not forthwith pool financial resources in a\nfund for the reconstruction and development of Haiti.\nThe developments in South Africa which led to the\ndemise of the abhorrent regime of apartheid and to the\nestablishment of a democratic and non-racist South Africa\nhave led to the conviction that in the end the rightful\nstruggle of people for justice, equality and majority rule\nwill meet with success. Indeed, the birth of the new\nSouth Africa last April has demonstrated that structures\nimposed by force cannot survive the determination of\nthose who seek justice.\n6\n\n\nThe people and Government of the Republic of\nSuriname wish to congratulate the people of South Africa\nand their leaders, especially President Nelson Mandela, on\nthis success, which will have a positive impact on the world\ncommunity.\nWe are all greatly indebted to the Special Committee\nagainst Apartheid, which for 32 years played a vital role in\nglobal efforts to end apartheid. My country is confident\nthat the new Government in South Africa will cope well\nwith the new challenges it faces. We hope that the\ninternational community will not wait to assist the new\nGovernment in bringing about the necessary economic and\nsocial changes to build a future of security, stability and\nprosperity for the South African people.\nThe many positive political changes and international\nbreakthroughs resulting from the end of the cold-war era\nhave had a profound influence on the problem of the\nMiddle East, especially the Palestine issue. The conflict\nhas taken a positive turn in line with those changes. My\nGovernment wishes to record its satisfaction over the\nhistoric agreement signed between Israel and Jordan, which\nfollowed the accord between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization in September 1993. The historic\nopportunity to achieve lasting peace has now materialized\nand the international community must guarantee that this\nimportant momentum is not lost.\nThe statistics of the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the World Bank and the United Nations give\nrise to only one conclusion: that we live in a world beset\nby inequality, gross disparity and imbalance in the\ndistribution of wealth and resources, and urgent solutions\nfor the economic situation of developing countries are\nrequired.\nThe problem of economic imbalance is not limited to\na few countries or to one region. It is a global issue - just\nas peace and democracy are global issues - and for that\nreason this forum must deal with it as a matter of priority.\nNo longer is it the nuclear nightmare that frightens us most:\nrather, it is the scourge of poverty, which continues to\nerode the foundations of our civilization.\nIn Suriname, as elsewhere in Latin America, the\nCaribbean and other regions, bold but necessary reforms\nhave been set in motion to eliminate obstacles to\ndevelopment and economic competitiveness in order to\nadapt to new international realities. In this context, my\ncountry is endeavouring to rehabilitate and reconstruct the\nbeleaguered economy of our nation on a sound and solid\nfoundation.\nWithin the framework of these economic reforms we\nconsider the development of human resources to be a\npriority issue. We consider it to be extremely important\nto improve the living conditions and basic health and\nnutrition of our people. We are committed to these goals\nbecause we believe that every human being has the\nultimate right to development.\nThe austerity measures which were subscribed to by\nmy Government have not been easy to implement because\nof the weakness of the economy and the hardships and\nsuffering they impose on our people. Notwithstanding the\nprogress made so far, it is obvious that such an\nundertaking calls for the availability of vast resources,\nwhich cannot be mobilized at the national level only. We\ntherefore have called on the international community to\nprovide assistance to complement our domestic efforts.\nIn particular, we have called on our historical partner to\nfulfil the agreements reached in this context and to\nsupport us in our attempts to create prosperity for our\npeople.\nWe must add to this that it is our obligation to see\nto it that our need for aid does not lead to the\nrecolonization of our country.\nMy Government shares the international\ncommunity\u2019s concern for the fragile ecosystem in our\nworld, which must be protected. Like other developing\ncountries, Suriname is confronted with the challenge to\nmeet its present development needs and simultaneously\nsafeguard the environment and natural resources for\ngenerations to come. In trying to establish a sound\nbalance between development and environment my\nGovernment has committed itself to taking all the\nmeasures necessary to protect and preserve the\nenvironment, in accordance with the guidelines adopted\nby the Rio de Janeiro Conference, and has incorporated\nthe concept of sustainable development in its national\ndevelopment programmes.\nIf the international community does not have the\npolitical will to deal effectively with the crises occurring\nin so many economies, the world will continue to lack\nstability and will remain vulnerable to upheavals and\nsetbacks that could undermine the foundations of the\nfuture.\n7\n\n\nIn the context of the recently held International\nConference on Population and Development and the\nforthcoming Fourth World Conference on Women, a World\nSummit for Social Development is therefore a timely\ninitiative as it will provide an opportunity to embark on an\nin-depth analysis of human development in all its aspects.\nThese international meetings should afford all of us the\nopportunity to address in an integrated manner the issues of\npoverty, unemployment and social integration.\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean various\nencouraging initiatives have been taken to deal effectively\nwith the imperatives of economic and social development\nand to enhance the capability of the countries of the region\nto respond to the pressing challenges ahead. Joint efforts\naimed at the strengthening of regional integration and\ncooperation have been made.\nOn 24 July 1994 in Cartagena, Colombia, we stood at\nthe cradle of the Association of Caribbean States, an\nassociation which brings together member States of the\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), the countries of\nCentral America, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti,\nSuriname, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela. This is\nindeed proof of the growing awareness among the\nleadership in the region that closer economic and political\nrelations are tools to enhance our capacity to bring\nprosperity to our peoples. By joining the Association of\nCaribbean States, Suriname has demonstrated that it is part\nof the region and wants to participate in the shaping of its\nfuture.\nSuriname has also explored the possibility of joining\nCARICOM as a full member since it believes that by\njoining Suriname will both enhance its own capacity to\nintensify regional cooperation and bring to the Caribbean\nCommunity its cultural richness and its economic\nopportunities.\nOur hemisphere, which includes both developed and\ndeveloping countries, is being challenged to take the\nopportunity provided by global changes to develop\ninitiatives for the cultivation of international relations\nconducive to prosperity for all on the basis of sustainable\ndevelopment, social reform and equity.\nIn the light of these aims, my country welcomes the\nproposed Summit for the Americas, to be held in December\n1994, at which representatives of countries of the Western\nhemisphere will come together to address these issues and\nto act as catalysts for the changes needed in the\ndevelopment patterns of both the countries of the North and\nthose of the South in order for them to reach their\ncommon goals.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the\nSea has on many occasions been described as one of the\nmost important multilateral legal instruments of our\ncentury. My Government participated actively in its\npreparation, and I take great pleasure in congratulating the\nworld community on the coming into force of this\nConvention on 16 November 1994.\nOn behalf of my Government, I also wish to express\nmy satisfaction with the agreement that has been reached\nwith regard to the mining of minerals in the deep sea-bed,\nas contemplated in the aforementioned Convention.\nAll Members of the United Nations pledge their\nsupport for the principles and initiatives of the United\nNations. At the same time, the Member States are\nkeeping an eye both on the kind of support and on the\nlevel of assistance they can generate from this\nOrganization. Suriname does so.\nFor Suriname, many aid programmes from the\nspecialized agencies and other United Nations bodies have\nbeen hampered by the implementation of one of the main\ncriteria for assistance. Suriname was counted among the\nnet contributors of the United Nations Development\nProgramme because our national per capita income was\ncalculated to be higher than $3,000. This figure is wrong\nbecause of an unrealistic official exchange rate. Now that\nthe official exchange rate has moved to a realistic level,\nwhich is more than 100 times the former rate, Suriname\nis looking forward to a readjustment of its status and\nsubsequently to a reclassification, and also to the aid\nprogramme that will follow this transformation.\nWe are involved in an evolutionary process, with\nboth the world and the United Nations adjusting to new\ndemands with regard to peace, security and sustainable\ndevelopment. It is clear that a new international order\nbased on the democratic participation of all States calls\nfor a restructuring and strengthening of the United\nNations in response to its new responsibilities. Indeed,\nthe role of the United Nations has taken on more\nrelevance than ever before, and it is most urgent for the\ninternational community to restructure this Organization\nin order to enable it to play the important role for which\nit was created.\nThe celebration in 1995 of the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations will be a good occasion on which to\n8\n\n\nreflect on the new role of the Organization and the\nattainment of that objective, provided that the relations\nbetween the General Assembly, the Security Council and\nthe Secretary-General are reorganized.\nMy Government is committed to contributing to the\nsuccessful outcome of this endeavour.\n"

The\nAfghan delegation assures him of its full cooperation\nduring his term of office.\n23\n\n\nI cannot fail to express the gratitude of the Afghan\ndelegation for the effective leadership shown by\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, the President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session, in guiding the\nproceedings of that session.\nHis Excellency Professor Burhannudin Rabbani,\nPresident of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, has instructed\nme to convey to the Assembly a message he has addressed\nto it. I am privileged to read out that message now:\n\\\"Your Excellencies, Heads of State and\nGovernment participating in the forty-ninth session of\nthe General Assembly,\n\\\"His Excellency the Secretary-General,\n\\\"His Excellency the President of the General\nAssembly,\n\\\"I convey my best wishes for the prosperity,\nwelfare and progress of your nations, and wish the\nUnited Nations and the current General Assembly\nsession ever more success in furthering the cause of\npeace and social justice.\n\\\"I had desired to personally attend the current\nGeneral Assembly session and avail myself of the\nopportunity to meet and extend to you, and through\nyou to your Governments and peoples, the message of\nthe Islamic State and the Afghan nation. However,\nimportant State engagements, particularly some\nongoing developments concerning the consolidation of\nthe political process in my country, prevented me\nfrom doing so. Therefore, I have asked the Chairman\nof the Afghan delegation to convey this brief message\nto the General Assembly.\n\\\"This message raises the cry of a nation which,\nwith its unprecedented sacrifices, has played its\nhistoric role for the cause of world peace and stability\nand for the collapse of the hegemonistic and\nexpansionist system of the former Soviet Union, as\nwell as for the defence of freedom, social justice and\ndemocratic values. A nation which suffered more\nthan 1.5 million sacrifices and immeasurable\ndestruction in all spheres of its life has contributed to\nthe ending of the cold war and to a considerable\ndiminution of the threat of nuclear confrontation. It\nwas the ending of global polarization that enabled East\nand West to attain positive understandings that\nproduced assurances and trust leading to the\nestablishment of extensive cooperation and the\nrecognition of democracy as an accepted value and\nconcept, irrespective of any bloc interest.\n\\\"We are mindful of the fact that our friends are\nequally grieved as a result of the prevailing\nsufferings imposed upon our innocent nation. We\nappreciate their readiness to endeavour to find an\nend to those destructive events.\n\\\"I would like to make it known that as far as\nthe Islamic State is concerned, we have proved our\nsincerity and our dedication to a peaceful settlement\nof the present problems. To allow the political\nprocess to consolidate, I have announced my\nreadiness to transfer power to a responsible and\nlegitimate authority. I have even declared that I\nwould not be a candidate during the transitional\nperiod.\n\\\"It is the warmonger elements who have taken\nadvantage of our flexibility and conciliatory\ngestures, including our unilateral cease-fire\ndeclarations, to strengthen their political and military\npositions and please their outside supporters with\nmoves towards the realization of their heinous\ndesigns. These are elements whose merciless rocket\nattacks on innocent civilian targets and the continued\nviolation of international humanitarian law are\nmatters of everyday life.\n\\\"The Afghan nation is astonished to continue to\nsee a lack of adequate enthusiasm on the part of the\nworld community to act effectively towards the\nrealization of the following legitimate aspirations:\n\\\"First, an extensive collective endeavour to provide\nrealistic and effective assistance to accelerate the\nongoing political process inside the country;\n\\\"Secondly, an immediate start of practical assistance\nfor the reconstruction and rehabilitation of war-torn\nAfghanistan, as well as mine clearance, to facilitate\nand speed up the repatriation of Afghan refugees;\n\\\"Thirdly, effective international measures to stop\nforeign interference, particularly in the form of the\nsupply of weapons and ammunition to those who\ncontinue to cause immeasurable loss of life and\ndestruction of property.\n24\n\n\n\\\"Finding a solution to the existing problems of\nAfghanistan necessitates the taking of realistic and\ncourageous action by the world community, the United\nNations and, in particular, the United Nations Security\nCouncil.\n\\\"We are confident that clear and decisive action\nin continuation of the support extended to us during\nour 14 years of struggle would enable the Afghan\nnation once again to live in peace, equality and\nbrotherhood, free from any form of racial, ethnic,\nlinguistic and religious prejudice. It is in such an\natmosphere of peace and tranquillity that Afghanistan\ncould play its positive and effective role in the\nconsolidation of regional peace and stability as a\npositive element, defending democracy and social\njustice.\n\\\"As history recounts, a disturbed Afghanistan has\nalways been a source of regional instability, just as its\nstability has had a positive impact on the tranquillity\nof the region.\n\\\"It is expected that those concerned with peace in\nAfghanistan, especially our fraternal neighbouring\ncountries, will be supportive of the ongoing political\nprocess in our homeland.\n\\\"The tenets of Islam guide us towards honesty,\njustice and mutual respect among members of the\nhuman community, irrespective of any form of\nprejudice. Islam calls upon all Islamic nations to\nserve the cause of the peace and security of mankind.\n\\\"The United Nations, as a source of hope for\nmany suffering nations around the world, can play a\ndecisive role in the return of peace to our shattered\nand war-stricken country.\n\\\"We are appreciative of the personal efforts of\nHis Excellency the Secretary-General of the United\nNations and the special mission under the leadership\nof His Excellency Mahmoud Mestiri. We also value\nthe efforts of His Excellency Mr. Hamid Algabid,\nSecretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, for his continuous search to put an end to\nthe conflict in Afghanistan. We wish them every\nsuccess in coordinating their efforts with our national\nendeavours based upon realistic approaches.\n\\\"Let us hope that our future generations will\nrecall the efforts of our friends and those interested in\na stable and peaceful Afghanistan as the continuation\nof our just struggle for the cause of peace.\n\\\"Wishing the current session of the General\nAssembly every success,\n\\\"Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani,\n\\\"President of the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan.\\\"\nLet me begin my own statement by referring to the\nmiseries being inflicted upon our people and country and\nby letting members of the Assembly know about some\nrecent political developments in Afghanistan.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly three\nmain political developments have taken place in our\nnational efforts aimed at further consolidation of the\npolitical process and in the international action in favour\nof peace and stability in Afghanistan:\nFirst, the completion of the first two rounds and the\nbeginning of a third round of peace efforts by the United\nNations special mission to Afghanistan;\nSecondly, consideration of the situation in our\ncountry by the Security Council;\nThirdly, major developments in the political process,\nhighlighted by the convening in August 1994 of a\nSupreme Islamic Council in Herat and by its significant\nresolutions.\nFollowing the first round of its visit to Afghanistan\nthe special mission submitted its report (A/49/208) to the\nSecretary-General. Before making some comments on\nthat report, I wish first to express the gratitude of the\nIslamic State of Afghanistan to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his personal concern and\nthe attention he continues to pay to Afghanistan. We\nassure him of our continued cooperation and support. I\nshould also like to reaffirm the commitment of the\nIslamic State to support the special mission and to\ncooperate with it to enable it to discharge its mandate\nsuccessfully.\nHere, I should like to draw the attention of the\nAssembly to some elements in the report that are of\nparticularly importance. Paragraph 13 states that the\nmission found most of the country - at least two thirds of\nit - to be at peace. I would also draw attention to the\n25\n\n\nrealistic conclusion of the mission in paragraph 31, which\nstates, inter alia, that the\n\\\"mission believes that reconstruction assistance should\nnot be seen as separate from but integral to a lasting\npolitical solution.\\\" (A/49/208, para. 31)\nEmphasizing the interrelationship between political and\neconomic activities to promote peace, the report says:\n\\\"Political and economic activity are interrelated and\ninterconnected forces, which must be linked in\nAfghanistan in ways which encourage peace.\\\" (Ibid.)\nWe appreciate this positive assessment of the mission.\nIn the light of the above conclusions of the United\nNations mission as well as its recommendations, and based\nupon the critical need of the Afghan people for outside\nassistance, we believe the notion of peace first and\nreconstruction assistance second is no longer justifiable or\nplausible. The beginning of reconstruction assistance in\nthose parts of the country where peace prevails will\ncertainly encourage and persuade those who are illegally\ncarrying arms to abandon their weapons for shovels and\nbegin rebuilding their agriculture and farms.\nSince the beginning of the abortive coup of 1 January\nin Kabul, the United Nations Security Council has\nconsidered the situation in Afghanistan on three separate\noccasions. This consideration, which was in conformity\nwith the Afghan nation\u2019s expectations of the Security\nCouncil, was timely and appropriate.\nIn its Presidential Statement dated 23 March 1994,\n\\\"The Council stress[ed] the importance that it\nattaches to full compliance with international\nhumanitarian law in all its aspects and recall[ed] that\nthose who violate international humanitarian law bear\nindividual responsibility.\\\" (S/PRST/1994/12)\nThat Statement was just, positive and realistic.\nRecently, another Security Council Presidential\nStatement, dated 11 August 1994, was issued in reference\nto certain developments including the progress report of the\nUnited Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan and the\nrecommendations therein. This Presidential Statement too\ncontains some positive, important and realistic elements, in\nparticular the fourth paragraph, wherein\n\\\"The Council calls on all States to take the\nnecessary steps to promote peace in Afghanistan, to\nstop the flow of weapons to the parties, and to put\nan end to this destructive conflict.\\\"\n(S/PRST/1994/43)\nThe Statement also urges the international\ncommunity to assist Afghans in rebuilding their shattered\ncountry.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan expressed its\nappreciation to the Council for addressing an important\naspect which is the core of the problem. However, we\nnote with astonishment the reluctance on the part of the\nCouncil to condemn the aggressors, who continue to\ninflict inhuman atrocities on innocent civilian populations\nand continue to violate international humanitarian law.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan once again states\nthat the present crisis in the country is not a civil war but\nrather an imposed armed conflict fueled from abroad.\nThe Security Council\u2019s good intentions for\nAfghanistan can be realized only if the Council addresses\nthe actual cause of the fighting. It should not limit itself\nto the mere issuance of statements, but should consider\ntaking some specific enforcement measures.\nIn this connection, it would be appropriate to refer\nto resolution 48/75 H, adopted at the forty-eighth session\nof the General Assembly on 16 December 1993, on\nmeasures to curb the illicit transfer and use of\nconventional weapons. The Assembly, considering the\navailability of massive quantities of conventional weapons\nas a contributing factor to armed conflicts around the\nworld and recognizing the excessive quantity of\nconventional weapons in a number of countries as a\nsource of destabilization of their national and regional\nsecurity, invited Member States to take appropriate\nenforcement measures directed at ending the illegal export\nof these weapons from their territories.\nThe continued illegal flow of conventional weapons\nto Afghanistan represents a violation of the provisions of\nresolution 48/75 H by some of our neighbouring\ncountries. We hope that the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral to the General Assembly at the current session,\nrequested by that resolution, will suggest effective ways\nand means of stopping the illegal flow of these weapons\nand of collecting weapons illegally distributed in the\ncountry.\n26\n\n\nNow I should like to turn to the recent major political\ndevelopment which is a source of hope for bringing an end\nto the crisis in our country:\nAt the beginning, it would not be inappropriate to\ndraw the attention of this Assembly to the fact that the\ncurrent situation in Afghanistan is a legacy of 14 years of\nprotracted war stemming from the invasion unleashed by\nthe former Soviet Union, as well as of a series of\ninterferences in our internal affairs over the last two years.\nTo eliminate the manifestations and effects of such a\nprotracted war, which aimed at erasing all spiritual,\nhistorical and cultural values of Afghan society, is not\nfeasible in a short period of time.\nEarly last month on the initiative of the south and west\nzone of the country and its leader and general commander,\nGeneral Mohammad Ismail Khan, a Supreme Islamic\nCouncil convened in the ancient city of Herat, with the\nparticipation of more than 700 delegates representing\ndifferent strata of Afghan society, including governors and\nthe main commanders of various provinces, religious\nscholars, tribal leaders, technocrats, intellectuals and other\nscholars, as well as 150 representatives of Afghans living\nabroad. That important gathering was also attended by the\nrepresentative of the Office of the Secretary-General on\nAfghanistan and Pakistan as well as by a number of\nrepresentatives of friendly countries. At the end, the\nSupreme Islamic Council adopted an eleven-point\nresolution. Due to the important contribution the realization\nof the objectives of the said resolution would have in the\nconsolidation of peace and the political process in the\ncountry, I should like to take the liberty of shedding light\non some of its most important points.\nGiven the fact that on the basis of Islamic law and\ninternationally accepted principles, the will of a nation is\nthe source of national sovereignty, the Supreme Islamic\nCouncil decided:\n- To convene a traditional Grand National\nAssembly - Loya Jirgah - by the end of October 1994, in\nthe capital, Kabul, in order to determine the future political\nleadership of the country; adopt and ratify the future\nconstitution; and settle other important national issues yet\npending;\n- To reject and condemn any Government created\nagainst the will of the nation and under the patronage of\noutsiders;\n- Strongly to condemn foreign interference in the\ninternal affairs of Afghanistan, calling upon the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the United\nNations to act resolutely to put an end to that interference\non the basis of the provisions of their Charters;\n- To reaffirm the fact that Afghanistan is a\ndistinct and indivisible political entity.\nThe participating members of the Supreme Islamic\nCouncil in Herat committed themselves to standing firm\nagainst any rejection of this national accord. The full text\nof the Herat resolutions can be found in the official\ndocument of the Security Council (S/1994/943).\nIt is gratifying to note that based upon those\nresolutions, a preparatory commission for the Grand\nAssembly convened on 30 August in Kabul and at its first\nmeeting unanimously elected Mawlawi Mohammad Nabi\nMuhammadi, the leader of the Herakat-Inqalabi Islami\nparty, as its Chairman.\nGiven the fact that the resolutions adopted in Herat\nmarked a major new stage in the political evolution of our\ncountry, with the emphasis on the broad participation of\nAfghans, in that national gathering, and taking into\nconsideration the effective role that the special mission of\nthe United Nations could play in the acceleration of the\npeace process, it would be relevant to say a few words\nabout the need to coordinate and merge these two series\nof efforts into components of a unified political process.\nGuided by its mandate, the United Nations Special\nMission should try to find common ground with a view\nto ensuring a compromise approach that would lead to\nnational rapprochement among Afghans. We are fully\nconfident that Ambassador Mestiri will keep this in mind\nas the core of his mandate. If the Afghans, in keeping\nwith their traditional way of solving problems, come\ntogether in a national gathering and adopt resolutions\naimed at preserving the national sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity and at realizing the right of the people to decide\ntheir own political future without foreign interference and\ninvolvement, the United Nations will be left as a neutral\nparty with a complementary role.\nAs an additional measure, the United Nations Special\nMission could support an initiative that would avoid any\nloopholes and would ensure fairness and impartiality in\nthe proceedings. Otherwise, attempts to create a parallel\ninitiative will only produce further complication and\naggravation of the situation and, consequently,\n27\n\n\ndisappointment for our nation in the peacemaking efforts of\nthe United Nations.\nI should like to make it clear that at no stage in its\nexistence has Afghanistan constituted a source of threat to\nits neighbours. Nor has it allowed any third country to use\nit for the advancement of that country\u2019s political differences\nwith Afghanistan\u2019s neighbours. We shall continue to act in\nthis manner. Today, we yearn for peace more than for\nanything else, for only in an atmosphere of peace can we\nstrive for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of our\nwar-shattered country and heal the wounds and relieve the\npain and suffering resulting from 14 years of war. We\nsincerely and seriously expect our neighbours to be\nsupportive of our national efforts to these ends.\nIn principle, the legitimate interests of States should be\nrecognized and respected by their neighbours. However, if\nthe expectation of a State, under the pretext of preserving\nits interests, violates the supreme interest of another State -\nnamely, its national sovereignty and territorial integrity and\nthe principle that the will of a nation should govern its\ndestiny - this expectation becomes illegitimate.\nNot too long ago the world witnessed the former\nSoviet Union, as it pursued its activities in Afghanistan,\ncrossing the boundary of legitimate interest. As a result,\nthe Afghan nation, without regard for the disparity between\nthe military means of the two sides, stood against one of\nthe world\u2019s mightiest military machines. After 10 years of\nimposed war and direct confrontation with the Red Army,\nthe Afghan nation, with the help of the Almighty and the\nsacrifice of more than 1.5 million martyrs, proved once\nagain that it would never allow foreign interference or\naccept dictates - in particular, that it would not permit\noutsiders to impose their will on Afghans.\nThere is no longer a foreign army of occupation in\nAfghanistan, but the legacy of such a presence is still\nkilling our people. Land-mines constitute the most toxic\npollution facing mankind. Referred to as the hidden killers,\nthese do not discriminate between adults and children. If\nthere are 100 million of these deadly devices in 60 war-\nstricken countries throughout the world, at least one fifth of\nthem are in Afghanistan. This cruel threat is a dreadful\nimpediment to the return of the refugees.\nWe need a great deal of help from the international\ncommunity if we are to promote and finance land-mine\nawareness and clearance programmes. We appreciate\nhighly President Clinton\u2019s very important proposal, voiced\nhere, concerning the need for international action to clear\nmines in the war-stricken countries of the world.\nNo international effort in the war against poverty\nand in support of sustained growth and development will\nbe effective if account if not taken of the continuing\ndeterioration in the socio-economic situation of the least\ndeveloped countries, identified as such by the United\nNations system. Among these countries are those that\nexperience frequent natural disasters and those ravaged by\nwar.\nSpecific action to deal with the particular needs and\nproblems of land-locked developing countries - I refer in\nparticular to assistance for the land-locked States of\ncentral Asia - is an important matter that requires\ndiscussion during this session of the General Assembly.\nAfghanistan, which is itself land-locked, is the country of\ntransit for many central Asian States. Roads and\nhighways in Afghanistan are damaged as a result of the\nlong years of foreign armed aggression. For this reason\nwe shall propose that the United Nations system assist our\nregion by carrying out a corridor study - a study of the\ntransit roads in Afghanistan, which is situated in the heart\nof Asia.\nTransit and transport agreements between the land-\nlocked States members of the Economic Cooperation\nOrganization, including Afghanistan, and Iran and\nPakistan need to be concluded or updated to take account\nof the new circumstances and the legal and technical\nadvice of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan stands firm in\nsupport of human rights throughout the world but\nparticularly in Afghanistan. Much to our regret, armed\nconflict between various groups has resulted in violations\nof human rights - especially of the right to life, which is\nhumanity\u2019s most fundamental right. To prevent such\noccurrences and to ensure security, the State is\ndetermined to collect the arms currently in the possession\nof certain groups. There has already been noticeable\nprogress in this area. Most of the armed groups realize\nthe need to end conflicts and to relinquish heavy\narmaments. The completion of this task can be ensured\nthrough strengthening of the national armed forces and\nthe national police force. Significant steps will be taken\ntowards this goal.\nAs for civil, political, economic and cultural rights,\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan, in observance of Islamic\n28\n\n\nteaching and international responsibilities, acknowledges its\nduty to eliminate all discrimination and intolerance, whether\nreligious, linguistic or based on gender. Afghanistan\nrecognizes its Islamic responsibility to ensure the family,\nlegal, cultural, social, political and economic rights of\nwomen. Apart from obligations of principle and morality,\na country that lost 15 per cent of its population during the\nwar cannot be completely successful in the enormous task\nof reconstruction without the active participation of its\nfemale population. Therefore, it is imperative that proper\nmeasures be taken to secure extensive participation by\nAfghan women in the process of rebuilding the nation\u2019s\neconomy, culture and society.\nIn the midst of these conflicts, it is the children who\nsuffer most. In Afghanistan alone there are almost 1\nmillion war orphans. The situation of this precious and\nmost vulnerable category of the population deserves\nparticular attention. To this end, the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan will submit a proposal for consideration by the\nAssembly at its current session to establish an international\nfund within the framework of the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund (UNICEF) to assist the rehabilitation of orphans of\narmed conflicts. It would be worth considering a\ndeclaration of 1996 as the international year of orphans.\nWe welcome the appointment of Gra\u00e7a Machel by the\nSecretary-General as an expert to carry out the mandate of\nthe General Assembly to conduct a study of the\nconsequences of armed conflicts on children.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan, inspired by Islamic\ninstructions, has no hesitation in taking a firm stand against\nterrorism in any shape or form. As we battle violence in\nour own land, we continue to add our voice to that of the\ninternational community in condemning terrorism the world\nover.\nAt its last session the General Assembly discussed in\nsome detail the plight of disabled people. However, the\npractical achievements do not seem to be adequate. From\nthis rostrum I remind the world community again of the\nstate of the nearly 2 million disabled persons in\nAfghanistan, victims of a war of aggression. We will\nsubmit proposals for securing international assistance for\nthe world\u2019s disabled population in order to alleviate their\nsocial, economic and psychological problems.\nOne issue worth mentioning, with both regional and\ninternational implications, is that of narcotic drugs. The\nillicit cultivation, production, stocking, smuggling and\ntrafficking of narcotic drugs are undeniably critical\nproblems facing humanity today. Regrettably, one of the\nlegacies of the long war in Afghanistan is the\ntransformation of some parts of our country into staging\nareas for illicit drug activities. This phenomenon, which\nis partly the result of the unavailability of alternative\nproductive economic activities, is a source of great\nconcern to us. Afghanistan, despite its scarce resources,\nhas taken serious measures in the struggle against illicit\ndrugs. We will spare no effort to combat these illegal\nactivities. However, we must not overlook the reality that\nAfghanistan, with its extremely limited means and\nmassive economic and financial needs, is not in a position\neffectively to accomplish this task alone. Afghanistan\nneeds urgent support from the international community to\nintensify the struggle against drug cultivation and\ntrafficking.\nThe ongoing internal conflict in Tajikistan, a\nfraternal neighbour of Afghanistan, is a matter of\ncontinued concern to us. We hope that the brotherly\nTajik people, who are opening a new chapter in their\nhistory after the collapse of the former Soviet Union and\ntheir emergence as a new and independent nation, will\nsoon succeed in overcoming their difficulties.\nOne dimension of this internal conflict is the\nperiodic disturbances occurring on the border between\nAfghanistan and Tajikistan. As a result of the conflict\ninside Tajikistan, more than 100,000 Tajik refugees have\ntaken refuge inside Afghanistan. The Islamic State of\nAfghanistan, on the basis of deep feelings of Islamic\nbrotherhood, humanitarian considerations and traditional\nAfghan hospitality, provided shelter to those refugees.\nThe influx of the Tajik refugees to Afghanistan is\ndue to the political circumstances in their own country.\nTherefore, only a political solution to the problems with\nwhich they are faced, with the Government of Tajikistan,\nwill guarantee their voluntary repatriation to their\nhomeland.\nThe dispatch of armed forces of the Russian\nFederation to Tajikistan, especially on the border between\nAfghanistan and Tajikistan, would in our view further\naggravate the problem rather than contribute to its\nsolution.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan has committed\nitself to supporting the peaceful initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral and his Special Envoy to Tajikistan, Ambassador\nPiriz-Ballon. As far as possible we have encouraged the\n29\n\n\nTajik refugee leaders, in a spirit of conciliation, to help\nUnited Nations efforts to succeed by agreeing to a\nnegotiated settlement. A chief factor in resolving the\nproblem will be the Tajik Government\u2019s heeding the just\nand legitimate demands of the Tajik opposition leaders.\nAfghanistan, in pursuit of its previous commitments,\nis desirous that its border with Tajikistan should be a\nborder of peace, understanding and friendship. Once again\nwe would like to declare that periodic clashes on the border\nbetween Afghanistan and Tajikistan are a manifestation of\nthe internal conflict in Tajikistan, and not a single member\nof the Afghan armed forces is, or will be, involved in any\nborder clashes.\nAs everyone knows, in Bosnia and Herzegovina the\nodious and barbaric \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" practised by the\nSerbs of Bosnia re-emerged a few weeks ago in Banja\nLuka, Bijeljina and other areas. The Security Council has\njust demanded - in resolution 941 (1994) of 23 September -\nthat the Bosnian Serb authorities immediately cease their\ncampaign of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". This demand of the\nSecurity Council is bound to be disregarded and denied by\nthe Bosnian Serb criminals. It is therefore imperative that\nthe Security Council should decide to mandate a United\nNations presence and coercive measures for the protection\nof the Bosnian communities threatened by further \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\". Otherwise, the United Nations and the five-\nPower Contact Group will lose all credibility.\nAnother dangerous area calls for the immediate\nattention of the Organization if we want to save the whole\nregion from catastrophe. The grave situation in Kosovo,\naggravated by the daily massive repression committed by\nthe Serbian authorities against 2 million ethnic Albanians,\nand referred to as a time-bomb, remains explosive. We\nalso remind the Assembly of human rights violations in\nSandjak.\nIt is our view that a special United Nations mission\nshould assess war damage resulting from the acts of armed\naggression committed by the Bosnian Serbs. The\naggressors must know that they will have to pay war\nreparations to those who are their victims. This will remind\naggressors always to think twice before firing and\ndestroying.\nOn the basis of its common historical ties with the\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir, especially common\nreligious ties with its Muslim population, the Islamic State\nof Afghanistan is deeply concerned at the exacerbation of\nthe situation in that territory. The sufferings of the Muslim\npeople of Kashmir add to our grief. We continue to\nbelieve that the question of Kashmir, which has always\nbeen one of the prime concerns of the Muslim Umma,\ncan find a lasting solution through peaceful means in an\natmosphere of trust, understanding and good-\nneighbourliness between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan\nand the Republic of India, a solution on the basis of the\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations and\ninternationally accepted principles on the settlement of\ndisputes.\nDuring these crucial moments of the history of the\nPalestinian people, we reiterate the responsibility of the\ninternational community to support the inalienable\nnational rights of the Palestinians, including their right to\nreturn to their homeland, and the right to\nself-determination, encompassing the right to their own\nindependent State on their national soil, with Al-Quds\nal-Sharif as its capital. The peace process has to be\naimed at the full implementation of Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) guaranteeing the\nfull withdrawal of occupying forces from all the occupied\nPalestinian territories.\nThe Afghan nation, like other Islamic nations,\nconsiders the occupation of the site of one of the most\nsacred shrines of Islam, in Al-Quds, by authorities lacking\nawareness of its sacred Islamic character, as contempt for\nthe most basic spiritual rights of the Islamic community\nall over the world.\nIn conclusion, I wish to draw the attention of this\nworld gathering to the fact that, as a result of heavy\nrocket attacks on Kabul by the opposition, as well as their\nblocking of the roads to Kabul, the capital has been\nwithout running water, electricity or heating for most of\nthe time since last January. Also, a shortage of food\nsupplies seems to be threatening the city\u2019s most\nvulnerable inhabitants who are suffering. It has been\npredicted that the coming winter will be a harsh one.\nAs the International Committee of the Red Cross\n(ICRC) fears, a large-scale human disaster may be\nimpossible to avert. We request the donor community to\nrespond positively and urgently to the United Nations\nappeal for winter emergency assistance to the city of\nKabul.\n"

        "file_text": "President Snegur (spoke in Moldovan; English text\nfurnished by the delegation): Allow me at the outset, Sir,\nto extend to you my cordial and sincere congratulations on\nthe occasion of your election as President of the forty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that your\ncompetence and active cooperation with Member States will\npave the way for a successful and fruitful session.\nAt the same time, I should like to express my deep\ngratitude to His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally for the\noutstanding work accomplished in his capacity as President\nof the previous session.\nI should also like to express sentiments of our\nutmost consideration to His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, whose activities in redefining the role of\nthis prestigious Organization in this changing world enjoy\nthe appreciation and support of the Republic of Moldova.\nI am honoured to represent the Republic of Moldova\nfor the second time at this rostrum. Nearly three years\nago, in March 1992, I expressed gratitude to Member\nStates for their considerable support extended to my\ncountry by recognizing it at the international level as an\nindependent State and by accepting it into the large\nfamily of the United Nations.\nLooking back over these years, I should like to note\nthat the Republic of Moldova gained its independence in\na complex political context in which the aspirations for\nfreedom and democracy of nations led to the collapse of\ntotalitarian regimes and the emergence of new States.\nUnfortunately, those positive changes were followed\nby negative tendencies, such as threats to subregional and\nregional security. Moreover, we are witnessing the\nreappearance and aggravation of some older problems\nconnected to national minorities, territorial disputes, the\npresence of foreign military troops on the territory of new\nindependent States, the intensification of some separatist\ntendencies, often inspired and directed from abroad, and\nso on.\nUnder these circumstances, the state of affairs is\nmore complex than we could imagine. The euphoria that\n\n\nfollowed the events in Eastern Europe and on the territory\nof the former Soviet Union generated in some the opinion\nthat the two main objectives - democratization of society\nand building a market-oriented economy, both compulsory\nfor the institutional reintegration of new States into the\ndemocratic world - would not face serious obstacles. Now,\nhowever, we find that there is a desynchronization and even\na time disparity between those two objectives. I would say\nthat that disparity is even more evident in the new\nindependent States that emerged as a result of the collapse\nof the former Soviet Union. In this sense, the Republic of\nMoldova is no exception.\nThe situation requires a larger conceptual and practical\neffort to correct such desynchronizations. It is obvious that\nthe United Nations cannot remain indifferent to the\ndifficulties that confront the countries in transition. In this\nconnection, we consider that the Secretary-General\u2019s\nintention to draw up an agenda for development is\nparticularly opportune, and we welcome it. In our opinion\nthe assistance granted by the United Nations to young\nStates should be provided on the basis of the concrete\nconditions prevailing in every specific country and the\nprogrammes being elaborated in each.\nLocated at the intersection of the geopolitical interests\nof some great Powers, Moldova was incorporated into a\nState and political entity in which democratic values were\nmeaningless. The experience of Moldova is different from\nthat of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, where\nthe communist \\\"freezer\\\" functioned for only four decades\nand something was preserved from the previous democratic\ndevelopment. That is why we had to begin the process of\ndemocratization and market transition almost from the very\nbeginning. The deepening of the economic crisis can be\nexplained to a large extent by the fact that we do not have\nat our disposal sufficient financial and energy resources or\nthe raw materials necessary to support these reforms.\nIn addition, our country\u2019s potential was affected this\nyear by a natural disaster of which the international\ncommunity has already been informed. We suffered human\nlosses and considerable material damage, and we had to\nmobilize every effort and all resources to subdue the\nelements and overcome their consequences. Our voice was\nheard by the international community. I should like to\nexpress my sincere gratitude to the international\norganizations and countries that granted humanitarian\nassistance to the Republic of Moldova and my sincere\ngratitude to the Members of the United Nations for their\nunderstanding and sympathy, which they manifested by\nadopting the resolution (48/266) entitled \\\"Emergency\nassistance to the Republic of Moldova\\\" during the forty-\neighth session of the General Assembly.\nOver the three years that have elapsed since the\nproclamation of the independence of the Republic of\nMoldova, on 27 August 1991, our decision to develop\ndemocracy and a State of law with a market economy has\nremained firm, in spite of transitional difficulties. This\nfirm decision is being realized through our efforts to\ncreate the necessary legislative premises for promoting\nreforms, including privatization, for transforming the\neconomy to one based on market relations and for\nensuring respect for fundamental human rights and\nfreedoms.\nThe recent parliamentary elections held on a multi-\nparty basis were free and fair, and this was confirmed by\ninternational observers. Another significant event was the\nadoption of the Constitution, which paves the way for the\nreal independence and democracy chosen by the people of\nthe Republic of Moldova.\nThe Republic of Moldova has ratified a series of\nimportant international Conventions on human rights. We\nhave consequently undertaken new commitments to\nchange the internal juridical framework in accordance\nwith international standards. Measures have been taken\nto guarantee the rights of the national minorities, some of\nwhich were on the edge of losing their identity during the\nSoviet regime. Many provisions of Moldovan legislation\nare aimed at protecting the right to retain, develop and\nutilize the language spoken on the territory of the country.\nUnder the new Constitution, special forms of autonomy\nmay be granted to some human settlements in the east\nand south of the Republic of Moldova in accordance with\nspecial juridical statutes adopted under the constitutional\nlaws. For example, a draft for such a statute for the\nsouthern region is being examined in the Parliament.\nWe consider that the good intentions of the\nGovernment of the Republic of Moldova and its concrete\nand positive actions represent essential premises for the\nelimination of sources of tension. It is our strong belief\nthat they can be eliminated, and with less controversy, not\nthrough the use of force but in a peaceful way through\nnegotiation and dialogue; as an old saying teaches us: \\\"It\nis better to have a year of negotiations than a day of\nwar\\\". This is true, since any armed conflict provokes\nhuman and material losses.\nThe Republic of Moldova is and will remain fully\ncommitted to constructive negotiations, on the condition,\n2\n\n\nof course, that all the parties involved demonstrate political\nwill and common sense.\nAt the same time we cannot ignore the fact that in\nspite of reasonable compromises made by Chisinau,\ntendencies of separatism still exist in eastern regions, and\nhuman rights continue to be flagrantly violated. For\nexample, despite the fact that the Moldovan authorities and\nseveral international organizations, including the United\nNations, have expressed their deep concern about the\nsituation of the \\\"Ilascu Group\\\", as of today the members of\nthe Group are still illegally detained. Another example is\nthis: the Moldovans from the left bank of the Dniester\nriver are prohibited from using the Latin alphabet in their\nschooling. The separatist leaders from Tiraspol continue to\nobstruct the signing of the already-endorsed agreement on\nthe legal status and the modalities and stages of the\ncomplete withdrawal of the 14th Army.\nI want to emphasize once again that a complete,\norderly and unconditional withdrawal of foreign military\ntroops from the territory of the Republic of Moldova is the\nwill of our people. This will is clearly reflected in our\nConstitution, which forbids the deployment of foreign\ntroops on the territory of the Republic of Moldova. In this\ncontext, it should be mentioned that the authorities of the\nRussian Federation show a correct understanding of our\nposition. I would like to underline the important role of the\ninternational community, the international organizations,\nincluding the United Nations, and especially the Conference\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in\nfacilitating the bilateral negotiations.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate\nEstonia and Latvia on the withdrawal of foreign military\ntroops from their territory and, at the same time, to express\nour hope that the international community will support the\nsame kind of appropriate and orderly withdrawal of foreign\ntroops in the case of the Republic of Moldova.\nI should like to touch upon the subject of separatism\nand discuss it in a larger perspective. It is well known that\nmany regions of the world are currently affected by\nseparatist tendencies. Respecting the right of nations to\nself-determination - a fundamental right outlined in\ninternational documents - we cannot ignore the fact that this\nright is often used as a tool serving the interests of certain\npolitical groups and, in that context, this right has nothing\nto do with the legitimate aspirations of people to liberty and\nnational sovereignty.\nToday, in my opinion, at the end of the millennium\nthe separatist phenomenon is an extremely negative one,\nand to ignore it can lead to tragic consequences for many\ncountries - indeed, for the entire world. In such\ncircumstances, can we afford to allow dozens of\nartificially induced States to emerge as a result of the\npressure of certain interested political groups? Will this\nfurther the strengthening of international stability and\nsecurity? We do not believe so. Given that the majority\nof States have a multi-ethnic configuration, and could be\naffected by such separatist tendencies, we cannot but\nemphasize the dangers this might entail. That is why we\nbelieve that this kind of separatism - today\u2019s deadly world\nvirus - must be condemned by the international\ncommunity. We think that this issue should be more\nclosely examined, and we hope that the United Nations\nwill give due attention to this matter.\nThe Republic of Moldova has joined the United\nNations as a young European country. Our European\naspirations are determined by our geopolitical and cultural\naffiliations to the European democratic space, and we are\nlinked to it by our Latin heritage also. For us, to be\nisolated from the European space and its values means to\nfacilitate the re-emergence of some influences from which\nwe suffered painfully in the recent past. That is why our\nvital and fundamental goal is the integration of our\ncountry into Europe. In this context, we firmly look\nforward to increasing cooperation and linkage with the\nCouncil of Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), the Western European Union (WEU), and the\nCSCE, including expanding our relations with the\nEuropean Union, which represents the main guarantee of\ndemocratic practices and values.\nThe implementation of our options depends crucially\non the willingness of the economic and political-strategic\nEuro-Atlantic structures to support Moldova actively.\nI think that establishing economic relations with the\nindependent States of the former Soviet Union and joining\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States - where we\nparticipate only in the economic structures and are not\ninvolved in collective security or political-military\ncooperation - will not become an obstacle to our gradual\nintegration into the Euro-Atlantic structures. We believe\nthat in these times nobody wants new dividing lines in\nEurope or in any other part of the world. On the\ncontrary, we need to eliminate those once generated by\nthe cold war. At the turn of the century, not only Europe\nbut the whole world finds itself in a complex process of\ntransformation. We want to establish new forms of\n3\n\n\ncollaboration that would respond to the aspirations and the\nneeds of all States.\nThe day is approaching when the international\ncommunity will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations. In all these years the\nUnited Nations has been - and it remains - the major\nuniversal centre for maintaining peace and international\nsecurity and for mobilizing the efforts of States, in\ncooperation with regional organizations, towards settling\nglobal issues. The Republic of Moldova has the honour to\ncontribute, together with other States, to the implementation\nof the noble ideals of the World Organization. I am\nespecially pleased to inform the Assembly that a committee\nfor coordinating the activities and manifestations dedicated\nto the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations has been created in the Republic of Moldova.\nIn calling to mind the achievements and successes of\nthe United Nations system, we cannot but mention the fact\nthat so far it has operated under the guidance of a Charter\nconceived 50 years ago. I think that the new international\nrealities might call for some essential modifications to adapt\nthe provisions of the Charter to these realities.\nThe Republic of Moldova supports the reforms\ninitiated by the United Nations aimed at improving the\nefficiency of the Organization and its major bodies.\nOur country shares the views expressed by the\ndelegations of many countries within the Open-ended\nWorking Group regarding the issue of fair representation on\nthe Security Council. The Council\u2019s composition, its\nfunctioning and methods of work should be modified\nwithout affecting the efficiency of its activities in its main\nfield, which is ensuring international peace and security.\nTaking into account the active role and contribution\nperformed in the United Nations by Germany and Japan\nand their possibilities of assuming specific responsibilities\nin keeping international peace and security, Moldova\nsupports the candidatures of these two countries as\npermanent members of the Security Council. Our position\non fair representation on the Security Council is that it is\nnecessary to take into account all regional groups\nrecognized in the United Nations. In this sense, the\nRepublic of Moldova supports the proposal of the\nNetherlands to grant an additional seat to each geographic\ngroup, including countries from Eastern Europe.\nConsultations and debates on such an important\nsubject should be supplemented with practical\norganizational and procedural measures, such as setting\nup some subsidiary bodies of the Security Council in\naccordance with Article 29 of the Charter, and increasing\nand expanding cooperation with the General Assembly\nand the regional organizations.\nAt the same time, we consider that the working\nmethods of the most representative body of the United\nNations - the General Assembly - could also be modified.\nWe are all interested in directing those activities as much\nas possible towards consolidating the principles of justice,\ndemocracy and development. The delegation of Moldova\nsupports the decisions adopted at the forty-seventh session\naimed at increasing the efficiency of the General\nAssembly and rationalizing the activities of its\nCommissions.\nThere is a direct link between peace and security on\nthe one hand and economic and social development on\nthe other. In this new era, when the United Nations is\nincreasing its efforts to maintain international peace and\nsecurity, we should not forget about the persistence of\ninequalities and of grave social and economic problems,\nwhich affect all countries, particularly those in transition\nand the developing ones. In this sense, reform of the\nOrganization should include economic and social\nmechanisms, especially the Economic and Social Council.\nThis reform, already initiated, should be more effective in\nimplementation and be more rational in the utilization of\navailable resources.\nIn this context, I should like to stress the importance\nof the two previous sessions of the Commission for\nSustainable Development, whose work we hope will\nmaintain and intensify the impulse generated by the Rio\nde Janeiro Conference on Environment and Development\nwith respect to the rapid implementation of the\ncommitments made in the framework of Agenda 21.\nTurning to another matter, I would like to note that\nthe Republic of Moldova is aware of the financial crisis\nof the Organization. We are not indifferent to this\nsituation, and I would like to assure the Assembly that\nmy country will do its best to fulfil its commitments.\nThe recommendations of the last session of the\nCommittee on Contributions concerning the\nre-examination and adjustment of the scale of assessments\nof Member States reflect more justly States\u2019 real capacity\nto pay. We hope that the General Assembly will take\nthese recommendations into consideration in the spirit of\njustice and solidarity which characterizes the United\nNations.\n4\n\n\nIn conclusion, I express the hope that the constructive\natmosphere that characterizes the United Nations will help\nus to identify the problems faced by the international\ncommunity and to find the necessary solutions.\nThe delegation of the Republic of Moldova expresses\nits readiness to cooperate most actively and efficiently with\nthe delegations of other States in order to achieve the high\ngoals of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I should like, on behalf of the delegation of\nthe Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, to extend to\nMr. Essy my warmest congratulations on his election to the\npresidency of our Assembly. I am convinced that his\nwealth of experience in international relations will be for us\nthe best guarantee for the success of our work. Through\nhim, the Assembly has also paid resounding tribute to his\ncountry, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and to one of its illustrious\ndeparted sons, the late President Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, a\ngreat statesman and acknowledged visionary whose\nwisdom and intelligence made a great contribution to the\nadvent of a world of peace and progress.\nI wish to join previous speakers in expressing\nprofound gratitude to his predecessor for the effectiveness\nwith which he presided over the General Assembly at its\nforty-eighth session.\nI also take this opportunity to convey to Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, our Secretary-General, our high esteem\nand fraternal gratitude for his tireless efforts to reduce\npockets of tension and strengthen international peace and\nsecurity. His devotion and talent reinforce the role of our\nOrganization.\nThese past five years, the world has seen great\nupheavals that have put an end to the cold war and\nideological blocs. Despite the emergence of certain\nconflicts, the world is on the threshold of a new, more\npromising era in which dialogue and joint action seem to\nbe prevailing over confrontation.\nWe are one year away from the fiftieth anniversary\nof the establishment of the United Nations, and in the\npresent circumstances we must think about defining the\nnew missions our Organization has to carry out, in\naddition to those bestowed on us by history. Even if the\ngoal of a peaceful world society has not yet been reached,\nit is acknowledged that our Organization has contributed\nbroadly to decolonization and the progressive\ndevelopment of international law. Of the positive results\nachieved by the United Nations, the definition and\npromotion of human rights is inarguably the most\nimportant. This world forum has made it possible for\ndeveloping States to make the international community\nmore aware of their difficulties and to express their\ndemands. Thanks to the United Nations, some global\nproblems, such as those of population and environment,\nhave become priority concerns for all nations, small or\nlarge, rich or poor.\nThe climate of d\u00e9tente and the easing of tensions in\ninternational relations undoubtedly made it possible to\nresolve the conflict that beset South Africa for so long.\nThe first non-racial, democratic elections held in South\nAfrica, resulting in the election of President Nelson\nMandela, are the best evidence of the positive\ndevelopment of law there. My country is particularly\n18\n\n\npleased to see the Republic of South Africa occupying its\nseat in our great family. All Africa places its hopes in\nSouth Africa, whose leaders have demonstrated wisdom and\ndetermination. We earnestly hope South Africa will be able\nto pass peacefully and harmoniously through its new stage\nof transition.\nOne of this year\u2019s felicitous events is clearly the\nconcretization of the peace process that started with the\nWashington agreements between the Palestinians and the\nIsraelis. Their mutual recognition has provided fresh\nimpetus, and it heralds an era of peace in that part of the\nworld, which has for so long been bloodied by war. I take\nthis opportunity to congratulate President Arafat and the\nPalestinian people on their tireless efforts to give Palestine\na sovereign, independent State within internationally\nrecognized boundaries.\nIf peace is to be established in the Middle East, there\nmust be a comprehensive settlement of the differences\nbetween the State of Israel and the Arab States of the\nregion. The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, an\nArabic-speaking and French-speaking African State, will\nspare no effort in sincerely encouraging all the parties\nconcerned to strive for peace. We therefore welcome the\nagreement reached between the Kingdom of Jordan and\nIsrael.\nMy country has always respected our Organization\u2019s\nprinciples, and therefore has always advocated dialogue and\nconcertation in the settlement of conflicts. In that spirit, it\nendorsed the General Assembly\u2019s recommendations on the\nquestion of the Comorian island of Mayotte. Need I recall\nthat in this regrettable dispute, which started 19 years ago,\n[between the Comoros and France], in 1975, the Comorian\nauthorities have always expressed a willingness to negotiate\nwith France on the legal and practical modalities for the\nreturn of the Comorian island of Mayotte to its natural\ncommunity. Unfortunately, France has always opposed\nconcertation on this issue. Quite the contrary: that great\ncountry, an unchallenged defender of human rights, is\nprolonging its administrative and military presence in\nMayotte. It has also undertaken in this part of our small\nterritory reforms and socio-economic development plans\nwhose clear aim is to separate for all time the four sister\nislands that geography, history, race, religion, language and\neconomy had joined together with ties that were both\nidentical and complementary. For Comorians, faith and\ndignity have made this problem a cardinal point of our\nsovereign existence.\nWhile we take note of the tangible results of the\nrebirth of democracy in Eastern Europe, the opening up\nof Africa to multiparty politics and the easing of tensions\nbetween Powers, we cannot be but concerned at the\nappearance of conflicts that are undermining world\nstability and equilibrium. The case of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is a constant and striking reminder that we\nstill have a long, long way to go on the road to lasting\npeace. My country calls on the Serb and Bosnian parties\nto comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions\nand to accept the plan for territorial division proposed by\nthe Contact Group. Nothing would be more tragic than\nallowing passion and pride to prevail over reason and take\nprecedence over the lives of thousands of women,\nchildren and old people, who are the daily victims of this\nincomprehensible conflict.\nWe are equally at a loss when we look at the\ngenocide that has ravaged Rwanda. We still wonder how\nall the macabre events that have torn Rwanda apart could\nhave taken place. Fortunately, peace has been restored\nand normalization seems to be gaining ground. I take this\nopportunity to express our deepest gratitude to France for\n\\\"Operation Turquoise,\\\" as well as to all the States that\nsupported that operation, for without it Rwanda would\nhave ceased to exist. We express our gratitude to the\nneighboring States for the very African hospitality they\nshowed in saving the lives of human beings in distress.\nI urgently appeal to the new Government of Rwanda to\nspare no effort to bring about national unity, without\nwhich the reconstruction of Rwanda cannot be assured.\nIn addition, we salute the courage and determination\nof the political authorities and the people of Burundi for\ntheir avoidance of another tragedy with incalculable\nconsequences.\nThe international community must assist Africa -\nparticularly the Organization of African Unity, which has\nnever remained indifferent to the various conflicts that\nhave embroiled certain Member States - to prevent\nconflicts and manage them better. It is imperative that\nwe finally wake up to Africa\u2019s economic realities and\nunderstand that its instability and destitution are a\nstanding threat to society throughout the world.\nWhile we recognize that the world political situation\nhas eased considerably, we must also take note that the\ninternational economic situation shows us no glimmer of\nhope. Political stability will be fragile if there is not a\nclear improvement in the economic sphere and, in\nparticular, if growth is limited to the wealthy countries.\n19\n\n\nThe developing countries are bearing the full brunt of the\nill effects of the crisis, in the form of deteriorating terms of\ntrade, rising protectionism, decreasing net flows of external\nresources and, on top of all that, the debt burden, which\nnullifies the efforts of the developing countries.\nThe widening gap between wealthy and poor countries\nreduces the effects of the economic recovery in the\nindustrialized countries in recent years has seemed to be\nclearly appearing on the horizon. In this context, it is our\ncollective responsibility to combat poverty, famine and\ndestitution in the developing countries.\nGiven the distress of the developing countries and an\ninternational economic system in crisis, we must devise a\nnew and constructive vision, one capable of restructuring\nthe world economy while reflecting the interests of both\nparties within the framework of sincere cooperation.\nWe place our hopes in a renewed United Nations that\nwill take concrete action to establish more balanced\ninternational economic relations.\nIn the opinion of my country, the Federal Islamic\nRepublic of the Comoros, cooperation between North and\nSouth is vital to the balance of the world economy. The\nFederal Islamic Republic of the Comoros also believes that\ncooperation between the countries of the South is\nimperative; indeed, we have made cooperation with the\ndeveloping countries an essential element in our relations.\nFor us, the development of South-South cooperation\nis a bounden duty in order to insure the continuation and\nstrengthening of development assistance. We have chosen\na policy of regional solidary and integration as an effective\ntool for economic and social progress. Our commitment to\nthe Indian Ocean Commission, and our membership in the\nAfrican Economic Community, as well as our participation\nin the preferential trade area, ZEP, demonstrate the\nimportance the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros\nattaches to the General Assembly\u2019s recommendations on the\nneed for the developing countries to cooperate on a regional\nlevel in order to better confront their own problems. It is\nin this spirit that our regional institutions have adopted a\nstrategy aimed, first and foremost, at strengthening trade\nand industrial cooperation, and at improving transportation,\ntelecommunications and so forth.\nSince the democratic election of His Excellency Mr.\nS\u00e1\u00edd Mohamed Djohar to the Supreme Magistrature, the\nFederal Islamic Republic of the Comoros has committed\nitself to working for a democratic, dynamic and open\nsociety and to combating corruption, in order to\ndefinitively bring about economic and financial recovery.\nIn this effort, the Comorian people adopted a new\nconstitution and, last December, democratically elected a\nnew Parliament composed of all the country\u2019s main\npolitical parties.\nThe Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros\nunderstands that international cooperation alone cannot\neradicate the evils of underdevelopment. Thus it has\nsigned a programme of structural adjustment with the\ninternational financial institutions, with the aim of\nachieving economic recovery and of improving public\nfinance. It is a trial that the Comorian people is enduring\nwith courage and sacrifice. But the recent devaluation of\nthe Comorian franc has exacerbated the crisis by seriously\nundermining the Comorians\u2019 purchasing power. In such\na difficult socio-economic context, how can one convince\nstarving people and demoralized State workers that\ndemocracy brings hope? The measures taken as a result\nof the structural adjustment programmes do not facilitate\nthe role the public authorities of a country must play in\nthe context of social renewal.\nWhile it is true that the easing of international\npolitical tension and of certain regional conflicts has\nreinforced hopes for peace, the gravity of the international\neconomic situation is also creating doubt.\nThe victims of the world crisis are still the same:\nmen, women and children of the African, Asian, Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean regions.\nIndeed, the same people are always the ones who are\nconfronted with famine, poverty, natural catastrophes and\ndesertification. Other modern scourges such as\nfundamentalism, terrorism, epidemics and drug-trafficking\nhave been added to an already hostile socio-economic\nenvironment. The harsh reality of the poor countries is\naccentuated by their exclusion from the decision-making\nprocess concerning the international economic situation.\nAs the twentieth century draws to a close, the long-\ncherished hopes of the third-world peoples are giving way\nto disappointment.\nThe special session of the General Assembly on\neconomic cooperation, the Paris Conference on the least\ndeveloped countries, the five years of the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\nand many other programmes and projects that have been\ndrawn up and carried out over the last 20 years have not\nattained the goals set for them by the General Assembly\n20\n\n\nin the area of development. Specialists in development\nassistance and economic cooperation are unanimous in\nfinding that the current trend is towards stagnation and even\nregression.\nOur General Assembly must now find a solution to the\nproblem created by the failure of international economic\nrelations.\nWe must insist more strongly on our sense of\nsolidarity and shared responsibility.\nMy country has always advocated strengthening the\nrole of the United Nations in all areas of international\nrelations. But it also believes that the structures of the\nUnited Nations system must correspond to the new world\nscene. We are among those who believe that the victors of\nthe Second World War do not have a monopoly on the\nmaintenance of peace and on the socio-economic\ndevelopment of nations.\nThe General Assembly must be the central body where\nthe relevant decisions of our Organization are taken.\nIt is difficult to understand why there is no connection\nbetween the political determination expressed here by\nStates, the essential components of the protagonists of\ninternational life, and the international financial institutions.\nOn behalf of His Excellency Mr. S\u00e1\u00edd Mohamed\nDjohar, President of the Federal Islamic Republic of the\nComoros, and on behalf of the Government and the people\nof the Comoros, I should like from this rostrum to make a\nsolemn appeal to the international community to provide\neffective support to the Comorian people in its efforts at\nsocio-economic recovery and in its irreversible commitment\nto democracy.\nI should like to request that the Security Council\nreconsider the sanctions adopted against Libya, because, as\na result of sanctions condemning inadmissible acts, an\nentire people is being penalized. It is in this spirit that the\nrelevant resolutions adopted by the League of Arab States,\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the\nOrganization of African Unity should be taken into\nconsideration, so that this fraternal country may enjoy its\nsovereignty.\nWe welcome the imminent return of President Aristide\nto Haiti. May the peace-keeping operation there bring\nstability and security so that Haitians, in their renewed\nunity, can work together to rebuild a free and prosperous\nnation.\nWe also extend these wishes to our brothers in\nLiberia, Somalia and Angola, so that, as in Mozambique,\nthey may resume dialogue and lay down their weapons.\nWe also wish to encourage the Algerian authorities\nin their efforts at national reconciliation in the greater\ninterest of the Algerian nation.\nAccording to several sources, it seems that there has\nbeen a significant movement of Iraqi troops towards the\nKuwaiti border. We venture to hope that these\nmanoeuvers are intended for a purpose other than\naggression against Kuwait. Indeed, our Organization will\nnever accept a repetition of Iraq\u2019s aggression of 1990.\nIt is difficult for us to believe that Iraq has not\nlearned the lessons of that famous, much-covered Gulf\nwar, from which the Iraqi people, the ultimate victims,\nare still healing their wounds.\nThe aggression against a sovereign State and the\nattack on its territorial integrity are a clear violation of\ninternational law. It is an act that goes against the\nfundamental principles of the Charter of this\nOrganization.\nThat is why, on behalf of the Government and\npeople of the Comoros and in the name of the sacred\nprinciples of Islam, I appeal to the Government and\npeople of Iraq to halt any attempt to invade Kuwait. It is\nup to the Security Council to use all peaceful means to\nspare us a second Persian Gulf war. If it does not,\nmankind will not be able to understand why each time\npeace seems to be established another war looms.\nMay I conclude by repeating my delegation\u2019s\nfraternal congratulations to the President of the General\nAssembly on his election. We are at his complete\ndisposal to assist him in any way in his discharge of that\nlofty, noble mission.\n"

        "file_text": "I am\nhonoured to address this forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. First, I wish to congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on\nhis election to the presidency, and to say that his\nexperience makes him an excellent choice to ably lead\nthis body to meet the challenges ahead. I also take this\nopportunity, on behalf of my Government, to congratulate\nthe former President, His Excellency Mr. Samuel\nInsanally, and express our appreciation for his\ncontributions. The same appreciation is extended to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for his strong and\neffective leadership, so instrumental in the success of the\nwork accomplished by this Organization.\nWe note with great sympathy the terrible volcanic\neruption in Papua New Guinea. We express the hope that\nthis Organization and its Members will take all possible\nmeasures to assist in alleviating the suffering and\ndestruction caused by this disaster. We also express our\nsympathy to the people and the Government of the\nRepublic of Estonia for the recent accident and loss of\nlife in that country.\nWe join the other members of this Assembly in\nwarmly welcoming the new South Africa here. Their\nstruggle was long, arduous and painful. The people and\nGovernment of Micronesia share the joy of the\nGovernment and people of South Africa at having\nachieved their objective.\nMy Government welcomes the historic steps taken\ntoward peace in the Middle East and expresses its support\nfor the ongoing bilateral negotiations between the parties\nin that region. In the light of these positive developments\nin the peace process, the General Assembly should reflect\nthis new reality in the course of this forty-ninth session\nand provide an environment conducive to further dialogue\nbetween parties.\nWe gather at a time in our history when new\ngrounds of cooperation are being woven into greater\ndimensions of solidarity. This is fortunate because we\nalso face urgent challenges to the future of our planet.\nFrom the point of view of a small developing State, we\ncome to this Assembly with immediate concerns on such\nissues as climate change, sustainable development, nuclear\nwaste and natural disasters.\nLinked with all these concerns is the issue of human\nrights. The road from Vienna, where the world\ncommunity met only a few hundred miles from where\n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" was taking place in Bosnia and spoke\nof improvements in the field of human rights, has been\nmarked with new signposts leading us in the right\ndirection, namely, the establishment of the post of United\n27\n\n\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the\nelection of Ambassador Jose Ayala Lasso to that post.\nHowever, the scenery along the way is not that much\ndifferent from what it was for many years before this.\nToday, the atrocities and violations of human rights that are\ncontinuing in Bosnia seem to be even overshadowed by\nnewer outbreaks of human rights violations in such areas as\nRwanda, Haiti and other parts of our world. This\nAssembly must continue to devote its attention and\nresources to human rights.\nSeveral weeks ago at Brisbane, Australia, the Heads of\nGovernment of our 15 Pacific States, including the\nFederated States of Micronesia, held the annual meeting of\nthe South Pacific Forum. As is their practice each year, the\nleaders discussed matters of common concern within our\nregion and expressed consensus views in a communiqu\u00e9\nthat has already been presented and included in the records\nof this Assembly. The Federated States of Micronesia\nsubscribes to the views expressed in that communiqu\u00e9, and\nwill be guided by it in many of our actions here in the\ncoming months.\nThe South Pacific Forum also decided, at its recent\nmeeting in Brisbane, to seek observer status at the United\nNations during this forty-ninth session. In attaining\nobserver status with the United Nations, the South Pacific\nForum will address the increasing importance placed on the\nrole of regional organizations and the contributions they can\nmake towards the objectives of the United Nations. We\nbelieve that the Forum, as an observer, can increase the\neffectiveness of our region\u2019s work on such critical issues as\nclimate change, conservation of biological diversity and\neffective implementation of the results of the Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States.\nOne long-standing major concern of our Government,\nwhich is shared by Forum members, is the testing of\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction\nwithin our region. We are relieved by the continued\nmoratorium on nuclear testing by France and the United\nStates, but we remain deeply concerned at the possible\nconsequences that may flow from China\u2019s insistence on\nproceeding with its programme. We will not breathe easy\nuntil a moratorium on all testing is made permanent, and to\nthat end we hope that rapid progress will be made towards\nconcluding a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.\nDespite our outspoken concerns in numerous\ninternational venues during recent years, the Pacific\nregion\u2019s vastness and seeming emptiness still makes it an\nattractive location for environmentally unfriendly\nactivities. Too often, when we have attempted as island\ncountries to halt movements through our waters of toxic,\nradioactive and hazardous materials, our voices have not\nbeen heard. As if the dangers of such transport were not\nbad enough, today we confront an even more repugnant\nprospect, that of our region becoming a permanent\ndumping ground for the world\u2019s nuclear waste. I wish to\nemphasize here that the Federated States of Micronesia is\nand will remain diametrically opposed to the use of our\nregion by countries which are unwilling to store their\nwaste within their own borders. As part of our dedication\nto finding more effective means to prevent these outrages,\nthe Federated States of Micronesia has the honour of\nchairing the ongoing negotiations within the Forum group\ntowards a regional treaty banning transboundary\nmovement of all hazardous wastes.\nThrough these and other appropriate actions, we are\ndetermined to see that the Pacific region is treated by the\nrest of the world community with the same degree of\nconcern for the long-term health and welfare of our\npeople and their environment.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s new report on\nan Agenda for Development. My Government fully\nsupports the call for a re-evaluation of the role of the\nUnited Nations in development. As the United Nations\napproaches its fiftieth anniversary, its global agenda must\nbe redefined to be more comprehensive and more\nfocused. The present lack of coordination between the\nBretton Woods institutions and the United Nations must\nbe corrected to synchronize the setting of global policy on\ndevelopment.\nThe end of the cold war has presented the United\nNations with a long-overdue opportunity to turn its\nattention to development. Yet the cost associated with\nexpanded peace-keeping operations around the world is\ndiverting scarce resources at a time when, for many\nStates, the role of the United Nations in development is\nbecomingly increasingly prominent. This is a trend that\nthe United Nations must examine very carefully in order\nto find the proper balance among all its responsibilities\nunder the Charter.\nThe recently concluded International Conference on\nPopulation and Development in Cairo is testimony to the\nglobal problems associated with our rapid population\ngrowth. The United Nations and the international\ncommunity face a pressing urgency to redirect resources\nto address population growth and sustainable resource use.\n28\n\n\nThe world\u2019s population is growing faster than ever before\nwith an estimated number of 95 million people being added\neach year. This unprecedented population growth rate will\nhave a profound effect on our environment. The action\nplan for population and sustainable development has clear\nimplications for climate change. I wish to draw the\ndistinction that, although the rate of population growth in\nthe industrialized world is slower, these countries still add\na disproportionate cost to the environment because residents\nin industrialized countries add about four times as much\ncarbon to the atmosphere each year as do their counterparts\nin the developing countries. Micronesia strongly supports\nthe Programme of Action on Population Control and\nDevelopment endorsed at Cairo and is looking forward to\nmeeting the goals and objectives contained therein.\nAs an island State, my Government welcomes the\nsignificant breakthrough and the universal acceptance of the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of Sea and its\nimminent entry into force on 16 November 1994. This is\nthe culmination of long and arduous negotiations among\ncountries for more than a decade in shaping what I consider\nto be a near-perfect management and conservation regime\nfor the high seas and the deep seabed which is the common\nheritage of mankind. The Federated States of Micronesia\nis a party to the Convention and I am happy to inform the\nAssembly that my country was among the many countries\nwhich signed the deep seabed mining Agreement relating to\nthe Implementation of Part XI of the Convention after it\nwas opened for signature. We look forward to close\ncooperation with the international community in the sound\nmanagement and conservation of the high seas as well as\nour individual territorial waters.\nAs a developing island State whose economy is\ndependent on these resources, Micronesia is committed to\nthe promotion of responsible fishing practices - not only\nwithin our exclusive economic zone and the zones of our\nneighbours in the region, but also in the contiguous high\nseas areas adjacent to the zones. The Federated States of\nMicronesia has actively participated in all of the substantive\nsessions of the United Nations Conference on Straddling\nFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. In the\nFederated States of Micronesia, we are fortunate that our\nislands are located in those latitudes of the Pacific Ocean in\nwhich 50 per cent of the world\u2019s highest grade tuna\nresources are located and caught. While we appreciate\nhaving this resource, we remain ever mindful of the fact\nthat the continued viability of our economy depends on the\nrational use of the marine resources present in our waters\nand beyond. This principle of rational utilization of\nresources forms the foundation for the concept of\nsustainable development.\nIt is not only coastal States like my own, which must\nbe dedicated to rational use and responsible fishing\npractices. Distant water fishing nations must also\nrecognize and protect the fragile balance of nature that\nexists in the oceans of the world to ensure the\nsustainability of the resource.\nDuring the last session of the Conference on\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks,\nmy Government\u2019s delegation joined the 15 other States\nmembers of the Forum Fisheries Agency in supporting a\nbinding legal document as the form of outcome for the\nConference. Even so, we do not support any outcome\nwhich would compromise the sovereign rights of coastal\nStates over the living marine resources occurring within\ntheir own extended economic zones. We do not support\nany derogation from the provisions of the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea that recognize the\nsovereign rights of coastal States.\nI now direct my comments to the recently concluded\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States in Barbados, which has\nbeen a great success in many ways. For the first time in\nthe history of the United Nations, we have been able to\nput forward an agenda for world attention concerning the\nsustainable development of small island developing States.\nThe Programme of Action that emerged from that Global\nConference is the first post-Rio de Janeiro effort to\namplify the principles of Agenda 21 in a specific context\npointing towards tangible measures for implementation.\nWhile this is a milestone, it will remain little more\nthan a planning document without the genuine\ncommitment of our developing countries around the\nworld. We welcome the recent report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on actions taken by the Organization and by the\nbodies of the United Nations system to implement the\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States. We cannot help but feel\na certain impatience to see actions taken that are\naccompanied by necessary funding; nevertheless my\nGovernment applauds the steps being taken to ensure that\nthe results of the Barbados Conference are integrated into\nthe programme of work of the Commission on\nSustainable Development. Strong partnership in this\nregard should be seen not as a conflict between developed\nand developing countries, but rather as a shared goal and\nan investment for the benefit of the entire family of\n29\n\n\nnations. A notable and welcome example of such shared\neffort is the upcoming initiative by the United States to\nwork with all countries towards the revitalization of the\nessential coral reefs, which are deteriorating all over the\nworld.\nThe Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is one\nsource of funding from which Small Island Developing\nStates could access financial assistance for implementation\nof the Programme of Action and other related\nenvironmental endeavours. The Programme of Action\nadopted at the Barbados Conference specifically requested\nthat, since such global environmental problems as climate\nchange, biological diversity and international waters are of\ngreat significance and concern to small island developing\nStates, the restructured GEF should be seen as an important\nchannel of assistance in these areas through the provision\nof new and additional resources. At the meeting of Heads\nof State the South Pacific Forum, which recently concluded\nin Brisbane, Australia, welcomed the restructuring and\nreplenishment of the GEF and its intention to assist in the\nimplementation of the decisions taken at Barbados.\nWe therefore encourage all Member States, during the\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly, to give\nmeaning to the concept of sustainable development by\nsupporting the overall outcome of Barbados, including all\nenabling legislation. This will give the United Nations\nspecialized agencies and organizations the mandate to start\nimplementing the Programme of Action.\nIn the Framework Convention on Climate Change, we\nappealed for a more constructive approach by the\ninternational community, with a view to further\ncommitments towards the reduction of greenhouse gases, as\ncalled for by the proposed protocol to the Convention\ndistributed this week to the Parties by the Alliance of Small\nIsland States. Recent scientific reports have confirmed with\ncertainty that global warming is occurring. More\nimportantly, it is also clear that the industrialized countries\nmust make greater cutbacks in emissions than were\noriginally envisioned if there is to be any hope of avoiding\ndisastrous consequences to much of the world -\nconsequences which cynics were scoffing at only a few\nyears ago. We welcomed with hope the coming into being\nof the climate-change Convention this past March and call\nupon all Members of the United Nations to be present as\nParties when the Conference of the Parties to the\nConvention convenes in Berlin.\nIn keeping with its concern for the protection and\nsustainable use of the environment, the Federated States of\nMicronesia acceded in June to the Convention on\nBiological Diversity and is looking forward to the first\nConference of the Parties this November, in the Bahamas.\nIn this connection, my Government wishes to add its\nsupport to the request made at the last session of the\nIntergovernmental Group in Nairobi that work on a\nprotocol on biosafety should begin without further delay.\nThe question of ownership and access to ex-situ genetic\nresources not presently covered by the Convention must\nalso be addressed as a matter of priority.\nThe concept of giving equal priority to the\nenvironment and to development is now widely accepted\nbut remains in many ways difficult to implement. It will\nremain so for many years to come, even though all our\nbest thinking is to be devoted to it. Sadly, even as we\nspeak, the quality and stocks of our planet\u2019s natural\nresources are deteriorating at an accelerated pace due to\npast and current practices. If we are to succeed in\nconfronting this challenge, the integrated efforts of the\nentire international community must call upon the assets\nthat all countries - large and small, developed and\ndeveloping - can bring to bear.\nFor example, sustainable living, which has been the\nway of island peoples for centuries, involves practices and\ntechniques that are quite relevant to sustainable\ndevelopment in much of today\u2019s world. The canoes\nsailing across our crystal blue lagoons bring to mind a\nhost of traditions of our people that involve clean use of\nthe environment and highly effective resource-\nmanagement practices. We must approach sustainable\ndevelopment in a way that respects and builds on the age-\nold concept of sustainable living and takes full account of\nthe wisdom that can be gleaned from indigenous cultures\nworldwide.\nIn other words, my country believes that not only is\nit important to have a common vision to combat climate\nchange and promote sustainable development, but it is\nnow incumbent upon us seriously to rethink our roles and\nhow we can all play a vital part in restoring our\nenvironment. As a front-line country in terms of\nvulnerability, Micronesia recognizes that we cannot retreat\ninto the position of treating global environmental issues\nonly to the extent to which we think we are conveniently\ncapable, without giving due consideration to their urgency\nand magnitude. Addressing this man-made catastrophe\nrequires many more additional resources and a greater\ncommitment, especially on the part of the developed\nworld.\n30\n\n\nOur views on these issues are clear and simple: we\nare convinced that all our efforts are mounting up to a\nlong-term investment for the survival and viability of our\necosystem, the common heritage of mankind. In assessing\nwhat has transpired so far in all related activities geared to\nthis common objective, I cannot but say how fascinated I\nam with the enormous effort that has gone into these\nprocesses. The activities include the negotiations on the\nclimate-change Convention, the biodiversity Convention, the\ndesertification Convention and the Convention on the Law\nof the Sea, as well as the Conference on Straddling Fish\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the Barbados\nConference, the Cairo Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, the Commission on Sustainable Development\nand the Global Environmental Facility. I cannot but believe\nthat positive progress will emanate from this massive\nhuman energy and commitment, and that our future will be\nsecured with this common vision. We are not only\ninhabitants of this planet, but custodians of its resources for\nfuture generations. I hope that the greed of mankind will\nnot in the end triumph over the our inherent responsibility\nto leave for future generations an environment that is as\nhabitable as the one we find today. Sustainable utilization\nof our natural resources may be the greatest gift that our\npresent civilization can contribute to future humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate the\nPresident on his election to his high office, and to thank the\noutgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally,\nfor his wise leadership during the forty-eighth session of\nthe General Assembly.\nMany had hoped that the fall of the Berlin Wall would\nput an end to the divisions of the world and usher in a new\nera of peace and harmony among nations. This has not\nhappened. Today humanity faces a new division or\nfragmentation far more dramatic in essence. The world is\ntorn between hope and despair. This is the new division\nwe are facing.\nOn the one hand, hope: the spirit of democracy is\nkept alive. The global commitment to the universal\nprinciples of respect for human rights, the rule of law and\nfundamental freedoms has been maintained.\nOn the other hand, despair: the eruption of\nlong-suppressed evil forces, such as ethnic and xenophobic\nnationalism, racism and tribalism, has caused new conflicts.\nThey have emerged as new threats to international peace\nand security.\nOn the darkest side, there are new instances of\ngenocide. Slogans of racial hatred have resurfaced.\nHundreds of thousands of people have been killed or\nwounded; hundreds of thousands of people have become\nrefugees or displaced persons. Human dignity has been\nviolated.\nOn the brightest side, historic breakthroughs have been\nachieved in South Africa and the Middle East. The\ncourageous stand of some eminent statesmen has been\ninstrumental in translating the basic vision of the United\nNations into reality. In this respect, our praise goes to the\nleaders of Palestine, Israel and South Africa for their\ncourage and far-sightedness. Their bold steps towards\npeace fostered our optimism to counter the negative\ntrends.\nIn order to be able to plan a better future, we must\ntake account of the achievements and the failures of the\npast and meet the challenges of the present. The time has\ncome to start to contemplate realistically how to create\nnew and workable mechanisms to respond effectively to\nthe challenges of our times. But we first have to accept\nthe fact that euphoria is almost always short-lived.\nToday we observe two contradictory trends, one\ntowards fragmentation and conflict and the other towards\nglobalization and cooperation. This new dialectic defines\nthe framework within which we have to work together to\nfind a balance between optimism and pessimism, between\nthe integrity of the nation-State and the demands of an\never more interdependent world.\nThis Organization was built on the ashes of the\nSecond World War. The war\u2019s aftermath left its imprint\nnot only on the United Nations Charter, but also on the\nrules that govern its work and its structure. Hence, the\ncrucial challenge before us today is to make the United\nNations the real centre of universal solidarity, by\nimproving its effectiveness and harmonizing its work with\nthese new imperatives. It is in line with this reasoning\nthat we attach the utmost importance to the process of\nreform and restructuring of the United Nations.\nIn this exercise, the pivotal point should be the\nSecurity Council. The widespread demands to make that\nprincipal body more representative, more responsive,\nmore transparent and more accountable have imposed\nupon us a historic task which we must fulfil. The\ndemocratization of the Security Council is a challenge of\nour times, one that requires an adequate response. The\nmoral authority of this body needs to be reinforced. We\nhave to enhance the representative weight of the Security\nCouncil by enlarging it and by establishing a fairer and\nmore orderly system of rotation within the geographical\ngroups.\nWe must make sure that the Security Council is not\nperceived as a tool of a small group of big States that\nseek to impose their will and their national policy\nobjectives on others. Indeed, the moral and legal\nauthority of the Security Council\u2019s decisions emanates\nfrom the fact that the Council, in accordance with Article\n24 of the Charter, acts on behalf of all States Members of\n23\n\n\nthe United Nations. Consequently, it is essential that the\nworking methods of the Security Council be reviewed to\nreflect the spirit of democratization.\nWith this understanding, my country, Turkey, has been\nactively participating in the deliberations of the Open-ended\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council. We expect this Working Group to\nbecome a genuine driving force for real reform of the\nSecurity Council. Therefore, any \\\"quick-fix\\\" solution in\nwhich the reform may be interpreted in a rather narrow\nsense cannot be accepted. In the same vein, we also fully\nsupport the efforts under way to revitalize and rationalize\nthe work of the General Assembly as the central and\nuniversal deliberative forum.\nThe ongoing conflicts and tragedies all over the world\nunderscore the urgency of our task of strengthening the\nUnited Nations, particularly in the field of collective\nsecurity. In the past five years, United Nations\npeace-keeping operations have undergone considerable\nexpansion. The nature of peace-keeping is changing.\nPreventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-enforcement,\npeace-building and global human security have emerged as\nnew concepts on which further reflection is needed.\nAs an active participant in the peace-keeping\noperations of the United Nations, Turkey believes that their\nsuccess depends ultimately on the support and assistance\nreceived from the community of nations. This, in turn,\nrequires the awareness of a sense of shared responsibility\nin addressing our common concerns.\nThe United Nations stand-by forces, in which we have\ndecided to participate, would play an essential role in\npromoting such awareness. Only when a potential\naggressor clearly perceives that the international community\nwill retaliate in a timely and effective manner might it\nchange its behaviour.\nThe challenges we are facing today go beyond the\nmeans and resources of a single organization. Accordingly,\nthere is a need for a new collective security architecture of\nmutually-reinforcing institutions in which all elements\nwould have a role to play. The interaction between global\nsecurity and regional security requires effective cooperation\nand coordination among the United Nations and regional\norganizations. One thing is clear: only the United Nations\ncan provide legitimacy to regional arrangements and\ninstitutions in the fields of peace-keeping and peacemaking.\nFrom Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Caucasus to\nRwanda, the peoples of the world, faced with threats of\nracist hatred, are desperately demanding the helping hand\nand protection of the United Nations.\nRegrettably, the tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nhas continued to be at the top of the international agenda\nduring the past 12 months. Despite numerous Security\nCouncil and General Assembly resolutions, the\ninternational community has been able neither to put an\nend to the ethnic cleansing, nor to roll back the brutal\naggression against the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. On the contrary, the lack of effective\nenforcement measures has encouraged the aggressors to\nproceed further with their genocidal campaign and their\nblatant defiance of international law.\nDecisive and firm action to stop the aggression is\nlong overdue. The Washington and Vienna Agreements\nlaid down the foundation for a just and viable peace in\nBosnia. These Agreements define the framework of a\nfederation which preserves the territorial integrity and\nunity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a multicultural,\nmultireligious and multi-ethnic State. They are also open\nto the participation of Bosnian Serbs.\nThe Bosnian Government accepted the latest\ninternational peace plan proposed by the five-nation\nContact Group in the spirit of peace. However, the\nextremist Serbs, longing for an ethnically homogeneous\nGreater Serbia, have insisted on their defiance of the will\nof the international community and have rejected the\npeace plan. Their rejection has demonstrated, yet again,\nthat aggression cannot be halted on the shifting sands of\npromises and declarations.\nThe five-nation Contact Group has committed itself,\nin case of rejection, to the tightening of sanctions on\nSerbia and Montenegro. We deeply regret that the\nSecurity Council, by adopting resolution 943 (1994) on\n23 September 1994, moved in the opposite direction\ndespite the efforts of the Contact Group of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. Once again,\naggression has been rewarded. Genocide remains\nunchecked. The Bosnian people are yet again completely\ndisappointed with the international system. Their\ndisappointment is shared more and more by the rest of the\nworld, especially in the Islamic countries.\nWe have arrived at a critical juncture. The\ninternational community should stand by its commitments\nand should begin to act resolutely. We have to admit\n24\n\n\nthat only diplomacy backed by sufficient force can make\nthe extremist Serbs realize that war gives them more pain\nthan gain. There should be no further easing of the\nsanctions until Serbia and Montenegro recognize all the\nsuccessor States within their international borders.\nAs winter approaches, the need to provide security,\nshelter and humanitarian assistance to the civilian\npopulation becomes ever more pressing. The safe areas\nshould be extended and effectively protected by the United\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The strangulation\nof Sarajevo should be ended. The humanitarian corridors\nshould remain open.\nAs a matter of principle, the Bosnian Government\nmust be provided with all the means necessary for\nself-defence, so that it may exercise its inherent right under\nArticle 51 of the Charter. This is a moral, legal and\npolitical obligation on the part of the international\ncommunity - but primarily a moral one.\nPresident Izetbegovic\u00b4, in his address at the 7th plenary\nmeeting, on 27 September 1994, from this rostrum,\nannounced a new formula in this respect. On the condition\nthat certain conditions be fulfilled, he limited his just\ndemand for the lifting of the arms embargo to the adoption\nof a formal decision, deferring the implementation of the\ndecision for six months. This is a new sacrifice motivated\nby the international community\u2019s inability to provide\nsecurity for the victims or to recognize their basic right to\nself-defence. We must praise this noble gesture and\nsupport the new formula.\nRealization of the commitments to a just and viable\npeace in Bosnia - commitments that have so far remained\nunfulfilled - is vital for the restoration of the credibility and\nmoral authority of the United Nations. If we fail the test of\nhistory in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the so-called \\\"new\nworld order\\\" could turn into a permanent \\\"new world\ndisorder\\\".\nWe are witnessing further potential threats to the peace\nand stability of the Balkans. With the increasing tension\nbetween Greece and Albania there is, regrettably, a risk that\nyet another crisis may be created in the region. In addition,\nthe Republic of Macedonia is suffering from an illegal\neconomic blockade imposed by Greece. Moreover,\nMacedonia is still waiting to be represented at the United\nNations under the name and the flag it has chosen.\nThe Balkans can in no way stand the pressure of\nadditional tensions. Compliance with the basic international\nnorms - respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,\nnon-intervention in internal affairs, and the need to\nresolve disputes by peaceful means rather than by threat\nor coercion - is today more than ever before a pressing\nneed in the Balkans.\nMy country lies at the very epicentre of the vast\ngeography and the new geopolitics of Eurasia. Most of\nthe conflicts which are high on the international agenda\nare taking place around Turkey. Fully aware of our\nresponsibilities for the peace and stability of our region\nand beyond, we are trying to contain conflicts.\nWe seek to reverse destabilizing currents. We strive\nto promote the rule of law and democracy on our\nperiphery. We remain a factor for stability. We believe\nthat regional economic cooperation is a driving force for\nshared prosperity and increased confidence among nations\nas well as the most effective way to prevent the spread of\nethnic conflicts and potential hegemonic tendencies.\nWith this awareness, we have developed new\ncreative and cooperative regional initiatives to enhance\nsolidarity and to consolidate the new geopolitical\npluralism. We have established the Black Sea Economic\nCooperation with Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria,\nGeorgia, Greece, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the\nRussian Federation and Ukraine. The Economic\nCooperation Organization, originally founded by Turkey,\nIran and Pakistan, has been enlarged to include\nAfghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,\nTajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\nAnother blatant example of defiance of international\nlaw has been unfolding in the Caucasus, where Armenian\nforces continue to occupy one-fifth of Azerbaijani\nterritory. More than a million Azerbaijanis have been\ndisplaced. Constant calls by the international community\nfor the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of\noccupying forces, as stipulated in relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, have fallen on deaf ears. This\nunlawful situation, created by Armenians, constitutes a\nserious threat not only to the stability of the region\nneighbouring Turkey, but also to international peace and\nsecurity.\nAs a member of the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) Minsk Group since its\ninception, Turkey remains committed to the CSCE peace\nprocess. We firmly believe that a solution should be\nfound through collective efforts under the authority of the\nCSCE. In this respect, we fully support the endeavours\n25\n\n\nof the Chairman of the Minsk Group to organize a\nmultinational force to assist the parties to reach a just and\nlasting solution. We stand ready to contribute to these\nendeavours.\nIn this context, I should like to reiterate our consistent\nand firm position, which we have expressed from this\nrostrum on many occasions: Neither in the Balkans nor in\nthe Caucasus, nor, for that matter, anywhere else, will\nTurkey ever accept the acquisition of territory by force.\nNor will Turkey ever allow misinformation and unashamed\nofficial propaganda - even from this rostrum - to continue\nto lead the international community to tolerate and\nperpetuate the living conditions imposed upon the Turkish\npeople of Cyprus.\nTurkish Cypriots remain totally isolated in their part\nof the island because of innumerable restrictions that\nGovernments and international organizations have placed on\ntheir trade, travel, cultural and sporting contacts with the\nrest of the world. This arbitrary embargo is maintained as\na result of a relentless campaign to distort the facts relating\nto the history of events on the island over the last 31 years.\nEven a United Nations-sponsored confidence-building\npackage, which was aimed at partially alleviating the ill\neffects of this embargo, was deliberately torpedoed by the\nshort-sighted policies of the other side, and, unfortunately,\nprospects for a just and durable settlement have been\nfurther eroded.\nA realistic and viable negotiated settlement continues\nto be the objective of the Turkish Cypriot side. We support\nthis, and we believe that the only way towards a\ncomprehensive solution of the question of Cyprus lies in\nremoving the obstacles to the confidence-building measures.\nAs a neighbouring country, Turkey follows very\nclosely developments in Georgia. We look forward to the\nrestoration of peaceful conditions in that friendly country\nand stand prepared to participate in the concerted\ninternational action within the framework of the United\nNations Observer Mission in Georgia.\nTurkey has set out on a lasting path of solidarity with\nthe newly independent Central Asian republics, with which\nit has historic, cultural and linguistic ties. Turkey fully\nsupports the efforts of those secular republics to build\npluralistic societies and will assist them in integrating into\nthe world community. I should like to underscore that\nTurkey\u2019s relationship between sovereign countries is one of\ncooperation and solidarity; it is a relationship between\nsovereign countries. It is neither in competition with, nor\nexclusive of, other countries\u2019 relations with them.\nWe attach great importance to the unity and\nterritorial integrity of Afghanistan. We had hoped that a\nbroad-based national reconciliation process including all\ngroups could have started. However, we have been\ngreatly dismayed by the resumption of armed conflict.\nWe once again call upon all the Afghan parties to put an\nend to the fratricidal fighting and start working for the\nestablishment of internal peace so that the rehabilitation\nand reconstruction of this devastated country can begin.\nIn the Middle East, the end of the cold war has\nfundamentally altered the bleak picture and opened new\nhorizons for peace. The Israeli-Palestinian agreement and\nthe ensuing Israeli-Jordanian agreements have opened up\na new era in which enmity is giving way to reconciliation\nand despair to hope.\nThe historic breakthrough in the peace process,\nwhich promises concord and cooperation between the\nPalestinians and Israel, and between Israel and its Arab\nneighbours, will undoubtedly have positive ramifications\non a much wider regional and global scale. The\nestablishment of permanent peace in the Middle East will\nalso create the necessary conditions for harmony,\neconomic cooperation and shared prosperity.\nAs a country neighbouring the Middle East, Turkey\nhas a record of constructive involvement in the region\u2019s\naffairs and good traditional ties with all the parties. It is\nactively participating in all tracks of multilateral\nnegotiations. It remains ready to contribute to the\neconomic restructuring efforts of the Palestinians in Gaza\nand Jericho. It will take part in the temporary\ninternational presence upon the request of the parties. I\nshould like to reaffirm our strong support for the process\ntowards a just and lasting peace in the region.\nThe rather optimistic prospects for the future of the\nMiddle East need to be tempered, however, with a degree\nof realism, in the face of the hardship the Iraqi people\nhave been suffering. Four years after the outbreak of the\nGulf crisis they are still waiting to return to normality.\nWe are fully aware of the fact that, in order to take its\nrightful place in the international community, Iraq has to\ncomply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nHowever, we cannot and should not turn a blind eye to\nthe fact that Iraq has almost completed its compliance\nwith the disarmament requirements under Security\n26\n\n\nCouncil resolution 687 (1991) and deserves encouragement\nin this respect.\nIt should also be borne in mind that the sanctions have\ncaused great economic problems not only for the Iraqi\npeople but also for a number of countries, especially Iraq\u2019s\nneighbours. The great economic losses of the most\nadversely affected countries, particularly mine - Turkey -\nstill have to be addressed.\nHere, I must also underline once again our principled\nstand that we will remain committed to the territorial\nintegrity and unity of Iraq, which are vital for peace and\nstability in the Middle East.\nThe elimination of apartheid in South Africa closed a\nlong and dark chapter in the history of humanity. Apart\nfrom South Africa, the picture is still gloomy in many parts\nof Africa. The United Nations conducts half of its\npeace-keeping operations in that continent and is actively\ninvolved in maintaining and building peace in Somalia,\nMozambique, Angola, Liberia, Rwanda and Burundi.\nThe efforts of the United Nations in Africa should be\nbased on a twofold and consolidated strategy. They should\nbe directed not only to maintaining peace, but also to\naccelerating sustained economic development, through\nwhich the major causes of continued armed conflicts may\nbe defused.\nIndeed, the root causes of conflict require new global\ncommitments. In full agreement with the\nSecretary-General, my Government subscribes to the view\nthat it is time to balance the old commitment to territorial\nsecurity with a new commitment to human security; to shift\nfrom providing security through arms to ensuring security\nthrough development.\nThe end of the cold war has also ended the\ncompartmentalization of major components, such as\npolitical security and social issues. It is now mostly\nrecognized that security cannot be viewed in political and\nmilitary terms alone, and that peace and prosperity are\nindivisible.\nAt a time when disorder and disintegration, both at\nnational and international levels, seem fated to increase, the\nconcept of crisis prevention needs to be elaborated and\nexpanded.\nWe strongly endorse the view that peace, development\nand democracy are interrelated and mutually reinforcing.\nWe all recognize the pressing need to promote a new\nculture of development. The United Nations new agenda\nfor development must bring sustainable and\npeople-centred development to the forefront. For this, a\nstronger role for the United Nations is needed.\nDemocracy is the underlying imperative for human\nsecurity, social integration and good governance. Indeed,\nduring the Vienna Conference last year, the international\ncommunity reiterated its commitment to the protection of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms and to the\ncommon struggle against racism, xenophobia and\nintolerance. Today a pluralistic civil society, free and fair\nelections, and the rule of law are defined as the common\ngoals of humanity. Dialogue between different cultures\ncan only be achieved within the context of democracy.\nViolence and terrorism could not, and should not, be\njustified under any circumstances. In this spirit, the\nGeneral Assembly in its resolution 48/122 reaffirmed the\nVienna Declaration and described terrorism as an activity\nwhich aims at the destruction of human rights,\nfundamental freedoms and democracy, as well as\nthreatening the territorial integrity and security of States,\ndestabilizing legitimately constituted Governments,\nundermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse\nconsequences on the economic and social development of\nStates. We call upon the international community to\nstand by its commitments and to take the necessary steps\nto combat and eradicate terrorism.\nLack of tolerance is the underlying cause of various\nconflicts which constitute the most important threat to\ninternational peace and security. Therefore, promotion of\na culture of tolerance has a direct bearing on crisis\nprevention. We should inject the spirit of tolerance into\nthe young generations.\nIt is a pleasure for me to recall here that on Turkey\u2019s\ninitiative, the General Assembly last December\nproclaimed 1995 as the United Nations Year for\nTolerance. By the terms of resolution 48/126, the entire\nUnited Nations system has been asked to contribute to its\nsuccessful observance. Its celebration will contribute to\nthe acceleration of efforts to prevent all forms of racism,\ndiscrimination, fanaticism and fundamentalism.\nDisarmament should also be seen within the context\nof preventive diplomacy. We must recognize the fact that\nthe end of the cold war has not removed the danger of\nnuclear weapons. On the contrary, in some cases the\ndanger has actually increased. Hence, another field where\n27\n\n\nprogress is needed is the prevention of nuclear proliferation.\nAs we prepare for the Conference of the Parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which\nwill be convened next year, the creation of a climate of\nconfidence will be vital. Measures need to be taken now\nto create that climate.\nIn the same vein, we hold the view that full\ncompliance with existing arms control and disarmament\ninstruments at regional and global levels is of primary\nimportance.\nAs the Secretary-General has rightly stated, the\nchildren\u2019s Summit in 1990, the Earth Summit in 1992, the\nhuman rights Conference in 1993, the population\nConference in September 1994, the social development\nSummit in March 1995 and the women\u2019s Conference to be\nheld in September 1995 are all linked. By 1995, in time\nfor the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we should\nreach a global consensus on the way forward to new\ncommitments towards building a better world.\nTo complete the agenda, we must also add to these\nmajor events the Second United Nations Conference on\nHuman Settlements (Habitat II), which will be held in\nJune 1996 in Istanbul. In this context, we welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s call to declare the Habitat II\nConference as the \\\"City Summit\\\" to increase world\nawareness on this subject and to commit the world\u2019s\nleaders to making our cities, towns and villages healthy,\nsafe, just and sustainable. High-level participation in this\nConference will ensure its success.\nWe will commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nOrganization next year. It is the most opportune time, on\nthe threshold of a new millennium, to take stock of what\nwe have achieved, and where we have failed, with a sense\nof realism and vision. We are obliged to realize the\ndreams of the founders of the United Nations. We hope\nthat our deliberations will help to generate a new impetus\nfor positive action to this end.\nMember States have set their hopes on the United\nNations, which reflects diversity united in a common\ncause. To the extent that it succeeds, we will have a\nbetter world for all peoples, and peace, security,\ndemocracy, development and prosperity will be enhanced.\nThis requires cooperative action, which all nations\nshould be engaged in. We have to give full scope to our\nimagination to keep pace with the winds of change and\nstrive for the realization of the shared dreams of\nhumankind. If we fail, future generations will pay dearly\nfor our mistakes. I am convinced that after all the bitter\nexperiences of the past, humanity has the cumulative\nwisdom not to make such mistakes.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure\nthat I present my compliments to you, Mr. Amara Essy,\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, and congratulate you on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its current session.\nI would also like to extend my recognition to\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, who, as President of the\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session, dignified not only his\nown country, Guyana, but all the countries of the Amazon\nand South American region as well. I also greet the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to whom\nI convey my gratitude for the tireless efforts he has been\nundertaking at the head of this Organization.\nThe close of this century is marked by the force of\ntransformation. In the last few years there has been\nprodigious change. This has been of such a radical nature\nthat we could, like Hamlet, say that \\\"The time is out of\njoint\\\" (Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act I, scene v). The process\nhas been so fascinating that some have deluded\nthemselves with the fantasy that the future is already\nunder control. That is not the case. Transformation does\nnot have a fixed, inexorable course. We must not allow\nourselves to be enticed by hasty interpretations or by\nmere appearances. It is our responsibility to give\nmeaning to change and to guide trends in accordance with\nthe greater interests of the world community.\n1\n\n\nIt will be five years next November since the Berlin\nWall crumbled. That period is sufficient for evaluating the\ndistances that have been covered and, above all, for\ncharting a course that will lead us to a safe harbour. The\ncold war took place under the sign of denial, a situation\nreflected even in the language that marked the period. The\nexpressions that identified and explained almost 40 years of\ntense relationships denoted confrontation, exclusion or, at\nbest, uncomfortable coexistence of opposites. The\ncatchphrases of the day were \\\"iron curtain\\\", \\\"containment\\\"\nand \\\"balance of terror\\\".\nToday we are in the midst of transition. Taking stock\nof these last few years, we can say that the results, though\ntenuous and imperfect, are positive. The cause of peace\nhas made significant headway. Nuclear war has ceased to\nbe an impending threat. Conflicts which many of us judged\ninsoluble either have been or are in the process of being\nsettled through dialogue and negotiation. In southern\nAfrica and in the Middle East, steps of historic significance\nhave been taken toward a more just and a more peaceful\nworld. In Central America and in South-East Asia,\nprogress is tangible. Throughout the greater part of our\nplanet, the logic of confrontation is giving way to the logic\nof cooperation.\nIt is that very logic that we wish to see firmly\nestablished in our own region. Peace and fraternity are\nLatin America\u2019s vocation. We have been striving to bring\nthe sister Republic of Cuba fully into the inter-American\nand international fold by means of a policy of outstretched\nhands, of dialogue and of rapprochement. Political,\neconomic and commercial isolation, apart from being\nunjustifiable, only contributes to aggravating the hardship\nendured by the Cuban people at a time when we perceive\npositive indications of democratic reform and of\nreconciliation. Here too the stasis of confrontation must\ngive way to the dynamics of dialogue, putting to rest this\nremnant of the cold war.\nGiven a set of entirely different characteristics, we are\nequally interested in promoting a lasting solution to the\nHaitian crisis, the return to office of President Jean-\nBertrand Aristide, and national reconciliation. The\ndiplomatic efforts of the international community, which we\nfirmly support, must have as their point of reference the\nprompt removal of the de facto authorities by peaceful\nmeans - the only means to avoid even greater suffering for\nthe Haitian people. We consider it disturbing that the\nprinciples of non-intervention and self-determination are the\nobject of interpretations that are incompatible with the\ncharters of the United Nations and of the Organization of\nAmerican States. The gravity of the Haitian crisis and\nthe urgency of the need to solve it do not make us unable\nto see the inherent risks of a situation that evokes traumas\nand scars that are still very vivid in the memory of Latin\nAmerica. Once the legitimate Government is re-\nestablished, it will be the responsibility of the\ninternational community to provide Haiti with assistance\nin the daunting task of national reconstruction.\nWe are still far from universal peace. Conflicts of\nenormous cruelty shock the world and are the cause of\nunspeakable suffering for millions of human beings.\nRwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina are emblematic\ntragedies of our times. The scenes of horror shown by\nthe media attest to the difficulty of finding effective\nsolutions to the imbalances which challenge all peoples.\nThe intensification of migratory flows toward developed\ncountries has been accompanied by an exacerbation of\nxenophobia and racial discrimination.\nCritical situations continue to challenge the\ninternational community\u2019s ability to ensure peace and\nharmony. In Angola, a country so closely linked to\nBrazil by historic and cultural ties, we witness with pain\nand indignation the prolongation of a conflict that is the\nlongest and most devastating civil war today. We are\nencouraged by the prospects that the negotiations under\nway in Lusaka between the Government of Angola and\nUNITA may be promptly concluded. In paying a tribute\nto President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos for his political\nconduct, we urge UNITA to demonstrate a real\ncommitment to stability and peace in the country, and we\ncall upon all those with an influence on the Angolan\ncrisis to do likewise.\nWe welcome the progress achieved in Mozambique.\nThe process of national reconciliation will culminate in\nthe general elections to be held next October, when the\npeople of Mozambique will be able to choose, in free and\nfair elections, the government that will lead the country\nin this new era of its history. President Joaquim Chissano\nhas played a central role in this process. Brazil takes\npride in the fact that Brazilian troops are participating,\nthrough the United Nations Operation in Mozambique\n(ONUMOZ), in the reconstruction of Mozambique.\nIn the case of East Timor, we have also noted\npositive signals in the negotiating process promoted by\nthe Secretary-General, to whom we pay a tribute.\nDemocracy and the values associated with it are the\ngreatest conquest of our time. We are experiencing an\n2\n\n\nethical revolution. The concern with human rights gains\nuniversality alongside a growing awareness of the\nimperative of public probity. The international context has\nceased to be the exclusive domain of the raison d\u2019\u00e9tat and\nhas acquired a more human dimension directed to the\nwelfare of the individual.\nIn the economic and commercial sphere, recent\ndevelopments are also positive. After eight years of\ndifficult negotiations within the Uruguay Round of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), we\nadopted the Marrakesh agreements. The World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) will open up new and promising\noutlooks for the economic relationship among nations.\nUnilateralism and protectionism, derived from parochial\ninterests, will lose any semblance of legitimacy.\nThe effective progress achieved cannot obscure the\nfact that there are challenges that continue to demand firm\nresolve from the international community.\nThe fundamental rights of individuals, despite having\nbeen incorporated into the realm of universally recognized\nvalues, still demand the firm and decided support of all\nthose who believe in them.\nThe social conditions of the majority of the world\u2019s\npopulation continue to deteriorate. In the last 20 years, the\ngap has widened between rich and poor nations, between\nthe millions of people who are adequately fed and educated\nand have a surplus for leisure and the billions who are\nstruggling for survival. The pressures for migration toward\nthe developed North and the many conflicts of the\nimpoverished South are two sides of the same coin. Youth,\nin particular, continues to be a victim of deprivation and of\na lack of prospects in most of the world.\nThe globalization of the economy and the\nstrengthening of free trade have yet to demonstrate in\npractice their undeniable potential as factors of growth and\nwell-being. Lingering protectionism, now draped in new\ncolours, resists the assault of economic rationality. The\npositive impact of the Marrakesh agreements is under\nsubstantial threat from new conditionalities that will have\na restrictive effect on the flows of international trade.\nIssues that are in themselves legitimate, such as the\nprotection of the environment and universally accepted\nlabour standards, cannot and should not serve as pretexts\nfor even greater barriers to the access of goods produced in\npoor countries to the markets of wealthier nations. The\ncost of readjustment of the most prosperous economies\ncannot be shunted onto the shoulders of those who\npossess little or nothing.\nThe mastery of technology is a major watershed\nbetween industrialized and developing countries. The\ndifficulties in access to advanced technologies are an\nobstacle to overcoming the disadvantages of developing\ncountries, reducing their competitiveness and creating\nbarriers to the transformation of productive processes.\nThe new international division of labour cannot re-enact\npast formulas that have proved to be inefficient. The\ncompetitive integration of developing countries into the\nworld economy must build upon dynamic comparative\nadvantages, not static ones, with an increasing integration\nof knowledge into the productive process. Alongside the\nindispensable internal efforts of each country, such a\nqualitative leap requires an international environment\nbased on cooperation.\nIn order to consolidate peace and ensure that the\nprogress already achieved shall be irreversible, we must\nbe able to develop a vision for our future, an attainable\nand forward-looking Utopia. Brazil is convinced that a\ntruly new order must be based on a pluralistic and\ndemocratic perspective on international relations.\nWe do not contend unrealistically that States and\nother international players will refrain from affirming\ntheir specific and often conflicting interests. The fact is\nthat we all stand to gain, and our interests will be better\nserved, once the basic aspirations of the great majority\nhave been reasonably satisfied.\nInterdependence must be understood in an integrated\nway, and not merely as the expression of a market-\neconomy phenomenon. It presupposes the political ability\nto act in coordination with others toward the fulfilment of\nobjectives shared by all mankind. In an interdependent\nworld the improvement of living conditions in a poor\ncountry may have an impact on the creation of jobs in a\ndeveloped nation. The integration of those that are\nexcluded and the promotion of participation by all in\nworld affairs is not only a moral obligation, but, first and\nforemost, a demonstration of lucid judgement.\nThe fundamental commitment to development is the\ncornerstone of the order to which Brazil aspires. This\nconcept has the advantage of encompassing the essential\nneeds of all nations, large and small, rich and poor.\nDevelopment reinforces freedom, invests the dignity of\nman with a concrete dimension, stresses efficiency,\n3\n\n\npromotes stability and enhances democracy. Development\nbuilds peace.\nThe promotion of development stands to benefit from\nthe lessons of the past. We must formulate a concept of\ndevelopment that recognizes each country as the main actor\nin creating its own prosperity, while incorporating the\nvarious features of its international dimension in the fields\nof trade, investment and flows of technology.\nA renewed international effort in favour of\ndevelopment will be successful only under an active and\nmutually advantageous partnership between the countries of\nthe North and those of the South. Advancement of the\ninterests of the richer nations requires their involvement in\nefforts to overcome the backwardness of the less\nprosperous. To hold the opposite view would be\ntantamount to believing that a fire in our neighbour\u2019s house\ncannot reach over the fence into our own. In short, it is an\nabsurdity the price of which even the wealthiest cannot\nafford.\nThe nations of the world have a fundamental role to\nplay in the construction of an open and equitable\ninternational system.\nWe must undertake a profound reformulation of the\nUnited Nations performance in promoting development. No\nother task under the United Nations mandate will more\nadequately support and promote peace and establish a just\nand stable order.\nWe must avoid the crystallization of an undesirable\ndivision of labour between the United Nations on the one\nhand and the Bretton Woods institutions on the other.\nPeace and development constitute an indivisible whole and\nmust support each other. This great forum cannot be kept\noutside decisions on matters arising from objectives\ninscribed in its very Charter.\nThese concerns have been at the root of the launching\nof the Agenda for Development, in which Brazilian\ndiplomacy has been deeply involved.\nSeveral United Nations Conferences, some having\nalready taken place, others yet to come, are significantly\ncontributing to shedding light upon the need for a\ncomprehensive and coordinated consideration of the\ndevelopment issue. In one way or another, development\nwas a central concern, or will continue to be so, in Rio de\nJaneiro at the Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, in Vienna at the Conference on Human\nRights, and in Cairo at the Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, and it will continue to be so in the\nforthcoming meetings in Copenhagen on Social\nDevelopment, and in Beijing, on Women. Awareness of\nthe fact that the decisions reached at these encounters will\nproduce effective results only if all these issues are\nexamined in an integrated fashion is becoming\nincreasingly firm and universal.\nWith a view to fostering a debate on all such issues\nin a wider conceptual framework, the Brazilian\nGovernment proposes the convening of a United Nations\nconference on development, possibly in 1996, which\nwould seek to synthesize the initiatives and programmes\ndesigned to promote human dignity and well-being.\nDemocracy should be the rule for political relations\nwithin and among States. To bring democracy into\npolitics and international relations is a goal which can be\nturned into reality. The strengthening of the role of the\nGeneral Assembly and the expansion of the Security\nCouncil, with the participation of developing countries in\nall member categories are important and necessary steps\non the road to democratization and greater legitimacy.\nLike other Member States, we favour a reform of the\nSecurity Council that will increase its effectiveness. We\nunderstand that such effectiveness will be ensured only by\na composition truly representative of the world\ncommunity. At the beginning of this month the Heads of\nState and Government of the 14 nations from Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean which form the Group of Rio\nmet in Rio de Janeiro and stated that\n\\\"in accordance with their legal tradition and their\ncontribution to the cause of peace, the Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean region must be included in\nany expansion of the Security Council\\\".\nBrazil has participated actively in the debate on the\nexpansion of the Security Council. We have clearly\nstated our readiness to assume all responsibilities required\nof countries eligible to occupy permanent seats.\nElected to the Security Council for the current\nperiod, Brazil has lived up to its responsibilities. We\nhave based our positions on respect for principles such as\nnon-intervention, as well as on the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of States; we have consistently\nfavoured peaceful and negotiated solutions to conflicts, as\nwell as consensus; we have stood by the rule of law in\nsafeguarding the international public order; we have risen\n4\n\n\nin defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms; and\nwe have increasingly participated in peace-keeping\noperations in several regions of the globe.\nAs part of Latin America, we are proud of sharing its\nlong history of peace. Latin America is the least armed\nregion of the world and the only one to have become, by\nvirtue of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, definitively free from\nnuclear weapons. Cuba\u2019s adherence to the Treaty,\nannounced in a letter from President Fidel Castro to\nPresident Itamar Franco - in response to a Brazilian\ninitiative - has brought this process to a conclusion.\nLatin America has been a factor of international\nstability in a turbulent world. Our legal tradition, built\nthrough decades of efforts to regulate inter-American\nrelations, represents a relevant contribution to the\ninternational community. As pioneers in the promotion of\ndisarmament, we feel entitled to seek equivalent gestures\nfrom the entire international community, and in particular\nfrom the nuclear-weapon States. In this context, we\nattribute special significance to the prompt adoption,\nthrough multilaterally negotiated commitments, of effective\nmeasures to reduce, and not merely control, their arsenals,\nincluding sensitive nuclear material such as plutonium. It\nis likewise imperative that negotiations on a comprehensive\ntest-ban treaty be successfully concluded, leading to\nsignature.\nBrazil is ready to join in the construction of a new\ninternational agenda based on universal participation and\ncooperation for peace and development.\nThis readiness derives from our own identity. We are\na pluralist and open society, having emerged from the\nmeeting of different cultures and ways of life, which in turn\nproduced a new culture and way of life, founded on\ntolerance and understanding. We enjoy peacefully defined\nborders with 10 neighbouring countries, and an absence of\nconflicts for more than 120 years.\nForged through dialogue, conciliation and peaceful\nreform, Brazilian society is experiencing a moment of\nintense democratic affirmation under the leadership of\nPresident Itamar Franco. In a few days we shall be holding\nthe largest elections in our country\u2019s history. Nearly 100\nmillion voters will cast their ballots, in an atmosphere of\nabsolute freedom, to choose their representatives in the\nexecutive and legislative branches at the State and federal\nlevels from as many as 35,000 candidates.\nOurs is one of the most diversified economies in the\nsouthern hemisphere. As we head toward economic\nstability, with a strong currency, conditions become\nfavourable for the resumption of a sustained process of\neconomic growth which will undoubtedly place Brazil\nonce again among the most dynamic economies in the\nworld.\nWe have made important advances in increasing the\nexposure of our economy to world trade. As of next\nJanuary, we will have brought into force a common\nexternal tariff, along with Argentina, Paraguay and\nUruguay, and will have consolidated a Customs Union\ncapable of generating growth and prosperity, one of the\nfirst customs unions among developing countries. The\ninterest expressed by other South American countries in\njoining MERCOSUR - Common Market of the South -\nprovides ample proof that the vision of a South American\nfree trade area is gradually materializing. These\naccomplishments represent a telling example of the\nenterprising capacity of Latin American nations, and\nconstitute a fundamental step toward a harmonious and\nintegrated South America.\nOur efforts in developing political and economic\ncooperation go well beyond Latin America. In line with\nthe universal inspiration of our diplomacy, we have set\nout to reinforce the ties that associate us to friendly\nnations in all regions of the globe, as well as to expand\ninto new and important political and commercial\npartnerships. Such actions range from the intensification\nof traditional relations within our hemisphere and with\nindustrialized countries to new and creative formulas for\ncooperating with countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle\nEast. In all cases, we have tried to raise the dialogue to\nincreasingly higher levels and, in many instances, have\nsucceeded in establishing dynamic and privileged\nrelationships.\nThe ties between Brazil and African nations have\nbeen strengthened through the action taken to give\nstructure to the community of Portuguese-speaking\ncountries. This new and important forum will unite our\nbrothers and sisters on different continents and lead to\neven greater understanding and cooperation.\nBeginning in the South Atlantic which we share, we\nintend to expand the horizons of cooperation between\nAmerica and Africa, with the added strength, in the\npolitical and moral spheres, brought about by the election\nof Nelson Mandela in the new South Africa.\n5\n\n\nThe zone of peace and cooperation of the South\nAtlantic will transform this area into a zone free of nuclear\nweapons, constituting an example of solidarity and\nbrotherhood between two continents. With this objective in\nmind, the 24 countries that make up this forum have just\nmet in Brasilia, with very encouraging results for friendship\nbetween Africa and South America.\nBrazil desires for itself what it desires for each and\nevery other nation. We know that there can be no\nhappiness and prosperity in the midst of strife and\nmisfortune. Together with the family of nations, Brazil,\nwhich does not countenance any form of hegemony, seeks\nto move forward in a spirit of confidence toward the\ncreation of a world order responsive to the aspirations for\ndemocracy, stability, disarmament and respect for the\nsovereignty of States and a world order committed to\ndevelopment.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my country and\nin my own behalf, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to the Presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. The fact\nthat you belong to our beloved continent, coming as you do\nfrom a country bound with my own by bonds of\nbrotherhood and relations of friendship and cooperation is\na source of added pride to us in your assumption of this\nhigh office. My delegation is confident that, familiar as\nyou are with the work of the United Nations, and with your\nextensive experience in the field of international relations,\nyou will be able to steer this session to a successful\nconclusion. I should also like to seize this opportunity to\nexpress my delegation\u2019s appreciation of your predecessor,\nHis Excellency Ambassador Insanally, for the wisdom he\ndisplayed, the efforts he made and the initiatives he took to\nreform the United Nations and enhance its role. Further, I\nwish to express our gratitude to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nthe Secretary-General, for his tireless efforts to strengthen\nour Organization so as to enable it to face the numerous\ncrises that beset the international community.\nThe international situation witnessed many\ndevelopments during the forty-eighth session. The will of\nthe people of South Africa has triumphed after a long\nstruggle and great sacrifices. It is indeed heartening to\nsee in our midst today the delegation of South Africa,\nrepresenting a united, democratic and non-racial country.\nBrotherly Yemen has survived its transient crisis and\nremains one united country, whose citizens are working\nwith more determination and greater expectations, to build\nthe modern State of Yemen. Along with these\ndevelopments, tangible progress has been recorded in the\nimplementation of the Peace Accord in Mozambique.\nMoreover, the artificial tension in the Korean peninsula is\nnow subsiding. We are hopeful that the difficulties\nrelating to the reunification of the Korean peninsula will\nbe overcome through dialogue to be entered into on equal\nfooting.\nSuch developments are a source of satisfaction and\nwe greatly welcome them. However, they do not mask\nthe gloomy points of the wider picture of the international\nsituation. Many disputes still await a solution. The\noutbursts of nationalist passions, ethnic chauvinism and\npower struggles in the absence of any power among the\npeople, have led to the outbreak of new regional conflicts.\nAlthough some of these conflicts are getting closer to a\nsolution, as is the case in Liberia, where the conflict is\nheading towards a permanent solution, the international\ncommunity must still support national reconciliation\nefforts in Afghanistan, overcome the setbacks to the peace\nefforts being undertaken in the Balkans, consolidate the\nrole of the United Nations in establishing peace in that\nregion and guarantee the legitimate rights of the parties to\nthe dispute there.\nThe international community is also called upon to\nrenew its efforts aimed at reaching a satisfactory solution\nto the problem of Cyprus. It must encourage peace talks\non Angola and support work towards a negotiated\nsolution in sisterly Somalia, in addition to demonstrating\nincreased solidarity to alleviate the tragedy of the\nRwandan people. It must also make more efforts to solve\nthe problem of Kashmir on the basis of bilateral\nagreements and the relevant United Nations resolutions in\nparticular.\nIn the interest of stability in the Persian Gulf region,\nmy country stresses the importance of the unity and\nterritorial integrity of Iraq, and calls for an end to all\ninterference in its internal affairs. We also consider that\nthe sanctions imposed on Iraq, which cause suffering to\nthe Iraqi people, should be lifted, since the reasons for\nthese sanctions are no longer valid. Their continuation\n9\n\n\ncan only mean a grave injustice aimed at the destruction of\nthe Iraqi people and the extermination of large groups of its\npopulation.\nThe United Nations has adopted many resolutions on\nthe Question of Palestine, all of which acknowledge the\nright of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland\nand to exercise the right of self-determination. Although\nthe United Nations has repeatedly reaffirmed these\nresolutions for more than 40 years, the Palestinian question\nstill awaits a solution, the Palestinian people remain\ndisplaced and their rights are systematically and\ncontinuously violated. This proves that the so-called\nongoing peace process lacks the elements necessary for any\ncomprehensive settlement. This also shows that the\nresolution of the Palestinian question and the establishment\nof comprehensive peace in the Middle East cannot be\nrealized merely by returning Gaza back to its status as a\nmunicipality and adding Jericho to it, but must rather come\nabout through the liberation of all occupied Arab territories\nincluding the Syrian Golan and the acceptance of a\ndemocratic solution that would meet all the rights of the\nPalestinian people, including their right to return to their\nhomeland and establish their own independent State.\nA few months ago, we celebrated the historic victory\nof the people of South Africa. It is no coincidence that the\nstruggle of the Palestinian people is in many ways similar\nto that of the people of South Africa, and that many of the\nacts of heroism of both peoples echo each other. The\nsolution that made it possible to build a united, democratic\nand non-racial state in South Africa offers a model for\nresolving the question of Palestine through the\nestablishment in Palestine of a democratic non-racial State\nwith Al Quds as its capital, where Arabs and Jews can live\ntogether. This is the proper solution, without which it\nwould be impossible to reach a just and lasting peace that\nserves the interests of both Jews and the Palestinian Arabs.\n\nThe numerous changes witnessed by the world after\nthe cold war have created opportunities to build a more\nstable and secure world. However, the hopes of the\npeoples of the world for greater and better understanding\nand for wider cooperation have started to wane. The\nexperience of the past few years has caused deep concern\nregarding some developments. Some States have begun to\ntry to impose their control and to expand their hegemony,\nusing their power and influence in utilizing international\norgans to implement their plans, and using them,\nparticularly the Security Council, as a tool to punish those\ncountries which abide by their principles and adopt\nindependent policies and positions. This was the very\ncontext of the dispute between my country and France,\nBritain and the United States of America in what has\nbecome known as the Lockerbie crisis. This problem was\nraised, pushed arbitrarily through the Security Council,\nand dealt with under Chapter VII of the Charter, which is\nnot applicable in this case since Libya has not threatened\nanybody and has never acted in a manner that jeopardized\ninternational peace and security. The whole issue is\nmerely the suspicion that two Libyans may be connected\nto the Pan Am flight 103 incident.\nAware as it has been all along of the motivation\nbehind this entire issue, my country has shown sincere\nreadiness to cooperate in uncovering the truth and\ncircumstances of that incident. We have taken the\nnecessary judicial measures consistent with the Charter of\nthe United Nations and international law, with only one\nproviso, that they do not involve any violation of Libya\u2019s\nsovereign rights.\nAlthough the Security Council was pushed into the\nadoption of resolution 731 (1992), Libya did declare its\nreadiness effectively to cooperate in the implementation\nof that resolution. In that respect Libya took practical\nsteps that were widely welcomed by numerous\norganizations, including the League of Arab States, the\nOrganization of African Unity, the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference, and the Non-Aligned Movement. It\nwas our hope that the three States concerned would take\nthat into consideration and respond positively to the\nrequests of Libyan authorities for cooperation in\ncompleting the investigation. However, the three States\nconcerned responded in an entirely different way. Instead\nof accepting the initiatives calling for dialogue and\nnegotiation, and showing flexibility in dealing with the\nother aspects of the crisis, by reconsidering Security\nCouncil resolution 748 (1992) with a view to lifting the\nsanctions imposed on the Libyan people, instead, they\nresorted to the Security Council once again and, using\ntheir influence, managed to persuade it to adopt resolution\n883 (1993), tightening the sanctions imposed by\nresolution 748 (1992).\nThe argument invoked by the three States concerned\nto justify maintaining the sanctions and the threat even to\ntighten them further, is that Libya has not complied with\nthe requirements of Security Council resolution 731\n(1992). And when these States are confronted with the\nfact that the Jamahiriya has really complied with these\n10\n\n\nrequirements, their officials, and particularly British and\nAmerican officials, answer with the words \\\"Libya knows\nwhat is required of her\\\". Officials in both countries have\nrepeatedly used this phrase to such an extent that we are\nconvinced that the aim behind the raising of the Lockerbie\nincident is not to uncover the truth and the circumstances\nof the issue but rather to achieve premeditated political\nobjectives. Indeed, if the aim had really been to bring\nLibya to comply with the requirements of resolution 731\n(1992), that aim has been fully realized. Libya has taken\nthe legal measures necessary to pinpoint responsibility for\nthe terrorist acts perpetrated against both American and\nFrench planes. Libya has requested the three States\nconcerned to cooperate in completing the investigation in\nthis respect. Libya has even invited neutral bodies to\nfollow it up and international and humanitarian\norganizations to monitor its fairness. My country has\ncooperated with the French judge in charge of the\ninvestigation aimed at determining responsibility for the\nexplosion aboard French UTA flight 772. Contacts in this\nrespect still continue. My country has also cooperated with\nthe Government of the United Kingdom in trying to\nuncover certain elements accused by the British\nGovernment of involvement in terrorist acts. To this end,\nseveral meetings were held between the Libyan and British\nsides. Today, we are very glad to see that negotiations\nhave already started between Britain and the political and\nmilitary wings of the Irish Republic Army (IRA) and that\nan agreement has been signed by the two parties. Now the\nleaders of the IRA are being received and welcomed at the\nhighest level in both London and Washington with a view\nto holding negotiations with a view to ending the dispute\nand all its side effects.\nLibya has condemned international terrorism in all its\nforms and declared its readiness to commit itself to\nwhatever measures are adopted by the international\ncommunity to combat this scourge. Libya has also severed\nall its relations with all groups and organizations suspected\nof being involved in terrorist acts. Libya has emphasized\nthat it will not allow its territory, citizens or institutions to\nbe used for such acts whether directly or indirectly. We\nhave declared our readiness to punish severely whoever is\nproved to be involved in any terrorist acts. Libya has also\ndeclared that there are no terrorist training camps on its\nsoil. It has repeated its invitation to the Security Council,\nor any international body mandated by the Council, to\nverify this. All these practical measures confirm the extent\nof my country\u2019s seriousness in stamping out the\nphenomenon of international terrorism. This seriousness\nhas been reflected in the call by the Jamahiriya for the\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly to\nbe devoted to the study of the causes and dimensions of\nthis problem and its support of the proposal to convene an\ninternational conference to define terrorism, including\nState terrorism, and the means to eradicate it in all its\nforms. It is State terrorism with which Libya is now\nbeing threatened at the hands of a State which is a\npermanent member of the Security Council. That State\nhas abducted Libyan prisoners of war from Chad and is\nnow training them and equipping them to undermine the\nsecurity and stability of Libya. This is the same terrorism\nto which Libya fell victim in 1973 when Israeli planes\nintentionally shot down a Libyan civilian airliner, killing\nall 108 passengers aboard; and also when the United\nStates of America in 1986 bombed Libyan cities while\npeople were asleep in their beds and caused great loss of\nlife and damage to property. Later it was revealed that\nthe acts used by that State as a pretext for its aggression\nwere unfounded.\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has spared no effort in\ntrying to resolve the dispute, including trying the two\nsuspects in the Pan Am flight 103 incident, although the\nmatter has been predetermined by the 1971 Montreal\nConvention which gives Libya the right to try the two\nsuspects itself. However, the refusal by Britain and the\nUnited States of America to abide by this Convention, to\nwhich they are both parties, has prompted Libya to seek\nother ways of holding the trial. Thus, Libya offered to\nresort to the International Court of Justice or to surrender\nthe two suspects to the United Nations office in Libya for\ninvestigation. Libya has also proposed that the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations should establish a fact-\nfinding legal commission to verify the seriousness of the\naccusations, including carrying out a comprehensive\ninvestigation. Competent Libyan authorities referred the\nmatter to the basic popular congresses which constitute\nour legislative authority and they in turn made the\ndecision that they had no objection to letting the two\nsuspects stand trial before a fair tribunal to be agreed\nupon. Proceeding from this, my country declared its\nreadiness to enter into negotiations with the States\nconcerned under the supervision of the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations on the trial to be held in a place\nagreed to by all parties concerned where full guarantees\nwould be available to establish the truth, indeed the very\naim of Security Council resolution 731 (1992).\nRecently, new information on the American aircraft\nincident has been uncovered, including a book entitled\nTracking the Octopus by Coleman and Donald and the\nstatements by the manager of a Swiss electronics\ncompany. These new revelations obliterate the central\n11\n\n\nelement on which the accusations against the two Libyan\ncitizens was based. Despite all this, Libya maintained its\ncooperation in trying to identify all the circumstances\nsurrounding the incident. On this basis, Libya accepted the\nproposal of the Council of the League of Arab States\ncontained in its resolution 5373 of 27 March 1994. That\nproposal called for trying the two suspects by Scottish\njudges under Scottish law at the seat of the International\nCourt of Justice. Even after new information was revealed\nby the Palestinian citizen, Yousef Shaaban, before a\nLebanese Court, Libya did not hesitate to go ahead with the\ntrial and did not waver in its declared readiness to accept\nany verdict emanating from such a trial.\nThis, once again, underlines the fact that the Libyan\nJamahiriya has no objection to the trial of the two suspects.\nAll that Libya wants is for the trial to be fair and just, free\nfrom any emotional or media influences, and with the\navailability of all guarantees consistent with the norms of\nlegality and international law, which Libya has observed\nand applied. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) can\ntestify to this, since that Court has considered, over the past\n10 years, three cases to which Libya was a party. The ICJ\ndecided the case relating to the continental shelf between\nLibya and Tunisia, and both parties fully implemented the\nruling of the Court. The same happened in the case of the\ncontinental shelf between Libya and Malta; once again the\ntwo parties implemented the ruling of the International\nCourt of Justice. This year, the Court decided the territorial\ndispute between the Jamahiriya and Chad. Though the\nruling rejected Libya\u2019s demands, the Jamahiriya did\nimplement it in a constructive spirit that was welcomed and\nappreciated by both the Security Council and the Secretary-\nGeneral. This shows the extent of my country\u2019s\ncommitment to and respect of international legality,\nsomething that great powers pay lip service to but never\napply. These States refuse even to appear before the ICJ,\nsince they believe in the legality of force and not the force\nof legality.\nMost international and regional organizations have\nrenewed their appeal to the three States to accept the\ninitiatives calling for dialogue and negotiation, with a view\nto reaching a peaceful settlement to the crises. Those\norganizations, including the 11th Ministerial Conference of\nthe States Members of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\n60th Session of the Council of Ministers of the\nOrganization of African Unity, welcomed Libya\u2019s\nacceptance of the Arab League\u2019s proposal. This august\nAssembly, which includes all States represented in those\norganizations, is now called upon to show its appreciation\nof Libya\u2019s position, Libya\u2019s steps and initiatives and the\nproposals that we have accepted. It should call on the\nthree States concerned to show flexibility and enter into\ndialogue with the Jamahiriya with the aim of reaching a\npeaceful settlement to this problem. This Assembly is\nalso called upon to express its support of these demands,\nso that the Security Council will reconsider its resolutions\non the crisis and lift the unjust sanctions. It is absurd and\nignorant to depict the sanctions as being against the\nLibyan Government, because in Libya there is no\nGovernment as such. The power is in the hands of the\npeople, who now suffer the consequences of these\nsanctions - for example, the crash of a Libyan civilian\naircraft in 1992, leading to the death of all 157 civilians\naboard, as a result of the ban on spare parts.\nFurthermore, 1,622 people have been killed in car\naccidents, and 350 people, most of whom were children,\nold men and women died as a result of delays in moving\nthem abroad for medical treatment. These sanctions have\nalso caused economic damage estimated at $4.5 billion.\nThese damages are detailed in official document\nS/1994/921.\nBefore the Second World War, and following the\nend of that war, the Libyan people suffered and continue\nto suffer all sorts of pressure, troubles and pains. We\nhave been subjected to colonialism in its worst form: a\nFascism that wreaked havoc in our country, killing,\ndisplacing and exiling countless numbers of our citizens.\nAgainst our will, we had to be a theatre of war between\nthe colonial powers, a war that was fought on our soil\nand for which we were the fuel. That war\u2019s mines are\nstill buried in our soil, in our farms and under our homes.\nFrom time to time, these mines explode and kill innocent\npeople. In previous sessions of this Assembly, my\ncountry has repeatedly called on the States concerned to\ncooperate with us in removing these mines. Today,\n7 October, coincides with the commemoration of the\nLibyan people of the 25th anniversary of the evacuation\nof the last Fascists who had settled in Libya and\noppressed its people. Once again I repeat my call and\nurge the States concerned to respond positively to the\nresolutions of the General Assembly, instructing them to\nprovide the necessary information on mines, give\ntechnical assistance in removing them, and pay\ncompensation for the losses they have caused. This may\nalso be a good opportunity to remind the imperialist states\nthat occupied our lands for over 40 years that we have\nnot forgotten the ruin and destruction they left behind.\nI should also like to announce that my country,\nthrough this Assembly and other forums, will seek to\ncompel colonialist states to pay fair compensation for the\n12\n\n\nresources they have looted and the wealth and money they\nhave plundered from our country. The peoples of the world\nare called upon to adopt a historic resolution, through this\nOrganization, condemning colonialism and forcing former\ncolonial powers to compensate their former colonies, in\norder to prevent the re-emergence of colonialism and\nprevent the powerful from once more blackmailing and\noppressing the weak.\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya welcomes efforts aimed\nat enhancing security and cooperation in the Mediterranean\nregion. We voice our satisfaction with the initiatives whose\nobjective is to enhance economic, social, cultural and\nenvironmental cooperation in the region. Libya calls for\ntaking all measures necessary to remove all causes of\ntension in the area, especially through the withdrawal of\nforeign military fleets whose continued presence jeopardizes\npeace and security in the Mediterranean, which in turn are\nclosely linked to international peace and security. The\nArab Maghreb Union has achieved tangible progress on the\nroad towards economic integration among its countries and\ntowards the consolidation of the underpinnings of\ndevelopment in these countries. It has also opened new\nchannels of cooperation with organizations in the areas to\nwhich we belong both geographically and culturally. Libya\nwelcomes those steps and expresses the hope that the\nMaghreb Union will succeed in playing a similar role with\nits counterpart organizations on the other side of the\nMediterranean, beginning with the intensification of\ncontacts and meetings, as well as active dialogue with the\ninstitutions concerned, on a basis of equality and common\ninterests in a manner capable of responding to the concept\nof joint development and the collective responsibility for\nmaintaining peace and strengthening cooperation on the\nshores of the Mediterranean.\nIn view of the stability of the political system in the\nJamahiriya and its importance as an economic market, it\nwould be impossible to marginalize or ignore its role in any\ncooperation between the shores of the Mediterranean if\nsuch cooperation is achieve its objectives, at the forefront\nof which is serving the peoples of the region and achieving\ntheir prosperity.\nSome progress has been registered recently in the field\nof disarmament. This is a welcome development. Libya\nlooks forward to more international cooperation with a view\nto destroying nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as\nwell as other weapons of mass destruction. We look\nforward to the banning of the development, stockpiling and\nuse of all such weapons. My country also hopes that more\nefforts will be made to conclude a treaty on making Africa\na nuclear-weapon-free zone and the activation of the\ninitiative aimed at making the Middle East region free\nfrom weapons of mass destruction. The Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya is a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation\nTreaty. We hope that the preparatory committee for the\n1995 review conference will, in its next session, reach an\nunderstanding that takes into consideration the concerns\nof all parties to the Treaty, especially as regards its\nextension. My country still has some difficulty in\naccepting an indefinite extension of the Treaty, because\nsuch an extension does not take into account several of\nour concerns, including the unavailability of credible\nsecurity guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon states.\nFurthermore, the area in which we live suffers from a\nsecurity imbalance, resulting from Israel\u2019s acquisition of\nnuclear weapons and its non-adherence to the\nnon-proliferation regime. It has not acceded to the\nTreaty, nor has it signed a safeguard agreement with the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That is\nwhy my country would like to emphasize that it is\nessential to address these concerns at the time of\nconsidering the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty\nin 1995.\nRespect for and protection of human rights is one of\nthe fundamental underpinnings of Libyan policy. This\nhas been demonstrated in various forms which included\nthe setting up of the International Committee for the\nQaddafi Human Rights Prize and the adoption of the\ngreen document on human rights and basic human\nfreedoms. Libya is determined to support and contribute\nto all international efforts aimed at guaranteeing the\neffective enjoyment of human rights. We thus welcome\nthe conclusions of the Vienna Conference, which\nconstitute a step on the road to the support and\nenhancement of human rights. That human rights\nConference rejected the manipulation of human rights and\ntheir use as a tool of political pressure. This universally\nadopted principle must be respected, especially by States\nthat selectively raise problems related to human rights.\nThe international community must stand up to any\nattempt by any State or group of States to exploit human\nrights as a means of interfering in the internal affairs of\nother States. It must also oppose any attempt by any\nState or group of States to distort the principles and\nvalues of other peoples or to promote the principles and\nvalues of such States or groups of States as the only\nproper values that should be embraced by all peoples.\nThe international community\u2019s hopes for a secure\nand stable world cannot be realized without addressing\neconomic problems, particularly in the developing\n13\n\n\ncountries, where economies continue to face difficulties as\na result of the aggravation of the problem of external debts,\nthe application of protectionist trade policies, the imposition\nof harsh conditions for their importation of advanced\ntechnology, the deteriorating prices of raw materials and the\ncontinued attempts to impose new taxes, such as the carbon\ntax, which could hurt not only the economies of the oil-\nexporting States but also those of oil-importing countries.\nWe believe it is impossible to solve these problems\neffectively unless the international community deals\nseriously with and puts an end to the erroneous practices\nthat continue to characterize international economic\nrelations. Such practices include coercive economic\nmeasures, such as the freezing of assets and the\nconfiscation by certain developing countries of the property\nof a number of developing countries, including my own.\nSuch measures constitute an impediment to growth, aside\nfrom the fact that they run counter to the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, norms of international law and the\nresolutions of the General Assembly.\nThe General Assembly is the natural place for\nMember States to exercise their rights and express their\nviews on the initiatives aimed at reforming the United\nNations. In the course of the last session, we followed with\nkeen interest everything that was achieved in this regard.\nMy country expresses its satisfaction at the progress made\ntowards revitalizing the activities of the General Assembly\nand the establishment of an effective working relationship\nbetween the Assembly and the Security Council. We hope\nfuture efforts will result in an increase in the membership\nof the Security Council based on equitable geographical\ndistribution. To our mind, this process must be\naccompanied by measures to remove obstacles to the proper\nfunctioning of the Council, such as the privilege of veto\npower, and improvements in its working methods so that it\ncan function in accordance with the principles of the\nCharter and, eschewing double standards, deal consistently\nwith all issues.\nIf we examine past Security Council practices we shall\nfind that while the Council showed interest in trying to\nsecure commitment to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\nit has turned and continues to turn a blind eye to Israel,\nwhich has not acceded to the Treaty and actually possesses\n200 nuclear warheads. Furthermore, the Security Council\nhas insisted on invoking Chapter VII of the Charter in cases\nto which it is not applicable, while at the same time failing\nto invoke Chapter VII in the case of Israel, despite its\ndefiance of United Nations resolutions and its continued\noccupation of the territories of States Members of the\nUnited Nations. The Council kept silent on the Israeli\nrefusal to withdraw from southern Lebanon and on the\nmassacres perpetrated against the Palestinians, such as the\none in Hebron\u2019s Al-Haram Al-Ibrahimi Al-Sharif - the\nMosque of Abraham - where, in an act of terrorism, a\nfanatical Zionist settler, trained in an American camp,\nkilled over 50 Palestinians while they were praying.\nMy country believes that, in the context of reforming\nthe Security Council, the Council must be neutral and\ngive none of its members a chance to dominate it or steer\nit towards serving its own interests, as has been the case\nin so many instances, the latest of which was the\nCouncil\u2019s granting of permission to one of its permanent\nmembers to invade an independent State Member of the\nUnited Nations, the Republic of Haiti. It has been said\nthat the objective of that action was to restore democracy\nand protect human rights. If this were true, why was\nthere no such action in the past, when the people of that\ncountry were suffering under the yoke of a repressive\nregime, subjected to the most vicious violations of their\nhuman rights? What happened was a flagrant violation of\nthe Charter, an act of aggression against the inviolability\nof an independent country. It also establishes the\ndangerous precedent of giving permission to a State,\nunhappy about waves of immigrants reaching its shores,\nto occupy the land where the immigration originates.\nLibya cannot afford to overlook this invasion or\nkeep silent about it, first, as a matter of principle and,\nsecondly, because Haiti has a special place in our history.\nForty-five years ago Haiti played a decisive role in a\nmatter of interest to us. Its deciding vote won the\nadoption of the General Assembly resolution on Libya\u2019s\nindependence.\nAt this time next year, the celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations will begin. While\ndevelopments in recent years have revealed some\nweaknesses in some of the United Nations organs\u2019\nhandling of dispute settlement and crisis management, this\ncannot be attributed to the Charter but, rather, to the\ntendency by certain Powers, insisting that their approach\nalone should be adopted, to impose their hegemony on the\nhandling of international matters.\nThis question should be the focus of attention in the\nnext session because it will mark the demise of the old\norder and the building of the new order that will replace\nit. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya intends to participate\nwith others in building this new order to ensure that it\nwill be an order based on justice and equality that\nrespects peoples\u2019 political and economic options, secures\n14\n\n\nfull commitment to international law and full respect for the\nCharter of the United Nations and stands up to those who\nwould push the United Nations towards the fate of the\nLeague of Nations. The new order we need is one that\nenhances and protects human rights and eradicates poverty,\nsuffering, division, conflicts, disputes and wars. It must be\nan order in which no State seeks to impose its hegemony\nand abuse its influence, an order that supports the\nsettlement of disputes among States by peaceful means, not\nby arbitrary and coercive means. We need a new order\nunder whose umbrella all peoples can look optimistically to\na future where security, peace and stability prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first to extend to\nAmbassador Amara Essy heartfelt congratulations on his\nunanimous election to preside over the forty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly. His election is a fitting tribute\nboth to him and to his country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. While\nexpressing our confidence in his skills and capacity to guide\nthis session to a successful conclusion, I wish to assure him\nof the full cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of\nthe heavy responsibility he has assumed.\nI wish also to join the heads of delegations who spoke\nbefore me in the very pleasant task of welcoming the new\ndemocratic South Africa into the United Nations. The\nrecent happy events in South Africa mark a turning point in\nthe history of Africa. They have opened up new vistas for\nfruitful economic cooperation across the African continent\nand have allowed the international community to be\nvictorious over institutional racism.\nIt has now been a few years since the international\ncommunity entered into a new era that is relatively free\nof ideological polarization. The nuclear confrontation that\nhad haunted the international community before the end\nof the cold war is now more or less behind us. The\ndemise of the cold war has in this regard contributed to\nthe lifting of the thick veil that had hindered the\nappreciation of our interdependence. None of the major\nproblems of the present world can be effectively dealt\nwith in the absence of an approach that takes seriously\nthe fact that we live in an interdependent world. The\nchallenges of the environment, the problems of climate\nchange, the unrestrained growth in population and\nquestions of economic growth and development, among\nothers, are all issues that call for greater cooperation\nbetween States.\nIt is not too early for us to assess to what extent the\ninternational community has taken advantage of new\nopportunities and, with the major obstacles to joint action\nhaving now been removed, how much progress the world\nhas made in addressing the critical problems facing us.\nSome of these ostensibly affect only part of humanity,\nbut, in fact, are directly or indirectly the problems of the\ninternational community as a whole.\nThe ever-deteriorating economic and social\nconditions faced by the majority of the peoples in the\ndeveloping world and the abject poverty in which they are\ncondemned to live are the most critical challenge facing\nthe world. The effects of this reality reverberate through\nall aspects of international life, and they impinge on all\nissues now routinely accepted as the common challenges\nof the international community. Actions designed to deal\nwith concerns related to international peace and security,\nto the environment, to climate change, to population\ngrowth and development and to a host of other\ninterrelated concerns will remain only off-target and, at\nbest, partial measures if most of the developing world is\nallowed to continue to wallow in poverty, and if, as a\nconsequence, despair and hopelessness continue to be the\ndominant mood of present and future generations in the\nSouth.\nIn Africa, for instance, where a genuine fear of\nmarginalization in international economic cooperation has\nin recent years become the prevailing mood, much of the\nexplanation for the scale, intensity and duration of the\nconflicts must be sought in the continent\u2019s continuing\neconomic decline and in the consequent social malaise\nand hopelessness generated by that sad reality. The\neconomic history of Africa over the last two decades is\n21\n\n\none of precipitate decline. The 1980s was a lost decade,\nbut the first half of the present one is proving to be no\nbetter.\nEach African conflict may have its own unique local\nas well as extra-local features, but all of them, in one way\nor another, grow out of the humanly impossible economic\nand social situations that provide societies with neither hope\nnor a future.\nFrom Liberia to Somalia and from Rwanda to\nBurundi, what Africa has been witnessing in recent years is\nthe virtual collapse, under the weight of unbearable\neconomic and social difficulties, not only of State structures\nbut also of traditional values and norms of social\norganization.\nIt seems therefore overdue for the United Nations,\nwhen it comes to addressing conflict situations such as\nthose in Africa, to think and to act with the clear\nassumption that traditional notions of preventive diplomacy,\npeace-keeping and peace-making, although important, are\nnot enough to maintain the peace and to make it durable.\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" will be far from sufficient if it doe\nnot go side by side with, and made an integral part of, \\\"An\nAgenda for Development\\\".\nIn our part of the world, the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) took up a huge challenge when it decided to\nincrease its capacity by setting up a mechanism for the\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts. This\nis an important step that requires the effective assistance of\nthe international community, and we are appreciative of the\nsupport already being given to the OAU by some countries.\nBut we have no illusions: even if the OAU had the\ncapacity required to carry out its mandate in preventive\ndiplomacy, it would not necessarily be able to make\nsubstantial inroads in ensuring durable peace in the\ncontinent.\nNor can the United Nations and the international\ncommunity do any better unless the challenges faced in\nconnection with preventive measures in the economic and\nsocial areas are taken up in the most serious manner and\nunless the economic and social decline of Africa is\nreversed. The bottom line is that no African country can\ncategorically be said to be immune from the political and\nsocial consequences of the immense level of economic\ndecline, which can be arrested only with the requisite level\nof international economic cooperation and development\npartnership. This, incidentally, could also be a way to\narrest and contain all varieties of extremism.\nIt seems to us that it is only with the foregoing in\nmind and with the full appreciation of the very complex\nnature of some of the conflict situations in Africa that the\nUnited Nations can be an effective factor for peace in\nAfrica. This approach would also allow the international\ncommunity to appreciate fully actual movement, no\nmatter how small, in the right direction towards the\nresolution of specific conflict situations in Africa. The\nvalidity of this is most clearly to be seen in the prevailing\nsituation in Somalia.\nMore than a few still view the situation in Somalia\nas having shown no improvement and believe that\nconditions in that country have in fact deteriorated. That\nview is probably the major reason for the increasing calls\nfor the speedy withdrawal of the United Nations\nOperation in Somalia (UNOSOM) from Somalia. That\nview is also certainly behind the latest Security Council\nresolution on Somalia.\nThe situation in Somalia, and most particularly in\nsome parts of that country, is clearly still far from\nnormal, and there is no question that the overall situation\nin the country is very fluid. The international\ncommunity\u2019s frustration at the slow pace of the national-\nreconciliation process and at the lack of sufficient\ncommitment by all sides in Somalia to their responsibility\nto sort out their own problems as speedily as possible is\nalso understandable, and this is also our concern.\nBut the feeling that conditions in the country have\nbecome hopeless and that the general trend in Somalia\nholds no promise is not born of what has been taking\nplace there since late last year. That the situation in\nSomalia today, from the point of view both of the level\nof armed clashes and of dialogue between Somalis of all\nfactions, is far better than it was a year ago, or indeed a\nfew months ago, cannot seriously be doubted.\nNo one can pretend to have a ready-made solution\nto the problem of power-sharing in Somalia, which has\nbeen one of the major hurdles preventing national\nreconciliation. The OAU and the countries of the\nsubregion have continued to do everything possible to\nassist the Somalis to meet this challenge, firmly\nconvinced that the agenda for peace and national\nreconciliation in the country should be set by Somalis\nthemselves and that the role of extra-Somali parties,\nincluding that of UNOSOM, is to assist in the process.\nWe believe that this has been a very fruitful approach. It\nis the one that has been adopted from the very beginning\nby President Meles Zenawi, whose OAU colleagues have\n22\n\n\ngiven him the responsibility of following developments in\nSomalia.\nFrom his station in Mogadishu, President Meles\u2019s\nenvoy has been maintaining very close contact with the\nvarious Somali factions. Our general assessment is that the\ntrends in Somalia are encouraging and that the Somalis are\ntaking the first hesitant steps to sort out their problems.\nAlthough there is no guarantee of success, the general\nthrust of developments in Somalia is worthy of the support\nof the international community.\nAt this time last year UNOSOM was engaged in heavy\ncombat with some Somali factions, and its presence in\nSomalia did not enjoy universal acceptance there. Today,\nthe situation has changed so dramatically that there is\nconsensus in the country that UNOSOM should stay, one\nway or another, until national reconciliation is achieved. It\nwould indeed be ironic if the international community were\nto choose to ignore Somalia precisely when the situation is\nchanging for the better.\nThe efforts of the countries of the Horn of Africa in\nthe search for solutions to situations of conflicts have not\nbeen limited to Somalia. It is little more than a year since\nwe in the subregion deployed the initiative of the Inter-\nGovernmental Authority on Drought and Development\n(IGADD) with a view to assisting in the resolution of the\nlong-standing conflict in the Sudan - a conflict which has\ncreated a deep rift in Sudanese society, and whose\nimplications for peace and security, as well as for the social\nand economic development of our region, are very great\nindeed.\nIn the course of the negotiations, the IGADD\nCommittee\u2019s major goal was to help the parties to identify\nand address the central issues that have been the sources of\nthe conflict in the Sudan - a country characterized by\nreligious, ethnic and racial diversity. Pursuant to\ninstructions from our Heads of State, the IGADD\nCommittee of Foreign Ministers attempted, in a series of\nrounds of negotiation, to help the parties to narrow their\ndifferences over the root causes of the conflict and to arrive\nat a formula for overcoming the deep crisis affecting their\ncountries. Because the IGADD process induced the parties\nto focus on the critical issues in the conflict, positions have\nbecome well defined. The degree of polarity reflected in\nthese positions reveals the gravity of the root causes and\nexplains why the talks have come to deadlock. Thus, the\nIGADD peace process is at a crossroads in that the\npositions of the parties have hardened, and the mediators\nare left to choose between abandoning their efforts and\ndeveloping alternative strategies in response to the crisis.\nFaced with this situation, the Ministerial Committee\nwas compelled ultimately to refer the matter back to the\nIGADD Committee of Heads of State, which met recently\nin Nairobi. The Heads of State, while recognizing the\nlogjam that has been created in the process of negotiation,\nhave none the less unanimously decided that there is no\nalternative to continuing with the peace effort. The major\nconsideration here has been the conviction of the Heads\nof State that a persisting crisis in the Sudan would be not\nonly a cause of continuing bloodshed in that country but\nalso a major source of instability and lack of peace in the\nsubregion.\nIn this regard, the importance of the international\ncommunity\u2019s input towards breaking the logjam in the\nIGADD peace initiative in the Sudan can hardly be\nunderestimated. A solution to the problem can come only\nthrough the continued efforts of the countries of the\nregion and the international community\u2019s support for\nthose efforts.\nWe in Ethiopia have had more than our share of the\ntragedies associated with conflicts. It is three years since\npeace was restored to the country following three decades\nof civil war and internal strife. Over the past three years\nthe Transitional Government has focused its attention on\nthree broad concerns - the restoration of peace and\nstability; the democratization of the political process,\nincluding the creation of conditions for enforcing the rule\nof law and setting up democratic institutions; and the\nliberalization of the economy and the freeing of the\neconomic sector from the strait-jacket of the command\neconomy imposed on our peoples by the military\nGovernment.\nOne of the unique aspects of the democratization\nprocess in Ethiopia has been the very extensive\ndevolution of power to all regions of the country. In a\ncountry known for its excessive centralization of power -\nsomething that was pushed to absurdity by the previous\nGovernment: the major reason for the absence of peace\nin Ethiopia for so long - the new relationship between the\ncentre and the regions is becoming a promising\narrangement for genuine and meaningful participation of\nthe people, at the grass-roots level, in the political process\nof their country. We believe that once democracy\nbecomes relevant to the average person and at the grass\nroots, it will prove to be durable because the struggle\nbetween autocracy and democratic forms of governance\n23\n\n\nwill not then be between very narrow, elite groups, whether\nfrom the military or from other sectors of society.\nAs we approach the end of the period of transition in\nEthiopia, we can say with full confidence that we have, by\nand large, achieved all the major objectives set for that\nperiod. Until three years ago Ethiopia\u2019s name was\nassociated with political instability and civil war. Today\nEthiopia has not only achieved peace but also become a\nfactor for peace in its own subregion and beyond, as is\nvividly demonstrated by the Ethiopian peace-keeping\ncontingent in Rwanda.\nMoreover, we have been gratified by the recent\nsuccessful elections for a Constituent Assembly, which will\nbe convened very soon to prepare a constitution on the\nbasis of which a general election will be held to install the\nfirst-ever democratically elected Government in the country.\nIn the course of the last three years, we in Ethiopia\nhave benefited immensely from the generous assistance of\nthe international community, for which we are very\ngrateful. This assistance was again demonstrated during the\nrecent drought, which affected over 7 million people.\nThanks to the assistance of the international community, to\nthe role the Ethiopian people themselves played and to the\ntimely, effective measures taken by the Government, the\neffects of a drought that could have caused massive loss of\nlife, dislocation and displacement commensurate with those\nof the 1984-1985 drought were successfully contained.\nEven though Ethiopia has now started to stand on its\nown feet, we cannot pretend that we have even remotely\nbegun to address the major challenges still facing us. The\nfledgling democratic process in a country with no\ndemocratic traditions will continue to be a major challenge.\nBut the political will to solidify grass-roots democracy will\nalways be there, among other things because the survival of\ncountries as diverse as Ethiopia can be ensured only on the\nbasis of democratic governance. However, the linchpin of\nthe success of democracy in Ethiopia, as is also true for all\nsimilarly situated countries, is sustainable economic growth\nand development. Citizens who see no future for\nthemselves or for their offspring can hardly be counted on\n- and for understandable reasons - to be a bedrock for\nstable Governments, without which democracy will have\nlittle chance of flourishing.\nNone the less, even in the economic sector we have\nmade some notable gains, and our cooperation with the\ninternational financial institutions has so far been very\nencouraging. But the challenges ahead of us are immense,\nand we will continue to count on the support of the\ninternational community to help us put our country firmly\non the path of sustainable growth and development.\nOne of the major positive outcomes of the demise of\nthe cold war has been the new confidence placed in\nmultilateral approaches to solving the major problems\nfaced by our interdependent world. The United Nations,\nas the finest expression of multilateralism, has thus been\ngiven a new opportunity to make a difference in the\nworld and to spearhead the efforts of the international\ncommunity for peace and development. In this context,\nthe democratization of the United Nations at all levels,\nand greater transparency in the operation of the organs of\nthe Organization, including that of the Security Council\nand of the Secretariat, are some of the required steps\nwhich will guarantee that the United Nations can play to\nthe fullest its potential appropriate role as the foremost\nmultilateral organization with the full confidence of\npeoples in the North as well as in the South. For our\npart, we will continue to do our share, and do all that is\nnecessary to assist the United Nations in achieving its\nnoble objectives and goals.\n"

While its political\neffectiveness may not have met all the requirements of\npeace because of the structure of world power that had\nprevailed since 1945, it did achieve overwhelming success\nin the actions and programmes of its specialized agencies.\nBorn to foster peace and security and to promote\ndevelopment, the United Nations was the fruit of the post-\nSecond-World-War era. At that time peace meant the\nabsence of war and of the justifiable fear of world-wide\nself-destruction.\nThe hope for a renewed international order based on\nnew values has gained momentum. Unique and\nmonumentaL events symbolized by the razing of the \\\"wall\nof infamy\\\" have created the propitious conditions and\nopportunities for recapturing and relaunching the lofty\ngoals of the signers of the San Francisco Charter.\nThose events summon us to struggle for a world\nbuilt on solidarity, respect for the self-determination of\npeoples, and the quest for a better standard of living for\nall.\nA new world and its agonizing challenges require\nnew answers and clear and unambiguous objectives\ncombined with an iron will to achieve them. The human\nbeing must be at the centre of all concerns. Our efforts\nmust thus be aimed at combating poverty and achieving\nsocial justice. We must foster new democratic ways for\nthe exercise of power and genuine respect for human\nrights. In other words, we must ensure that democracy\nworks, prospers and prevails.\nUnquestionably, the present-day world is beset by\neconomic and political complexities incompatible with the\naspirations of people everywhere to a decent life.\nGlobalization of the economy, intense financial\ncompetition, national cultural diversity, and the various\ntensions between groups, countries and regions, typified\nby the ethnic and religious regional conflicts of recent\nyears, constitute the features of the new reality.\nThe answers to these challenges and problems are no\nlonger to be found in the use of arms. They lie in the\nwill to build a consensus and in the ability to promote\ndevelopment through fair competition regulated by rules\nthat are accepted by all participants.\nUnless world peace is at stake, the threat or use of\nforce is no longer a viable instrument for achieving the\ndecent life to which all peoples are entitled.\n11\n\n\nHow, then, can we defend democracy and ensure that,\nrather than perish, it becomes stronger and more effective\nin dealing with starvation, unemployment, drug trafficking,\nthe depletion of natural resources, forced migration and the\nnew forms of trade protectionism that undermine\ndevelopment?\nIf, indeed, we are to protect human rights and\nstrengthen democracy, we must undertake a thorough\nreview of this whole issue and of the very concept of\ndevelopment on the basis of equitable access to markets,\ncapital and new technologies.\nThe Dominican Republic is one of the most solid and\ndeeply rooted democracies on the American continent. It\nis one of the few Latin American democracies in modern\ntimes with a record of lasting and commendable political\nstability. It is an example of harmonious and civilized\ncoexistence in a society marked by contrasts. We have\nshown to the world that our democracy is participatory,\nwith reconciliation and dialogue as the channels for the\nsolution of the major political and economic crises that we\nhave experienced.\nIn the economic arena, global interdependence poses\nchallenges, and yet offers opportunities. We must therefore\nmake progress in harmonizing financial, technological and\nproduction policies in order to achieve growth at all levels.\nThe development of the most industrialized nations\nmay be inadequate without the growth of developing\nnations. The greatest growth in outlets for the commodities\nof industrialized countries will be found in the markets of\ndeveloping countries.\nWe are witnessing a transition towards trade\nliberalization that can lead to freer trade and the eradication\nof poverty through the creation of more and better jobs.\nHowever, certain threats appear on the horizon. One\nof them is neoprotectionism. Even though the \\\"barbed-\nwire\\\" hostility of former protectionist tariffs is being\ndismantled, the re-emerging protectionism may not be based\non tariffs, but it conceals certain invisible, yet genuine\nenemies: environmental regulations, customs barriers,\nquotas, anti-\\\"dumping\\\" rules, social clauses and others. In\nthis way the aspirations to free trade may become mere\nrhetoric.\nImpoverishment is another threat. Are we fully aware\nthat opening up our economies can cause us to overlook the\nneed to properly administer their attendant social costs?\nUnemployment and the acceleration of social\ninvestment plans threaten to negate the efforts we have\nmade over many years to democratize our political\nsystems. While the formation of economic blocs is an\nestablished fact, it gives us pause nevertheless: To what\nextent might this phenomenon constitute a stumbling\nblock for a world based on the democratic rules of free\ntrade and on equal conditions for all?\nAs members know, more emphasis is placed on\nselling than on producing. However, we do not have\nadequate means of production or fair access to them; yet\nwe are supposed to compete on an equal basis with the\nmore industrialized countries of the world. These are not\ninvalid complaints and claims. New rules must be\nworked out to permit developing countries to gain access\nto technology and finance their infrastructures on\nfavourable terms - in other words, to attain practical and\nacceptable levels of competitiveness.\nHow can we meet these new challenges? To begin\nwith, any development policy must attempt to modernize\nour sources of production. If we have little or nothing to\nsell, what is the point of continuing to open up our\nmarkets? This is closely linked to the development of a\nproper transport and communication infrastructure and to\nthe optimum use of energy sources.\nWe must thus create new conditions of productivity,\nparticularly in the fields of technology social\ndevelopment. If human beings are to be the focus of all\ndevelopment policy, the fostering of effective programmes\nbecomes the best possible business. An investment in\nhealth, education and housing is profitable not only\nsocially but economically.\nAll these initiatives and actions to meet the new\nchallenges that stem from the globalization of the\neconomy must be viewed in that context. Therefore we\nneed a new kind of cooperation, which must be the\nkeynote of international activities. Among other things,\nwe must adjust national policies to global objectives. We\nshould be able to achieve a new idea of cooperation.\nCooperation is the alternative to intervention, the way to\nfulfil the international community\u2019s desires for peace,\nstability and democracy.\nIn this new age, we must be keenly aware of the\ntrends that are shaping the end of this century and the\nbeginning of the next. The world is becoming smaller,\nmore interdependent and globalized; the survival of\nhuman life is gravely threatened by the deterioration of\n12\n\n\nthe environment and by short-sighted, uncoordinated\npolicies to stem the tide of problems besetting the planet.\nWe in the Dominican Republic, have our share of\nproblems, but one stands out: we live geographically next\ndoor to the poorest nation of the hemisphere. Haiti has\nwritten glorious pages in the history of the struggle for\nfreedom and equality. Its past, heavy with confrontation\nand long periods of authoritarian rule, has unfortunately\nturned it into a nation requiring international assistance.\nThere must therefore be a determined and generous show\nof cooperation on the part of the international community\nso that the Haitian people may pursue its destiny -\neconomic and social, as well as political. The Dominican\nRepublic has always been ready to cooperate in effective\ninitiatives for the betterment and viability of needy\ncountries, whose peoples have every right to live in dignity,\nwith all the opportunities offered to others.\nThe problem of drug trafficking and narcotics\nconsumption continues to be a scourge of world-wide\ndimensions. It is the Dominican Republic\u2019s State policy to\ndeal most severely, in keeping with our legal provisions,\nwith the trafficking, consumption and possession of narcotic\ndrugs. What is more, our country has offered, and will\ncontinue to offer, its cooperation to other nations in the\napprehension, prosecution or extradition of those who have\nmade this criminal trade the most lucrative activity of our\nnew times.\nAlthough the developed countries are the most\nattractive market for the sale of narcotic drugs, the\nunderdeveloped countries, whether or not they are\nproducers of narcotic drugs, have seen an increase in drug\naddiction too. The entire international community must\ncontinue resolutely to deal with this scourge so that drug\nabuse does not become the side effect of a seductively\nexcessive well-being or the amnesia-inducing product that\nhelps some to cope with poverty.\nThe Dominican Republic, a nation of pacifist\ntraditions, will continue to support the efforts of the United\nNations in preventing armed conflicts and in the\nestablishment, maintenance and consolidation of\ninternational peace and the internal peace of all nations.\nIn another field of endeavour, the Dominican Republic\nretains the concern voiced at last year\u2019s session of the\nAssembly on the proposal made by the Secretary-General\nto merge the United Nations International Research and\nTraining Institute for the Advancement of Women\n(INSTRAW) and the United Nations Development Fund for\nWomen (UNIFEM). INSTRAW was conceived at the first\nWorld Conference of the International Women\u2019s Year,\nheld in Mexico City, and was created pursuant to the\ndecision of the Economic and Social Council.\nThe Dominican Republic takes this occasion to\nreiterate its request that INSTRAW and UNIFEM not be\nmerged. We also request retention of the commitments\nentered into under Economic and Social Council\nresolution 1998/LX, of 12 May 1976, which establishes\nthe permanent headquarters of INSTRAW in the\nDominican Republic, so that our great city in the\nAmericas may continue to host that important organ.\nWe are deluding ourselves if we think that peace,\nsecurity and development can be pursued as separate\ngoals at either the national level or the international level.\nThe new order and new balance that are coming into\nbeing call for new ways of thinking and new priorities.\nThey require a reappraisal of current international realities\nin the light of established norms with regard to the\nsovereignty of all nations and recognition of the pluralism\nof the world\u2019s peoples.\nThe new era demands that confrontation turn into\ndialogue and that calls for justice be replaced by shared\ncommitments of peoples.\nThe promising, peaceful future of which we all\nspeak in meetings and assemblies will come about if,\nabove all, we, the Governments of our region, do our bit,\nwithout haggling or imposing conditions, according to our\nmaterial and leadership potential.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, please allow me at the outset to congratulate\nyou on your assumption of the Presidency of the forty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election\nto this high office attests to the respect accorded by the\ninternational community to your friendly country, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire. We are confident, in view of your qualifications\ncredentials and diplomatic skills, that you will steer the\nwork of this session to a successful conclusion which will\nfurther the noble causes and principles of the United\nNations, which are aimed at bringing peace and prosperity\nto the world. I would like to assure you of my delegation\u2019s\ncooperation with your endeavours to achieve this common\ngoal.\nI should like also to take this opportunity to express\nour appreciation to His Excellency Samuel R. Insanally,\nthe Permanent Representative of the friendly country of\nGuyana, for the exemplary manner in which he presided\nover the work of the previous session of the General\nAssembly. Furthermore, on behalf of the Government of\nthe Sultanate of Oman, I should like to pay special tribute\nto the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedicated and\ncontinued efforts aimed at resolving complicated conflicts\nby peaceful means.\nThis forty-ninth session is being held amid\nincreasing prospects for and optimism about the creation\nof a world in which atmosphere of peace, interdependence\nand peaceful settlement of disputes will prevail. Our\nArab region is currently witnessing radical and important\nchanges where hatred and animosities between the Arabs\nand Israel are slowly vanishing and giving place to a new\nclimate of understanding, dialogue and coexistence.\nWe are totally convinced that there is no alternative\nmeans by which the Arabs and Israel may resolve their\ndifferences other than negotiation. While some promising\nand positive results have been achieved, we are still at the\nbeginning of a long process and we have a long way to\ngo towards resolving deep-seated differences. We\ntherefore appeal to the international community to\ncontinue to lend its support to the efforts aimed at\nbringing peace and security to the region.\nIn South Africa, my country has participated with\nmany other countries of the world in the inauguration\nceremony of President Nelson Mandela. That historic\nevent could not have taken place were it not for the\ncourageous policies of both President Mandela and Vice\nPresident de Klerk in their approach to power-sharing\nbased on equality.\nThanks to the positive steps taken and the wise\npolicies pursued by President Mandela in forming a\nNational Coalition government that embraces various\npolitical parties, South Africa has been able to resume its\nrightful place in this Assembly, and can now play its\nnatural role in regional and international forums.\nIn Mozambique, the peace process is making\nsignificant progress. Moreover, we are witnessing an\nincreasing normalization of relations amongst Asian\n16\n\n\ncountries. We also witness more integration and\ninterdependence in the economic relations in Europe and in\nNorth America. And last but not least, we note with\nsatisfaction the peaceful resolution of conflicts in Latin\nAmerica and the unprecedented tendency of its peoples to\nopt for peace, development, and social and economic\nbetterment in their countries.\nWe have to cover a lot of ground before we achieve\nthe building of the world envisaged by the Charter of this\nOrganization. The prevailing climate of concord affords us\nan opportunity to enable this Organization to face up to the\nchallenges and unresolved problems and to address such\nproblems in the light of the new realities.\nMy country views with satisfaction the steps that have\nbeen achieved so far on the Palestinian-lsraeli track. We\nhave always called for a just, lasting and peaceful solution\nto the situation between the Arabs and Israel through direct\nnegotiations. Therefore, my country has welcomed the\noutcome of the Palestinian-lsraeli negotiations which\nculminated in the signing of the Cairo Agreement on the\nimplementation of self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.\nThis Agreement is now being implemented, the Palestinian\nAuthority is now a concrete reality and is exercising its\ndifferent functions in such areas as education, health,\ntaxation, tourism and social affairs. There are other\nfunctions stipulated in the Agreement which, we hope, will\nbe exercised at the earliest possible time, by the Palestinian\nAuthority. The expansion of the competence of the\nPalestinian Authority to other Palestinian areas in the West\nBank will undoubtedly strengthen the peace process and\ncontribute positively to security and stability in the area.\nSuch significant steps could never have been achieved\nhad not the Palestinian Liberation Organization honoured its\nobligations under the Declaration of Principles signed in\nWashington and under the Cairo Agreement. In order to\nachieve peace and enable the Palestinian people to take\nadvantage and reap the benefits of the vigorous efforts\nexerted in this context, the international community should\nextend the necessary assistance to the Palestinian Authority\nso that it may be able to discharge its many responsibilities\nand rebuild the infrastructure, which has been severely\ndamaged. Support for the Authority will not only serve the\ncause of security and stability in the self-rule areas alone\nbut in the region of the Middle East in its entirety.\nThe desired just and lasting peace will prevail only\nthrough complete withdrawal by Israel from the entirety of\nthe occupied Arab territories, in accordance with Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\n425 (1978), and in application of the land-for-peace\nprinciple.\nMy country has followed with interest another\nsignificant step in the peace process, namely that on the\nJordan-lsraeli track, which was highlighted by the signing\nby His Majesty King Hussein of Jordan and the Israeli\nPrime Minister of a declaration that ends the state of war\nbetween the two countries and masks the movement\ntowards the establishment of a comprehensive peace. My\ncountry has supported these positive and important steps.\nMindful of the fact that comprehensive peace is an\naspiration of the present and future generations, we\nemphasize the critical importance of a complete Israeli\nwithdrawal from the occupied Jordanian territories. We\nbelieve that it is crucial for Israel to demonstrate the\nnecessary flexibility to reach an agreement on the\nquestion of water in order for both countries to move\nforward towards the long-awaited lasting peace.\nWe look forward to similar positive and important\nsteps in the peace process on both the Syrian-Israeli and\nLebanese-Israeli tracks. We are confident that the co-\nsponsors of the Middle East peace process as well as the\nparties concerned are fully aware of the fact that unless\nsignificant and substantive progress is made on those two\ntracks, the peace process will remain incomplete and will\nmake the region\u2019s peoples prey to suspicions, mistrust and\ninstability. Therefore, efforts must be made in the\ncoming phase, to achieve concrete progress in this\ndirection. Israel must declare its readiness to withdraw\ncompletely from the Syrian Golan Heights and from the\nLebanese territories it now occupies. We are confident\nthat if Israel were to take such an undoubtedly positive\nstep in the peace process, the peoples of the Middle East\nwould be able to work together towards the consolidation\nof peace and the promotion of economic development on\na large scale in the region.\nMindful of the need to support the peace process and\ngiven the awareness that national and regional security are\ninseparable, the Sultanate of Oman has actively\nparticipated in the meetings of the five working groups\nemanating from the multilateral negotiations. Although\nthe latter are no substitute for bilateral negotiations, they\nconstitute a significant tributary that has the potential of\ngiving a rather significant boost to the process in the\ndirection of the desired just and comprehensive peace in\nthe Middle East.\n17\n\n\nGiven the pivotal importance of water resources for\nthe future security and peace of the Middle East, the\nSultanate of Oman accords a very high priority to the\ndiscovery and development of new water resources side by\nside with the promotion of sea-water desalination\ntechnology in order to make such technology more cost\neffective. Within the framework of multilateral negotiations\nin the Middle East, my country hosted the fifth meeting of\nthe Working Group on Water Resources held from 17 to 20\nApril 1994. The meeting resulted, inter alia, in the\nendorsement of the Omani proposal to establish in Muscat,\nthe Omani capital, a regional centre for the research aimed\nat the development of desalination technology.\nGiven the great significance we attach to the\nestablishment of that centre, as it will have a decidedly\npositive impact on the economic development of the States\nof the Middle East, we look forward to the cooperation of\nall in this regard in order to make the transfer of water-\nresources technology cost effective to the region so as to\nhelp in raising the standards of social and economic\ndevelopment and, thereby, in consolidating the peace and\nstability of the region.\nWe in the Gulf region are committed to the\nachievement of the highest level of stability, cooperation\nand development in all our countries and to the\ndevelopment of our multilateral and bilateral relations. This\nnaturally embraces the settlement of all bilateral differences.\nConsequently, we view with satisfaction the agreement\nbetween the State of Bahrain and the State of Qatar to have\nrecourse to the International Court of Justice with regard to\ntheir differences over the disputed islands and the maritime\nborders. We also hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran\nand the United Arab Emirates would settle their differences\nregarding the islands of Abu Moussa, the Greater Tumb and\nthe Lesser Tumb as soon as possible, in an amicable and\npeaceful fashion. This could include having recourse to\ninternational arbitration in view of the mutual interests the\ntwo countries share in various spheres. There is no doubt\nthat such regional efforts will contribute to the\nconsolidation of regional security and serve the cause of\ninternational peace.\nWe have noted recently that there has been\nconsiderable progress in Iraq\u2019s implementation of the\nresolutions relating to the destruction of weapons of mass\ndestruction, particularly the agreement on the installation of\na long-term monitoring system, which should now be put\ninto effect for a suitable period. In the meantime, the\nSecurity Council should proceed to make the necessary\ncontacts with both Iraq and Kuwait to implement its\nresolution 833 (1993) regarding the demarcation of\ninternational borders between the two countries through\nthe acceptance and legal ratification by the parties in\naccordance with established international norms and\npractices in matters relating to international borders.\nWe believe that it is an opportune time to take more\npositive steps to enable Iraq to perform its regional and\ninternational role in a peaceful context and to help the\nbrotherly Iraqi people to put behind it the years of\nembargo and to make up for what it has lost in terms of\nsocial and economic development.\nThe future of the region should be based on the\nconviction that it is imperative for States to develop and\nfurther their relations and to overcome their outstanding\ndifferences in a manner that safeguards the interests of all\nparties.\nThe interdependent nature of today\u2019s world makes it\nimpossible for States to pursue an individualistic approach\nthat disregards the interests of others. We therefore\nbelieve that the peaceful conduct of relations and the\npursuit of constructive political dialogue are the best\nguarantees for present and future security and stability in\nthe region.\nWe aspire after a more stable, more developed world\nthat would be totally free from ethnic and regional\nconflicts, a world that would be able to ensure the\nprogress of mankind towards a better way of life by\nchannelling the disposable economic resources to the\nfinancing of scientific research which may benefit social\nand economic development. While we are fully aware of\nthe fact that the international community has made real\nprogress in changing to the better in many important\nareas, it is nevertheless regrettable that there remain many\nfactors which make other parts of the world prey to\npolitical, ethnic and regional conflicts. It is now\nabundantly clear that the United Nations is losing its\nability to address all these crises. While we sympathize\nwith the sufferings of many peoples that are victims of\nsuch crises, we believe it is high time the international\ncommunity set up a new and unambiguous rule that\nshould be followed in dealing with such problems. It is\nevident that the present mechanisms available to the\nUnited Nations and other international organizations are\nno longer able to perform their humanitarian role. It is\nnot possible for the United Nations to go on feeding\nwhole peoples indefinitely, and it is, therefore, high time\nfor the leaders of countries immersed in such tensions and\nconflicts to realize that the United Nations will not be\n18\n\n\nresponsible for their actions towards their peoples, and that\nthe States of the international community are no longer able\nto rebuild for them what they themselves have destroyed.\nFunds should not be made available to rebuild countries\nwhich destroy their own infrastructures with their own\nhands. All peoples should contribute effectively to the\ndevelopment of the world economy rather than be a burden\non it.\nThe United Nations cannot play a peace-keeping role\nin each and every conflict that erupts in the world. Peace-\nkeeping forces should not be dragged into regional conflicts\nexcept to the extent to which regional organizations and\nStates are willing to shoulder their full responsibility in this\nregard. If deemed necessary, this should take place only\nfollowing the consent of the parties to conflict and on the\nbasis of clear goals and mandates linked to a definite time-\nframe.\nRegional organizations have a vital role to play in the\nresolution of the disputes that exist in many parts of the\nworld. Although that role parallels and is complementary\nto the efforts of the United Nations, we have noted that,\nregardless of how important and necessary it is, it is almost\nnon-existent in the political arena. While we value the\nefforts of the peace-keeping forces in Somalia, we believe\nit would have been possible to avoid the negative aspects\nthat became evident in that operation had full use been\nmade of the Organization of African Unity, the competent\nregional organization qualified to bring about national\nreconciliation and the establishment of national authority.\nThe United Nations could have lent a helping hand by\nproviding expertise and advice, as well as political,\nfinancial and humanitarian support.\nRegional arrangements, whether in Asia, Africa or in\nany other continent, in no way detract from the role of the\nSecurity Council as the principal body responsible for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Rather,\nsuch regional arrangements could help lighten the Council\u2019s\nworkload and instil a sense of partnership and a spirit of\ncaring into international affairs.\nAs the possibility of the failure of some peace-keeping\noperations cannot be ruled out, it is necessary to face the\nfacts and to draw object lessons from them if the United\nNations is to avoid sliding into the repetition of the same\nmistakes.\nTragic events are taking place in Rwanda as a result\nof the continuing political and ethnic strife that has led to\nthe outbreak of violence, to the horrendous massacres,\nwhich claimed hundreds of thousands of innocent lives,\nand to the destruction of the infrastructure of that\ncountry\u2019s economy. Great numbers of Rwanda\u2019s people\nare now living in refugee camps in neighbouring countries\nunder unimaginably tragic circumstances. Hunger and\ndisease claim the lives of hundreds daily. In view of this\nhorrendous suffering, my country calls upon the\nRwandese parties to stop the bloodshed and work towards\nnational reconciliation in accordance with the Arusha\nPeace Agreement so that peace and stability may be\nrestored in Rwanda.\nThe mediation efforts undertaken so far to bring\nabout peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven to be\ninsufficient, due mainly to the imbalance of power\nbetween the Bosnian parties. The main cause of\nimbalance in this regard is the denial to the people of\nBosnia and Herzegovina of their right to fight for their\nexistence through the imposition of a comprehensive arms\nembargo on that small State, in total disregard of its right\nof self-defence enshrined in Article 51 of the United\nNations Charter. The arms embargo should be imposed\non the aggressor. And who is the aggressor in the\nBosnian case? All the facts available to the United\nNations and its agencies regarding the situation in\nSarajevo and in other Bosnian cities prove that the Serbs\nare the aggressors, and in the most inhuman terms.\nWhile my country welcomes the structural reforms\nundertaken with a view to ensuring the optimum\nutilization of the resources available to the United Nations\nwith the greatest degree of efficiency and flexibility, it\nfeels that the ability of the Organization to discharge its\nduties and perform its role depends to a very large extent\non the willingness of the Member States to live up to one\nof the main responsibilities of membership - the prompt\npayment of their financial contributions, including their\nprompt contribution to peace-keeping operations.\nAs we approach the second summit meeting of the\nSecurity Council, we ought to accord due attention to the\nissue of the expansion of the Council\u2019s membership in\naccordance with the different trends prevailing in the\nworld, while constantly preserving the principle of\nequitable geographic balance without prejudice to the\nlevel of decision-making in the Council. We therefore\nsubscribe to the view that no hasty decision should be\ntaken in this respect and that more time should be given\nto the regional groups to expound their views in this\nregard.\n19\n\n\nMy country has noted with satisfaction the successful\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round and the long-range\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1994 and the\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization. This has\nhelped prevent the world economic order\u2019s turning into a\nhotbed of tension and strife between the various regions.\nHowever, my country and the developing countries in\ngeneral, some of which have acceded to those agreements\nor are in the process of so doing, request that their\nparticular circumstances be taken into consideration when\nimplementing the new agreements.\nIt is expected that our developing countries will have\nto make sacrifices in order to support the world economic\norder arising out of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade, particularly in the short and medium terms.\nTherefore, we hope to find support from the new World\nTrade Organization that would be proportionate to what we\nhave to offer. We are particularly interested in the\ndevelopmental aspect of these agreements, as we are\ninterested in strengthening and developing the service sector\nin our countries through the assistance offered by the\nadvanced economies and the international organizations.\nIn the area of disarmament, we hope that the\ninternational support to the Convention on the Prohibition\nof the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\nChemical Weapons and on their Destruction will give\nimpetus to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to\ndraft a comprehensive test-ban treaty that would be an\nimportant step towards ridding the world of nuclear terror.\nIn this context, we support the efforts aimed at establishing\nnuclear-weapon-free zones, particularly in the Middle East,\nwhich is one of the world\u2019s most sensitive regions.\nAt present, thanks to the prevailing spirit of concord\nand the ending of the cold war between the East and West,\nwe witness a robust movement towards the consolidation of\npeace and security. The world is beginning to realize that\na climate of concord and harmony is the most viable means\nof establishing an international community characterized by\nconstructive cooperation and mutual benefit, and that such\na development will be in the interest of mankind and its\nwell-being.\nToday, on the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe founding of the United Nations, we hope that the\noutcome of this session will be more compatible with the\nprinciple of international partnership and solidarity so that\nhumanity may be able to lessen and cure the ailments that\nsill undermine the twentieth century and thus ensure that\nthe twenty-first century will be a century of hope, peace\nand security for all human beings wherever they may be\non the face of the Earth.\n"

        "file_text": "May I offer you,\nSir, our sincere congratulations on your election to the\nhigh post of President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session. We are confident that under your\nable guidance the General Assembly will make significant\nprogress on the important issues before it.\nWe express our deep gratitude to Ambassador\nSamuel Insanally of Guyana for his admirable work\nduring his presidency.\nAt the outset, I wish to extend our heartfelt\nfelicitations to the Republic of South Africa, which has\nbegun its advancement along the road of democracy by\ndismantling the apartheid regime of racial discrimination\nand has assumed its rightful place in the community of\nnations. This historic event testifies to the fact that the\npurposes and principles that guide the United Nations,\nincluding that of respect for human rights, can be\ntranslated into reality.\nA number of other meaningful positive developments\nhave taken place on the international scene over the last\nyear, events that are inextricably linked to the tortuous\nemergence of a new atmosphere in the wake of the cold\nwar. None the less, instability continues to plague\nvarious corners of the globe, bearing witness to the\nextreme difficulty of finding solutions to problems; hence\nthe urgent need to harmonize our efforts and enhance the\nrole of the United Nations.\nThe international community is on the threshold of\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. As part of\nthe world-wide preparations for this event, a committee\nhas been established in Mongolia to coordinate national\nactivities. The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\ncoincides with the demise of the cold war, the advent of\na new era of mutual trust and partnership among nations\nand the emergence of unprecedented opportunities to\nimplement the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter. This anniversary will serve as an\nimportant moment of reflection on the Organization\u2019s\n4\n\n\npast, the lessons from both its successes and its failures and\nthe tasks ahead of us. The world community expects the\nanniversary session next year to be crowned by the\nadoption at the summit level of a visionary document\nembodying its hopes and aspirations and outlining\nmeaningful objectives for the new millennium. It is against\nthis background that we see the special significance of this\nsession of the General Assembly, which is to lay a sound\nfoundation for the anniversary.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s report entitled \u201cAn Agenda\nfor Development\u201d is a highlight of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation expresses its\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for producing a\nthought-provoking report which offers a comprehensive\napproach to development and innovative ideas for\nconsideration. We hope that the upcoming discussion of\nthat report will help in the search for an adequate response\nto persistent inequalities and imbalances, as well as ways to\ncombat the abject poverty, external debt burden and\nenvironmental degradation that negatively affect the\ndeveloping countries.\n\u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d is expected to promote\npeople-centred sustainable development through, inter alia,\na meaningful North-South partnership. In this connection,\nit would be advisable that the targets of earmarking 0.7 per\ncent of the industrialized countries\u2019 gross national product\n(GNP) for official development assistance and allocating 20\nper cent of that assistance for human priority concerns be\nreflected in that \u201cAgenda\u201d. We also wish to see included\nin the \u201cAgenda\u201d the idea of allocating 20 per cent of the\nbudget of the developing countries for the aforementioned\npurpose. An active South-South cooperation is of vital\nimportance for the sustainable development and self-\nreliance of the developing countries. In this regard the\nestablishment of the South Centre will have a significant\nbearing on the strengthening of the foundations of such\ncooperation.\nThe problems facing the countries in transition and the\nneed for international cooperation to overcome them have\nfound, in our view, a proper reflection in the \u201cAgenda\u201d. In\norder to ensure the success of transition, which has a direct\nbearing on the future of world developments, it is only fair\nthat greater attention be given to enhancing the\neffectiveness of international cooperation towards that end.\nFurthermore, this cooperation should be tailored to the\nyspecific conditions of countries in transition. In the case\nof Mongolia, aside from such handicaps as a low level of\ndevelopment and a disadvantageous geographical location,\nour economy, in fact, finds itself dependent on another\ncrisis-stricken country in transition.\nWe believe that the time has come to make every\neffort to resolve the external debt problem of developing\ncountries, taking into account the vital interests of their\nsocio-economic development and the urgent need to lay\nthe foundation for equitable economic cooperation. On\nthe other hand, it is incumbent upon the creditor nations\nto display the political will to deal resolutely with that\nintractable problem. One might add that the realistic\nassessment of the underlying political and economic\ncauses of the multiplying debt burden should be borne in\nmind in addressing this issue.\nThe successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round\nand the ensuing decision to create the World Trade\nOrganization represent an important step towards a fairer\ntrading system.\nWe hope that the entry into force of the Convention\non the Law of the Sea will facilitate the solution of\nproblems confronting, above all, the least developed, land-\nlocked and geographically disadvantaged States.\nThe post-Rio period has registered a welcome shift\ntowards the broadening of international cooperation in\naddressing environmental issues. Nevertheless, we have\nto admit that there is a significant disparity between the\nimportance that the international community attaches to\nthis problem and the actual results of the work done in\nprotecting the environment and halting the ecological\ncrisis and remedying its consequences. In this regard, I\nwish to emphasize that commitments, especially those\nrelated to the flow of financial resources and the transfer\nof technology, have to be faithfully honoured.\nAs a country exposed to drought and desertification,\nMongolia welcomes the conclusion of the negotiations on,\nand the signing of, the international Convention to combat\ndesertification.\nThe convening of the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment in Copenhagen next year is a clear\nmanifestation of the fact that social issues are being\nbrought to the centre of the international agenda. We\ntrust that the Summit will serve as a powerful engine for\nmarshalling political will at the highest level and will\nbring about a viable action programme to effectively\naddress social challenges. This Summit, taken together\nwith the recent International Conference on Population\n5\n\n\nand Development and the future conferences on women and\non human settlements constitute an intertwined continuous\nprocess of international consensus building.\nMongolia is advancing along the road of reforms,\nrelying on the active support of the donor community and\nof international organizations. The International Monetary\nFund-supported enhanced structural adjustment facility\nprogramme is in its second year of implementation. There\nis a positive trend towards checking economic decline and\ninflation and stabilizing the national currency. The role of\nthe private sector in the national economy is growing\nconsiderably. Relying on the experience of the years of\ntransition, we are on our way to finding effective ways and\nmeans for the State-governed economy. A great deal has\nbeen accomplished in laying down the legal foundations for\nsocietal life.\nYet underlying problems continue to persist. At times,\nwe face a situation in which one problem succeeds another.\nThe fuel and energy sector is in a critical state. The living\nstandards of the population continue to decline; poverty and\nunemployment are on the rise. There is a severe shortage\nof internal financial resources.\nIn order to make substantive progress in overcoming\nthese and other difficulties, foreign aid will continue to play\na decisive role for some time to come. In this respect, we\nare looking forward to the fourth donor meeting to be held\nin Tokyo this November. As hardships seem to persist, the\npractice of holding regular donor meetings under the\nauspices of Japan and the World Bank remains essential.\nWe trust that we will receive support and understanding\nfrom the parties concerned.\nHowever, this is not to say that we are pursuing a\nlopsided approach to overcoming the crisis and\nimplementing structural economic adjustments, relying\nsolely on outside assistance and ideas. It goes without\nsaying that the only way, eventually, is in the development\nof equitable and mutually advantageous cooperation.\nProceeding from this premise, we endeavour to attract\nforeign investment, including private investment, and to\ncreate the necessary legal, economic and other conditions.\nFor any State, and for small States in particular, peace\nand stability in their respective regions are of vital\nimportance. By and large, positive trends are prevailing in\nour region, despite the continued existence of hotbeds of\nconflict and tension. An important factor contributing to\nthese trends is the development of Russian-Chinese\nrelations and cooperation within the framework of friendly\npartnership. Mongolia welcomes the recent agreement\nbetween Russia and China not to target each other with\nstrategic nuclear missiles; we see this as a development\nthat augurs well for stability and confidence-building in\nthe region and beyond. The maintenance of good-\nneighbourly relations with these two countries is of\nparamount importance to Mongolia, and today these\nrelations are based on new Treaties on friendly relations\nand cooperation.\nAs opposed to the headway made in resolving and\npreventing crisis situations in Asia, there seems to be no\ndiscernible shift for the better on the Korean Peninsula.\nWe hope that the new leadership of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and the other parties\nconcerned, bearing in mind the international dimensions\nof the problem, will display great responsibility in\naddressing the problems at hand.\nThe agreement between the Government of\nTajikistan and the opposition group on a temporary cease-\nfire constitutes a first, important step towards national\nreconciliation in Tajikistan, and should be built upon.\nLast year\u2019s truly historic developments in the Middle\nEast paved the way for the positive steps that we are\nwitnessing today in the efforts to bring peace to the\nregion, inching towards a comprehensive settlement of the\nMiddle East conflict.\nWe hope that the United States-Cuba bilateral\nagreement on the immigration question will prove to have\na far-reaching impact on resolving the outstanding issues\nbetween these two countries.\nWe commend the peaceful manner in which the goal\nof restoring democracy in Haiti was achieved.\nThe wars that continue to rage in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and in Afghanistan and the tragedies in\nRwanda and Somalia testify to the highly complex nature\nof these problems and remind us again that the efforts of\nthe international community to resolve them should by no\nmeans decrease in intensity.\nBold steps are needed, particularly by the nuclear-\nweapon States, to solve the mutually interlinked problems\nof the indefinite extension of the non-proliferation Treaty\nand the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty in\n1995, as well as credible security assurances for the non-\nnuclear-weapon States.\n6\n\n\nIt is gratifying to note that the five nuclear-weapon\nStates supported Mongolia\u2019s declaration of its territory as\na nuclear-weapon-free zone and expressed their intention to\nrespect that status. The Non-Aligned Movement has also\nwelcomed that initiative as a commendable contribution to\nregional stability and confidence-building. In an effort to\ncontribute to the establishment of an effective verification\nsystem for the future comprehensive test-ban treaty,\nMongolia has expressed its interest in being part of the\nglobal seismic monitoring network. We stand ready to\ncooperate on this question with the interested parties.\nThe unchecked arms trade and its increase to global\nproportions, and especially its extension into volatile and\nunstable regions of the world, is fraught with dangerous\nconsequences. We believe that it is high time for the\nUnited Nations to take a close and comprehensive look at\nthe issue with a view to formulating the legal parameters of\nthe conduct of States in this respect.\nIn recent years the role and influence of the Non-\nAligned Movement in world politics have grown.\nConsiderable progress has been achieved in implementing\nthe Jakarta Final Document, which epitomized the new\nstrategy of the Movement in the post-cold-war era. The\nCairo Ministerial Conference, held last June, contributed to\nthe enhancement of the Movement\u2019s activities. Here, I\nshould also like to mention that this Conference emphasized\nthe need to augment the Movement\u2019s efforts with a view to\nadequately responding to common problems facing the\ndeveloping countries.\nI wish to make a few more comments on the United\nNations.\nIn the wake of the cold-war policy that limited the\ncapacity of the United Nations to implement fully the\npurposes and principles of its Charter, new opportunities\nhave opened up before the world Organization. All at once,\nthe eyes of the world, full of hope and expectation, have\nturned to the United Nations. The United Nations has\nexerted a great deal of effort, and it can be credited with\nimpressive accomplishments, especially in the areas of\npeace-keeping and humanitarian assistance. Nevertheless,\nmany Member States have voiced their concern over and\ncriticism of the restructuring of the United Nations and\nhave stressed the need to ensure a proper balance in its\nactivities.\nWe can well understand the justified criticism that our\nOrganization is disproportionately preoccupied with peace-\nkeeping and security issues at the expense of its urgent\ndevelopment agenda. We expect that with deliberations\non and the subsequent adoption of the Agenda for\nDevelopment there will be less grounds for such criticism.\nThe composition of the Security Council and its\nmethods of work do not reflect the realities of the time.\nMy delegation hopes that the ongoing deliberations in the\nWorking Group on this issue will be intensified and\nsuccessfully concluded by the fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe commend and support the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his efforts to enhance the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the Secretariat. We are\nconfident that the Secretary-General will persevere in his\nreform process, and wish him every success in his future\nendeavours.\nThe Mongolian people is approaching an auspicious\nevent, which will be observed this coming November \u2014\nnamely, the seventieth anniversary of the proclamation of\nthe Republic, which represents an important juncture in\nrestoring our independence. My people has accomplished\nsince then an arduous journey marked by ups and downs.\nToday we are continuing our reforms in line with our\ndemocratic Constitution of 1992.\nIn keeping with its foreign policy concept, Mongolia\nwill continue to endeavour to make its own contribution\nto the common cause of developing friendly relations and\ncooperation between nations and ensuring peace, security\nand progress.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour and a privilege for me to address\nthe Members of this Organization. In doing so, I convey\nthe greetings of the President of the Republic of Burundi,\nHis Excellency Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, and of the\nGovernment and people of Burundi, as well as their good\nwishes for every success at this session of the General\nAssembly.\nI should like also to greet and congratulate His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs\nof C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on his unanimous election to preside\nover the General Assembly\u2019s work at this session.\nYour statesmanlike qualities, developed in the course\nof a long and rich career as a diplomat, augur well for\ngreat success at this forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. Through your impressive election, the General\nAssembly has once again paid tribute to Africa and to\nyour country, so committed to peace and international\ncooperation. I assure you that my delegation will give\nyou every support as you strive to fulfil your mandate.\nMy congratulations also go to the other members of\nthe Bureau, who, I feel sure, will spare no effort in their\npractical support for you in the successful\naccomplishment of your heavy responsibilities.\nI should also like warmly to congratulate your\npredecessor, Mr. Samuel Insanally of the Republic of\nGuyana, who, as President at the forty-eighth session,\nguided the work of the Assembly masterfully and with\nexemplary commitment.\nLastly, we pay a warm tribute to Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nfor all the activities he has initiated in order to cope with\nthe many challenges and enormous difficulties facing our\nOrganization today. We believe that these obstacles are\nnot insurmountable provided that there is honest\ncommitment and solidarity on the part of the international\ncommunity. Thanks to the resolve and perseverance of\nthis Organization, which mobilized the Member States\nagainst apartheid, peace and democracy have now\ntriumphed in South Africa. The people and the\nGovernment of Burundi have already welcomed this well-\ndeserved victory of the valiant South African people, who\nhave thus resumed their place in the concert of nations.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is\nbeing held at a time of many serious and unexpected\nevents. There have been natural disasters throughout the\nworld: famine, civil war, terrorism and other scourges of\nmodern times, such as religious fundamentalism and the\nre-emergence of exclusionary movements, associations or\n14\n\n\npolitical parties, all bearing within them the seeds of\ndivision.\nA year ago, from this very rostrum, the late President\nMelchior Ndadaye conveyed to this Assembly a message of\npeace, friendship, brotherhood and solidarity. This occurred\njust after the pluralist elections of June 1993, which the\nentire world had found to be free and transparent. Then, on\n21 October 1993, President Ndadaye was assassinated in a\nrash and senseless act that plunged Burundi into desolation,\ndivision and political and ethnic massacres, and sorely\ntested the hard-won democracy. Since that fateful day,\nBurundi has suffered a serious political, institutional, social\nand economic crisis, the repercussions of which are still\nbeing felt today. We all recall the unbearable images\nbroadcast by the international media.\nLet us further recall that the successor to President\nNdadaye, Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira, died tragically in an\nairplane accident in Kigali on 6 April 1994, which also\ntook the life of the Rwandese Head of State. Misfortunes\nnever come singly; Burundi had the terrible shock of losing\ntwo Presidents in less than six months. This situation has\nprofoundly traumatized the people of Burundi. Some\nwondered if Burundi would be able to avoid the human\ncataclysm recently experienced by its neighbour Rwanda.\nIndeed, the institutional crisis that resulted from the vacuum\nof power, and the various manifestations of violence that\nfollowed, crystallized latent antagonisms, exacerbated latent\nethnic divisions and created an atmosphere of suspicion and\nintolerance that was prejudicial to peace.\nDespite the dark picture I have just painted, the people\nof Burundi has not succumbed to despair. Indeed, the\nregistered political parties and the representatives of civil\nsociety have met in a negotiating forum and begun in-depth\ndiscussions with a view to finding ways and means of\nensuring a swift return to peace, security, trust and socio-\neconomic and political stability in the country.\nThe lengthy discussions which began after the death\nof President Cyprien Ntaryamira last April recently led to\nthe signing on 10 September 1994 of a government\nconvention. This document is a basis for the\nreestablishment of State institutions and organs of State and\nof various legal and political mechanisms which will restore\ntrust and cooperation between the political partners. The\nsuccessful outcome of these lengthy negotiations has\nallowed the people of Burundi to heave a sigh of relief.\nThe people had begun to tire and above all to question the\ngood faith of politicians who, as far as the people could\nsee, were more concerned with their own selfish interests\nthan in peace and the development for one and all.\nWe take this opportunity to thank the international\ncommunity for the role it has played in encouraging the\npeople of Burundi to pursue national dialogue and\ncooperation. We are particularly grateful to the United\nNations and the Organization of African Unity for the\ndecisive role they played in ensuring the successful\noutcome of the negotiations. The Special Representatives\nof the Secretaries-General of these organizations,\nAmbassadors Ahmedou Ould Abdallah and L\u00e9andre\nBassole respectively, participated at every stage of the\nnegotiations we have just concluded. We welcome the\nprogress made together through this preventive diplomacy.\nWe believe that the choice of a consensus President,\nMr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the consensus nomination\nof a Prime Minister from the opposition, and the\nformation of a coalition Government are all factors\nconducive to restoring security and confidence among the\nvarious elements of Burundi society and to promoting the\nreturn of displaced persons and refugees to their homes in\nthe hills. They are also very important in encouraging\nreconstruction and the economic recovery of the country.\nThe new national coalition government that arose\nfrom the consensus reached in the negotiations between\nthe political partners has, as its main tasks, the\nreconstruction of the economic and social infrastructures\nthat were partly or totally demolished, the campaign\nagainst a general sense of impunity, and the establishment\nof conditions guaranteeing the safety and peace of all in\nBurundi. The tasks ahead are enormous and cannot be\ncarried out without the solidarity and assistance of the\ninternational community on a bilateral and/or multilateral\nbasis.\nWe also take this opportunity to recall the request\nmade by the Government of Burundi for the organization\nof a neutral international inquiry to establish responsibility\nfor the October 1993 putsch and the ensuing massacres.\nThe international community has always stood by us in\ntimes of anguish and we feel sure that it will continue to\nsupport our efforts by providing emergency special\nassistance for economic recovery and reconstruction.\nWe also reiterate our appeal to the United Nations\nand friendly countries to continue to support the\nproponents of peace and progress in Burundi and to\ndiscourage and condemn all those at home and abroad\nwho may be tempted to use violence to resolve the\n15\n\n\nproblems we are experiencing. Today silence means\ncomplicity and is criminal.\nLasting solutions to Burundi\u2019s political problems can\nbe found only if they are dealt with in a subregional\ncontext. For some years now we have been witnessing\nforced movements of populations following violence\nperpetrated in some countries of our subregion. These\nmovements, often out of control, are a threat to peace and\nstability throughout the Great Lakes region.\nNo one can fail to see that the tragedy of Rwanda has\nshocked human conscience at the subregional, regional and\ninternational levels. It is shameful not only for those\nbehind genocide, or those who have committed it, but also\nfor mankind as a whole, which has not been able to rush to\nthe aid of a people in peril. My country hopes that those\nguilty of this crime against humanity will be brought to\njustice and receive the punishment they deserve. We\nencourage the Government of Rwanda to continue its policy\nof reconciliation and to do its utmost to ensure that all\nRwandese refugees can return to their homeland.\nThe crisis in Rwanda has had most regrettable\nconsequences for neighbouring States - above all for\nBurundi, which has ethnic, linguistic and cultural\nsimilarities to Rwanda. The Rwandese tragedy has had\npolitical, security, economic, humanitarian and\nenvironmental consequences. We need not go into details,\nbecause the whole world saw on television the human tide\nflee fighting to take refuge in neighbouring countries, such\nas Burundi, Tanzania and Zaire. The refugee problem has\nbeen acute in our subregion since the 1960s. As the\nAssembly knows, it is both a humanitarian and a political\nproblem. It causes discord between neighbouring States\nand has engendered mistrust between them. Some see\nrefugees as an economic and social burden, while others\nconsider them a threat to their security.\nFor these reasons, we propose that an international\nconference on peace, stability and development in the\nAfrican Great Lakes subregion be organized as soon as\npossible. In the short term, it is a matter of resolving the\nrefugee problem. In the medium term, inter-State\nmechanisms should be established to safeguard peace,\nbolster stability and promote socio-economic development.\nSuch a conference could pave the way for the creation of\na more viable economic community combining existing\norganizations, such as the Economic Community of the\nGreat Lakes Countries and the Kagera River Basin\nOrganization and adapting them better to the realities of our\nsubregion. We believe such a conference would help\nintegrate our States, which share an almost identical\nhistory, the same geographical space and, above all, an\nability to communicate through common languages. My\ndelegation is willing to make specific proposals on this\nmatter.\nNext year the United Nations will celebrate half a\ncentury of existence. In 50 years the Organization has\naccomplished a great many tasks. It has overcome many\nobstacles, survived the cold war and contributed to the\nadvent of international d\u00e9tente. Its specialized agencies\nhave assisted millions of people in distress. The\nOrganization has always committed itself to actions to\nmaintain international peace and security. It has been\nable to foster friendly relations between nations based on\nrespect for the principle of equal rights of peoples and\ntheir right to self-determination. The United Nations has\ncontributed to dialogue between the peoples and States of\nthe world by encouraging relations of cooperation and\nsolidarity.\nNone the less, the Organization, like any human\nenterprise, is far from perfect. Despite efforts to settle\narmed conflicts, we must note that the brinksmanship and\nintransigence of certain belligerents diminish hopes for\npeace.\nIn Africa, the conflicts in Somalia, Angola and\nLiberia seem to go on for ever, notwithstanding the\nefforts of the United Nations to resolve them.\nWith regard to the crisis in Somalia, we know it was\nthe massive intervention of the Blue Helmets that led the\nparties involved to the negotiating table. The operation\ninspired some hope that the people of Somalia would\nachieve reconciliation. Unfortunately, the conflict\ncontinues. Burundi believes the United Nations should\ncontinue this operation, using all the means authorized by\nthe Charter. At the same time, we call on the parties\ninvolved to settle their differences peacefully and to lend\nevery possible assistance to any mediation effort.\nAs to Angola, the political and military situation has\ncontinued to deteriorate, with an escalation of the fighting\nand greater mistrust between the belligerents. While\nwelcoming the resumption of the negotiating process\nbetween the Government of Angola and UNITA, my\nState wishes to repeat its appeal for a cessation of the\nhostilities that have brought so much suffering to the\npeople of Angola.\n16\n\n\nIn Liberia, peace has not yet been restored. There has\nbeen delay in full implementation of the Cotonou\nAgreement - signed on 25 July 1993 by the Interim\nGovernment of National Unity, the National Patriotic Front\nof Liberia (NPFL) and the United Liberation Movement of\nLiberia for Democracy (ULIMO), under the auspices of the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),\nthe United Nations and the Organization of African Unity -\naimed at finding a peaceful settlement to the conflict. The\nRepublic of Burundi pays tribute to the efforts made by\nECOWAS and the United Nations to bring about a peaceful\nsettlement of that conflict, which continues to bring such\ngrief to the people of Liberia.\nWe also support the United Nations peace plan for\nWestern Sahara, which involves a referendum to allow the\nSaharan people to choose their own destiny.\nAfrica is today the scene of the largest number of\narmed conflicts in the world. This political instability\nmeans we cannot tackle development in our countries,\ndespite the vast natural resources of our continent. We\nbelieve it is high time Africans stopped blaming their\nmisfortunes on outside factors. We firmly believe that\nAfrica must shoulder its responsibilities and define the\nmain lines of its development in accordance with its\nrealities. We must respect our identity while accepting any\npositive contribution from outside. Burundi has no doubt\nthe time will come when Africa will show its capacity for\nself-improvement and that it will be able to contribute more\nto the well-being of mankind. In other words, through the\ndemocratic reforms now under way, our continent, which is\ncurrently undergoing a period of upheaval, will attain the\nfreedom and development it so desires.\nMy country welcomes the new era opening up in the\nMiddle East. The peoples of that region are finally going\nto be able to work together for peace, security and\ndevelopment. We pay tribute to all the countries and\ninstitutions that contributed to the mediation efforts and\nencourage them to continue their diplomatic efforts with a\nview to a final and irreversible settlement of that conflict,\nwhich has lasted far too long.\nThe situation in the Balkans is also a matter of\nconcern. Work must continue to reconcile the positions of\nthe various parties. War does not resolve problems of\ncoexistence and good-neighborliness between peoples.\nOn the Korean peninsula, we wish for the voluntary\nand peaceful reunification of Korea. We also encourage\ncontinued negotiations between the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea and the United States of America, in\nthe hope that they will remove all uncertainties with\nregard to the nuclear problem.\nAs the Secretary-General pointed out so aptly in \\\"An\nAgenda for Development\\\", there can be no peace without\ndevelopment. And the 1994 World Human Development\nReport also states:\n\\\"The absence of peace can indeed hinder\ndevelopment; but without development, peace is\nthreatened.\\\"\nDevelopment requires international cooperation and\nassistance from other States. The Charter sets as one of\nthe purposes of the United Nations:\n\\\"to achieve international cooperation in solving\ninternational problems of an economic, social,\ncultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting\nand encouraging respect for human rights and for\nfundamental freedoms for all without distinction as\nto race, sex, language, or religion\\\".\nProblems arising from the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity and those of a humanitarian character,\nparticularly after the cold war, have led the Organization\nto extend its operations to the four corners of the Earth.\nSome observers even fear that development activities will\nbe neglected so long as urgent and immediate needs\nmonopolize the Organization. Some go so far as to say\nthat the discussion on development should be shifted from\nthe General Assembly to other, better equipped\ninstitutions.\nIn Burundi, we consider that development, and the\nrelated problems and needs, must also be one of the\npriorities of the United Nations. There can be no better\nplace than the General Assembly to deal with problems as\nglobal and interconnected as poverty, debt, the\nenvironment, development assistance and other equally\nthorny world-wide issues.\nOn the matter of combating poverty and other social\nproblems, Burundi places great hope in the upcoming\nWorld Summit for Social Development, where it intends\nto be represented at the appropriate level. Our delegation\nwill spare no effort to ensure that the declaration to be\nadopted at the Copenhagen Summit will correctly reflect\nthe concerns of poor peoples.\n17\n\n\nThe external debt problem of the developing countries\nis also a crisis, and it must be dealt with more innovatively\nthan it has been in the past. Many strategies have been\nadopted to resolve the problem. Specific actions have been\ntaken by creditors to restructure commercial debt and in\nsome cases to cancel bilateral debt. But as the Secretary-\nGeneral has pointed out, to date, the efforts made to lighten\nthe burden of multilateral debt have been far from\nsatisfactory.\nThe subject of multilateral debt should thus also be\ncarefully studied. My country hopes that the discussion to\nbe held on the agenda item on debt will result in\nconclusions that can lighten the burden of multilateral debt,\nparticularly with regard to the fragile economies of the least\ndeveloped countries.\nThe current situation regarding trade relations is\nextremely disturbing. The industrialized countries are\nerecting major barriers to the importation of certain\nproducts from developing countries. At the same time,\nhowever, the latter countries, under the effect of\nliberalization policies, are opening wide their doors to\nforeign competition.\nAccording to the most reliable sources, the damage\ndone to developing countries exceeds the amount of aid\nallotted to them; however, should the rich countries\neliminate all obstacles to the importation of products from\nthe third world, the increase in exports from developing\ncountries would equal twice the aid granted to these\ncountries.\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the creation\nof the World Trade Organization augur well for a more\norderly and equitable system of world trade. We maintain\nthe hope that accompanying measures will be taken to\navoid the marginalization of developing countries in the\nmultilateral trade system. We are thinking, in particular, of\nthe least developed countries which run the risk of being\npoor relations within the new World Trade Organization.\nFor some years, the international community has been\naware of the non-sustainable nature of the development and\nconsumption patterns followed thus far, without concern for\nthe protection of the environment.\nAs the Secretary-General emphasizes in \\\"An Agenda\nfor Development\\\", the environment, like peace, the\neconomy, society and democracy, permeates all aspects of\ndevelopment. In the last few years, the General Assembly\nhas seriously taken up the issues of environment and\ndevelopment. The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, in\nJune 1992, gave birth to international legal instruments\nwhich, if implemented, will ensure a better environment\nand more harmonious development for the Earth and its\ninhabitants. My country, Burundi, has already signed\nthese instruments, and it will soon ratify them.\nBurundi has been closely following the discussion\nthat has been under way for some time at the United\nNations with a view to reforming and improving the\nworking methods of the Security Council. The ideas put\nforward are quite diverse. We earnestly hope that this\ndiscussion will lead to a solution that will preserve the\neffectiveness of the Security Council while allowing the\ndeveloping countries to have their voices heard within\nthat body.\nIf the democratic reforms desired by our peoples are\nto be lasting and irreversible, there must be support from\nthe international community, for democracy against a\nbackdrop of social crisis, unemployment, or poverty,\ncould prove illusory. My country places great hope in the\nUnited Nations, which alone can contribute to solving\nmankind\u2019s current problems, such as those of population,\nthe environment, economic and social development and\nhealth, particularly at a time when certain countries of the\nworld are shaken by endemic illnesses. We cannot pass\nover in silence the scourge of our time - AIDS. The\ninternational community must pool its efforts to suppress\nthis scourge.\nWe express the hope that the United Nations will\ncontinue to pursue the ideals and purposes contained in its\nCharter. May international relations become more\ndemocratic, and a new, more just and equitable, political\nand economic order emerge.\nWe also hope that, as this century draws to a close,\nour Organization will be able to achieve tangible results,\nparticularly in removing the spectres of hunger, poverty\nand war.\nWe all aspire to peace, justice and freedom. In our\nendeavours, we must succeed in achieving them, in order\nto give future generations the opportunity to live in a\nbetter world.\n\n"

        "file_text": "First, allow me, on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, to\ncongratulate you warmly, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession. I am confident that, under your guidance and\nwith the active contributions of member countries, this\nsession of the General Assembly will have a successful\noutcome. I also wish to take this opportunity to express\nour admiration for the efficient performance of your\npredecessor, Mr. Samuel R. Insanally. We greatly\nappreciate the great efforts made by Mr. Boutros-Ghali in\nhis high post as Secretary-General of the United Nations\nin the cause of peace, national independence and\ndevelopment.\n5\n\n\nThe United Nations is approaching the final year of its\nfirst half century of existence. The most appropriate way\nfor us to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nOrganization is to help it act in a manner commensurate\nwith its global role and with the important, difficult and\ncomplex tasks set out by the new world situation. Since\nthe last session of the General Assembly, we have\nwitnessed immense and profound changes in the world as\na whole and in each region. Mankind is confronted by both\nopportunities and challenges. It is the task of each country\nand of the international community as a whole to realize the\nnoble aspirations of mankind, to overcome the obstacles to\nsettling global and pressing issues and to promote peace,\ncooperation and development.\nThe world panorama is full of contradictions. While\nthe threat of a destructive world war has been further\nchecked, ethnic, religious and territorial conflicts continue\nto persist or even multiply in a number of regions. Against\nthis disturbing backdrop, there have been some rays of hope\nthat certain conflicts in the world will be settled. The\nsuccess of the struggle waged by the South African people\nto abolish apartheid and establish a new united, democratic\nand non-racist State in South Africa constitutes a historic\nachievement for the South African people, the United\nNations and the world community. The Vietnamese\ndelegation warmly welcomes the delegation of the new\nSouth Africa to the General Assembly.\nIn the Middle East, encouraging progress has been\nmade, particularly between Palestine and Israel and between\nJordan and Israel, in the negotiating process and the search\nfor peace. These developments foster hopes of reaching a\njust and lasting peace in the region and of restoring the\nPalestinian people\u2019s rights to self-determination and an\nindependent State in their own land.\nOver the past year there have been certain positive\ndevelopments in the world economy. In a number of\ncountries there have been signs of recovery. Globalism and\nregionalism have accelerated. Economic competition is\nacute and, in this context, the developing countries continue\nto bear innumerable disadvantages. A considerable number\nof these developing countries, however, are beset by\npoverty and backwardness; with every passing day millions\nof people are threatened by starvation. The developing\ncountries hope that, with the conclusion of the Uruguay\nRound and the decision to establish the World Trade\nOrganization, trade and investment will be expanded, thus\nstrongly enhancing international economic cooperation on\nthe basis of equality and mutual benefit.\nThey cannot, however, help being worried about\nattempts to use social and environmental issues as fuel for\nprotectionism. This will affect the common sentiments\namongst the world\u2019s nations at a time when joint efforts\nare needed to solve global issues in the interests of the\ndevelopment and advancement of every nation and of the\nentire international community.\nIn an increasingly interdependent world in which\nglobalism is being strengthened, there is continuous\npressure to facilitate increased cooperation on the basis of\nequal and mutual benefit and to narrow the gap between\nthe level of development of the North and that of the\nSouth with a view to securing sustainable and lasting\npeace throughout the world.\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s\ninitiative in producing his \\\"Agenda for Development\\\".\nWe believe that through wide consultations between\nMember States we shall arrive at an agenda that responds\nto common demands and will ensure that the United\nNations plays an active role in facilitating economic and\nsocial development and the eradication of poverty in\nMember countries, thereby strengthening the\nOrganization\u2019s important role in international economic\nrelations.\nWe share the view - expressed by many\ndelegations - that the maintenance of international peace\nand security and the promotion of development are the\ntwo paramount tasks of the United Nations. It is our\nhope that the role of the United Nations in the field of\ndevelopment will be strengthened in response to the\nexpectation of the countries of the world.\nThere is an increasingly irresistible trend towards\ndialogue and international and regional cooperation. In\nour view, international cooperation should be based on\nobservance of the principles of respect for independence\nand national sovereignty, non-interference in the internal\naffairs of other States, mutually beneficial cooperation on\nthe basis of equality, the settling of disputes through\nnegotiation and without recourse to force or the threat of\nforce. In today\u2019s world of increasing awareness of\nnational independence, respect for the right of nations\nfreely to determine their own course of development and\nto maintain their national identity is an essential condition\nfor the maintenance of peace and stability and for the\nstrengthening of international cooperation.\nBlockades, embargoes, sanctions and the imposition\nof conditions in international relations are relics of the\n6\n\n\npast. They run counter to the aspirations of peoples and to\nthe common trend and are contrary to international law.\nIn this connection, we wish to express our deep\nsympathy with the Cuban people in respect of their current\ndifficulties. We demand an end to the economic,\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba. We\ndemand also prompt and effective implementation of the\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly. We welcome\nthe joint communiqu\u00e9 recently signed by the United States\nof America and Cuba on the question of Cuban emigr\u00e9s.\nWe hope that the two countries will continue their dialogue\nwith a view to settling other outstanding differences\nbetween them.\nAt a time of opportunities and challenges, of hope and\nfear, the United Nations bears, more than ever, a heavy\nresponsibility in regard to the maintenance of international\npeace and security. Never before has the United Nations\nbeen directly engaged in dealing with so many hotbeds of\ntension throughout the world. Despite the Organization\u2019s\nefforts, satisfactory solutions to the conflicts in Bosnia,\nSomalia and Rwanda have yet to be found.\nThe tendency to resort more and more to measures of\nenforcement and intervention to try to resolve intra-State\nconflicts has prompted legitimate concern among many\ncountries. We share the view that United Nations\npeace-keeping operations should strictly observe the\nprinciples of respect for national sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other\nStates. We believe that the best way to secure the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts is to persevere with dialogue.\nLessons should be learnt from the successes and the failures\nof peace-keeping operations in recent times. This would\nhelp the United Nations the better to discharge the tasks\nthat the Member States as a whole have entrusted to it.\nThe complex world situation and the increasingly\nimportant role of the United Nations urgently require\nrestructuring of the Organization. In view of the growing\ndemocratization of international relations, we join those\ndelegations that are demanding reform to democratize the\nUnited Nations system. This would include an increase in\nthe membership of the Security Council to make it more\nrepresentative, more in keeping with the changes that have\ntaken place in the world and more transparent in its\ndecision-making processes. Revitalization of the work of\nthe General Assembly as the body most representative of\nthe interests of Member States is also necessary.\nThrough the convening of international conferences,\nsuch as the recent International Conference on Population\nand Development, the coming World Conference on\nWomen and the World Summit for Social Development,\nthe United Nations has clearly demonstrated its\ncommitment to the promotion of international cooperation\nin the resolution of global social issues of vital interest to\nall nations.\nI should like to mention in this important forum a\nparticularly significant coincidence of history. As the\nUnited Nations prepares to celebrate its fiftieth\nanniversary, the Vietnamese people are looking forward\nenthusiastically to commemorating the fiftieth anniversary\nof President Ho Chi Minh\u2019s solemn declaration to the\nentire world of the birth of an independent, free and\ndemocratic Viet Nam. Only now, half a century after its\nbirth, is Viet Nam able to really concentrate its efforts on\nsocio-economic development.\nLocated in the most dynamic development zone in\nthe world, Viet Nam is fully aware of the danger\nconstituted by the widening gap between its level of\ndevelopment and that of other countries of the region. It\nhas therefore set itself the urgent task of rapidly\novercoming its state of poverty and underdevelopment in\norder to join the stream of progress and development in\nthe region and in the world. Viet Nam has embarked\nupon the path of reform and renewal in every sphere of\nits society\u2019s life. The core of this reform and renewal is\nthe development of a multi-sector economy operating\nthrough a market mechanism and employing State\nregulation at the macro-economic level with a view to\nmaintaining the country\u2019s socio-economic stability, along\nwith the step-by-step establishment of a state of law of\nthe people, by the people and for the people.\nThe reform and renewal process has achieved\nimportant initial results. The average annual growth rate\nof our gross national product for the three years from\n1991 to 1993 was 7.3 per cent; for the first six months of\nthis year, the rate rose to 8 per cent. Our international\neconomic cooperation and trade relations and foreign\ninvestment in our country have grown rapidly. Our\npeople\u2019s living conditions have been improved. Further\nprogress has been made in the cultural, social, educational\nand health-care areas, especially regarding the care of\nchildren.\nAlong with economic reforms, Viet Nam has\ngradually carried out the reform and renewal of its\npolitical system in order to build a society in which the\n7\n\n\nrights of each and every one will be increasingly ensured.\nWe continue to move forward in our efforts to establish a\nstate of law, perfect the legal system and undertake national\nadministrative reform. After the promulgation of the new\nConstitution in 1992, our National Assembly adopted a\nnumber of important laws, including the civil law, the\nlabour law, the land law, and the law on the promotion of\ndomestic investment.\nWith these achievements, Viet Nam is now shifting\ntowards a new stage in its development - that of the\nindustrialization and modernization of the country. This\nlong and arduous process has as its final objective a\nprosperous people, a strong nation and an equitable and\ncivilized society.\nTo create a favourable international environment for\nnational construction and development, Viet Nam has been\npursuing a foreign policy of openness, diversification, and\nmultilateralization of its relations, while carrying out our\ndesire to become the friend of all countries in the interest\nof peace, independence and development. We are pleased\nto note that our policy is developing in complete harmony\nwith the general trend throughout the world, and especially\nin South-East Asia - that is, the trend towards pursuing\npeace and cooperation in the interest of development, after\ndecades of war and confrontation. In its implementation of\nthis foreign policy, Viet Nam gives first priority to\nenhancing the relations of friendship and cooperation with\nneighbouring countries in the region, and to creating peace,\nstability, cooperation and development in South-East Asia.\nOur bilateral relations with each of the members of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and\nwith the Association itself, are experiencing rapid and\nsatisfactory growth, primarily in the economic and\ncommercial areas, particularly since Viet Nam became an\nASEAN observer in 1992. At the ministerial Conference\nof ASEAN held in Bangkok last July, the ASEAN Foreign\nMinisters unanimously supported Viet Nam\u2019s full\nmembership in this Association. With the increased support\nof the ASEAN countries, Viet Nam is actively preparing to\ntake all the necessary steps to join this Association as a full\nmember. Viet Nam\u2019s accession to ASEAN is in conformity\nwith the general trend towards responding to the interests\nof the countries of the region and reinforcing regional\ncooperation, especially in the economic and commercial\nareas, and at the same time facilitates the expansion of our\nrelations with other countries and international organizations.\nIn keeping with the new regional context, all 10\ncountries of South-East Asia recently participated, for the\nfirst time, in the Conference of foreign ministers of\nASEAN; an ASEAN Regional Forum, at which regional\nsecurity was discussed, was also held for the first time on\n25 July last in Bangkok. All this demonstrates the\ngrowing cooperation in South-East Asia, as well as the\nrobust movement towards the attainment of the common\ngoals of the region: peace, stability and security.\nIn order to ensure the peace, stability and\ndevelopment of each country and of the region as a\nwhole, Viet Nam is of the view that the countries of the\nregion should consolidate existing points of agreement,\nnarrow differences and settle disputes, including those\nregarding the Eastern Sea, through bilateral and\nmultilateral negotiations among those parties directly\nconcerned, without resorting to the use or threat of force.\nWhile waiting and working for a fundamental and durable\nsolution, all the parties concerned should restrain from\nany act that might further complicate the situation, and at\nthe same time strictly respect each country\u2019s right of\nsovereignty on the continental shelf and in the exclusive\neconomic zones, in keeping with international law and\nparticularly with the 1982 United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea.\nWith regard to the Kingdom of Cambodia, Viet Nam\nardently wishes to see its neighbour become an\nindependent, peaceful, neutral, non-aligned country,\nmaintaining friendly relations with all countries. It is Viet\nNam\u2019s policy to strengthen good-neighbourly relations\nwith the Kingdom of Cambodia and to respect the\nCambodian people\u2019s right to self-determination. We\nconsider that all signatories to the Paris Agreement on\nCambodia are bound to scrupulously observe that\nAgreement, to refrain from interfering in that country\u2019s\ninternal affairs and to actively contribute to the process of\nnational reconciliation and the restoration of peace and\nstability in Cambodia.\nIn the interest of maintaining and strengthening the\ntraditional friendly relations between Viet Nam and\nCambodia and of protecting the legitimate rights of the\nVietnamese residents who have been, for many\ngenerations, living in Cambodia, we wish to draw\nattention to the Immigration Law promulgated by the\nNational Assembly of Cambodia on 26 August 1994.\nCertain articles of that Law have given rise to some\nconcern. His Royal Highness King Norodom Sihanouk\nand the Royal Government of Cambodia share the\nlegitimate concern of the Government of Viet Nam and\nhave undertaken to avoid any regrettable consequences\nand agreed to begin negotiations with Vietnam soon to\nsettle this problem.\n8\n\n\nThe lifting by the United States of the embargo\nimposed upon Viet Nam has opened up new prospects for\nbuilding and broadening multi-faceted cooperation between\nour two countries in the interests of the two peoples and in\nthe service of peace, stability, cooperation and development\nin the region and throughout the world.\nWe firmly believe that multilateral relations, especially\nwithin the framework of the United Nations, are playing an\nincreasingly important role in international life. As we\nmove towards the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the founding of our Organization, we shall\nbe reviewing all the activities of the past 50 years, drawing\nthe necessary lessons to enhance the capacity and\neffectiveness of the United Nations system and to pursue\ntasks worthy of the confidence and expectations of the\npeoples of the world. For its modest part, Viet Nam will\nunceasingly strive to make positive contributions to the\ncommon cause of the United Nations for peace,\ndevelopment and social progress throughout the world.\n"

        "file_text": "I warmly congratulate you,\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly. You take office at an\nhistoric moment for the United Nations on the eve of its\nfiftieth anniversary.\nThe past year has been one of progress and great\nhope for many peoples and States represented in this\nAssembly. In South Africa, the elections have given birth\nto a democratic, non-racial society which offers a model\nof tolerance and reconciliation for others on that tortured\ncontinent. In the Middle East, the establishment of a\nPalestinian administration in Gaza and Jericho paves the\nway for a comprehensive settlement in a region that\nseveral times in living memory has threatened global\nconfrontation. In Germany and in the Baltic States, the\nwithdrawal of foreign troops marks the end of the\ndivision of our continent and heralds a Europe free and at\npeace. And on my own island - the island of Ireland -\nthe declaration by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) of a\ncomplete cessation of military operations has opened the\nprospect of a peaceful resolution which has not existed\nfor a generation.\n14\n\n\nFor many years it has been customary for Irish\nForeign Ministers to report to this Assembly on\ndevelopments in relation to the conflict in Northern Ireland.\nToo often they have spoken of killing and destruction, the\nfailure of political initiatives and controversies on human\nrights. It seemed that the Northern Ireland conflict\nbelonged to the category of truly intractable problems\ndestined to outlive all change of circumstance and to defy\nall attempts at a solution.\nI begin my address this year on this question, because\nmy message is now one of hope. The past 12 months have\nsignificantly enhanced the prospects for lasting peace and\nstability on the island of Ireland. It is true that the edifice\nof a solution still remains to be constructed, but I believe\nvery solid foundations have now been laid.\nAt the origin of the Northern Ireland conflict lies a\ndifference of view as to whether the partition of Ireland\nearlier this century was or was not a denial of the right of\nthe Irish people to self-determination. This difference was\npassionately and violently acted out by two communities in\nNorthern Ireland, who were and remain deeply polarized by\ntheir division on fundamental constitutional issues. This\nconflict has been costly for all the people of Northern\nIreland and for the British and Irish peoples generally. To\ndeal with it is one of the most urgent and important tasks\nfacing both Governments. Experience has shown that the\nability of the two Governments to do so will be directly\nproportionate to the degree of agreement between us.\nIt is in the inherited gaps between our positions that\nterrorism on both sides has taken root. For that reason,\ncooperation and agreement between the two Governments\nis vital for any solution. Last December, the Irish and\nBritish Governments published a Joint Declaration which\nsignificantly consolidated the common ground between us\nand offered all the parties to the conflict a compelling\npolitical alternative to the endless cycle of bloodshed and\nretribution.\nIn the Joint Declaration, the British Government\nrecognizes that it is for the people of Ireland alone, by\nagreement between the two parts respectively and without\nexternal impediment, to exercise their right of\nself-determination on the basis of consent, freely and\nconcurrently given, North and South, to bring about a\nunited Ireland if that is their wish. The Irish Government\naccepts that the right to self-determination of the people of\nIreland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with,\nand subject to, the agreement and consent of a majority\nof the people of Northern Ireland.\nThe Declaration seeks to deal with the issue of\nself-determination in a way which banishes the spectre of\ncoercion. Instead, political consent is now clearly set as\nthe necessary goal and touchstone for any stable\narrangement in Ireland, whatever the framework. The\nDeclaration makes clear that the British Government is\nnot the enemy of the Irish nationalist tradition and that\nthe Irish Government is not the enemy of the unionist\ntradition. A crucial aspect of the Declaration is the\nacknowledgement that future arrangements in Ireland are\nfor decision and agreement between the Irish people\nthemselves, North and South, and its formal commitment\nthat the role of the British Government will be to promote\nsuch agreement.\nThe Declaration thus marks a decisive break with\nany notion which has had such dark resonances in Irish\nhistory that arrangements in Ireland might be decided as\na function of British rights over Ireland. This opens the\nway, in turn, for a new and more developed\nacknowledgement by the nationalist tradition of the\nunquestionable rights of the unionist community, derived\nfrom its position as a distinct tradition in Ireland. A\nconsiderable section of the Joint Declaration is devoted to\nthis issue.\nAt the end of August, following a protracted internal\ndebate, the IRA decided in favour of a complete cessation\nof military operations. That decision has been confirmed\nby other statements in the interval. Much more\nimportant, it has been sustained on the ground. This is a\ndevelopment of very great significance.\nIt is first and foremost welcome because it saves\nlives. Secondly, it opens the prospect of comprehensive\nnegotiations, governed by democratic principles, taking\nplace against a background of peace and embracing the\nentire spectrum of all those involved in the conflict. Such\nnegotiations have the greatest potential for success.\nMoreover, their outcome is likely to be more authoritative\nthan a less general agreement, which would have had to\nbe enforced against a background of continuing violence\nand repression.\nWe still await the end of the campaign of violence\ncarried out by loyalist paramilitaries. I remain hopeful\nthat they, in turn, will come to realize that their violence\nis repugnant to their own community as well as to others,\nand counterproductive to their cause. We hope that\n15\n\n\nresponsible political leaders in the unionist community will\nmake their voices strongly heard on this issue, as many\nhave done already, and that a complete cessation of\nviolence will ensue on the loyalist side also.\nWe have now an unparalleled opportunity to create the\nbasis for lasting agreement among our different political\ntraditions in Ireland. We can do so, no longer prisoners of\nthe past, but rather learning form our past mistakes on all\nsides.\nPerhaps the greatest such mistake, shared at one time\nas an unquestioned assumption on both sides, was that this\nconflict, concentrated in the narrow ground of Northern\nIreland, could only end in victory and defeat for one\ntradition or the other. Compromise was seen as the first\nstep on the road to defeat. We have all learned, through a\ncostly process of trial and error, that in the Northern Ireland\nsituation notions of victory and defeat are an illusion. Each\ncommunity had the critical mass to thwart the other, but\nneither can prevail alone. General political consent is\ntherefore a simple practical necessity, as well as an ideal.\nThe challenge now for the British and Irish\nGovernments is to seize on the momentum for peace.\nTogether with all the political parties in Northern Ireland,\nwe need to build new structures, reflecting the lessons of\nour experience and building on the principles of the Joint\nDeclaration.\nExperience has taught us that a majority \\\"winner-\ntakes-all\\\" system is profoundly unsuited to a society such\nas Northern Ireland, where divisions are predominantly\ncommunal and unchanging - rather than social or economic,\nand therefore changeable. Let us apply that lesson, making\nagreement and consensus the kernel of all new\narrangements.\nNorthern Ireland is characterized by a profound lack\nof consensus on the constitutional issue of whether the\nlegitimate frame of reference is Northern Ireland or the\nisland as a whole. Let us anchor new arrangements in an\nAgreement acknowledging and reconciling the validity of\nboth.\nThe political division of Ireland has inhibited many of\nthe constructive political, economic and social interactions\nwhich can contribute to the welfare of both parts of the\nisland. Let us set that to rights in effective new structures\nbetween North and South.\nThe choice of sovereignty has hitherto been a kind\nof symbolic shorthand for the victory or defeat of one\ncommunity or the other. Let us divorce this notion as far\nas possible from all partisan or tribal connotations, and\nagree that the exercise of sovereignty, by whichever\nGovernment, will at all times, now and in the future, be\nqualified by scrupulously equal treatment of the two\nNorthern communities and of their rights, identities and\nallegiances.\nNew arrangements on these lines would, I believe,\ndivest the conflict over sovereignty of much of its current\nconfrontation and passion. Under new arrangements on\nthese lines, buttressed and guaranteed by formal\nagreement between the two Governments, conflict over\nthe choice of sovereignty might cease to become the\ndestabilizing issue it now is. Instead, it might be handled\nunder agreed political ground-rules, scrupulously even and\nfair to both aspirations, as a question of mutual\npersuasion and comparative benefit. Northern Ireland\ncould become a place specially dedicated to the protection\nof the rights of both communities. Then, for the first\ntime, both communities there could be truly themselves,\nand perhaps find common purpose in many areas where\nat present there is only division.\nThe Irish Government will pursue progress towards\na lasting accommodation on a number of different levels.\nWe are establishing a Forum for Peace and\nReconciliation, to enable all democratic parties in Ireland\nthat are so minded to make recommendations on ways in\nwhich agreement and trust between the two traditions in\nIreland can be promoted and established. This will not be\na negotiating forum, although we are hopeful that its work\nwill contribute positively to the climate in which\nnegotiations take place, and that many of its\nrecommendations can be translated into practice.\nSimultaneously, the Irish and British Governments\nare working on a joint framework document setting out\ntheir own views on where a balanced accommodation of\nthe problem may be found. It is our hope that this\ndocument, which we will commend to the other parties,\nbut cannot of course impose on them, will give fresh\nimpetus to the process of comprehensive negotiation.\nThe developments I have outlined have forged a\nunique opportunity to achieve a comprehensive, just and\npeaceful resolution of the Northern Ireland problem. It is\nvital that their potential should be realized through early\nnegotiations and agreement on new political structures.\nA new beginning for all our relationships in Ireland is\n16\n\n\nwithin our reach if we have the collective courage and\nimagination to avail ourselves of the opportunity. The\ndesire for a lasting peace and a political accommodation\nhas never been stronger across the entire population of the\nisland.\nIf in many parts of the world the message is one of\nhope, we know that in other places old enmities and ethnic\nanimosities have surfaced, with vicious and indeed deadly\nconsequences.\nThe conflicts in Somalia, in the former Yugoslavia, in\nRwanda; the gross abuses of human rights in Haiti and East\nTimor; the suffering of millions who are denied their basic\nrights to food, water or shelter; these remind us that we\ncannot let up in the struggle to create a peaceful world and\nto uphold human dignity.\nA characteristic feature of many contemporary crises\nis that they are essentially conflicts within States, rather\nthan between them.\nAnd this, I believe, is the central question facing the\nUnited Nations as it approaches its fiftieth anniversary: can\nthe United Nations, which was born out of the greatest\ninter-State conflict the world has ever seen, and which is\ndesigned specifically to prevent and resolve such conflicts -\ncan this Organization deal adequately with internal crises\nand civil strife?\nI know that there are some who argue that the United\nNations has no place in such matters, that many internal\nconflicts are not amenable to outside intervention. I can\nunderstand such arguments and the cautious desire not to\nget involved in other people\u2019s internal quarrels.\nBut can we let a crisis such as that in the former\nYugoslavia escalate to the point where it threatens a wider\nBalkan conflict?\nCan we stand aside while millions are slaughtered by\ntheir compatriots in Rwanda?\nBy what calculus do we divine that death in civil strife\ncounts less than death in inter-State warfare, that those\nthreatened by their own countrymen are less deserving of\nour efforts than those who are threatened by their\nneighbours?\nI can find no moral justification for such distinctions.\nThe appalling escalation of terror and violence in\nRwanda demonstrates the truth of this. To the names that\nhave come to be associated in recent years with human\nsuffering - Sarajevo, Gorazde, Mogadishu, Baidoa - we\ncan now add Goma, Bukavu and Ngara.\nThe tragedy of Rwanda has gripped the hearts and\nminds of the Irish people. Today there are over 100 Irish\naid workers in the area. More than 70 Irish public\nservants and military personnel are working with the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) and the aid agencies.\nAnd our President, Mary Robinson, hopes shortly to\nvisit Rwanda to show solidarity with the people of that\ntroubled land and to emphasize the need for international\naction.\nIn its response to the crises in Rwanda and Somalia,\nthe international community has shown a generous\nwillingness to help. Much human suffering has been\nalleviated. But we have not come near to achieving\ndurable solutions. Nor are we any nearer to constructing\na system to prevent similar horrors in the future.\nWe must ask how the United Nations could have\nplayed a more active mediating role in Rwanda.\nCould it have prevented the outbreak of genocidal\nwarfare when political unrest rapidly deteriorated into\ncivil strife?\nCould it have responded more coherently when\ngenocide was followed by a mass exodus?\nHow can it now assist in the resolution of the\nconflict?\nI believe that unless we equip the United Nations to\ndeal with these kinds of problems - the most characteristic\nand pressing of our time - the credibility and relevance of\nour Organization will increasingly be called into question.\nThe roots of civil disorder and internal strife are\noften complex and deep - deeper and more complex,\nindeed, than the causes of inter-State war. Recent\nexperience has shown that recourse to Chapter VII action\nalone is inadequate and that outside involvement, unless\ncarefully prepared and sensitively executed, can add to,\nrather than diminish, the crisis. We must learn the\nlessons of this and realize that building a United Nations\n17\n\n\ncapable of meeting the challenges of the new era will\nrequire coordinated action in many areas.\nI will mention seven points on which I believe there\nshould be priority action:\nWe must reform the Security Council to make it more\nrepresentative of the United Nations greatly expanded\nmembership and to reflect the great changes in\ninternational relations of the past 50 years.\nWe must develop the Organization\u2019s capacity for early\nwarning and mediation and for timely intervention in\ndisputes before they escalate out of control.\nWe must enhance the United Nations peace-keeping\ncapabilities to make them more flexible and\nresponsive when crises erupt.\nWe must develop the United Nations operational\ncapacity in the area of human rights. In particular, we\nneed a more developed system of human rights\nmonitors.\nWe must act to establish a permanent international\ncriminal court. We must intensify our efforts to\neliminate the root causes of many conflicts -\ninequality, social injustice, and poverty - by acting on\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s agenda for development.\nWe must restrict the international flow of the\ninstruments of war and oppression by adopting a code\nof conduct for conventional arms transfers.\nThere is now widespread agreement on the need for\nthe Security Council to be more representative and more\nresponsive to the needs of the general membership of the\nUnited Nations. I believe that early decisions to increase\nthe overall membership of the Council are needed, and that\nan increase in the permanent membership should reflect the\nchanges in international life over the past 50 years.\nOur discussions have shown that concrete decisions\nwill not be easy, but we must avoid getting bogged down\nin narrow considerations of optimal numbers and the\ncompeting claims of regional Powers. One way of handling\nthis would be to build into our decision a commitment to\nreview again the membership of the Security Council at a\nspecific date in the future. In this way we could work for\na result that reflects current geopolitical realities, that\nacknowledges that these realities can change over time and\nthat recognizes that all Member States have the potential\nto contribute to international peace and security.\nMeasures already taken to improve transparency are\nwelcome, but more must be done to facilitate interaction\nbetween the Security Council and the general\nmembership. And surely the time has also come when\nwe can delete from the Charter references to enemies that\nno longer exist.\nThe terrible crises in Rwanda and Somalia have\nshown that we need to look urgently and more closely at\nthe role and capacity of the United Nations in preventing\nand defusing conflicts. And we need to consider ways of\nstrengthening the capability of regional organizations to\nengage in conflict resolution. We must be prepared to\navail ourselves in full of the functions bestowed by the\nCharter on the General Assembly, the Secretary-General\nand the Economic and Social Council, as well as on the\nSecurity Council.\nWe must ensure that information on economic and\nsocial conditions likely to result in a threat to security or\nstability is brought quickly to the attention of the\nOrganization, and in particular to the Security Council.\nWe have the instrument for this in the Economic and\nSocial Council. We should now act on the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposal that a reformed Economic\nand Social Council provide reports to the Security\nCouncil on those economic and social developments that\nmay threaten peace and security.\nBeyond this, we must strengthen the United Nations\ncapacity for mediation. The Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly, despite their undoubted authority\nunder the Charter, are not always the most suitable\ninstruments for the direct mediation of conflict. In\npractice, the Secretary-General has on many occasions\nappointed a representative to mediate in particular crises,\noften with considerable success. I believe that the time\nhas come to put these arrangements on a more organized\nbasis. This could be done by constituting a mediation\nbody to which the Security Council or the Assembly\ncould refer difficult issues. Acting in consultation with\nthe Secretary-General, this body would be distinct from\nthe International Court of Justice, in that it would have\nthe role of political mediation rather than that of\npronouncing a verdict in terms of international law. I\nbelieve that such a body, drawing on the pool of\npersonnel skilled in mediation, backed by effective staff\nand properly resourced, could rapidly acquire an expertise\n18\n\n\nand authority that would significantly enhance the\npeacemaking capabilities of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations is now conducting more peace-\nkeeping operations and has more personnel in the field than\nat any time in its history. Ireland is participating in many\nof these operations and devotes a significant proportion of\nits defence forces, and of its defence expenditure, to United\nNations peace-keeping. That is one reason why my\nGovernment is particularly concerned at the under-funding\nof peace-keeping operations and at the failure of certain\nMember States to pay their assessed contributions.\nBut there is a deeper and more important reason. The\nSecretary-General has pointed to the difficulty in finding\npersonnel for the many new demands on United Nations\npeace-keeping. Recent experience has shown that a\nSecurity Council mandate no longer ensures that an\noperation will soon take place. I can think of nothing more\nserious or more damaging than the failure of the\nOrganization quickly to mount an operation at the outbreak\nof a crisis. The crisis itself escalates out of control, the\ncredibility of the United Nations is called into question and\nthe authority of the Security Council is undermined.\nWe must act to ensure that operations are properly\nresourced, that troop contributors can take decisions on\nparticipation, secure in the knowledge that they will be\nadequately funded, and that there is greater consultation\nbetween the Council and troop contributions.\nThe cost of peacekeeping will always be less than the\ncost of war. There could be no better way to mark the\nfiftieth anniversary than to address once and for all this\nmost critical constraint on peacekeeping operations.\nAs our understanding of civil strife develops, we are\ncoming to see the vital role that action in the area of human\nrights can play in helping to prevent and resolve conflict.\nThe value of integrating peace-keeping and human rights\nhas proved its worth in Cambodia, in El Salvador and\nelsewhere, but our approach has been piecemeal and\ntentative. Even in Rwanda we still await an adequate\ndeployment of human rights monitors. Resources will have\nto be found for this activity. For its part, Ireland intends to\ncontribute to the voluntary fund for Rwanda established by\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nThere is a clear need to put in place an effective\nsystem of monitoring and adjudicating human rights\nviolations. One important step would be to develop a\nstanding team of human rights monitors reporting to the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. This would make\nit easier to integrate human rights action into peace-\nkeeping operations, and the mandate for peace-keeping\noperations could include a human rights dimension with\nclearly established reporting and verification procedures.\nIn addition, we should move now on the\nestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.\nThe United Nations must demonstrate that it has the will\nto bring to justice those responsible for crimes against\nhumanity, summary executions, torture, rape and\nmutilation. If we fail to do this, we will have failed to\nlearn the lessons of Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and we will,\nof course, risk their repetition.\nOur efforts to deal with war and civil strife cannot\nignore what the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" has described as the\nroot causes of conflict: economic despair, social injustice\nand political oppression. Maintaining the peace is\nimpossible in an unequal world. Conversely,\ndevelopment is the most secure basis for peace.\nIt can be no coincidence that Rwanda and Somalia\nare among the least developed countries of the world.\nThus, when the Secretary-General himself tells us that\ndevelopment is in crisis, we are compelled to listen, and\nwe are compelled to agree with him that an alternative to\nthe United Nations in development simply does not exist.\nThe truth is that the agenda for development and the\n\\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" are complementary. They are\ndifferent sides of the same coin, and we must make\nprogress on both if we are to reach our common goals of\npeace and prosperity.\nWhat has been called a \\\"culture of development\\\"\nmust extend beyond the provision of financial assistance\nto embrace economic progress, the environment, social\njustice, democracy and good governance. At next year\u2019s\nWorld Social Summit and at the Conference on Women\nwe can build on the progress already made in the\nConferences on Environment and on Population.\nThe tragedy of war and civil strife underlines the\nneed to address more seriously the question of\ndisarmament. The easy availability of arms contributes,\nnot just to the scale of the carnage and suffering in\nconflict, but to the outbreak of conflict itself.\nAt the global level, the volume of trade in major\nconventional weapons has declined in recent years. But\n19\n\n\nin some regions large stockpiles have accumulated. In\nothers the arms trade continues to grow.\nThere is a need for States to exercise greater\nresponsibility and restraint in their arms transfers. Already\nthe United Nations Register of Conventional Arms has led\nto greater transparency. But I believe that we should now\ngo further. That is why Ireland has proposed that the\nUnited Nations elaborate a code of conduct for conventional\narms transfers which would set out common principles to\nbe observed in this area. It is my hope that the General\nAssembly will now decide that work on such a code should\nbe put in hand.\nThe lives of millions of people have been put at risk\nand large areas rendered unsafe as a result of the\nindiscriminate use of land-mines. Since last year many\nGovernments have introduced moratoriums on the export of\nanti-personnel mines. I welcome President Clinton\u2019s call\nfor an agreement to reduce the number and availability of\nthese mines.\nI welcome also the very considerable progress made\nin the reduction of nuclear arsenals and towards a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. The threat of nuclear\nconflict between the major Powers no longer overshadows\nour daily lives. But there is disturbing evidence that some\nStates still want to acquire a nuclear-weapon capability.\nTheir ability to do so is helped by the growth in the world\u2019s\nstocks of fissile materials and in personnel with the\nrequisite technological skills.\nNext year\u2019s Conference to review and extend the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nprovides an opportunity to address these issues. Ireland\nwants to see an indefinite extension of the Treaty. We\nwant to see the principles on which the Treaty is founded\nmaintained; the non-proliferation regime strengthened; all\nStates becoming members; and progress made towards the\ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons, as envisaged in\nthe Treaty.\nThe agenda for United Nations reform is formidable -\nfor the Organization itself and for the States that make up\nthis Assembly. But whatever the difficulties, reform is a\nvital and urgent necessity. I am convinced that unless we\nact in a broad and imaginative way, bringing together the\npolitical, peace-keeping, development and human-rights\ninstruments of the United Nations, we will prove inadequate\nto the great contemporary challenges.\nWe now have an opportunity such as has not existed\nfor a generation. I urge all of us to grasp it.\n"

Those of us who already know your work at the\nUnited Nations and at other international meetings can\nalready foresee the success of the work of the forty-ninth\nsession; we know your enormous talent, wisdom and\npatience. Your election also reflects the international\ncommunity\u2019s confidence in your country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, a\ncountry with which Niger maintains diversified relations\nsolidly rooted in the history and geography of West Africa.\nFinally, your election is a posthumous tribute by the\ninternational community to the work carried out over half\na century by the late President F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny in\nthe service of human dignity, peace and social progress.\nPermit me, therefore, to congratulate you, Sir, and through\nyou the people of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and its President, Mr. Henri\nKonan Bedi\u00e9, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session.\nI wish also to congratulate the other Assembly\nofficers; I am sure they will spare no effort to rendering\nvaluable assistance as you carry out your tasks.\nNiger thanks your predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Samuel Insanally, for his tireless work; he fulfilled his\nmandate methodically and ably during one of the\nOrganization\u2019s busiest years.\nI also convey my greetings to the Secretary-General,\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and thank him\nfor the dynamism and far-sightedness with which he is\ncarrying out his mandate in this period of important change;\nwe hail him for his firm commitment to international peace\nand security.\nThe annual convening of the General Assembly\ngives Niger the opportunity to renew its faith in the\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United\nNations, signed at San Francisco nearly half a century\nago. On 28 September 1993, the President of the\nRepublic of the Niger, His Excellency Mr. Mahamane\nOusmane, here outlined the views of Niger and its people\non the problems of our time. In his statement he stressed\nthat the solution to some of those problems lies first and\nforemost in the establishment of democracy. Indeed, it is\nthrough democracy that mankind will find the path of\nfreedom, the path of the love of work and the path of the\nshared happiness of citizens.\nNiger is firmly committed to this path of democracy;\nit has already found the path of freedom for its children.\nToday in Niger, no one is molested because of his\nphilosophical or religious ideas; since the establishment of\nthe Third Republic, freedom of the press is complete and\nis guaranteed by the Constitution. Freedom of association\ntoo is complete and guaranteed by the Constitution, and\na number of political parties, associations and trade\nunions now play to the full the role that is properly theirs\nin every democratic society.\nIt is in that context that the people of Niger is\nengaged in rediscovering the path of the love of work,\nwhich alone can generate wealth. Many\nnon-governmental organizations have been founded and\nare working in close cooperation with foreign\norganizations.\nThe Government of Niger is aware of its\nresponsibilities in this area, and is doing everything it can\nto ensure that every man and woman of Niger feels fully\ninvolved in development issues and can make even a\nmodest contribution to building a society founded on\nprosperity, justice and freedom.\nNiger is a Sahelian country confronted with the\ninexorable advance of the Sahara Desert; we welcome the\nconclusion at Paris last June of the International\nConvention to Combat Desertification in those Countries\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\nparticularly in Africa. Niger invites all Member States to\nsign that important Convention so as to permit it to enter\ninto force as soon as possible. We hope that the\ninternational community will finally be able to act on its\ncommitment to give countries suffering from this scourge\nthe ability to lay the foundation for genuine, sustainable\ndevelopment.\n25\n\n\nLike other developing countries, Niger is facing\nnumerous difficulties, the most important and most\nformidable core issue for us is rainfall, whose\ncapriciousness is feared by our authorities and our people\nalike. Sometimes too meager, sometimes excessive, the\nrainy season is an ongoing concern in Niger. Last year\nthere was not enough rain; this year, however, there were\nrains such as Niger has not witnessed in more than two\ndecades. They caused considerable damage but did not\ngratify our people or our Government with an adequate\nharvest.\nNiger wants to free itself from the vagaries of the\nheavens in order at last to save its children from hunger\nand thirst. That is why our Head of State, His Excellency\nMr. Mahamane Ousmane, has initiated a major campaign\nin which the people are participating in building the first-\never dam on the Niger river.\nTo this end he called on all the citizens of Niger to\nmobilize the resources needed to build the Kandadji Dam.\nFrom this rostrum, I should like to invite all\norganizations and countries which wish to aid my country,\nto give particular attention to this project. For Niger, this\nis a question of ensuring the conditions necessary for the\nsurvival of the present and future generations.\nMy country has accorded food self-sufficiency top\npriority in its campaign for economic development. It\nkeenly hopes that with the assistance of the international\ncommunity it will achieve this objective before the end of\nthe present decade. Here, Niger hopes that the nations\nwhich share the same ideal of prosperity and happiness will\nextend it the same solidarity.\nSince he took office in April 1993, President\nMahamane Ousmane has vowed to devote his full energy\nto the return of peace in the troubled regions in the north of\nour country. He has made that question a constant matter\nof concern for the Government of Niger.\nBy the grace of God, and following the recent\nnegotiations held in Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, the\nGovernment of Niger signed a peace agreement with the\nCoordination of Armed Resistance, thereby opening the\nway for a cease-fire and the drawing up of legislative texts\ndesigned to provide more harmonious management of the\nregions.\nOn behalf of the Government of Niger, allow me here\nto extend our warm gratitude to Algeria, Burkino Faso and\nFrance, whose mediation made it possible to arrive at this\nfortunate conclusion.\nThe Ouagadougou Agreement, which was signed\nlast Sunday, 9 October 1994, and which entered into force\ntoday, 11 October 1994, will allow the people of Niger to\ndevote itself to the critical issues of development in a\ncalm atmosphere. It opens the way to national\nreconciliation among the sons of the same geographical\nregion, united by history and inspired by the same will -\nthat of living together.\nThe Government of Niger will, for its part, engage\nin implementing this Agreement by submitting a draft law\nto the National Assembly as soon as possible.\nIt hopes that the international community will assist\nby providing material and financial resources to ensure\nthe return and integration of the refugees.\nNiger is also expecting consistent support from the\ninternational community to ensure its economic recovery.\nThus, since the devaluation of the CFA franc, my\nGovernment has been continuing negotiations with the\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\nIt has concluded an agreement with the Bretton\nWoods institutions on economic recovery, and\nnegotiations are now under way for the conclusion of an\nagreement on the facility for strengthened structural\nadjustment. The Government of Niger has taken the\nnecessary preliminary measures to ensure that the present\nnegotiations lead to the signing of this agreement at an\nearly date.\nOn the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding\nof the United Nations, it is gratifying to be able to note\nall that has been accomplished, in particular over the last\nfew years, in areas as complex as peace-keeping,\ndisarmament, security, the establishment of democracy,\nand respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThe development of the situation in the Middle East\nwhich led to the establishment of the Palestinian authority\nin Gaza, like the logic of peace and dialogue which now\nprevails between Israel and the other Arab countries, is\npart of this new dynamic.\nWe cannot fail to mention here, with legitimate\npride, the process which led to the establishment in South\nAfrica of a democratic regime which is being guided with\nwisdom and determination by President Nelson Mandela\n26\n\n\nand which has allowed this founding Member of the\nOrganization to regain its rightful place in the community\nof nations.\nHow can we fail to be gratified that President Jean-\nBertrand Aristide will soon arrive on Haitian soil after three\nlong years in forced exile?\nThese are indeed major events which encourage us to\nhope that we will see a rapid return of peace wherever it\nmay have been shattered or wherever it is threatened.\nThe recent negotiations held in New York between\nCuba and the United States, the negotiations between the\nAmerican and North Korean authorities, as well as the\nwithdrawal of the last foreign troops from Germany and\nsome of the Baltic States, show how much we have\naccomplished in the five years since the collapse of the\nBerlin Wall.\nThroughout the world - in Africa, in Asia and in\nAmerica and in Europe - the last vestiges of the cold war\nare fading away to open the way for a fruitful partnership\namong nations.\nThe United Nations has made its contribution to the\nachievement of this new atmosphere but here and there\nhotbeds of tension continue to exist which attest to the\nfragility of the present balance.\nAmong these conflicts, some of which are ravaging\nAfrica, I would mention first of all the conflict in Rwanda,\nwhere a fratricidal war has caused the deaths of hundreds\nof thousands of men, women and children, left thousands\nwounded and sent millions of refugees into exile.\nHow can we have allowed such a tragedy to take place\nwithout having used all the means and resources available\nto the international community in time to prevent, if not\nlimit, the unprecedented massacres which were perpetrated?\nBecause it is aware that nothing lasting can be\nconceived and realized in Rwanda without peace and unity\namong its sons Niger made its modest contribution to the\nrestoration of peace in Rwanda by participating in the\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR).\nIn this country which has been torn apart, Niger hopes\nto see the provisions of the Arusha Agreement enforced so\nthat the hardworking people of Rwanda may be able at last,\nand once and for all, to turn its attention towards the tasks\nof reconstruction and development.\nNiger expresses the same hopes for peace and\nstability in neighbouring Burundi and welcomes the\nsignificant progress made recently, which has resulted in\nits acquiring authorities who can pursue the work of\nconsolidating the peace.\nQuite close to Rwanda, peace is making great strides\nalso in a country which has been engaged in war and\nsuffering since its independence, namely, Mozambique.\nNiger keenly hopes that the changes which took place\nrecently in South Africa will have a very positive effect\non the elections to be held there on 27 and 28 October.\nThe situation in Angola is a matter of concern for\nmy delegation. Niger welcomes the fact that, thanks to\npressure from the international community and the efforts\nmade by President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia and\nPresident Nelson Mandela of South Africa and thanks\nalso to the joint actions of the special representatives of\nthe Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity, UNITA has finally agreed\nto the signing of a peace agreement, a prelude to a\ngeneral cease-fire and the establishment of a lasting peace\nin Angola.\nNor must the international community and, in\nparticular, the United Nations turn its attention away from\nSomalia, that other fraternal country that has been\nravaged. Indeed, it must do all in its power to maintain\na significant United Nations presence, which alone can\nguarantee lasting peace in Somalia.\nThe process of settling all these conflicts has\nrevealed the need for greater coordination between the\nefforts of the United Nations and those of the regional\norganizations within the framework of safeguarding peace\nand international security.\nNiger thanks all the countries which, on a bilateral\nbasis, made their valuable contribution to the resolution\nof certain African conflicts and appeals to the\ninternational community for continuing support for the\nmachinery of prevention - machinery established by the\nOrganization of African Unity for the management and\nsettlement of conflicts - to allow it to be more\noperational.\nMy country is gratified that, after 46 years of\nhostilities, Jordan and Israel agreed to sign a peace\nagreement on 25 July 1994 - this less than a year after the\nsigning of the agreement between the Israelis and the\nPalestinians.\n27\n\n\nNiger hopes that the logic of peace which has been\nestablished in this region will lead to the signature of\nsimilar agreements between Israel and Lebanon on the one\nhand and between Syria and Israel on the other, so that\nonce and for all fraternity will prevail between the sons of\nthis part of the world, the cradle of centuries-old\ncivilizations.\nNiger thus appeals to the Iraqi authorities to ensure\nthat the actions they undertake fit within the spirit and letter\nof the Security Council resolutions, that they recognize the\ninternational borders of Kuwait and refrain from any action\nlikely once again to inflame the Gulf region in a fratricidal\nconflict with incalculable consequences.\nClearly, the world today has gone from a period of\nconfrontation to one of cooperation.\nIt is clear that our Organization over the years, with its\npresent membership of 184 States, is aspiring towards the\nideal of universalism enshrined in its Charter. However, it\nis up to the United Nations to devote particular attention to\nother regions and other peoples which, through their vitality\nand economic dynamism, could also contribute to the\nimplementation of the ideals of the Charter.\nIt is moreover in this spirit that Niger regrets that the\nGeneral Assembly was not able to put on its agenda the\nitem entitled \\\"Consideration of the exceptional situation of\nthe Republic of China in Taiwan in the international\ncontext, based on the principle of universality and in\naccordance with the established model of parallel\nrepresentation of divided countries at the United Nations\\\".\nNiger is keenly concerned at the continuation of the\nconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina despite the efforts and\nthe patience of the member countries of the Contact Group\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the\nnumerous resolutions of the Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly, and the many actions undertaken by the\ninternational community.\nThe most recent events in this conflict have\ndemonstrated to those who still had doubts that the war in\nBosnia and Herzegovina is deliberate and is supported by\nthe leaders of the Serbian community who have made force\nthe primary basis for their actions.\nThat is why, while welcoming the political courage\ndemonstrated throughout this crisis by President\nIzetbegovic, Niger supports the proposals which he made\nhere on 27 September of lifting the arms embargo which is\npreventing Bosnia and Herzegovina from exercising its\nright to legitimate self-defence in accordance with the\nCharter of the Organization.\nAt the risk of seeing many States lose their faith in\nthe system of collective security, the Security Council\nshould make the Serbs respect the relevant resolutions\nwhich it has adopted. It is high time for the Security\nCouncil to take the measures required by the situation\nconcerning the Serbian aggressors.\nThe end of the cold war and of the East-West\nconflict has not yet fully liberated mankind from all its\nanguish; nor has it allowed it to remove the heavy\nburden posed by the build-up and improvement in arms.\nWhile it is true that risks of armed confrontation between\nthe super-Powers have today disappeared allowing\nunimaginable progress in the area of disarmament, this\nhas not led to that strengthening of security which we\nwere entitled to expect.\nA producer of uranium, Niger has ratified the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and will\nsupport, during the negotiations to take place next year,\nits extension and the universal nature it must acquire.\nThe signing last year in Paris of the chemical\nweapons Convention, as well as the unilateral\nmoratoriums proclaimed by the nuclear Powers are today\nalso important constructive steps.\nOther efforts should also be made to control\nconventional weapons and, in a general fashion, to\nestablish confidence-building measures among States.\nIt is indeed horrendous to see colossal sums\nabsorbed in the manufacture of ever-more sophisticated\nweapons of destruction and in mortgaging the security of\nouter space while in vast regions of the world millions of\nmen, women and children are languishing in the most\nabject misery, engaging in a daily battle against hunger\nand illness. How many savings could have been made\nfrom the resources allotted to peace-keeping if the\nminimum had been allotted to development?\nI am tempted to say here: give economic and social\ndevelopment that which is its due and there will be less\nto worry about concerning peace.\nIndeed, as you so eloquently pointed out on 20\nSeptember last after your election, Mr. President, the\neconomic and social situation at the international level is\n28\n\n\nexperiencing alarming developments marked by the stamp\nof uncertainty and adversity for the developing countries,\nand for Africa in particular.\nIn the course of this century that is coming to an end,\nmankind has experienced unprecedented turns that improved\nthe conditions of the lives of individuals. However, in\nseveral regions of the world peace is threatened not by\narmed men but by millions of hungry human beings in\ndistress who see no prospects for improvement of their\nliving conditions.\nIn this regard, Africa for two decades now has seemed\na desperate case, despite its abundant natural wealth. To be\nsure, progress has been made economically and socially,\nbut in comparison with the rest of the world such progress\nseems insignificant, and in certain respects entire areas have\nbecome settled in a situation of non-development.\nThus, while certain countries in Asia are experiencing\nexpansion with trends of accelerated growth, Africa\u2019s\neconomic prospects continue to remain mediocre. Today,\nmore than 350 million Africans are living in abject poverty,\nmore than half of them women and children.\nParadoxically, Africa also shows the signs of a vibrant\ncontinent capable of the greatest economic prowess, as long\nas the international community gives it the opportunity and\nthe means to achieve its potential.\nIndeed, how can we speak of a continent on its way\nto ruin when along with its natural resources Africa has a\nyoung generation determined to meet the challenges of\nhistory? How can one sideline Africa when its contribution\nto the global economy throughout past centuries has\nallowed for the industrialization of the other continents?\nHere the industrialized countries bear a heavy\nresponsibility. I should like to recall Niger\u2019s position on a\nparticular aspect of this responsibility, namely, the debt. As\nlong as the developing countries, and in particular those of\nsub-Saharan Africa, continue to devote the greater part of\ntheir income to paying off the foreign debt they will never\nbe able to lay down the basis for a genuine economic\nrecovery. Thus, Niger urges the developed countries to\ncancel the debts of the developing countries and if\nnecessary to give priority to the least developed countries.\nIn so doing the industrialized countries will have answered\ntheir own appeal as made by the Group of Seven most\nhighly industrialized countries at the Naples Summit in July\n1994.\nAlong with the debt the continued deterioration of\nthe terms of trade is a subject of great concern for Niger.\nThe purchase price of the products these countries offer\non the international market is falling year by year while\nthe prices of manufactured products which the same\ncountries are buying are continuing to rise.\nTo be competitive, some of these countries have\ndevalued their currency by half, despite the difficult\neconomic, social and political consequences. Quite\nrecently in Morocco the developing countries renewed\ntheir faith in the rules governing international trade\nthrough their active participation in the agreement\nestablishing the World Trade Organization. We hope\nthat, in return, this organization will be able to fill the\ngaps in the text of the agreement by taking courageous\ndecisions and adopting measures in favour of the\ndeveloping countries, in particular those of Africa.\nFor many of the developing countries international\ntrade is, first of all, trade in commodities. That is why\nNiger attaches great importance to the establishment of\nthe commodifies Fund and, in so doing, appeals\ndiversification to those countries still reluctant to do so to\nbecome involved in the dynamic process under way in\nthis area.\nBut what the developing countries, and especially the\nleast-developed countries, need most is the establishment\nof a genuine fund for development assured of lasting\nresources. It is recognized today that the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions have reached their limits in development\nmatters. The conditions attached to World Bank and\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) loans are often a\ngenuine impediment to attaining the developing countries\u2019\npurpose in negotiating the loan agreements.\nIn his report \\\"An Agenda for Development\\\", the\nSecretary-General rightly notes that peace is the\ndevelopment; the economy is the engine of progress; the\nenvironment is a basis for sustainability; and social justice\nis a pillar of society.\nMy delegation hopes that the consultations to be held\non this document will result in a fleshing-out of the initial\noutline and that the final report will take into account the\nvital concerns of the developing countries. We hope that\nit will put forward concrete ways and means to ensure\nimplementation of the development programmes and\nstrategies adopted by the General Assembly over the last\nfew years.\n29\n\n\nThe forthcoming major international conferences - the\nWorld Summit for Social Development, the Fourth World\nConference on Women and the Second United Nations\nConference on Human Settlements - provide opportunities\nfor us further to enrich this Agenda.\nIn conclusion, let me reaffirm Niger\u2019s faith in the\nideals of the United Nations and in its ability to find,\nthanks to the solidarity of all its Members, the right\nanswers to the new challenges we face.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me say at\nthe outset how pleased I am to see you, Sir, presiding over\nthe General Assembly at this session. In addition to being\na well-deserved tribute to you personally and to your\ncountry, your presidency is a distinct honour and privilege\nfor Africa. Your task will definitely not be easy but we are\nconfident that your wisdom and broad experience will help\nguide our Organization in discharging its leadership role in\nworld affairs. I hasten to pledge to you my delegation\u2019s\nfull cooperation and active participation in the deliberations\nahead.\nLet me take this opportunity to say how welcome the\nleadership provided by Ambassador Samuel Insanally was\nduring the past session. We commend him for the clear\nvision and diligence with which he steered the work of the\nOrganization.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nequally deserves appreciation for having carried out his\nresponsibilities with sagacity and serenity despite the\ncomplex and sensitive nature of the issues that have\nretained our attention this past year.\nIt is also my distinct pleasure to associate myself\nwith all those who have extended a hearty welcome to\nnon-racial democratic South Africa within the fold of the\nAssembly. The end of apartheid in South Africa also\nunderscores the end of colonialism on the African\ncontinent. However, there still remain a few areas where\nthe process is not complete, but I firmly believe that it\nwill not be long before we can boast of a totally free\nworld. In this regard, I should like to say that, with\nrespect to the question of the return of the Chagos\nArchipelago to the sovereignty of Mauritius, we have\ncontinued to pursue a positive dialogue with the United\nKingdom and that some progress has been registered.\nThe United Nations of today is perceived differently\nfrom what it was less than a decade ago. The fabric of\ninternational relations is undergoing profound\ntransformation. There is now more latitude and scope for\ninternational cooperation and partnership than ever before\nand the United Nations is increasingly becoming the focal\npoint for such cooperation on a number of fronts. The\nnumerous activities in such fields as peace-keeping,\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking, humanitarian relief,\nelection monitoring and supervision undertaken by the\nOrganization during the past few years indicate that its\nleadership and potential to play an active role on the\ninternational scene have been recognized.\nBut we should all accept the obvious reality that the\nUnited Nations, despite its potential and goodwill, does\nnot have the material capacity nor can it muster the\nfinancial resources to attend to every potential or actual\ncrisis situation. While it has become evident that\nsolutions to the present-day crises cannot but be evolved\nwithin the framework of international cooperation, such\ncooperation, however, is still lacking or, where it does\nexist, is but lukewarm in substance. That is why, despite\nthe end of super-Power rivalry which, in theory, should\nhave eased tensions the world over, conflicts and tensions\nhave continued to flare up. Though the international\ncommunity does mobilize itself, albeit with disastrous\ndelay at times, to address such situations, peaceful\nsolutions remain elusive. Is it because our agenda in\naddressing these problems is not always the same?\nComing from a small island State where our priorities\nremain the economic progress of the country and the\nconstant improvement of the quality of life of our\ncitizens, I harbour the dream that we, leaders of the\n6\n\n\ninternational community, can still bequeath to future\ngenerations a world which thrives on peace. On the eve of\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Organization can we not\npledge and dedicate ourselves to that goal and recommit our\nefforts to that end?\nIt has, it seems, become fashionable to question\nwhether the United Nations system is well adapted to the\nnew changing situations that confront us and whether it is\nequipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nBut we often forget that we are the United Nations.\nMy delegation believes that the United Nations, given\nits universality, should inevitably continue to have a central\nand important role in the universal management of our\nsociety. But to be able to do this satisfactorily there is an\nurgent need not only to revitalize the Organization,\nstreamlining its agenda, but also to overhaul its structures,\nbringing in more transparency in its internal operations and\ntaking on board the aspirations of the developing countries\nwhich, after all, constitute the majority of our world.\nIn this regard, my delegation welcomes the ongoing\ndeliberations in the open-ended working group on the\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in the\nmembership of the Security Council. It is our hope that the\nwide spectrum of views expressed so far on this subject,\nthough seemingly divergent, would eventually converge to\nbecome a consensual approach that would render the\nCouncil more transparent and democratic.\nThe review of the membership of the Council should\nbe such as to make it functionally effective and as widely\nrepresentative of the membership of the United Nations.\nBut it should also, I reiterate, be the product of as large a\nconsensus as possible to preserve its credibility. In this\ncontext, while considering an increase in the permanent\nmembership of the Council, one should not be biased in\nfavour of the economic giants of this world alone. The\ndeveloping countries have a legitimate right to be\nrepresented on the permanent slate of the Security Council,\nfor our concerns are different from those of the\nindustrialized and developed countries. The African and\nLatin American continents should imperatively have their\nshare of the responsibility incumbent on the Council. We\nhave no doubt that those called upon to represent these two\ncontinents as permanent members will have significant\ncontributions to make in the interest of the world at large.\nWhile we do not favour too radical a reform, we believe\nthat the decisions of the Council should be arrived at by\nconsensus rather than through veto power. Such decisions\nwould obviously be more easily acceptable to the\ninternational community. However, the present veto\nsystem should be maintained for some time to come.\nIt is a fact that the United Nations has been playing\na more active role in world affairs and has been assuming\ngreater responsibilities in the fields of peace-keeping and\nmediation in conflicts in a number of countries. But the\nrestructuring exercise needs to address other levels of our\nOrganization as well, so as to embrace the development\ndimension of international relations. In this respect, one\nshould not shy away from a possible review of the United\nNations Charter itself, but the process, we believe, should\nbe gradual and consensual. A strengthened and reformed\nUnited Nations should be able to contribute positively to\nthe fulfilment of the vision of its founders.\nIt is opportune here to remind ourselves of what, as\nfar back as 1945, the then United States Secretary of\nState reported to President Truman on the result of the\nSan Francisco Conference. He said:\n\u201cThe battle of peace has to be fought on two fronts.\nThe first is the security front where victory spells\nfreedom from fear. The second is the economic and\nsocial front where victory means freedom from\nwant. Only victory on both fronts can assure the\nworld of an enduring peace. No provisions that can\nbe written into the Charter will enable the Security\nCouncil to make the world secure from war if men\nand women have no security in their homes and\njobs.\u201d\nAlmost half a century later, we find an echo of the\nsame sentiment when our Secretary-General states that\n\u201cthe development imperative is as much a priority\nfor the United Nations as the imperative of peace. ...\nThere can be no sustainable development without\npeace. There can also be no real peace without\ndevelopment.\u201d\nWe fully subscribe to those views and would go\neven further to say that international peace and security,\nas well as an equitable and conducive environment and\nthe redress of the asymmetrical international financial and\ntrading relations, are necessary prerequisites for the\nsustainable development of all countries in the world,\nespecially the developing ones.\nIn this respect, the plight of Africa is well known to\nthe world community. The causes of its ills and of its\nweaknesses are well documented. While the disease has\n7\n\n\nbeen diagnosed, the cure is not yet in sight. Africa needs\na new order with a clear vision of hope that will ensure its\ngradual integration into the international economic and\ntrading systems. Its marginalization, deliberate or\naccidental, must be stopped and reversed.\nThe issue of human rights continues to be the subject\nof varying perception. We believe that human rights are\nindivisible, and therefore we hold the view that a revised\nand reformed United Nations should concentrate equally, if\nnot more, on economic, social and cultural rights by\npromoting international cooperation for development.\nMay I be allowed here to quote the example of\nMauritius? Since the last decade, the rapid strides we have\nbeen making in the economic field have been accompanied\nby consistent progress in the social and cultural fields, as\nwell as in the strengthening of the democratic framework.\nBasic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of speech, of\nassociation and of movement, and the holding of general\nelections at regular intervals of five years with the free\nparticipation of political parties and individuals are an\nintegral part of our culture. Our experience exemplifies the\nsynthesis that is being achieved through economic\ndevelopment, which brings dignity to the population; social\ndevelopment, for the protection of the weaker sections of\nthe population; and the strengthening of all democratic\ninstitutions, for the evolution of a harmonious society.\nThe report by the Secretary-General entitled \u201cAn\nAgenda for Development\u201d is therefore timely and will no\ndoubt place the issue of development in its different aspects\nin a prominent place on the international agenda. The\nSecretary-General needs to be commended for this\ninteresting report, which highlights the multidimensional\nnature of development. The report has been further\nenriched by the constructive proposals contained in the\nMinisterial Declaration of the Group of 77 adopted on 24\nJune 1994 in New York. I commend this Declaration as an\nimportant contribution by the developing world to the\ndebate on the report.\nLet our world, both developing and developed, take\nadvantage of the new environment. And let us commit\nourselves to reducing poverty, hunger and illiteracy in the\nworld; commit ourselves to ensuring a steady and\nincreasing flow of financial resources, as well as transfer of\ntechnology, to the developing countries; and commit\nourselves to comprehensively tackling the debt problem.\nOnly through such commitments and shared responsibilities\nand action in an increasingly interdependent world will it be\npossible to stop the further marginalization of a large\nnumber of developing countries and help integrate them\nin a just and equitable international economic, financial\nand trading system.\nNext year will witness the establishment and setting\nup of the World Trade Organization, which is expected to\ncontribute towards the development of an integrated, more\nviable and durable multilateral trading system. I take this\nopportunity to exhort the members of that organization to\nadopt positive measures so as to ensure that the\ndeveloping countries, this time, secure a fair share in the\nexpected growth of the world.\nGenuine fears have been voiced by a number of\ndeveloping countries, especially small island States, that\nare vulnerable to natural disasters and suffer from the\ndisadvantages of being far from their sources of supply of\nraw materials and foodstuffs and the markets for their\nexport products. It is feared that the results of the\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT) will adversely affect their trade, especially\nthe trade preferences from which they benefit in the\ncontext of contractual agreements entered into with a\ngroup of developed countries, principally with the\nEuropean Union.\nMy own country stands to be affected both as an\nexporter and as a net food-importing country. We\ntherefore appeal for steps to be taken, as provided for in\nthe Final Act of the GATT Uruguay Round, to provide\nadequate compensation for any such loss. I should like\nhere to stress the need for the preservation of the existing\npreferential trade regime of the Lom\u00e9 Convention of the\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group and the European\nEconomic Community.\nAny attempt to bring in new issues concerning the\nmultilateral trading system, including the World Trade\nOrganization, would not be appropriate at this juncture.\nIn this regard, it would serve no useful purpose for the\ndeveloped and the developing countries to adopt\nconfrontational positions while dealing with such sensitive\nissues as the \u201csocial clause and the trade regime\u201d and\n\u201ctrade and the environment\u201d. My country for one will\nresist the inclusion of any clause that may appear as a\ndisguised protectionist measure.\nHowever, I also believe taking as an example my\nown country, where worker\u2019s rights are protected by the\nConstitution, that internationally recognized labour\nstandards and norms and the legitimate rights of workers\nshould be respected. This is important if man is to be at\n8\n\n\nthe centre of development. The enjoyment of these rights,\nand the observance of labour standards, should be\nencouraged in all countries, without, of course, losing sight\nof their respective levels of socio-economic development,\nor the development needs and objectives of developing\ncountries.\nI am happy to state, in that context, that my\nGovernment recently introduced legislation to ensure that\nworkers participate in the management of enterprises and\nbecome shareholders in the sugar sector where they are\nemployed. This is being done in the context of a new\nsocial order based on partnership, and it is meant to favour\nthe democratization of the economy.\nThis leads me to the forthcoming World Summit for\nSocial Development, the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen and the United Nations Conference on Human\nSettlements (Habitat II), to be held next year. In our view,\nall these conferences are geared towards one simple goal:\nto better the lot of mankind, and in so doing, to enhance\nhuman dignity. It is our sincere and cherished hope that\nthese summit meetings and conferences will contribute to\nthe debate on the Agenda for Development and will\nencourage a better understanding of the nature and\ncomplexity of the development problems facing the\ndeveloping world. May these conferences come up with\nreasonable and concrete proposals, backed by a clear\ncommitment of resources for their implementation.\nIt is true that the end of the cold war and the\ndisappearance of ideological conflicts have significantly\naltered the geopolitical configuration of the world. They\nhave modified the nature of international relations, with\nstrategic economic alliances replacing military ones in a\nworld still in search of a new order \u2014 which thus far has\nremained elusive.\nIn such an uncertain and volatile situation, where the\nsurvival of the fittest and of the most competitive is the\norder of the day, small and economically vulnerable\ncountries need assurances with regard to their security and\ncontinued economic development and social progress. In\nthis respect, renewed attention is being given, in different\nparts of the world, to regional cooperation and integration.\nWe believe that the salvation of small and weak\neconomies depends on the successful implementation of\nregional cooperation and integration programmes. We view\nregionalism as an important complement to multilateralism,\nespecially when open regionalism does not lead to\nexclusiveness. I therefore appeal to the international\ncommunity to fully support the successful implementation\nof regional cooperation and integration programmes,\nespecially the nascent ones in Africa.\nIn our own region, organizations such as the Indian\nOcean Commission, the Preferential Trade Area for\nEastern and Southern African States and the Southern\nAfrican Development Community are useful vehicles for\neconomic cooperation and integration among member\ncountries and help to strengthen our economies.\nPolitical stability, good governance, respect for basic\nhuman rights and freedoms are prerequisites to economic\ndevelopment. It is therefore the duty of the international\ncommunity to ensure movement in that direction. We\nhave, however, failed by not responding quickly enough\nto the agony of Rwanda, and, as the Secretary-General\nhas stated, we have acquiesced in the continued loss of\nlives. The serious plight of hundreds of thousands of\nrefugees from Rwanda remains a major source of\nconcern. We should redouble efforts and commit\nourselves to urgently addressing such human catastrophes\nof epic proportions, which, if left unattended or if tackled\ntimidly, may very well spill over into neighbouring\ncountries of the region and affect them adversely.\nI had the opportunity to state my country\u2019s position\non this issue at the recent Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) Summit in Tunis, where I warned that Burundi\nwas sitting on a powder keg that risked explosion unless\nthe international community acted in earnest to contain\nthe problem. Though the situation has eased to a certain\nextent, due mainly to Operation Turquoise and to the\ncommitment of troops from OAU member States, the\nregion still remains fragile. Countries which have the\nresources must come to the fore and fully assume their\nresponsibility to prevent a recurrence of this tragic\nepisode.\nMy country, for its part, besides its interventions in\ninternational forums and its modest contributions in cash\nand in kind, played host to the dialogue between the\nPresident of Zaire and the President of Rwanda, which\nculminated in the signature of an accord with respect,\nmainly, to the refugee situation.\nI should like to use the opportunity of speaking\nbefore this forum to appeal to my brothers in Angola,\nLiberia and Somalia and elsewhere in Africa, where\npockets of tension exist that can flare up into unnecessary\nconflicts, to apply peaceful means to resolve and iron out\ntheir differences.\n9\n\n\nIt would be fitting here to flag Mozambique as an\nexample where dialogue has prevailed over armed struggle,\nand where, in a few days\u2019 time, the people will be\nexercising their freedom of choice to elect those they wish\nto govern the country. Similarly, it is a matter of\nsatisfaction that the constitutional problem in Lesotho has\nbeen resolved peacefully and through constant dialogue. In\nthat respect, I should like to commend the efforts deployed\nby my brothers, Presidents Mugabe, Masire and Mandela.\nI wish the same fervour could be demonstrated by\nothers who are active in the Bosnia and Herzegovina\nconflict, where countless lives continue to be lost, where\nhuman suffering has crossed the limits of endurance, where\nthe population seems to have resigned itself to a fate\nimposed upon it by the warring factions. Are we not\nresponsible enough, human enough, to resolve the problems\nbesetting that region, the more so as conflicts like those\nwhich have plagued Northern Ireland and the Middle East\nover decades, and which appeared unsolvable, are being\naddressed resolutely, and with positive results?\nIndeed, the positive developments in the Middle East\nmark a turning point in the inter-State relationships in that\nregion and augur well for peace and stability. It is my\nfervent wish that the spirit of moderation and compromise\nthat has made it possible for positive results to be achieved\nin the ongoing negotiations will continue to prevail and\nhelps open other avenues for peace to be restored in the\nentire region.\nLet us, leaders of the world, on the eve of the fiftieth\nyear of our Organization\u2019s existence, take inspiration from\nthe positive trends that have emerged in the Middle East,\nfrom the successful transition in South Africa as a result of\npeaceful negotiations, and commit ourselves to resolving\nconflictual situations \u2014 historical as well as current \u2014\nthrough dialogue. In this regard, let me make an earnest\nappeal to Pakistan and to India, countries equally dear and\nnear to us, not to internationalize their differences but to\naddress them bilaterally through peaceful means. We\nshould like to encourage both Governments to resume their\ndialogue in a spirit of trust and compromise, in the higher\ninterests of their countries and peoples, and indeed in the\ninterest of the entire region.\nI am gratified to learn that in Sri Lanka, following the\ninstallation of the new Government, a dialogue has been\ninitiated between the parties in conflict. This is indeed a\ncommendable move.\nSuch positive efforts can only be beneficial to the\ninternational community, for the peace dividends that will\nthus ensue will permit the world to tackle, with undivided\nattention, the agenda of economic and social development,\nin order to make the world a safer place in which to live.\nThat is why we continue to hope for speedy positive\ndevelopments in such places as Fiji, where equality of\ncitizenship is yet to prevail.\nAnother issue that remains a major preoccupation of\nmy country is the question of disarmament. Next year,\nthe Conference to review the Non-Proliferation Treaty\n(NPT) will take place. Mauritius has made its position\namply clear on this issue. Any extension of the NPT\nshould be linked to progress on nuclear disarmament and\nthe achievement of a comprehensive test-ban treaty, as\nwell as the establishment of a negotiating framework\nwithin which the discriminatory nature of the Treaty\nshould be examined. We have stated in no uncertain\nterms that the world cannot be divided permanently into\ncountries permitted to have nuclear weapons and countries\nnot permitted to have them. A treaty perceived as\nmaking such a decision permanent is bound to fail and\ncannot be expected to last.\nWithout the convincing support of the NPT\nmembers, we may fail in our endeavours to make the\nworld nuclear-weapon-free. The recent dispute between\na Member State of the Treaty and the International\nAtomic Energy Agency clearly indicates that the NPT is\nnot infallible. Equally alarming is the trading in enriched\nuranium and plutonium, in stark contradiction of the\nobjectives of the Treaty. As long as there are nuclear-\nweapon States, there will be an urge for other States with\nnuclear potential to acquire such weapon-grade material,\nthus putting the world community in jeopardy.\nMauritius would like at this point to welcome the\nefforts for the conclusion of a treaty to make all of\nAfrica, a nuclear-weapon-free zone. It is our earnest\nhope that the exclusive club of nuclear-haves, principally\nthe permanent members of the Security Council, will do\neverything to permit the emergence of such a zone and\nthe conclusion of the treaty.\n10\n\n\n(spoke in French)\nAs Acting President of the Conference of Heads of\nState or Government of French-speaking countries, I should\nlike to say a few words in the French language, which\nbrings together this community of dialogue and cooperation\nnumbering 47 countries with more than 400 million\ninhabitants. Since 1986, the highest officials of these\ncountries, which are found on the five continents, have been\nregularly holding summit meetings to review those\nproblems that affect the francophone world and seek\ntogether for solutions to global problems.\nMy country thus had the honour of hosting the Fifth\nSummit of the Francophone World last October. It may\nseem surprising to some that a country member of the\nCommonwealth whose official language is English should\nhave been selected to host such a Summit and thus to\nbecome the spokesman of the francophone group for a two-\nyear period. In fact, for us Mauritians, this is in no way\nunusual, since we live with our cultural and linguistic\ndiversity in perfect harmony. Indeed, Mauritian culture is\nthe result of a synthesis worked out through history. We\nlive in a society that integrates the linguistic, religious and\nsocial contributions of Europe, Africa and Asia. The theme\nof \u201cUnity in Diversity\u201d, which inspired the work of that\nSummit, is very dear to our country. All the segments of\nthe Mauritian nation participate in creating a national\nidentity while preserving their ancestral cultures. This\nmessage of unity in diversity, based on the recognition of\ndifference and on human solidarity, is even more relevant\nin the difficult and complex situation in today\u2019s world.\nThe Heads of State or Government wish the\nfrancophone world to cooperate more closely with regional\nand international organizations that are working for\ndemocracy, peace and the development of the world \u2014 first\nand foremost, of course, is the United Nations. We have\nadopted a series of resolutions to promote this new\npartnership. It is, moreover, in this context that we had the\npleasure of welcoming the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to\nMauritius. During the Summit, we were able to intensify\na dialogue that we have been maintaining since then by\nvarious means. However, we hardly had time to acquire\nthe means to implement our own resolutions when events\nbegan to move rapidly in the francophone world.\nIndeed, on the day following the Mauritius Summit,\nour brother Melchoir Ndadaye, President of Burundi, was\nbrutally assassinated. The Organization of African Unity\nand the United Nations were immediately notified. Then\nthe situation deteriorated in Rwanda, and once again we\nnotified these two international forums. Given the lack of\naction during the first few days, we welcomed France\u2019s\nintervention for strictly humanitarian purposes, which\nallowed numerous lives to be saved.\nIn addition to their concern regarding the Great\nLakes region, the countries of the francophone world are\ndeeply moved about the situation in Haiti. We have been\nfollowing developments in that country very closely, and\nwe were gratified to note that positive steps have been\ntaken towards re-establishing democracy. We are\nawaiting with great impatience, and in the interest of the\nHaitian people, the return of legitimate power to this\ncountry, a country that has suffered so much in the course\nof its recent history.\nThe francophone world, for its part, has adopted\nnumerous resolutions aimed at securing for the\nFrancophone community a more dynamic presence\ninternationally. It will thus be able to make a\ncontribution in the specific fields of its competence. I\nshould like, in particular, to cite a resolution endorsing\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s report, which is rightly entitled\n\u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d. This resolution spells out\nthose themes which the francophone world would like to\nsee taken into consideration in the agenda and which will\nbe put forward by our representatives within the United\nNations during the preparatory stages.\nAt the Rio de Janeiro Summit, later in Vienna, then\nin Barbados and in Cairo, and tomorrow in Copenhagen\nand in Beijing, the countries of the francophone world are\nconsulting on the major problems the United Nations has\ninscribed on its agenda. This is being done to arrive at\ncommon positions for meeting the great challenges of\ndevelopment.\nSuch concerted action is essential for the harmonious\ndevelopment of our world at the dawn of the third\nmillennium; hence we are called upon to make a specific\ncontribution to illustrate that spirit of humanism that\nmotivates the francophone world.\nThe Mauritius Summit succeeded in situating the\nfrancophone world in a more political and more\ndiplomatic context. The francophone world has an\noriginal and positive message to spread through the world,\na message of liberty, solidarity and sharing. I am most\npleased to have conveyed it to you.\n"

        "file_text": "It\nis a great honour for me to address the General Assembly\nfor the first time on behalf of the Republic of Mali.\nThe Malian delegation welcomes the fact that this\nyear\u2019s session of the General Assembly is being held under\nthe skilful presidency of Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nAs well as being a personal tribute, his election honours not\nonly C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which is Mali\u2019s friend and neighbour,\nbut Africa as a whole. It also attests to the confidence of\nall delegations in him. They are confident that he will lead\nour work effectively and wisely. He can rely on the full\ncooperation of the Malian delegation. We convey to him\nour warmest congratulations and every good wish for\nsuccess.\nI wish also to pay tribute to Mr. Essy\u2019s predecessor,\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for the devotion\nand skill that he brought to his work as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its last session.\nI also take pleasure in greeting the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and in commending\nhim for his tireless efforts to strengthen the role of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn the period since the last session of the General\nAssembly there have been encouraging developments in\nthe cause of peace.\nThe advent of a united, democratic and non-racial\nSouth Africa is part of this pattern. That event, which\nputs an end to three centuries of domination, marks the\ncompletion of Africa\u2019s liberation. But, in addition, by\nenabling majority rule to prevail, it brings South Africa\ninto harmony with mankind\u2019s essential values. For both\nthese reasons we must welcome the fact that joint efforts,\nin Africa and around the world, were a powerful catalyst\nin the eradication of the policy of apartheid. I pay tribute\nto the determination of the South African people and to\nthe courage of two men, President Mandela and Vice-\nPresident de Klerk, each of whom understood the trend of\nhistory and opted for the course of reason and the path of\ndialogue.\nAt the same time, I wish to take the opportunity\nprovided by the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly to pay tribute to the Palestinian people and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization, under the leadership of\nChairman Yasser Arafat. The Malian Government\nwelcomes the conclusion and the signing by Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization of the Peace Agreement\non the autonomy of Jericho and Gaza, which constitutes\na significant step forward towards settling the Palestinian\nquestion. My delegation will continue to support the\npeace process in the interests of the Palestinian and Israeli\npeoples, because it provides a unique framework within\nwhich to bring lasting peace, stability and security to the\nwhole region.\nWhile developments in South Africa and in the\nMiddle East amount to significant progress towards peace,\ncertain remaining conflicts are a continuing source of\ngrave concern for the international community. Any\nconflict capable of destabilizing any region of the world\nis a threat to the peace and stability of the whole\ninternational community.\nTo increase the chances of resolving conflicts that\nhave worldwide repercussions the United Nations should\nresolutely support regional and subregional initiatives,\nsuch as the establishment by the Organization of African\nUnity of a central body for the prevention, management\n24\n\n\nand settlement of conflicts. But such initiatives need to be\nbacked up with genuine and forthright involvement by\nStates in the same subregion, as well as by consistent\nsupport from the international community, if lasting peace\nis to be brought to the areas concerned.\nIs it not also time to collectively address one of the\nfactors underlying the development of armed conflicts in\nsome regions of the world? I am thinking of the massive\nuncontrolled circulation of small arms in third world\ncountries in general, and of Africa in particular. We are all\naware that very few of these countries manufacture arms.\nSo where do they come from? How are they channelled?\nWhat can we do about them?\nIn the view of my delegation, the answer to these\npressing questions would make it possible to find ways and\nmeans to ensure that our peoples enjoy a safe and stable\nenvironment that will favour development activities.\nReturning now to existing conflicts, we believe that in\nRwanda everything must be done to promote dialogue in\norder to preserve peace in that country and in the region.\nIn this respect, my country, Mali, has been actively\ninvolved in the quest for a solution to the Rwandan tragedy\nand is participating in the implementation of the Arusha\npeace agreements through its contingent earmarked to\nreinforce the United Nations Assistance Mission for\nRwanda.\nThe international community and the United Nations\nmust continue their efforts to provide relief to the displaced\npopulations and organize their return while stepping up\neconomic, financial, material and technical assistance in\norder to foster Rwanda\u2019s reconstruction and economic\nrehabilitation.\nSimilarly, there is a need for stepped-up cooperation\nbetween the United Nations, the Organization of African\nUnity, the League of Arab Nations, the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement in\norder to find a settlement to the Somali crisis in\nhumanitarian, political and security terms. This endeavour\nshould be accompanied by the launching of a massive and\neffective programme of rehabilitation, relief and\nreconstruction in Somalia. Hence the presence of the\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) should\nbe maintained and strengthened.\nIn Mozambique, national reconciliation is under way.\nMy delegation wishes to hail the initiatives taken by the\nUnited Nations through its observer mission and calls for\nfull compliance with the electoral timetable.\nIn Angola, we welcome the continuation of the\npeace talks and call on all parties to fulfil their respective\ncommitments in order to bring peace quickly back to that\ncountry.\nWith respect to the Western Sahara, recent\ndevelopments make it incumbent upon this Organization\nto further pursue its efforts to bring about the holding of\nthe referendum, in conformity with the pertinent\nresolutions on this issue.\nIn Liberia, where my country is actively involved in\nthe search for a solution, all initiatives designed to bring\nlasting peace must be supported, in particular those of\nthe Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS). We call on the parties to the conflict, the\nsignatories of the various agreements, to respect their\ncommitments with a view to promoting the further\nmobilization of the human and financial resources the\ncountry needs. Everything should also be done to make\nthe experiment under way in the Military Observer Group\nof ECOWAS a model for the settlement of other regional\nconflicts.\nOur abiding conviction that peace is possible\neverywhere should bolster our determination to bring\nabout a settlement to other persistent conflicts.\nThus, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mali supports all\ninitiations permitting the speedy adoption and\nimplementation of measures that will break down the\nstubbornness of the Serb party. My country, like other\ncountries of the international community, remains\nprofoundly perturbed by the armed aggression and policy\nof \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d being directed against the Republic\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and its people. We must do\nour utmost to ensure that the relevant Security Council\nresolutions are fully respected.\nIt is with this same goal of reducing the number of\nregional conflicts that we should approach activities to\nbring a return to democracy in Haiti and to restore peace\nin Afghanistan.\nAnother source of grave concern for the international\ncommunity lies in the persistence of major economic and\nfinancial problems.\n25\n\n\nIndeed, one of the major challenges facing our\nOrganization today is development. The development\nstrategies and programmes that have been pursued thus far\nhave not yielded the desired results, in particular in the case\nof Africa.\n\u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d, proposed by the\nSecretary-General, does provide a useful opportunity to\ndiagnose the existing situation, in particular in Africa, and\nshould permit us to propose appropriate measures to lay the\nfoundations for lasting development for the benefit of all\nthe peoples and nations of the world.\nThe Agenda represents the last hope for millions of\npeople living in poverty and destitution, for millions of\nchildren dying every year of endemic diseases, and for the\nmillions of refugees around the world.\nThat is why my delegation welcomes the upcoming\nWorld Summit for Social Development, scheduled for\nMarch 1995 in Copenhagen.\nSimilarly, the Fourth World Conference on Women, to\nbe held in Beijing in 1995, should make an important\ncontribution to the elaboration of \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment\u201d. This Conference will permit our countries\nto better manage the tremendous human resource\nrepresented by women by translating policies and measures\nin favour of women into concrete programmes. More\nsocial justice for women can only enhance society as a\nwhole.\nIn the same vein, my delegation welcomes the ongoing\nreforms in various bodies of the United Nations, notably\nthose responsible for economic and social development.\nThe question of world trade and commodities is\namong those to have received the greatest attention in\nrecent years. In this context, the agreement creating the\nWorld Trade Organization was signed in Marrakesh,\nMorocco, on 15 April 1994.\nIn the implementation of that agreement, particular\nattention must be given to the following issues: the specific\nconditions of the developing countries, in particular the\nleast developed countries, which must continue to receive\npreferential treatment in the implementation of the new\nmechanisms designed to govern world trade; the transfer of\ntechnology in keeping with the aspirations of the countries\nof the South; regional economic integration; immigration\npolicies; professional training; and job creation.\nResolute political commitment on the part of the\nwhole of the international community is thus vital if the\nOrganization is to play the key role in the area of\ndevelopment and international cooperation entrusted to it\nby the United Nations Charter and the pertinent General\nAssembly resolutions.\nWe welcome the fact that on 18 June 1994, the\nInternational Convention to Combat Desertification in\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa, was adopted. Mali,\na country that has been hard hit by the cumulative effects\nof drought and desertification, is hoping for the early\nratification and implementation of this Convention.\nStrengthening the role of the United Nations is\nbecoming more and more of a necessity, for as it\napproaches its fiftieth anniversary, our Organization must\nface many challenges, whether in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security or in the fields of\neconomic and social development or respect for human\nrights.\nLet us equip this Organization with the means to\naccomplish these tasks.\nWhile the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary\nprovides a useful opportunity to assess the work\naccomplished thus far, it is also a reminder of the limits\nthat reality has imposed on the implementation of the\nCharter. In this respect, it is not simply the problem of\nthe Organization\u2019s financial situation that arises, but also\nits Members\u2019 ability to agree on its priorities and its tasks\nthat is being questioned. We can only rejoice when we\nsee that our collective awareness of the disorder and\nshortcomings of the past has, for the first time, become\nthe promise of a readiness to engage in serious thought,\nas attested to by the development of \u201cAn Agenda for\nPeace\u201d and the draft of \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d,\nwhich can become effective instruments to enable our\nOrganization to provide a better future for present and\nfuture generations.\nI should like to take this opportunity to inform the\ninternational community of the democratic developments\nthat have taken place in Mali since 1991.\nIn political terms, democracy is daily being further\nconsolidated and expanded. After free and democratic\nelections in 1992 we set up the institutions provided for\nby our Basic Law. My Government today is striving to\neducate the whole of Malian society in democracy.\n26\n\n\nEvidence of this is the recent regional consultation meetings\nwhich permitted the whole population in their respective\nregions to voice their views on the major concerns facing\nthe Malian nation. That exercise has also permitted the\nGovernment, among other things, to gauge the impact of its\nmeasures on the population.\nIn economic terms, I wish to draw attention to the\nimportant achievements in the context of the policy of\neconomic recovery and reform of public finance. The\nGovernment\u2019s new economic policy also stresses the\npromotion of the private sector.\nThe challenges that face us are daunting and hence\nour achievements still need to be consolidated; but that\nwill be possible with the support of the international\ncommunity.\nThe success of the recent round-table conference on\nthe development of Mali, held in Geneva on 13 and\n14 September 1994, attests to the confidence of Mali\u2019s\npartners in development in the measures that have been\ntaken.\nThese qualitative changes in Mali have also been\nobserved in several developing countries. They reflect\nthe fundamental aspiration of peoples to freedom, justice\nand development with solidarity. These positive\ndevelopments, if they are to be consolidated, require a\nseries of complementary measures at the international\nlevel. In this regard it is important to ensure equal\nparticipation by all States in the development of new\nnorms designed to place the international system on a\nmore solid foundation while at the same time providing\nbetter security for all.\nIt is my hope that the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Organization will provide a useful\nopportunity to reflect in depth on these issues.\n"

        "file_text": "The Pakistan delegation\ncongratulates you warmly, Sir, on your election to preside\nover this important forty-ninth session of the United\nNations General Assembly. Your election is a fitting\ntribute to your experience and outstanding achievements.\nIt is also an expression of the high regard in which the\ninternational community holds your great country. We are\nconfident that under your able stewardship this Assembly\nwill succeed in advancing the noble aims and objectives of\nour Charter.\nI wish also to record my delegation\u2019s profound\nappreciation for your predecessor, Ambassador Samuel\nInsanally of Guyana. He presided most ably over the\nAssembly as well as over the important Working Group on\nSecurity Council reforms.\nThe principal purpose of this world Organization is\n\\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\".\nThe United Nations must ensure that the twilight of the\ntwentieth century is not as bloody as was its dawn. We\nmust act resolutely to end the series of regional conflicts\nthat currently threaten international peace and stability.\nThe civil war in Afghanistan has compounded the\nsuffering imposed on its people during the long and\nvictorious struggle against foreign occupation. The world\ncommunity should not forsake the Afghan people. We\nmust continue to demand an immediate end to the\nhostilities. We must promote a new political consensus\nfor the future governance of Afghanistan. To facilitate\nthis, we must commence reconstruction in the peaceful\nparts of the country.\nWe welcome the temporary truce in Tajikistan.\nPakistan hopes that the preliminary steps agreed will be\nimplemented by the parties. This is essential to ensure\nthe success of the third round of United Nations-\nsponsored talks, to be held in Islamabad later this month.\nThe United Nations must encourage the peaceful\nresolution of the Cyprus issue on the basis of a bi-\ncommunal and bi-zonal federation, in which the Turkish\nCypriot and the Greek Cypriot community would have\nequal status.\nThe Security Council must act, under Chapter VII of\nthe Charter, to implement its own resolutions, reverse the\nArmenian aggression and restore the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Azerbaijan.\nWe all bear a collective responsibility for the failure\nto halt and reverse Serbian aggression against Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. A holocaust has taken place before the\neyes of the world. Two hundred thousand Bosnians,\nmostly Muslims, have been killed. Of them, 30,000 were\ninnocent children. Forty thousand Muslim women have\nbeen systematically raped by the Serbs. Millions of\nMuslim men, women and children have been ejected\nforcibly and brutally from their homes.\nWhile the aggression was going on, the major\nPowers went through the motions of promoting peace.\nThe Security Council adopted 50 resolutions, but it has\nyet to implement them. Mediators appointed by the\nUnited Nations and the European Union advocated peace\nplans that rewarded the aggressor and penalized the\nvictim. Even the right to self-defence has been denied to\nthe Bosnians. The United Nations Protection Force has\n10\n\n\nsupervised relief but failed to stop the war or protect the\nBosnian people. It was only when the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization carried out - belatedly - the threat of\nair strikes that the Serbs halted their onslaught against\nGoradze and Sarajevo.\nThe Bosnian Serbs have rejected the peace plan, which\nis, in truth, unjust to the Bosnian Muslims. It does not\nentirely reverse \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". It does not punish the\naggressor. It does not ensure the territorial integrity of the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia should be\noffered peace with justice, otherwise peace will not endure.\nPakistan and other Islamic countries are appalled at the\nSecurity Council\u2019s recent decision to ease the sanctions\nagainst Belgrade - the root cause of the aggression against\nBosnia and Herzegovina. This will not stop the flow of\nmilitary supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. It will merely\nencourage Serbian intransigence.\nThe Bosnian Muslims must be allowed to exercise\ntheir right to self-defence. Pakistan and other Islamic\ncountries fully support the demand for the immediate lifting\nof the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\nregret the threats by certain countries to withdraw their\ntroops from the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR) if the embargo is lifted. The Islamic States\nwill be ready to contribute their troops to UNPROFOR to\ncompensate for any shortfall created by such withdrawals.\nWe call for vigorous steps by UNPROFOR to effectively\nprotect and provision Sarajevo and other safe areas. We\nalso urge the creation of exclusion zones around all safe\nareas.\nIf expansionism is not stopped in Bosnia, if genocide\nis not punished, the virus of war will spread to Kosovo, to\nSandjak and perhaps to the entire Balkans. A wider\nconflict in this volatile region could have the most serious\nconsequences for peace and security in Europe and the\nMediterranean.\nA grim and bloody struggle is also going on in Jammu\nand Kashmir. As in Bosnia, it is an unequal struggle -\nbetween the defenceless Kashmiri people and an Indian\noccupation force that now numbers 600,000. In Kashmir,\nas in Bosnia, the principles of the Charter, of international\nlaw and of international morality have been violated with\nimpunity.\nThe struggle of the Kashmiri people is just and\nlegitimate. They were promised by the United Nations\nSecurity Council - and by India and Pakistan - that they\nwould decide, through a United Nations-supervised\nplebiscite, whether they wished to join India or Pakistan.\nOn 26 June 1952, the late Prime Minister of India,\nMr. Nehru, stated in the Indian Parliament:\n\\\"If, after a proper plebiscite, the people of Kashmir\nsaid, \u2019We do not want to be with India\u2019, we are\ncommitted to accept that ... we will not send an\narmy against them\\\".\nBut India has gone back on its agreement. It refuses\nto implement the Security Council resolutions. It has sent\nits army against the people of Kashmir. It has chosen to\ncrush the Kashmiri freedom movement by brute force.\nOver the past five years, 40,000 Kashmiris have been\nkilled; thousands more are in Indian jails. Thousands of\nKashmiri women have been raped by Indian soldiers as\npart of a policy to break the spirit of the Kashmiri people.\nWhole villages and neighbourhoods have been put to the\ntorch. Torture is routine; disappearances are common;\nand summary executions are standard practice in Kashmir.\nIndia\u2019s massive violations of human rights have been\nwell documented by impartial organizations and\nobservers, such as Amnesty International, Asia Watch, the\nInternational Federation of Human Rights, the\nInternational Commission of Jurists, Physicians for\nHuman Rights and many others. The world knows about\nIndian barbarism in Kashmir. It is unfortunate that the\nworld has remained silent so far.\nWhen faced with the possibility of censure by this\nAssembly last year, India offered to resume talks with\nPakistan on Kashmir. In the talks held last January, India\ndisplayed no desire for a settlement. It repeated the\nfiction that Kashmir was an integral part of India. The\nIndian Foreign Secretary told us that India had the right\nto use as much force as it wanted to prevent Kashmir\nfrom breaking away. When the issue was raised at the\nCommission on Human Rights, India offered cosmetic\nconcessions to prevent the dispatch of a United Nations\nfact-finding mission to Kashmir. Thereafter, it denied it\nhad made such a deal.\nOn the ground as well, India escalated its repression\nas soon as international pressure was eased. The day\nafter we agreed to resume talks, India conducted a\nmassacre in Sopore, killing 50 Kashmiris. Once India\nhad concluded that the major Powers would overlook its\nhuman rights violations because of the lure of trade and\nprofits in India, the repression against the Kashmiris and\nthe rhetoric against Pakistan sharply escalated.\n11\n\n\nLet me quote from the conclusions of the latest report\nof Human Rights Watch/Asia, entitled: India: Continuing\nRepression in Kashmir (August 1994, vol. 6, No. 8)\n\\\"As this report amply illustrates, the human\nrights situation in Kashmir is getting worse at a time\nwhen international pressure on the Indian Government\nhas all but ceased. Indeed, it could be argued that the\nincrease in deaths in custody and other abuses over\nthe last six months is not unrelated to the signals sent\nby India\u2019s one-time critics, notably the United States:\nthat human rights would no longer feature prominently\nin bilateral discussions\\\". (p. 20)\nI have seen the statement made here yesterday by the\nCommerce Minister of India. While I can fully subscribe\nto the high ideals which he has propounded, I find myself\nin the same situation as the distinguished philosopher the\nlate Mr. Bertrand Russell, when he observed that\n\\\"When one observes that the high idealism of the\nIndian Government in international matters breaks\ndown completely with the question of Kashmir, it is\ndifficult to avoid a feeling of despair\\\".\nIndia preens itself and postures on the issue of\nterrorism. Terrorism is the use of indiscriminate violence\nagainst innocent people. This must be condemned. By this\nyardstick, India is guilty of daily and systematic acts of\nterrorism against the Kashmiris. On the other hand, to\nresist a foreign invader, to repel an army of occupation\nengaged in murder, torture, rape and arson is not terrorism.\nIt is the exercise of self-defence. Self-defence is a right as\nold as history; a right recognized in the United Nations\nCharter. Distinguished representatives: If your son was\nkilled, and his body was thrown on your doorstep, how\nwould you respond? If your daughter was gang-raped by\nthe soldiers of an occupation army, what would be your\nresponse? The Kashmiri people have the right - under\ninternational law, under our Charter, under our resolutions\n- to resist the Indian army of occupation by all the means\nat their disposal. Their heroic struggle cannot be dismissed\nas terrorism. It is a valiant freedom movement which\ndeserves the full support of the international community.\nPakistan is a party to the Kashmir dispute. Our people\nare incensed at India\u2019s brutal killing of our Kashmiri\nbrothers and sisters. We have, nevertheless, acted with\nrestraint. We have extended moral, political and diplomatic\nsupport to the Kashmiris.\n\nWe have refrained from extending military help to them.\nThe Indian allegations of Pakistan\u2019s support for the\nso-called militants are designed to explain away the\nresilience of the Kashmiri freedom movement, to erode\ninternational sympathy and support for the Kashmiris and,\nmore ominously, to create perhaps a casus belli for a new\naggression against Pakistan.\nThe Kashmir crisis poses a growing threat to\ninternational peace and security. On India\u2019s independence\nday this year, Prime Minister Rao demanded all of\nKashmir. In recent months, Indian politicians and\ngenerals have threatened to launch attacks across the Line\nof Control. India\u2019s violations of the cease-fire have\nescalated. During August alone, the United Nations\nMilitary Observer Group for India and Pakistan\n(UNMOGIP) recorded 142 complaints from Pakistan of\nIndian cease-fire violations. Indian firing across the Line\nof Control is specifically aimed at civilians. In the past\nfive years, over 600 civilians have been killed on our side\nof the line. Pakistan\u2019s self-restraint should not be\nmisunderstood. Indian aggression will have disastrous\nconsequences.\nThere are three priorities in addressing the Kashmir\nquestion: first, to avert the threat of a conflict; secondly,\nto ameliorate the suffering of the Kashmiri people; and,\nthirdly, to open a credible diplomatic process designed to\nachieve a just and peaceful solution to the Kashmir\ndispute.\nTo arrest the threat to peace, I have addressed a\nletter to the President of the Security Council proposing\nthat the United Nations Military Observer Group for India\nand Pakistan should be substantially enlarged from its\npresent size of 35 observers. UNMOGIP should be\nallowed to perform its mandate of patrolling both sides of\nthe Line of Control. This would help to stem cease-fire\nviolations, lower tensions and avoid the danger of a\nconflict. The enlarged United Nations Observer Group\ncould also ascertain the veracity of India\u2019s allegations that\nPakistan is providing military assistance to the Kashmiri\nstruggle. I hope that the Security Council will approve\nour proposal. I hope that India will allow the United\nNations Observers to discharge their mandate of patrolling\non both sides of the Line of Control.\nSecondly, to ameliorate the suffering of the Kashmiri\npeople, India should take some genuine steps to halt its\n12\n\n\nrepression. We note with satisfaction that concern about\nopinion at this Assembly has convinced India to release at\nleast two of the imprisoned Kashmiri leaders. This is a\nvictory for the Kashmiri freedom struggle. These aging and\nailing leaders will, we hope, be allowed to proceed abroad\nfor medical treatment. Shabir Ahmed Shah, who, like\nNelson Mandela, has spent 20 years in prison because of\nhis commitment to freedom, has not been released. The\nworld community must demand the release of this prisoner\nof conscience.\nThere is no evidence that India has given up its\nrepressive strategy in Kashmir. This will become visible\nonce India lifts the Draconian emergency laws operative in\nKashmir, releases all the Kashmiris detained in Indian jails,\nwithdraws a part of its huge force from Kashmir, and\nallows human rights organizations and humanitarian\nagencies free access to the occupied Valley of Kashmir.\nAnd we hope the international community will not forget\nthe victims of Indian atrocities. As in Bosnia and Rwanda,\nthe human rights violations which have been documented\nand reported by impartial agencies must be investigated by\nan international tribunal, and those who are found guilty\nmust be punished.\nFinally, the efforts to promote a political settlement of\nthe Jammu and Kashmir dispute must take into account\nthree realities.\nFirst, the Kashmiri freedom struggle cannot be crushed\nby force. New Delhi\u2019s forecasts of imminent success are\ndesigned to deceive the Indian public and world public\nopinion. The Indian army is caught in a quagmire.\nSecondly, despite India\u2019s assertions about Pakistan\u2019s\ninterference, the Kashmiri struggle is obviously indigenous.\nThe Line of Control in Kashmir has 400 soldiers per\nkilometre. The Indians have wired and mined the Line.\nNothing can get through. United Nations monitoring of the\nLine can verify this. No external force can convince the\nKashmiris to offer the kind of sacrifices being made by\nKashmiri men, women and children in the cause of\nfreedom. For five years the Kashmiris have sustained their\nstruggle. They will continue their struggle even if Pakistan\nwishes otherwise.\nThirdly, no credible Kashmiri group or leader accepts\na \\\"solution\\\" for Kashmir within the Indian Union. The\nso-called political process advertised by India is wishful\nthinking. The All Parties Hurriyat Conference, which\ngroups 34 Kashmiri political parties and organizations, has\nrejected any settlement short of freedom from India.\nArriving in Srinagar after his release two days ago,\nAbdul Ghani Lone said:\n\\\"Any elections to be held in Kashmir are to be\nunder the auspices of the United Nations and ... only\nfor the right of self-determination\\\".\nThe other released Kashmiri leader, Syed Ali Shah Ghani,\nsaid:\n\\\"Elections are no answer to the problem in Kashmir.\nThe people of the State do not accept anything short\nof freedom. There will be no compromise in the\nfight for self-determination\\\".\nIndia\u2019s attempt to organize another fraudulent\nelection in Kashmir will prove abortive. As the Security\nCouncil declared in 1957, such unilateral actions cannot\nbe considered as the basis for the \\\"final disposition\\\" of\nJammu and Kashmir. This can only be done through a\nUnited Nations-supervised plebiscite prescribed by the\nSecurity Council. A final settlement of the Kashmir\ndispute will have to be based on the freely expressed\nwishes of the Kashmiri people. In a paper transmitted to\nIndia last February, Pakistan outlined the possible\nmodalities for ascertaining their wishes.\nPakistan welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s offer to\nexert every possible effort to \\\"facilitate the search for a\nlasting solution to the Kashmir issue\\\" (A/49/1, para. 542).\nWe hope India will also accept the Secretary-General\u2019s\noffer of good offices, as Pakistan has done. Pakistan is\nprepared for talks with India on Kashmir. It was Pakistan\nwhich initiated the Foreign Secretary-level talks. But\nafter six rounds of talks it is evident to us that India\u2019s\nostensible desire for negotiations with Pakistan carries\nlittle credibility while it continues the killing in Kashmir.\nPakistan does not reject dialogue, but it must not be a\ndialogue of the deaf.\nKashmir is a dispute between India and Pakistan.\nEvery dispute between two States is bilateral. It is also\nan international issue. The United Nations is obliged to\ntake cognizance of such disputes, specially when they\ninvolve violations of the United Nations Charter and the\nnon-implementation of Security Council resolutions.\nKashmir is the key to unlocking the problems of\nSouth Asia. Kashmir cannot be brushed aside any longer.\nThe conspiracy of silence must be broken. A resolution\nof the Kashmir situation is required to avoid the danger\nof a conflict. A solution of the Kashmir dispute will also\n13\n\n\nenhance the prospects of conventional arms control and\nnon-proliferation in South Asia.\nMy Government believes that to reduce the danger of\nwar in South Asia it is essential to promote a balance in\nconventional arms between Pakistan and India, at the lowest\npossible levels. India fields the third largest army in the\nworld. Almost all of it is deployed against Pakistan.\nDuring the past decade India was the world\u2019s largest arms\nimporter. Even during the Afghan war, India\u2019s arms\nacquisitions were over five times those of Pakistan.\nPakistan\u2019s defence capabilities have deteriorated further\nsince 1990. Last year, while Pakistan\u2019s defence spending\ndeclined in real terms, India\u2019s increased by 20 per cent.\nPakistan has made several proposals to India for\nconventional arms control: negotiation of a mutually\nagreed ratio of forces; measures to prevent the possibilities\nof a surprise attack, adoption of agreed principles for\nconventional arms control in South Asia.\nPakistan has no desire to expend more of its scarce\nresources on arms. Meaningful arms control and\nconfidence-building measures could also help to stem the\ndanger of a nuclear arms race in our region.\nPakistan\u2019s concern about nuclear proliferation in South\nAsia precedes the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). As\nearly as the mid-1960s Pakistan had warned the world that\nIndia would misuse nuclear cooperation. The late Prime\nMinister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto proposed the creation of a\nSouth Asia nuclear-free zone in 1972. In May 1974 India\nexploded the bomb - ironically calling it the \\\"Smiling\nBuddha\\\". Pakistan made every endeavour to counter\nproliferation in South Asia. Apart from the nuclear-\nweapon-free zone, we advanced subsequent proposals: for\nthe simultaneous signature of the NPT by India and\nPakistan, for acceptance of full-scope safeguards, for joint\nrenunciation of nuclear weapons, for a bilateral test-ban\ntreaty. All have been spurned by India. A proposal made\nby the United States for a conference to promote\nnon-proliferation in South Asia, involving Russia, the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the United States, as well\nas India and Pakistan, was also rejected by New Delhi.\nPakistan has displayed responsibility and restraint in\nthe nuclear field. While we have acquired a certain\ntechnological capability, we have not manufactured or\nexploded a nuclear device. We have not deployed nuclear\nweapons. We have not transferred sensitive technologies.\nTwenty years after exploding its nuclear bomb, India\nis about to take another fateful step towards proliferation:\nthe production and deployment of nuclear-capable ballistic\nmissiles. India is continuing work on its medium-range\nAGNI missile as well as on intercontinental ballistic\nmissiles. It conducted user trials of the short-range\nPrithvi this year. The Prithvi is a mobile missile. Once\nit is produced, Pakistan will have to presume that it has\nbeen deployed.\nIt is still not too late to prevent nuclear-weapon\nproliferation in South Asia. Pakistan suggests two critical\nsteps to avoid this danger.\nFirst, we suggest an agreement between India and\nPakistan not to develop or deploy ballistic missiles.\nIndia\u2019s production and deployment of the Prithvi will\ninvite a matching response from Pakistan. We have\nadvanced the concept of a Zero Missile Zone in South\nAsia. This objective should be endorsed by the world\ncommunity.\nSecondly, we suggest an agreement between India\nand Pakistan not to manufacture or deploy nuclear\nweapons. We hope India will respond positively to this\nlongstanding proposal. We hope it will agree, as a first\nstep, to issue a joint declaration with Pakistan renouncing\nnuclear weapons.\nIt is unfortunate that India and Pakistan have never\nsucceeded in solving any of their disputes through\nbilateral negotiations. Agreements reached on two major\nproblems - the Indus Waters Treaty and the Rann of\nKutch Accord - were made possible by the intercession of\na third party.\nAt this critical moment, when tensions are high and\npeace is threatened in South Asia, the States Members of\nthe United Nations have a fundamental responsibility to\nbring to bear their collective influence to promote\nsolutions to the interlinked problems of Kashmir,\nconventional arms conflict and non-proliferation.\n14\n\n\nPakistan desires good-neighbourly relations with India.\nWe want our people to devote their energies to the vital\ntask of nation-building. We want to banish from our midst\nthe spectre of rampant poverty. We want our people to live\nwith dignity. These goals cannot be attained unless we\nresolve the Kashmir problem and others and build a climate\nof trust and confidence in South Asia.\nPakistan has embarked on a new path of\nsocio-economic revival and growth. We have released the\ndynamism of our private sector. We have created an\neconomic climate that is most hospitable to domestic and\nforeign investment, and the results have been most\ngratifying. Agreements for foreign investment of $4 billion\nwere concluded 10 days ago with a delegation led by the\nUnited States Secretary of Energy. Additional investment\nis likely in the energy, telecommunications, electronics and\nother dynamic sectors of the Pakistan economy.\nToday, Pakistan and all of South Asia have the chance\nto break out of the cycle of poverty and underdevelopment.\nWe must not lose this chance. We must not let history pass\nus by again.\nWe meet on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations. The end of the cold war has released both\npositive and negative forces that were long suppressed.\nThe principles of democracy, human rights and free markets\nhave triumphed. We have celebrated the entry into the\nUnited Nations of many new States, proud and free. The\nvictory of democracy has been achieved in South Africa.\nThe victory of peace may well be realized in the Middle\nEast. Today, there is no threat of a global nuclear war.\nUnprecedented affluence has been achieved in parts of the\nworld. Momentous technological breakthroughs have been\nmade. We now have the potential to achieve global peace,\naddress global problems and promote global prosperity.\nBut even as we celebrate these victories, the triumphs\nof reason and statesmanship, we must confront the dark\nforces of aggression, racism, fascism and bigotry, which\nhave again raised their head in many parts of the world.\nIt is, perhaps, not surprising that once the restraints of\nthe cold war structures were lifted, conflicts and disputes -\nbetween States and within them - should have erupted like\nan epidemic. The world community has been unprepared\nto confront and repel aggression - witness Bosnia,\nAzerbaijan and Kashmir. We have been unable to muster\nthe political will to stop genocide - witness Rwanda. We\nare unprepared to pay the price to help the hungry and save\nthe deprived of the Earth - witness the Sahel.\nThe principal task of this session must be to revive\nhope, to restore the confidence of our peoples, that we,\nthe States Members of the United Nations, acting\ntogether, can build peace where it is broken; that we can\nbring solace to those who are suffering; that we can\nuphold and enforce justice where this is needed; and that\nwe can enlarge the horizons of prosperity to embrace\nthose teeming millions who are imprisoned in poverty.\n"

        "file_text": "France is especially pleased, Mr. President, to see the\nGeneral Assembly meeting under your authority. At the\nend of a year marked by the passing of an extraordinary\nstatesman, President Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, your election has\ngiven the international community another occasion to\nstop and think about the situation in the African continent,\nwhich in recent months has brought us both hope and\ntragedy.\nIn South Africa, a decisive evolutionary process took\nconcrete form this year in the first elections there with\nuniversal suffrage. We can now express our joy at seeing\nthat country take its rightful place in the concert of\nnations. The choice of the South African people, inspired\nby outstanding men to whom France wishes again to pay\na tribute, provides an example for all those who aspire to\ndemocracy, reconciliation and peace and gives them hope.\nIn Rwanda, on the other hand, an unprecedented\ntragedy has set the international community\u2019s\nresponsibility squarely before it. The Assembly is\nfamiliar with the efforts made by France to respond to\nthat tragedy and with the support it managed to find,\nprimarily among the African States. The operation that\nwas carried out enabled us to shelter more than 3 million\nRwandans from the fighting. None the less, we have\nfound it necessary once again to say the word \\\"genocide\\\",\nwhich, almost 50 years after the birth of the United\nNations, amounts to saying that the worst is still possible.\nDuring the darkest years of the Second World War,\nGeneral De Gaulle spoke of the need to establish a world\norder that could guarantee the security of all, to make\nrational use of all the world\u2019s riches and to bring together\nall the people on the face of the Earth. The time has\ncome for us to rediscover the ideal that inspired the\n12\n\n\ngeneration of the founders and to ask ourselves with clarity\nwhat means are necessary to implement it.\nAlmost everywhere in the world we are seeing the\npositive movement of nation-States into groups. France\nhas made the building up of Europe one of the pillars of its\nforeign policy. How could it not, then, encourage the\nformation of new areas of solidarity?\nThe experience of building Europe, which began 40\nyears ago, is a case in point. It has done more than just do\naway with the age-old rivalries that had led to two world\nwars. In the western part of the European continent,\neconomic integration and political cooperation have attained\na level that is unmatched in the world.\nSince the iron curtain ceased to exist, we have been\nprimarily concerned with expanding to all parts of Europe\nthe zone of peace and prosperity resulting from that\nprocess. This explains our desire to speed up the\nintegration of the Central and Eastern European\ndemocracies into the European Union. It also accounts for\nour efforts to organize a partnership with Russia and the\nStates of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\nThe European Union, the Western European Union (WEU),\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)\nare all coooperating in the efforts towards this end.\nFurthermore, it explains France\u2019s initiative, taken up in turn\nby the European Union, to establish a stability pact. This\nis an ambitious exercise in preventive diplomacy, aimed at\nresolving issues of relations between neighbours and of\nminority groups, where such issues persist in the European\ntheatre.\nToday Europe is a world power, as it demonstrated\nduring the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT) negotiations, at which its efforts led, notably, to\nthe establishment of a World Trade Organization (WTO).\nThis is a major success that will benefit all its member\ncountries by putting an end to unilateral practices and\nguaranteeing fair and free trade. Europe is thus assuming\nits international responsibilities. It is actively supporting\nthe peace processes in the Middle East, in southern Africa\nand elsewhere. It has long been involved in the struggle to\nachieve development, particularly through the Lom\u00e9\nConventions. It provides substantial financing everywhere -\nthe most in the world - for peoples mired in humanitarian\ncrises. Its actions prove that a genuine regional power can\nbenefit the entire international community.\nNew regional groups of solidarity are gradually\ntaking shape in all parts of the world. In Africa, France\nsupports the principle of an OAU mechanism for\npreventing, handling and settling conflicts. We are ready\nto help set up a military mechanism to enable the OAU\nto intervene more quickly, under United Nations control,\nin the framework of peace-keeping operations.\nIn South-East Asia, the countries of the Association\nof South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are working to\nstrengthen their economic ties and to establish confidence-\nbuilding measures to reinforce the stability of the region.\nFrance, which through the European Union was present\nat ASEAN\u2019s regional forum on security, held recently in\nBangkok, takes a special interest in the beneficial effects\nthis process should have on the countries of the Indo-\nChinese peninsula.\nOn the American continent, the entry into force of\nthe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\nadds to the dynamism of existing regional organizations,\nold and new.\nThus, perhaps, there may be such a group in the\nMiddle East as well, where progress in the peace process\nallows us to envision the development of intensive\nregional cooperation. The organization of all kinds of ties\namong the countries concerned will help to establish\npeace in the region, as will the search for solutions to the\npolitical problems that are still pending. France can\ntherefore only repeat that we hope to see the boycotts\nfinally ended. Our financial support for the peace\nprocess, as well as our active participation in the\nmultilateral negotiations, including participation in such\nultra-sensitive areas as regional security, reflect this very\nsame conviction.\nAbove and beyond that, France would like to see\nEurope organize a forum for cooperation involving all the\nMediterranean States. We have, on the initiative of\nEgypt, already made a contribution to the coming into\nbeing of the Mediterranean Forum, which recently held its\nfirst meeting in Alexandria. We will make this one of the\nmain goals of the French presidency of the European\nUnion in the first semester of the coming year.\nEverywhere, then, the progress being made in\nprocesses leading to integration and the establishment of\nregional frameworks for cooperation reflects positive\ntrends. These organizations, however, have neither the\nright nor the capability to do everything. It is the United\nNations that is and must remain the sole forum for\n13\n\n\norganizing peace and solidarity throughout the world. It is\nup to the United Nations and to that Organization alone to\nensure international equilibrium since, in the last resort, it\nalone has the power to decide on enforcement measures or\non the use of force. Regional organizations do contribute\nto peace and international stability. They may indeed fulfil\nmissions in preventive diplomacy, but they must then be\ninspired by the principles enshrined in the United Nations.\nAs regards peace-keeping, Chapter VIII of our Charter\nexpressly provides that the United Nations may, in certain\ncircumstances, employ the means at the disposal of the\nregional organizations.\nBut when conflicts become exacerbated, when a crisis\ncalls for a mandatory solution, the Charter requires us to\nturn to the Security Council, the sole authority having\npower to decide on enforcement measures or on the use of\nforce other than for legitimate self-defence. The\njustification for such measures may come only from the\nwill of the international community, and that is why the\nSecurity Council, in our view, must exert its authority and\ncontrol at all stages of operations it may decide upon:\nconception and approval of the mandate, the major phases\nof implementation and the monitoring of implementation.\nThe adoption of a system of mandatory sanctions\nagainst States that breach international legality is also a\nprerogative of the Security Council. But, and we are very\nkeenly aware of this, this concerns serious, exceptional\nmeasures whose purpose must be precisely defined to bring\npressure to bear on a Government to change its attitude.\nThat is the objective in such instances. France therefore\nproposes that in future, when a resolution imposing\nsanctions upon a Member State is to be voted upon, three\nconditions must be met. These are, that all other\ndiplomatic avenues have been explored without success;\nthat the Council resolution state explicitly what actions the\ntargeted State should take in order for the sanctions to be\nlifted; and that the maintenance of the sanctions should be\nsubject to regular review in good faith.\nIn the realm of disarmament, our Organization is once\nagain the sole forum where international commitments may\nbe entered into. Given this perspective, France ascribes\nespecial importance to the speedy ratification of the\nConvention banning chemical weapons - the first\nmultilateral disarmament treaty - and thereby its entry into\nforce in 1995. France hopes to see our Organization make\nprogress towards strengthening the Convention banning\nbiological weapons and to see new efforts made to ban\nanti-personnel mines. I was particularly pleased to hear\nPresident Clinton endorse this very concept in his recent\nstatement to the Assembly. Finally, the requirement for\nnon-proliferation, which North Korea\u2019s attitude compels\nus to take especially seriously, must lead, at the 1995\nConference, to the unconditional and indefinite renewal of\nthe non-proliferation Treaty. In this same vein, France\nreaffirms its support for the decision taken by the General\nAssembly last year to begin negotiations on a\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty that would be\ninternationally and effectively verifiable.\nOver recent years, crisis prevention and crisis\nmanagement have absorbed the greater part of our efforts.\nWe have thus imperceptibly strayed somewhat from what\nwas a major chapter in the history of the United Nations:\nthe North-South dialogue, the major conferences on trade\nand development. France thus proposes that the United\nNations restore development and the struggle to achieve\nit to their central place in its work.\nIt is not a question of repeating what was done in\npast decades. Our approach to development has changed.\nThe work pursued under the auspices of the United\nNations and its agencies has helped to call attention to the\ninterdependence of the economic, demographic, cultural\nand social ramifications of the development question.\nThat is why the main theme conferences devoted to the\nenvironment, to population, to social development and to\nthe status of women are now once again the instruments\nto be used to mobilize for development. Given this\nperspective, France will organize in Paris before the end\nof this year the signing of the Convention on the struggle\nagainst desertification, as well as the Aids Summit.\nThe United Nations alone is capable of ensuring that\nall these efforts be pursued consistently. It has the\nnecessary legitimacy and authority, inasmuch as all the\nmain institutions concerned, including what are known as\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, are part and parcel of the\nUnited Nations system. We therefore consider it\nnecessary to strengthen the links that unite all these\nseparate bodies. In particular, we should ensure that the\npolicies of adjustment carried out under World Bank or\nInternational Monetary Fund auspices take due account of\nthe social requirements of development. France is\ncommitted to doing so in working with its partners, and\nhas recently agreed to a substantial effort to help the franc\nzone countries overcome the short-term effects of the\ndevaluation of the CFA franc.\nThe Economic and Social Council should be the\nplace for ensuring coherence and consistency within these\norganizations. France therefore proposes that the next\n14\n\n\nannual meeting of the Council in Geneva should be an\nopportunity for the ministers of Member States personally\nto undertake a complete examination of the policies\nfollowed by these various institutions with regard to\ndevelopment, and especially to study specific ways by\nwhich they might work together better.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s efforts for renewal and\nclarification through the \\\"Agenda for Development\\\"\nnaturally form part of this global approach. The European\nUnion, for its part, has presented recommendations in its\naide-m\u00e9moire that it believes would enhance that draft.\nFrance intends to take an active part in General Assembly\ndiscussions on this subject.\nThe role of our Organization is no less critical where\nhumanitarian action is involved. France intervenes\nregularly on the ground alongside United Nations agencies,\nand we should like to pay a tribute to the outstanding work\ndone by the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, the World Food Programme and UNICEF,\nworking under tragically difficult circumstances. We were\nable to appreciate in full measure their usefulness as the\nRwandan crisis unfolded. We have had confirmation that\nthe United Nations alone is able to coordinate such difficult\noperations. Naturally, there is need for further progress:\nin shortening the Organization\u2019s reaction time, and in better\nallocating tasks among agencies. But the reform that began\nthree years ago with the establishment of the Department\nfor Humanitarian Affairs is beginning to bear fruit. We are\nindeed on the right track.\nLastly, France would like to stress the underlying\nprinciple of international law: the universality of human\nrights, a principle which may not be challenged in the name\nof any religious, cultural or national specificities. I am all\nthe more ready to say that because France is itself keen on\npreserving its identity and intent on defending it. However\ndifferent people may be, they share the same rights. The\nvery existence of our Organization rests on this principle.\nFrance has consistently urged the acceleration of\nprogress in the field of human rights, by seeking\nrecognition that certain principles must be applied to States\u2019\nactions. I welcome the steps taken by the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights since his designation and\nexpress the hope that the resources made available to him\nwill be commensurate with his mission.\nThe establishment of the International Tribunal for war\ncrimes committed in the former Yugoslavia is a significant\nevent. Until very recently there had been some scepticism\nabout this initiative. Today, thanks to the resolve of the\nTribunal\u2019s judges and prosecutor, it is in place and\nbeginning to examine actual cases being submitted to it.\nFrance supports these efforts and hopes that comparable\ncrimes of genocide that may have been committed in\nRwanda will also lead to the establishment of an\ninternational legal body.\nThe juridical work of the United Nations extends to\nother areas as well. It is designed to address matters of\ninternational trade with a view to making it both freer and\nfairer. In this regard, I have already expressed our\nsatisfaction at the establishment of the World Trade\nOrganization. The signing a few weeks ago of an act that\ncompletes the monumental work done by the United\nNations on the law of the sea is also a historic event.\nIf our Organization is to be able to carry out the\nmany difficult tasks which I have just described, we must\nconstantly work to reform it and adjust the means\navailable to it - in the first place, by strengthening the\nmeans available to the Secretary-General. On behalf of\nFrance, I should like to pay a tribute here to the\nSecretary-General - and this is not a mere formality. We\nhave the good fortune to have at the helm of our\nOrganization a man who, thanks to his ceaseless efforts\nover the past two years, has made progress possible in all\nareas: preventive diplomacy, crisis management,\ndevelopment, the running of the institution. We must\ntherefore give him the means to continue his work.\nThis is true, too, of peace-keeping missions. Recent\nexperience has shown the need to make military forces\navailable to the Secretary-General on very short notice in\nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions. To\nthat end, France wishes to develop a network of stand-by\nforces. On the initiative of the President of the Republic,\nwe have offered to make a standing unit of several\nthousand men available to the United Nations. It is also\nessential for the Secretary-General to be able to control\nthe evolution of peace-keeping missions. To that end,\nFrance recommends systematic recourse to the designation\nof a special representative.\nThe Secretary-General must be able to rely on the\nassistance of prominent and particularly competent\npersons. With regard to management, last year\u2019s\nestablishment of the post of Inspector General marked an\nimportant step forward. We expect further progress to be\nmade this year with the establishment of a committee on\nbudgetary discipline, as I proposed last year from this\nvery rostrum. Lastly, as our Prime Minister has\n15\n\n\nsuggested, France proposes that someone be appointed on\na permanent basis to the Secretary-General\u2019s Office who\nwould deal with the question of the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nOur Assembly is the most universal of international\ninstitutions. Its prestige and authority must therefore be\nstrengthened. To that end, France is making three\nproposals.\nFirst, sessions of the Fifth Committee must be held\nmore closely together in order to ensure better control over\nour finances, particularly with regard to peace-keeping\noperations.\nSecondly, there must be more frequent missions of the\nAssembly to deal with certain crisis situations, as was done\nin the cases of Haiti and South Africa. The financial\nreform of the United Nations, which has been discussed for\nseveral years now, must be set in motion. Following the\nwork of the high-level Working Group established last year\nto consider the question of enlarging the Security Council,\nFrance proposes that a group, led by the President of the\nGeneral Assembly, be set up this year to make proposals\nthat could lead to the financial reform of our Organization.\nThirdly, we must work to achieve the enlargement of\nthe Security Council. This question has already been the\nfocus of in-depth discussions that have clarified the\npositions at issue. For its part, France has no panacea to\noffer, but it believes that the solution must answer the dual\nimperative of efficacy and representativeness.\nOn the one hand, if the Security Council is to function\nefficiently, given its tasks and the circumstances in which\nit intervenes, its capacity to take important decisions\nquickly must clearly be maintained. But the Council must\nalso allow for full public debate in reaching its decisions.\nHence, we are in favour of the Council\u2019s holding official\nmeetings - without of course giving up its informal\nconsultations - to hear Members of the Organization and\ntalk with them before taking positions on the important\nquestions before it. We believe that this is the appropriate\nresponse to the demand for transparency made by many\ndelegations.\nOn the other hand, the Council\u2019s authority and thus its\nefficacy also depend on its representativeness. We\ntherefore favour the enlargement of the Council to include\nnew permanent and non-permanent members. France\nconfirms its support for the desires of Germany and Japan\nto accede to permanent membership. It also considers that\nthe representatives of the developing world should in no\ncase find themselves marginalized by any future reform.\nThe United Nations exists and acts only through the\nwill of its Member States. Though that is obvious it\nbears repeating. Any failure of our Organization is in\nfact the failure of those same States - that is, as my\ncolleague from the United Kingdom stated earlier today,\nour own failure. Its efficacy depends above all on the\ndegree of commitment each of us brings to it.\nWithout the commitment of States there can be no\nsolution to the financial crisis of the United Nations.\nEach of us is aware of the gravity of our Organization\u2019s\nfinancial situation. Each of us also knows that this\ncritical situation is not the result solely of the sum total of\nexpenditures. The real source of our crisis is well known:\nit is the negligence of States which do not pay their\ncontributions or do not pay them in full.\nOf course, we welcome the fact that one of the main\ncontributor countries has decided to pay a substantial part\nof its arrears, thereby bringing temporary relief to the\nOrganization\u2019s financial situation. We can understand\nwhy some Member States are requesting that the scale of\ncontributions be adjusted in order better to reflect real\nabilities to pay. France hopes that at the present session\nthe General Assembly will address the revision of this\nscale in accordance with the principle of fairness and in\na spirit of consensus.\nBut fairness also requires swifter and more\nsubstantial reimbursement to States that provide the troops\nnecessary to peace-keeping operations and are therefore\nthe primary victims of late payments. The situation in\nwhich some in fact pay twice while others do not pay at\nall must come to an end. France therefore asks once\nagain that a working group be established and mandated\nto propose all the measures that can encourage tardy\nStates to pay their arrears.\nAnd without the commitment of States there cannot\nbe any solution to international instability. France has\nmade considerable efforts to help resolve crises that have\nthreatened the international order over the past few years.\nIt has been the first and is now the second largest troop\ncontributor to the United Nations. It has well-known\nexperience in the three areas of preventive diplomacy,\npeace-keeping and humanitarian action. Obviously,\nFrance does not wish to lecture anyone, but its own\ncommitment does permit it to say that the readiness of\n16\n\n\nStates does not meet the demands made today upon our\nOrganization.\nNeed we cite all the circumstances in which the non-\nparticipation or temporizing of States has compromised\naction mandated by the Security Council? How many\nweeks did we have to wait last year for the military\narrangements provided for under Security Council\nresolution 824 (1993) on safe areas in Bosnia were finally\nin place? We all remember that, during the Rwandan\ncrisis, the decision taken by the Security Council in mid-\nMay to strengthen the United Nations Assistance Mission\nfor Rwanda had yet to be implemented two months later.\nRather than dwelling on these disappointments,\nhowever, France wishes to pay tribute to all those States\nthat have shown, by their commitment and sense of\ninternational solidarity, that the United Nations can prove\nthat it is effective. The African countries that chose to\nshare with us the risks involved in the operation in Rwanda;\nthe United States, which is working in Haiti to effect the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 940 (1994);\nthe States whose soldiers stand with ours in the United\nNations Protection Force: it is thanks to them that there\nremains a chance for peace in the former Yugoslavia,\ndelayed only by the stubbornness of the Bosnian Serb\nleaders. France expects that the greatest of firmness will be\nused in dealing with these most recent warmongers. But\nthe change in position of the other parties, and in particular\nthe authorities in Belgrade, makes it incumbent upon us to\ncontinue to seek a negotiated settlement. In this spirit, we\nappeal to Presidents Izetbegovic, Tudjman and Milosevic,\nwho have all accepted the peace plan for Bosnia, to resume\nthe direct dialogue necessary for a comprehensive\nsettlement. Otherwise, the international community must be\nprepared to propose the terms of a comprehensive, just and\nlasting settlement, taking into account the legitimate\ninterests of the various communities that made up the\nformer Yugoslavia and must enjoy equal rights.\nBringing to trial those responsible for war crimes is a\nmoral imperative to which France is committed. We must\nabove all make the people in the former Yugoslavia\nunderstand that there are prospects for the future other than\nendless violence and vengeance. That is France\u2019s message.\nThat is the reason for the commitment of our soldiers in\nBosnia and, sadly, the sacrifice of several dozen of them.\nThere is nothing pre-ordained about failure to get involved,\nor inertia. There is a strong will at the heart of our\nOrganization. Therefore France appeals to all Member\nStates to mark the fiftieth anniversary with a genuine\nrenewal of commitment.\nVoices are being raised today urging our\nOrganization to show greater realism in defining the\nmissions that it has to carry out. In appealing to Member\nStates to mobilize, France wishes to reaffirm its\nunwavering conviction that, in the face of the challenges\nto the international community, realism consists not in\nbeing less ambitious but in ensuring that we have the\nmeans fully to achieve our ambitions. They must not be\nlimited to what seems possible; they must be to make\npossible what is obviously necessary. It is in this spirit\nthat France will continue actively to play its role within\nthe United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure that I join the previous speakers\nin congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of this Assembly. The great African country\nthat you represent, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, has always played an\nactive and constructive role in our Organization. We are\ndelighted to have you presiding over our proceedings.\n8\n\n\nMy German ministerial colleague, Mr. Klaus Kinkel,\nspoke this morning on behalf of the European Union. The\nviews of my delegation are faithfully reflected in his\nstatement and, consequently, there is no need for me to\naddress the positions he has outlined.\nFive years ago the talk was of a new international\norder. The events that shook Eastern Europe at that time\nled us to believe that the old bipolar world had expired and\nthat another order was bound to take its place. For some,\nthe reaction to the aggression against Kuwait marked the\nbeginning of this new phase. Reality did not live up to our\nhopes. Today we have come to understand that the\nequilibrium based on a bipolar world did not have a\n\\\"natural successor\\\" and that it is up to us to build a new\none, little by little, through trial and error.\nOf course, a new equilibrium is emerging in several\nparts of the world.\nFirst, there is the highly symbolic case of the Middle\nEast. Even if implementation of the Washington and Cairo\nagreements is proving as arduous as was expected, every\nnew stage constitutes an important step towards lasting\npeace. The historic rapprochement between Israel and\nJordan strengthens this prospect.\nThe new South Africa, too, is facing immense\nchallenges, but at the same time it has become a beacon of\nhope for the entire African continent.\nThe strengthening of democracy and the progress\nmade in regional integration in Latin America seem to us\nyet another meaningful evolution. A number of countries\nin this region have now found the way towards sustainable\neconomic development.\nThe same holds true for Asia, where, moreover, a\nreadiness for dialogue now exists. The regional Forum\nlaunched by the Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN), contacts on the Korean peninsula and, at another\nlevel, the dialogue between the two sides of the Formosa\nStrait all contribute towards a new climate of confidence.\nWhile preparing to welcome four new members, the\nEuropean Union has signed cooperation agreements with\nthe majority of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe\nthat might ultimately lead to full membership.\nSimultaneously, new geostrategic ties are being forged with\nRussia.\nThe same will for dialogue is reflected in the\ndiscussion of major issues that concern the future of our\nOrganization, such as reform of the Security Council.\nEven if divergences of opinion remain on various points,\nthe sense of common interest prevails.\nBelgium\u2019s major concern remains the achievement\nof a more representative Council without diminishing its\ndecision-making capacity. We prefer therefore to avoid\nambitious projects that would give privileged status to\nseveral \\\"regional Powers\\\" according to imprecise criteria\nbut would not reinforce the Council\u2019s ability to shoulder\nits responsibilities.\nWhy not, as a first step, adapt the Council\u2019s\nmembership on the basis of unanimously agreed criteria?\nThe international community could, as a measure with\nimmediate advantageous effect, grant an additional\nnon-permanent seat to the regions that consider\nthemselves to be underrepresented and confer permanent\nmember status on those two economic Powers whose\npositive contribution to world affairs has long been\nrecognized.\nThese steps, however encouraging, do not by\nthemselves constitute a new international agreement.\nProgress and the readiness for rapprochement are by no\nmeans universal: Central Africa and Bosnia and\nHerzegovina are cases in point.\nThe situation in Rwanda is uppermost in our minds.\nThe threat it represents of destabilization in Burundi and\nthe neighbouring countries has become a constant cause\nfor worry in recent months. However deep the hatred\nborn of the recent or the distant past, reconciliation is the\nonly alternative. We appeal to the leaders and prominent\ncitizens of these countries to unite their efforts to broaden\nthe base of political power and to stand firm against\nextremists. Only when these conditions are met can\nemergency aid make way for durable reconstruction.\nNaturally, my country will contribute to each stage of this\nrenewal.\nThe civil war in the former Yugoslavia has cast first\nEurope and then the entire world into profound disarray.\nYet for more than three years now, we have been\nworking relentlessly to put an end to this tragedy. The\nUnited Nations Protection Force has become one of the\nlargest peace-keeping missions ever set up by our\nOrganization. The United Nations and the European\nUnion have worked together tirelessly to find a negotiated\nsolution. The main Powers have now added their weight\n9\n\n\nto these efforts. Let us hope that the latest attempt by the\nEuropean Union, the United States and the Russian\nFederation will finally succeed in halting the bloodshed.\nFrom this rostrum I call upon the parties to seize this\nopportunity: put an end to madness and let peace return.\nI have just touched upon two cases of civil war where\nracial hatred has led to particularly inhumane behaviour.\nMore than ever, we must remain unyielding when human\nrights are systematically violated. We must aim to banish\nevery regime that is based on practices of \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\".\nSo that this lesson may never be forgotten, Belgium\nfavours the establishment of an international penal\njurisdiction and expresses the wish that the international\ncommunity do whatever is necessary to render it\noperational as soon as possible. In the meantime, we\nbelieve that the Tribunal created to judge the war crimes\nperpetrated in the former Yugoslavia will stand as a\nvaluable precedent, which we would like to see extended to\nthe crimes committed in Rwanda as soon as possible.\nAlong the same lines, my Government welcomes the\nappointment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nThe operational initiatives launched by Mr. Ayala Lasso -\nsending human rights monitors to Rwanda, for instance -\nhave received early and concrete support from Belgium,\namong others. I am convinced that Mr. Ayala Lasso\u2019s\nactions will strengthen the respect for human rights and\npromote a successful dialogue among political leaders and\nhuman rights activists in every part of the world. This\ndialogue will take into account the differing approaches\ninspired by various cultures and religions, but in my\nopinion, it would lose its meaning if it were to compromise\non the one essential point: the respect owed to the physical\nand moral integrity of every human being.\nFor Belgium, the crisis in Rwanda has marked the\ninternational agenda. In the wake of the genocide, death\nlashed out blindly at a population in exile, pushing back the\nlimits of horror already reached in Bosnia and Somalia.\nMy fellow citizens were deeply troubled by the ruin of so\nmany efforts of development, the failure of so many\nattempts at reconciliation. The savage killing of 10 Belgian\n\\\"blue helmets\\\", who were among the 100 United Nations\npeace-keepers slain since the beginning of this year,\nhighlights the unmistakable fragility of peace-keeping\noperations. I believe the best way to honour all those who\nlost their lives is by reflecting in particular upon the limits\nand possibilities of international action.\nIn this regard, the common experience in which\nBelgium took part - in the former Yugoslavia, in Somalia\nand in Rwanda - has enabled us, sometimes in tragic\ncircumstances, to make a number of observations for\nfuture use. I intend to group them around four principles\nthat seem to me essential. First: peace-keeping\noperations cannot be improvised. Second: once decided,\nthey should be given the means to achieve their aims.\nThird: for these means to function fully, we should\nensure their operational and political coherence. And,\nfinally, as long as the security of the personnel involved\ncannot be guaranteed, it will become increasingly difficult\nto find troop contributors for peace-keeping missions,\nwhich will thereby reduce them to a purely theoretical\ninstrument.\nFirst, the principle of \\\"non-improvisation\\\" implies\ntwo things.\nThe first is that the Organization must at all times be\nable to mobilize the necessary means for a peace-keeping\noperation and to this end rely on the solidarity of all its\nmembers. This means that it is essential to reinforce the\nmilitary peace-keeping capacity of the Organization. In\nthe absence of a United Nations multilateral force that can\nbe deployed quickly, generalized offers of stand-by troops\nand equipment and standardization of equipment and\nprocedures are objectives we must pursue diligently. To\nthis end I have sent the Secretary-General a list of\npossible Belgian contributions which could be made\navailable for peace-keeping operations.\nThe second implication is that, even though\nsolidarity remains the basis for conceiving and\nimplementing peace-keeping, this solidarity cannot be\nblind and automatic. Each specific operation must be the\nresult of careful consideration.\nThe launching of a new peace-keeping operation\nshould only be envisaged and seriously considered when\nall other means of solving the crisis have been exhausted,\nincluding at the regional level. Chapter VI, as well as\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", offer a wide choice of\ninstruments for solving a crisis through negotiation,\narbitration, and so on. Those who forget that\npeace-keeping operations are not a panacea do the\nOrganization a disservice and often unwittingly contribute\nto making situations worse rather than solving them.\nOnce it has been decided by the Security Council, a\npeace-keeping operation becomes everybody\u2019s business.\nAll Member States must contribute according to their\n10\n\n\npossibilities and as circumstances dictate. Of course,\nMember States must retain the sovereign right to decide\nwhether or not to participate in a given peace-keeping\noperation, but in so doing, they should look beyond the\ncriterion of national interest.\nAll States should cooperate actively with a view to the\nsuccess of the operation by facilitating its movements,\nsupplies, reinforcements and the prepositioning of reserve\ntroops. All States should use their diplomatic influence to\nhelp the Secretary-General achieve the political objectives\nof an operation. And, finally, all States must adhere to\ntheir financial obligations with respect to an operation.\nSecondly, a peace-keeping operation must be based on\nthe consent of the parties, appropriate flexibility and\nadequate information.\nEvery operation must be based on consensus among\nthe States legitimately involved. The conflicting parties\nthemselves must agree to the deployment and aims of the\noperation, except in the case of an obvious humanitarian\ncatastrophe. In this all-too-frequent case, the Security\nCouncil\u2019s decision to act outside the framework of the\ntraditional mandate and disregard the three usual\nconditions - in other words, agreement by the parties, the\npolitical process and a cease-fire - must be taken with great\ncare. The Council must express this decision clearly in the\nmandate and accept all its consequences.\nAn operation must at all times have the strength\nnecessary to execute its mission safely. This rule is of\nutmost importance. It implies, to begin with, sufficient\nmanpower and flexible rules of engagement to respond to\nthe unexpected. It also implies adequate equipment to fulfil\nthe mandate and to react to emergencies. The deployment\nof a military reserve in the vicinity has already proven its\nusefulness, for example, in Somalia. It is a precautionary\nmeasure we should envisage more often in the future. As\na rule, a force subject to local provocation must always\nhave the choice between evacuating or remaining in place,\nbetween retreat or riposte.\nBut the use of force is not the first option to be\nconsidered in order to discourage resistance to a\npeace-keeping operation. Education and persuasion will do\nmiracles among populations that are often ill-informed or\neven misguided about the objectives of a peace-keeping\noperation. Experience has shown that it is absolutely\nnecessary to develop a coherent information strategy. Each\npeace-keeping operation should be provided with an\ninformation unit and a radio transmitter to broadcast its\nmessage. Moreover, the ability to neutralize hostile\npropaganda sources should be put to use each time this\npropaganda threatens the safety of part of a population or\nUnited Nations personnel.\nThe third consideration is that the cohesion of the\ncommand and control structures and consultations on a\nregular basis with troop-contributing countries are\nconditions essential to the success of an operation.\nThe military and political control of an operation\nmust rest with the United Nations or with a duly\nmandated body. This principle has two consequences.\nAny attempt by the Commander of the Force or of\na small contingent to report directly only to national\nauthorities will reduce the cohesion of the multilateral\noperation. The flexibility required by a commander in the\nfield to deal with the unexpected, however, is a different\nmatter.\nWhen an action is undertaken by a regional or\nmultilateral force it must be authorized by the Security\nCouncil. However, this authorization should not reduce\nthe operational autonomy of the commanders of such an\noperation. Those who take the risk must be in control.\nMoreover, for each operation a consultation\ncommittee should be created in which troop contributors,\nthe members of the Security Council and the Secretariat\ncan meet at regular intervals. This committee will enable\nthe contributors better to assist the Secretariat in\nmanaging the operation.\nIt will also generate a real dialogue between\ncontributors and the members of the Council, each time\nthe latter prepare to take a decision which modifies the\nbasic conditions of the operation. Contributors often have\na better knowledge of the situation in the field and are\nbest placed to judge whether a new task is feasible or\nacceptable. Without troop contributors the resolutions of\nthe Council would remain ineffectual.\nAs a fourth and last consideration, the security of the\nblue helmets is as much a concern of the contributing\ncountries as of the Secretariat. The prosecution of those\nwho attack the peace-keeping forces must be efficiently\norganized.\nThe responsibility of a Government for its contingent\ndoes not stop with its dispatch to the field of operations.\nThe contributing country has the right to watch over the\n11\n\n\nsafety of its compatriots at all times. Ultimately, security\nmust be the decisive factor for a contributing country to\ncontinue or suspend its participation in a peace-keeping\noperation.\nIt seems normal, therefore, that a troop contributor\nshould be entitled to equip its contingent from the start with\nsufficient defensive armament. Later, when unexpected\ncircumstances place the contingent in a situation of real\ndanger, the Security Council and the Secretary-General\nmust immediately adapt the mandate and, if necessary, the\nrules of engagement to that situation.\nIt is a fundamental duty of the United Nations to\norganize the international prosecution of those who attack\nUnited Nations personnel. The impunity granted so far to\nthe perpetrators of such crimes gives rise to an uneasy\nfeeling and undermines the credibility of the United Nations\nin the eyes of world opinion. The authority of our\nOrganization over those whom it is trying to reconcile is\nnegatively affected by this, and the Governments that\ncontribute troops are increasingly worried. In our opinion,\nit is essential to speed up the adoption of a convention on\nthe security of United Nations personnel, as well as of the\ninvestigations and the effective prosecution of those who\nattack our personnel.\nI hope that these thoughts that I have shared with the\nAssembly will contribute to improving the procedures and\nreinforcing the means put into effect by our Organization to\nface up to the new situations that it needs to tackle. In\nfact, these changes deserve to be formalized when any\nrevision of the Charter takes place. The functioning of the\npeace-keeping operations would be greatly improved by\nthis.\nAlexis de Tocqueville wrote:\n\\\"Amongst the laws that govern human societies, there\nis one that seems clearer and more precise than all\nothers. If men are to remain civilized, or become so,\nthe art of association must grow and improve at the\nsame rate as the equality of their conditions\\\".\nThough this \\\"art of association\\\" affects civil societies in the\nfirst place, it is also, and more than ever, a concern of our\nsociety of Governments. Launching peace-keeping\noperations is without doubt a most generous expression of\nthis art of acting together.\nIn the meantime, the fact that we have been able to\nmultiply peace-keeping operations in difficult political,\nfinancial and material circumstances is nothing short of\nmiraculous and prompts us to pay tribute to all the people\nwho have been working tirelessly within the Secretariat as\nwell as in the field.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Ghana\ndelegation, I have the honour and pleasure of conveying to\nyou, Sir, our congratulations on your election, by\nacclamation, as President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session. Your election is an honour not only to\nyou personally but also to your country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, with\nwhich Ghana shares a common destiny and, happily, enjoys\nvery warm, cordial and special relations. You will no\ndoubt be equal to the task, given your disposition and your\nrecord of distinguished service to your Government and\ncountry and to the international community.\nAllow me also to place on record our appreciation of\nthe effective leadership that your predecessor as President,\nHis Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, provided\nfor the Organization during his stewardship. His ability to\nnavigate the General Assembly through the difficult\ndiscussions on the restructuring and revitalization of the\nOrganization \u2014 particularly those on the reform of the\nSecurity Council \u2014 and the skill that he demonstrated\nduring the world hearings on the proposed Agenda for\nDevelopment are indelible marks of his stewardship.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nhas continued to remain on top of his very challenging\nand delicate task as the chief executive of the\nOrganization. His abilities and skills as a thinker,\nadministrator and accomplished diplomat have been assets\nto the United Nations. The dedication and commitment\nof his staff have been equally noteworthy.\nIn discharging its primary responsibility to promote\ninternational peace and security the United Nations has\nhad successes and disappointments. Exploitation of the\ninherent weaknesses of the Charter, lack of good faith,\ngreed and the quest for domination characterized the era\nof the cold war which, happily, appears to be coming to\nan end. However, conflicts that threaten international\npeace and security exist and are multiplying; some are\nlegacies of the cold war and others the result of the\nfailure of the international community to create the\neconomic and social conditions for international peace\nand security. Other contributing factors include inordinate\npersonal ambition, ethnicity, nationalism, religious\nintolerance and political adventurism.\nThanks to the end of the cold war, the political\nlandscape in Europe has changed and has impacted\npositively, if only with partial success, on Cambodia,\nMozambique and, most important of all, the Middle East.\nThe Angolan problem appears to be nearing a solution.\nAt long last, UNITA is getting the message that the\ninternational community abhors its commitment to\nmilitarism and appreciates the political maturity and spirit\nof compromise of the Angolan Government. Although\ncertain cold-war-era conflicts such as Cyprus, Korea and\nAfghanistan are proving difficult to solve, one must take\ncomfort in the fact that the Koreas are agreed on the basis\nof reunification of their country and that, after decades of\nconflict and anxiety, South Africa is now a non-racial,\ndemocratic country. We take this opportunity to welcome\nits delegation into our midst. The contribution of the\nUnited Nations in the solution of these conflicts is\nimmense, but one must also recognize that no progress\nwould have been possible without the exemplary\nstatesmanship of the leaders involved in their solution.\n10\n\n\nThe end of the cold war, coupled with the strains of\nnation-building, have produced new threats to peace in parts\nof the former Soviet Union, in Yugoslavia and in Africa.\nHorror stories have emerged from Bosnia, Liberia, Rwanda\nand Somalia. Some of the problems seem to have no\nimmediate prospect of solution. Somalia and Liberia are\ncoming close to being written off as Afghanistan has been.\nTo an increasing degree regional organizations and small\nStates like Ghana are being called upon to bear the burden\nof securing a peaceful world, a burden far above their\nmeans. In such situations success depends largely upon\nsupport from the more endowed members of the\ninternational community, either through the United Nations\nor on a direct bilateral basis.\nIn Liberia, Ghana and a few other countries members\nof the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) are groaning under the burden of helping the\nLiberians maintain a nation. In Rwanda, in the heat of\nbattle Ghana and Canada were left alone to grapple with a\nhorror situation without adequate material support. Even\nafter the international community was shamed into action,\nlogistic support has not been particularly prompt or\nadequate.\nGhana takes pride in its peace-keeping role. From the\nCongo crisis in the early 1960s up until now it has\ndemonstrated the will and readiness to come to the help of\nnations in distress. We are willing to continue to discharge\nour responsibilities if adequate material support can be\nforthcoming from the international community, particularly,\nits wealthy members. Given the unwillingness of many\nnations to get involved in conflicts far from their shores\nand in respect of which their national interests are not\nmanifest to their electorate, the option for the international\ncommunity is to support countries such as Ghana and\nregional organizations such as ECOWAS and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to defend the ideals\nof the United Nations.\nWith President Rawlings\u2019s assumption of the\nchairmanship of ECOWAS Ghana is directly face to face\nwith the ambitions, rivalries, prejudices, misconceptions and\nlack of common purpose even within ECOWAS and with\nthe misrepresentations that have made the solution of this\nproblem elusive. We must pay a tribute to our predecessors\nas Chairmen of ECOWAS who have had to grapple with\nthe problem. We have recently gathered the warring\nfactions in Akosombo to push the peace process forward.\nWe have taken note of the misconceptions and attempts to\nundermine this latest effort. However, with persistence,\npatience, firmness and transparency, we hope we can make\nsignificant progress in the coming year. What we ask of\nthe Liberians is sincerity and the spirit of compromise.\nFrom the international community, we will appreciate\nmoral, material and diplomatic support and an\nunderstanding of the complexities of the problem.\nPeace-keeping is crowding the international agenda\nto such a degree that we seem to be losing our ability to\nfocus on the unfinished business of disarmament. The\nproliferation of conflicts generates insecurity and\ncompounds the disarmament problem. Both problems,\nhowever, must be resolved simultaneously. The process\nof eliminating nuclear weapons needs to be speeded up to\nmake the extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) an attractive proposition for\nnon-nuclear Powers. Bilateral efforts at disarmament,\nsuch as those under way between the United States of\nAmerica and the Russian Federation, need to be situated\nin the general context of multilateral diplomacy.\nIt is no accident that conflicts abound in the\ndeveloping world and the economically backward areas of\nEurope. At the root of all these conflict situations and\nthe threats to peace and security are economic deprivation\nand abject poverty. It is not necessary to restate the\ngruesome statistics of the conditions of the poor \u2014 the\nhigh mortality rates, the malnutrition, the inadequate\nhealth facilities, ignorance and poor housing. These\nconditions are compounded by a seriously inequitable\nsystem of international trade with its attendant problems,\nincluding the debt burden. Unequal access to knowledge,\ntechnology and resources has accentuated the already\nunacceptable socio-economic inequalities both within and\namong nations.\nThe issue of external debt is primary in its\nconstraining effects on economic growth in Africa. The\nvast majority of lower-income countries which owe debts\ntotalling $1.3 trillion are in sub-Saharan Africa.\nSub-saharan Africa alone is overburdened with debt\nservicing to the tune of $200 billion representing 10 per\ncent of the total national income of the 43 countries\ninvolved. It is not sheer coincidence that Africa plays\nhost to a sizeable number of United Nations\npeace-keeping operations.\nThe scale of Africa\u2019s debt and the effect it has\nproduced in our economies requires action by the\ninternational community. The international accord\nembodied in the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa, which contains a strategy to\nrelaunch African economies on the path of growth and\n11\n\n\nrecovery, has hardly had any noticeable effect a year after\nits adoption. The international community is yet to\ndischarge its obligations under the international accord. No\nagreement has been reached on the modalities for the\ncreation of a diversification fund for Africa as called for by\nthe various studies initiated by well-known bodies of the\nUnited Nations. This is regrettable.\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral\ntrade negotiations was no doubt a historic achievement. It\nholds prospects of opening up possibilities of trade\nliberalization and long-term growth. It is, however, equally\ntrue \u2014 and probably more significant \u2014 to note that trade\nis possible only after production. A lot of factors constrain\nthe ability and capacity of developing countries, particularly\nin Africa, to take advantage of international arrangements\nsuch as those concluded under the Uruguay Round.\nBecause of our conviction that the underlying\nsocio-economic factors of the threat to peace and security\nshould be seriously addressed by the international\ncommunity, the Government of Ghana strongly supports the\nholding of the World Summit for Social Development in\nCopenhagen, Denmark, from 6-12 March 1995. However,\nit should not be an occasion for an attempt to impose a set\nof social values on the international community, nor should\nit be an opportunity to malign the cultural practices of any\ngroup of people. It should be an occasion for mutual\nunderstanding to pave the way for a charter for social\nprogress.\nGhana also attaches great importance to the\nforthcoming Fourth World Conference on Women,\nscheduled to take place in Beijing in September 1995, as\npart of the process of furthering peace and security. We\nrecognize the increasingly evident correlation between the\nadvancement of women and economic development and\nsocial stability. We hope the Conference will help\naccelerate the removal of obstacles to women\u2019s full and\nequal participation in all spheres of life and enable them to\nplay an active role in the global restructuring of economic,\npolitical, social and cultural relations as we approach the\ntwenty-first century.\nThe increased responsibilities of the United Nations in\npeace-keeping, the expansion of the Organization and the\ndemise of the Soviet Union as a super-Power have\nhighlighted the need for the Organization\u2019s restructuring.\nIn this exercise we must keep two things in mind. We\nmust not undermine the validity of the basic principles of\nthe Organization, such as the sovereign equality of States\nand non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.\nNot even the current preoccupation with democracy and\nhuman rights should be allowed to erode these principles\nany more than is absolutely essential. And we must\navoid allowing the Security Council to become the\ninstrument for the foreign policy objectives of certain\nPowers. We must fight neo-colonialist tendencies\nexemplified in the economic blockade of Cuba and the\nquestionable imposition of sanctions against the Great\nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. There is no\nbasis in international law for these actions, which result\nin misery for the ordinary people of these countries and\nrestrain intercourse between nations. Reasonable proposals\nfor an end to these problems have been made which we\nhope will find general acceptance.\nThe United Nations, particularly the Security\nCouncil, needs to be restructured in order to reduce the\nvulnerability of small nations to big-Power pressure and\nto reflect their increased roles, particularly in the area of\npeace-keeping, as well as the realities of power today.\nThe increased role of the United Nations in peace-keeping\nhas called for the establishment of machinery within the\nSecretariat to improve efficiency. In response to the\nproposal contained in the Secretary-General\u2019s report, \u201cAn\nAgenda for Peace\u201d, the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council have adopted a number of measures and\ndecisions which should enhance the Organization\u2019s ability\nto maintain international peace and security. However, a\nlot of work remains to be done. We hope that by its\nfiftieth anniversary the United Nations will be sufficiently\nreformed and revitalized to command universal respect\nand cooperation.\nIn the final analysis, however, resources \u2014 financial\nand otherwise \u2014 will determine the effectiveness of the\nOrganization. The financial situation of the Organization\nremains a source of concern. Members of the\nOrganization should redouble their efforts to ensure its\nsolvency so that the Secretary-General can effectively\nimplement the mandates of the legislative bodies.\nThe Members, for their part, expect prudence and\ndiscipline in the application of the resources made\navailable to the Organization. The consolidation of the\ninternal oversight mechanisms into the Office of Internal\nOversight Services, together with the existing external\noversight mechanisms, should help reduce waste and\nensure accountability.\nGhana reiterates its belief in the unity of the\npurposes of the Charter and wishes to stress the need for\nthe Organization to address global development issues\n12\n\n\nwith the same vigour as that with which it has approached\nthe issues of global peace and security. It is the hope and\nexpectation of Ghana that this forty-ninth session will mark\nthe beginning of the renaissance of the United Nations,\nready to demonstrate, more in action than in words, its\ndetermination to maintain peace and promote prosperity on\nthe basis of justice, law and respect for the dignity and\nworth of the human person.\n"

        "file_text": "May I begin by warmly congratulating you, Sir,\non your election to the presidency of the forty-ninth session\nof the United Nations General Assembly. I would also like\nto express my appreciation to your predecessor,\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, and to thank him for his\ncontribution to accomplishing the tasks of the last session.\nFurther, I wish to express our gratitude to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the\nvision with which he has guided the Organization and for\nhis tireless efforts to ensure the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security.\nThe collapse of the old order and the emergence of\nnew democracies in Central and Eastern Europe and, soon\nafter, in the former Soviet Union have presented the\nworld with a major challenge. In a period of tremendous\nchange, many difficulties and conflicts have arisen. Some\nof these difficulties come as immediate by-products of\nrapid and haphazard transformations, while others are\nsurfacing for the first time after decades of inadequate\nstop-gap measures. Further, if the reform programmes\nhave so far failed to yield all the benefits expected, this\nis also due to an under-estimation of the differences in the\ninitial conditions of the countries in transition.\nThe pace and comprehensiveness of economic\nreforms will vary from country to country. However, the\nreform process will inevitably be lengthy, as it involves\nwholesale changes in price mechanisms, in the concept of\nproperty, in industrial structures and in legal, commercial\nand financial institutions, as well as the creation of social\nsafety nets for the most vulnerable segments of the\npopulation, whose situation will be worsened by the high\ncost of the reforms.\nAs with all the former Soviet Republics, Armenia\u2019s\neconomy has been badly strained by the changes which\nfollowed the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the\ndifficult transition to a market economy. It is further\ncrippled by its over-reliance on trade with the former\nSoviet Republics; the blockade of transportation routes\nimposed by neighbouring Azerbaijan; an embargo by\nTurkey; and the damage inflicted by the disastrous\nearthquake in 1988. Other external conditions, such as\n\n\nthe disruption of transport due to the difficulties faced by\nGeorgia, have exacerbated the situation, contributing to the\ndecline in Armenia\u2019s industrial productivity. The legacy of\nthe Soviet period, with its inefficiencies and excessive\nhorizontal integration, has worsened the effects of the\nblockade.\nDespite these difficulties, the Armenian Government\nhas begun implementing significant structural reforms to\ncreate a healthy market economy, beginning with the\nprivatization process launched soon after the Armenian\nNational Movement came to power in 1990. Indeed, the\ncommitment to transform the centrally planned economy\ninto a market economy stems from the philosophy of the\ndemocratic movement in Armenia and is seen as an integral\npart of the transition to a democratic State.\nIn turn, a free market economy will flourish in a stable\ndemocracy, able to promote and underpin economic\ndevelopment. Armenia today is a country with more than\n30 registered political parties. It has proclaimed freedom\nof the press, freedom of conscience and freedom of\nreligion, and it has laws guaranteeing civil and political\nrights. Three free elections have already been held in\nArmenia: parliamentary and presidential elections and a\nreferendum on independence. The upcoming referendum\non the Constitution and the elections of the National\nAssembly and the President of the Republic will reaffirm\nthe establishment of a democratic tradition.\nDemocracy is fundamental to the process of economic\ntransformation, which can be divided into three phases,\nmore or less typical for all countries in transition:\ninstitutional reforms; long-term investments and changes of\ntechnological structures; and integration into international\nmarkets. It is imperative, however, to set priorities and to\nidentify the most pressing issues of the moment. In my\nopinion, Armenia is at the end of the first phase, which\nincludes the creation of a legal framework for economic\nreform, within which private economic activity can take\nplace, a framework ensuring that contracts are enforced and\nthat private property is protected; freeing of prices;\nprivatization; adoption of a national currency; financial and\nbudgetary stabilization; and improvement in the balance of\npayments. We have already accomplished 80 per cent of\nthis phase.\nArmenia has distinguished itself as the first among the\nformer Soviet Republics to privatize the ownership of\nagricultural land and livestock production. The\nprivatization of small and medium businesses as well as\nlarge enterprises is well under way. In late 1993, with the\ncollapse of the rouble zone, Armenia faced a monetary\ncrisis. The uncontrollable flow of old Soviet roubles into\nArmenia and Armenia\u2019s subsequent inability to control\nmonetary policy on its own territory forced the\nGovernment in November 1993 prematurely to introduce\na national currency, the dram. The Government is\ncurrently implementing a programme based on controlling\nand lowering the inflation rate, enforcing a strict budget,\ncontrolling fiscal expenditures and targeting assistance to\nthe most vulnerable groups.\nBasic reforms have been undertaken in the banking\nsector, the first of which was to break down the mono-\nbank system of central planning into a two-tiered system\ncomprising a central bank and a group of commercial\nbanks.\nIn Armenia, as in all the emerging democracies,\nthere is no historical precedent for the economic\ntransition. It requires lasting commitment and patience as\nwell as the substantial support of the international\ncommunity. Of course neither short- and medium-term\nadjustment programmes nor long-term development\nstrategies can hope to succeed fully without sustained\ngrowth in the world economy and favourable external\nconditions.\nWe recognize that there is no single model of\ntransition to be prescribed for all countries or, even more\nnarrowly, for all post-communist societies as a whole. To\nensure success for United Nations efforts in the countries\nin transition the Organization must tailor its involvement\nto each country\u2019s resources and procedures, giving\npriority to programmes rather than to projects. That\napproach essentially boils down to the definition of key\nobjectives for each programme that will reflect the\npriorities of the national Government and the organization\nof assistance around the achievement of those goals,\nwhich can be accomplished by strengthening the role of\nthe Resident Coordinator system.\nArmenia appreciates the Secretary-General\u2019s Agenda\nfor Development as an important and necessary\ncomplement to \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". It is a\ncomprehensive and thoughtful reflection upon the various\ndimensions of development and the role of the United\nNations in that connection. At the recently held world\ngatherings on development there was broad agreement\nthat the Agenda should be sustained by an action-oriented\nframework and practical proposals aimed at resolving\nexisting imbalances in the various development areas.\nWe look forward to the further elaboration of the Agenda\n2\n\n\nfor Development by the Secretary-General through a\nnumber of concrete proposals with regard to the reform of\nboth the United Nations system and the intergovernmental\nconsultative machinery for development, as well as specific\nrecommendations for greater coordination within the United\nNations as a whole, including the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions and the proposed World Trade Organization.\nSuch an elaboration is needed if the Agenda is to lead to a\nglobal partnership for development.\nArmenia looks forward to participating in and\ncontributing to the World Summit for Social Development\nin Copenhagen. The World Summit, to be held in the\nUnited Nations fiftieth anniversary year, is a landmark\nevent and will build upon the commitments of a series of\nUnited Nations global gatherings, including the 1990 World\nSummit for Children, the 1992 United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro and the\n1994 International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment in Cairo, and it will be followed by the\nFourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.\nThese are all key events in the process of international\nconsensus-building.\nDevelopment and human rights are interrelated and\nmutually reinforcing. There can be no genuine long-term\ndevelopment without respect for the full spectrum of the\nrights of individuals. The Vienna Conference on Human\nRights held last year deepened the understanding of the\nsignificance of human rights for stability, freedom, peace,\nprogress and justice. The establishment of the post of\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights was\nvital to a more effective implementation of the principles of\nhuman rights. Member States must continue to work to\nincrease the effectiveness of existing United Nations\nhuman-rights mechanisms and to support the High\nCommissioner in the fulfilment of his mandate.\nArmenia considers self-determination in its multitude\nof manifestations to be an inalienable human right.\nArmenia\u2019s position on the Nagorny Karabakh conflict has\nbeen clear and consistent from the start. Armenia has no\nterritorial claims against Azerbaijan. The conflict is\nbetween the people of Nagorny Karabakh, who are striving\nfor self-determination, and the Azerbaijani Government,\nwhich is refusing to address the rights of the people of\nNagorny Karabakh. Armenia provides moral, diplomatic\nand humanitarian assistance to the people of Nagorny\nKarabakh, and it cannot accept a military solution which\ncan only mean the genocide or deportation of the\npopulation of Nagorny Karabakh.\nWhile the Nagorny Karabakh conflict has gone\nthrough periods of both intense fighting and relative calm\nsince I spoke here two years ago, there has never before\nbeen a period in the five-year history of the conflict when\na cease-fire has taken hold for so long. I am pleased to\ninform the Assembly today that the cease-fire of\n12 May 1994, which was mediated by the Russian\nFederation, is in general being maintained. But what is\nmore gratifying and encouraging is that, through direct\nand immediate contacts between the parties to the\nconflict, the de facto 12 May cease-fire was formalized\non 27 July 1994, and on 28 August 1994 the parties\nreaffirmed their commitment to the cease-fire until such\ntime as a political document has been signed.\nArmenia congratulates the main parties to the\nconflict for their commitment to maintain the cease-fire\nand to engage in direct dialogue. Armenia views this as\nan important confidence-building measure, as a major step\ntowards the consolidation of the cease-fire and as a sign\nof a strong commitment to the successful conclusion of\nthe current negotiations, which in turn will make possible\nthe solution of the problem at the Minsk Conference of\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nClearly, the conflict has entered a new phase, in\nwhich the parties have demonstrated their desire for\npeace.\nOur new challenge, and the priority for Armenia, is\nthe consolidation of the cease-fire and the establishment\nof peace. There is a historic opportunity today to end the\nconflict. But the cause of peace requires the active,\nunified support of the international community to\nconsolidate the cease-fire. The cumulative impact of the\ndistrust of the past five years, on the one hand, and the\nlack of international measures to support consolidation,\non the other hand, may increase the current uncertainty\nand threaten the fragile cease-fire.\nThere is no doubt that, beyond the cessation of\nhostilities, a lasting peace will mostly depend on the\nability of the main parties to the conflict and of the\ninternational community to develop innovative and\ninternationally approved mechanisms for its establishment\nand maintenance.\nThe primary concern for Armenia has been, and\nremains, the security of the people of Nagorny Karabakh.\nBoth Armenia and Nagorny Karabakh have repeatedly\nexpressed their readiness to comply with the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. A lasting peace can be\n3\n\n\nachieved only by ensuring the irreversibility of the peace\nprocess through the deployment of international security\nforces between Azerbaijan and Nagorny Karabakh until\nsuch time as a negotiated solution to the problem of\nNagorny Karabakh has been reached, with the full\nparticipation of Nagorny Karabakh at the CSCE Minsk\nConference.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is in\ndirect contradiction of the peacemaking efforts of the\nUnited Nations. Armenia considers that only the\nunconditional and indefinite extension of the Nuclear\nNon-Proliferation Treaty will ensure that the Treaty serves\nits purpose. It is encouraging that negotiations on a\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty have made important\nprogress over the past year, and we hope that a text\nsatisfactory to all can be agreed on soon.\nWe support the integration of multilateral disarmament\nwith United Nations activities relat to preventive diplomacy,\npeacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict\npeace-building.\nThe debate in the General Assembly Working Group\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council has\nbeen very useful. Virtually all States Members of the\nUnited Nations favour an increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council to reflect the radical changes in the world\nand the increase in the Organization\u2019s overall membership.\nHowever, an increase in membership should not diminish\nthe Council\u2019s efficiency. It is necessary here to note that\nthe Council has taken a number of constructive steps to\nimprove its transparency and its communication with\nnon-members. The Security Council should also be better\nable to respond to emerging threats and disputes before\nthey escalate into armed conflict. With improved\ncoordination of United Nations organizations and agencies\ndevoted to economic and social progress, the Economic and\nSocial Council could better assist the Security Council and\nadvise it of potential emergencies arising out of economic\nand social conditions. Therefore, Armenia fully supports\nthe call for restructuring of the Economic and Social\nCouncil and for the possible establishment of an economic\nsecurity council.\nImproving the administrative performance of the\nUnited Nations is another priority. Armenia welcomes the\ncurrent initiatives to streamline the Organization\u2019s\nadministrative and management structures and procedures\nto meet the demands now being made of the United\nNations. In particular, we supported the United States\ninitiative, and we are pleased that the General Assembly\nhas created the Office of Internal Oversight Services.\nLet me return for a moment to the theme I began\nwith. In this period of unprecedented change, many\nhardships - both expected and unforeseen - have arisen.\nThe present era, full of challenge and hope, gives us new\nfaith in the United Nations as the best and most\nappropriate forum for integrating all the interests of the\nvarious peoples of the world, which are too fragmented\ntoday. Universal harmony can be established only when\ndiscords are peacefully resolved and full cooperation\nbetween nations is achieved. The United Nations,\nstrengthened by the noble principles and objectives\nenshrined in its Charter, and facing new responsibilities\nand tasks, can and must lead the way to a better\norganized and more harmonious world.\nLet me conclude by wishing the General Assembly\nevery success in the demanding work it faces during this\nsession.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his unanimous\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\nninth session. This is both a tribute to his country\u2019s\ncontribution to the work of the Organization and an\nacknowledgement of his personal achievements in\nmultilateral diplomacy.\nAlmost half a century ago, the founding Member\nStates \u2014 and my country is one of them \u2014 set for the\nUnited Nations a task of paramount importance: to unite\nour strength to maintain international peace and security\nand to promote the economic and social development of all\nnations. It was necessary to create a mechanism for\ncoordinating states\u2019 efforts that could offer mutually\nacceptable solutions to international problems. Experience\nhas shown that the United Nations can play the part of such\na unique mechanism. Thanks to the great efforts of this\nprestigious international Organization, we have managed to\navoid military flare-ups and conflicts in many parts of the\nworld.\nThe world has changed dramatically. The political,\nideological and military confrontation of two social systems\nhas become a thing of the past. The ice of the cold war\nhas melted away completely. These changes brought to the\nworld hopes for a better future but, unfortunately, have\nfailed to solve all international problems. Tragedies whose\nunderlying cause is ethnic, religious and national enmity are\nbeing played out in Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nNagorny Karabakh, Abkhazia and Tajikistan. Unsettled\nbilateral relations between some States, including those\nrelating to the areas of human rights and protection of\nnational minorities, are also factors. And there is also\nterrorism, drug-trafficking and uncontrolled arms exports,\nincluding arms supplies into areas of conflict and hot spots\nin countries where bloodshed continues.\nUnder these circumstances, the role of the United\nNations as a universally recognized uniter of peoples\nbecomes much more significant. I am deeply convinced\nthat there will come a time when the collective reason of\nthe United Nations will have a much greater impact on\nthe processes taking place in the world. Our duty is to do\neverything we can to achieve that. Here in the United\nNations, we have to find the answers to many questions\nof concern to our countries.\nFor Belarus, this is especially important. For four\nyears now Belarus has been building a democratic,\nindependent and sovereign State. Our ideal is one of a\nfree citizen in a free country. After decades of\ntotalitarianism and sham collectivism, we are gradually\ngiving back to our people freedom, which the great\nhumanist Leonardo da Vinci called the main gift of\nnature.\nOne significant milestone in the life of Belarus was\nthe adoption of a new Constitution and \u2014 a historic first\nfor us \u2014 truly free and democratic presidential elections.\nHenceforth Belarus has a President elected by the people,\nAlaksandr Lukashenka, who has testified to his basic\ncommitment to progressive market reforms. Presidential\npower and the trust of the people guarantee that\ndemocratic reforms in our country will be irreversible.\nAnd today we also have regular elections to the Belarus\nParliament and for local authorities.\nIn foreign policy, the Republic of Belarus believes\nin the principles of sovereign equality of states, non-use\nof force or the threat of force, inviolability of borders,\npeaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference in\ninternal affairs and other universally recognized norms of\ninternational law. Our Constitution contains a provision\nthat Belarus should be a neutral State and its territory a\nnuclear-free zone. Our Republic is ready to cooperate\nwith the whole world and is seeking its rightful place in\nEurope in the regional structures of collective security and\neconomic cooperation.\nThe President and the Government of the Republic\nof Belarus believe that implementation of market reforms\nwill guarantee success in the democratic transformations\nin our society. We have embarked on this path firmly\nand irreversibly. The legal and organizational bases for\nmoving to the socially oriented market economy have\nnow been created in the Republic. Appropriate legislation\nhas been enacted. The ideas of having a state of law,\ndividing power into different branches and improving the\n23\n\n\nsystem of executive authority are now being put into\npractice.\nHowever, as in other countries of Central and Eastern\nEurope, transition to a market economy is very difficult.\nOur greatest difficulties occur in privatization, fighting\nmonopolies and stabilizing the monetary-financial system.\nMoreover, we inherited from the past a national economic\nstructure in which an excessively large share was given to\nthe military-industrial complex. Internal and external\nnational debt is also high, leading to budget deficits and\ninflation.\nThe situation is aggravated by the long-term\nconsequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear\npower plant. The adverse effect of the unprecedented\nradioactive contamination on people\u2019s health is not\ndecreasing. On the contrary, it increases as this tragic day\nrecedes. On top of all of this, we had a drought this year\nthe likes of which our country had not seen for at least 100\nyears. Modest estimates put the overall damage from the\ndrought at more than $300 million.\nUnder these difficult circumstances, the Republic has\nelaborated a programme of measures for pulling the\neconomy out of crisis. This programme will be the basis\nfor an agreement with the International Monetary Fund,\nwhich we plan to sign sometime next month. Firmly\nresolved to carry out wide-scale reforms, we intend to curb\ninflation, reduce the budget deficit and reduce the deficit in\nthe balance of payments. Full liberalization of trade and\nprices, speeding up privatization, should, we think, make it\npossible to lessen the crisis in our economy. Relying on\nour own forces, we nevertheless understand that without\nsupport from the outside we cannot carry out our reforms\nfully and in a reasonably short time.\nThe Republic of Belarus does not intend to withdraw\ninto its own problems. We are open to the concerns,\nanxieties and problems of the whole world, and we wish to\nmake our own contribution to the activities of the world\ncommunity of nations. Not just rhetorically, but in reality,\nBelarus was the first State in history voluntarily, without\nreservations or conditions, to renounce the possession of\nnuclear weapons. We support proposals on the indefinite\nand unconditional extension of the Nuclear\nNon-Proliferation Treaty.\nIn 1990, from this rostrum, the delegation of the\nRepublic of Belarus put forward the idea of establishing a\nnuclear-free belt from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Recent\nsteps taken by Belarus to withdraw nuclear weapons from\nits territory ahead of schedule make it possible to consider\na substantial part of this region as nuclear-free territory\nalready.\nBelarus supports the efforts by Members of the\nUnited Nations to speed up the negotiations on concluding\na comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. We believe such\na treaty could be signed as early as next year. We also\nsupport the proposal made here to elaborate a treaty on\nnuclear security and strategic stability. And, of course,\nwe advocate multilateral discussion of issues relating to\nregulating the international arms market and military\nequipment.\nI would like to stress that, despite our economic\ncrisis, our Republic is endeavouring to comply fully with\nour obligations to reduce nuclear and conventional\nweapons, even though this requires enormous additional\nexpenditures. In this connection, we feel we can expect\nthe international community to support our actions.\nThe noble quest of peoples for peace following the\nSecond World War led to the establishment of the United\nNations. The people of Belarus paid a great price in\ndelivering of world from fascism. The deadly fires of\nwar scorched our land and touched literally every family\nin it. The tragic price of freedom was the life of every\nfourth citizen in my country. Not until 25 years after the\nwar did our population once again attain its pre-war level.\nThus, the General Assembly\u2019s decision to make 1995 the\nUnited Nations year of tolerance and to proclaim it the\nworld year of commemoration of victims of the Second\nWorld War evokes a particularly profound response in\nBelarus. The Belarus delegation also considers that next\nyear would be the appropriate time to delete from the\nUnited Nations Charter the outdated concept of the\n\u201cenemy State\u201d.\nWe must use the forthcoming United Nations golden\njubilee to seek new ways of improving our performance\nin the changed world conditions. It is a truism that nature\ncannot tolerate rigidity and that everything in nature is\nconstantly changing. That law is certainly applicable to\nthe United Nations. If the Organization is to work\neffectively, its major organs must undergo profound\nreform.\nIn the application of the principle of representation\nof countries and regions in the Security Council, the\ninterests of all groups of States, including the Eastern\nEuropean Group, must be taken more fully into account.\nOf course, no Security Council reform should detract\n24\n\n\nfrom its role as the body responsible for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, so needed by all Member\nStates, and particularly the smaller States.\nThe Government of the Republic of Belarus has\nreacted positively to the proposal to increase the number of\npermanent members of the Security Council with the\naddition of members selected from among the countries that\nmake an exceptional contribution to achieving the purposes\nof the United Nations Charter.\nWe believe that greater account should be taken of\nexisting realities, including the complex problems\nconfronting countries whose economies are in transition and\nthe poorest countries, as well as of global problems of\npopulation, unemployment and environmental deterioration\nin all parts of the world.\nPolitical and economic dialogue between donor and\nrecipient countries must be given new content, going\nbeyond the traditional framework of relations between\nthem.\nThe Republic of Belarus hopes that the movement that\nbegan in the Philippines at the International Conference of\nNew or Restored Democracies and developed further at\nManagua will make it possible for countries in transition\nand developing countries to unite and to develop a\ncoordinated approach within the framework of the United\nNations to consolidate democracy and create a free market.\nCountries with economies in transition find themselves\nat different stages on their road to democracy and a market\neconomy, and for that reason the success of reforms\ndepends to a large extent on support from the international\ncommunity. Hence, the Belarus delegation would propose\nthat in 1996, under the auspices of the United Nations, an\ninternational conference on sustainable development in\ncountries with economies in transition should be held. Co-\norganizers of the conference might include the United\nNations Economic Commission for Europe, the European\nRegional Bureau of the United Nations Environment\nProgramme, the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment, the European Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment and other interested institutions.\nWe also believe that the granting of most-favoured-\nnation status, giving countries with economies in transition\nbroad access to international markets and integrating them\nfully into the world economy, would be in the interests of\nthe international community as a whole.\nThere is a growing need to broaden cooperation and\nstrengthen coordination between the United Nations, the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other\nregional organizations and arrangements. In this\nconnection we welcome the granting of observer status in\nthe General Assembly to the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States. Belarus advocates a clearer definition\nof areas of cooperation between the United Nations and\nthe CIS. Such cooperation could include joint efforts in\npeacemaking, disarmament, the environment, anti-\nterrorism, drug control and industrial conversion.\nWe believe that peace-keeping operations should not\nbe allowed to overshadow the crucial problems of socio-\neconomic development. Administrative and financial\nreform must become the most important aspect of United\nNations renewal. One way of achieving that would be\nthrough a more rational distribution of the financial\nburden between the United Nations and other international\ninstitutions, including regional organizations. Another\nway would be to reject existing approaches to calculating\nthe scale of assessments of Member States for the regular\nbudget of the United Nations and for peace-keeping\noperations. It would be fairer to assess the contributions\nof States primarily in light of their actual capacity to pay.\nIn conclusion, may I say that the general debate at\nthis session attests to the genuine interest of Member\nStates in achieving the full realization of the United\nNations potential as a truly effective international\norganization, as a centre for harmonizing and coordinating\nthe activities of the nations of the world. The Republic\nof Belarus fully shares that commitment and is ready to\ncooperate with all countries of the world community to\nachieve that goal, so that the end of this century may go\ndown in history as the time when the aspirations and\nhopes of all mankind were finally met.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me first of all to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I am\nconfident that under your skilful guidance the Assembly\nwill move forward in responding to the many complex\nissues on our agenda. You are equally assured of the full\nand unstinting support of Guyana in the discharge of your\nresponsibilities in the period ahead.\nGuyana was very honoured to have held the\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. On behalf of the Government and the people\nof Guyana, I would like to express our gratitude and\nappreciation for the confidence and support given to\nAmbassador Insanally during his tenure of office.\nI have every confidence too that the work of the\nOrganization will benefit much from the dynamic\nleadership of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali\nand his dedicated staff. They deserve our admiration and\nencouragement in the performance of their praiseworthy\nbut often difficult tasks.\nThe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly\ntakes place at a momentous time. There have been\nchanges, many of which have had a significant impact on\nglobal relations. World events now testify to the need for\nan Organization which is equipped to meet every\nchallenge posed to it.\nThe world is observing the United Nations and will\nnot fail to pass judgement on its activities. While much\nhas been accomplished, there are still considerable\nchallenges ahead of us. An overview of the United\nNations and its achievements has pointed to a greater\nawareness of its role in the world. Increasingly, the\nOrganization is being called upon to respond to and\nresolve critical situations confronting our global\ncommunity. Our responses, while effective in many\ncases, are still inadequate. It is now imperative that we\nmove beyond merely responding to individual crises to\naddress the fundamental causes of conflict and threats to\nglobal stability.\n\n\nIn the year ahead, Guyana will work with the\nAssembly to make the United Nations more responsive to\nthe altered situation we face in the post-cold-war era. We\nshall strive with others to make the Security Council more\nequitable and effective, so that it may better discharge the\nfunctions allocated to it under the Charter. As a priority,\nwe shall seek to promote the work of the Organization in\nthe formulation and implementation of an agenda for\ndevelopment, which should complement \u201cAn Agenda for\nPeace\u201d. Equally important, we will press for the\nrevitalization of this Assembly in order that, as the most\nrepresentative body of the United Nations, it may\nharmonize our efforts to promote global peace and\ndevelopment.\nEfforts to achieve peace and security in the face of\noverwhelming odds reflect the desire of Member States to\ndwell in harmony, however difficult such an aim may be.\nThey also reflect the increasing importance of peaceful\nnegotiations to settle conflicts and to solve economic, social\nand human problems.\nThe eruption of conflicts, primarily within States, and\nthe ever-present threat of eruption in other States has\nstymied the hope of a new international order that would\naddress these issues and hopefully proffer solutions. In this\ncontext I wish to refer to the proposals of President Cheddi\nJagan on a new global humanitarian order, in response to\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/106 of 16 December 1992.\nIn his work, President Jagan has stressed the\ndebilitating effects of poverty and hunger and the urgent\nneed for concerted action to alleviate their effects. But\napart from these classic humanitarian concerns, he has\nsought to broaden the tableau to include the entire spectrum\nof human development and related issues. Thus, he\npromotes the principles of international interdependence and\ncooperation which will recognize the primacy of human\ndevelopment as a sine qua non for a peaceful and orderly\nexistence.\nHe has emphasized the need for good governance and\npopular participation in decision-making as the cornerstone\nfor a new type of development, which will take into\nconsideration the satisfaction of basic human needs in\nhealth, education, housing and the right to productive\nemployment for all.\nMy Government has recognized that the question of\nbasic human needs cannot be ignored. It is a prerequisite\nfor good order and stability, which would in turn produce\na stable political environment. Governments cannot afford\nto allow the growth of social discontent that is\nengendered by the vicious circle of debt, poverty and\neconomic deprivation.\nThere are many countries, not least my own, which\nsuffer, not from open and violent conflict, but from the\nresidue of a crushing external debt and the debilitating\neffects of an ongoing structural adjustment programme.\nIn spite of all this, my Government is committed to\nproviding for its people the basic necessities of health,\nhousing, education and an economic and a social\nenvironment for both men and women to achieve their\nfull potential. Some of the factors that inhibit advances\ntowards a new economic and social order are attributed to\nthe prevailing inequitable terms of trade and the persistent\nreduction in commodity earnings of exporters of primary\nproducts.\nHowever, social and economic problems are now not\nconfined to developing countries. In this era of greater\ninterdependence among nations and increasing\nglobalization, issues and problems of economic growth\nand development, poverty, population growth and\nenvironmental destruction have become global. It is\ntherefore necessary to first of all address the root causes\nof these problems before any tangible and lasting\nsolutions are achieved.\nPresident Jagan\u2019s proposals for a New Global\nHumanitarian Order have therefore taken into account the\nglobalization of these pressing issues. His proposals\ndirectly relate to the work of the General Assembly on\n\u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d; the Rio de Janeiro\nConference of 1992; the Conference of Small Island\nDeveloping States; the recently concluded World\nConference on Population and Development; the\nforthcoming World Summit on Social Development; and\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women. It is therefore\nmy Government\u2019s fervent hope that this forty-ninth\nsession will result in positive measures being taken to\naddress the economic, social and humanitarian problems\nprevailing in the world today. We have shown the\ncapacity to resolve supposedly intractable problems. I\nmay refer here to the end of the iniquitous system of\napartheid, when we all felt a sense of pride and\naccomplishment at the readmission of South Africa to the\nUnited Nations on 23 June 1994.\nI may also refer to the Middle East where we have\nseen a marvellous example of what can be achieved\nthrough patient diplomacy and dialogue, by the recent\nsigning of a Peace Accord between Israel and Jordan.\n2\n\n\nThe earlier signature of the Declaration of Principles,\ntogether with the current self-rule in Gaza, point to the\nstatesmanship of the leaders of Israel, the Palestinian people\nand the other parties to a conflict which has dragged on for\nfar too long.\nWe have seen the convening of a World Conference\non Human Rights and the appointment of a High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, events which point to the\nincreasing concern of the United Nations for the protection\nof human rights and for the improvement of the economic\nand social conditions of mankind.\nIn my own region, we see the possibility of the\nrestoration of democracy in Haiti. The multinational\noperation now under way, of which Guyana is a part, offers\nthe hope that, notwithstanding its inherent difficulties, the\nillegal government will finally abandon power. Guyana is\npledged to participate in the process leading to the prompt\nreturn of peace and stability in Haiti. The international\ncommunity must now work together to assist in the\nrebuilding of that country\u2019s institutions, as well as its\neconomy, as a safeguard to its future welfare.\nWe are happy that the United States and Cuba were\nable to meet here in New York and come to a positive\nagreement on the migration issue. We hope that the\nmaturity displayed in those negotiations will spill over to a\ncorrelative issue, the economic embargo, and that Cuba will\nbe allowed to pursue its economic rehabilitation for the\nbenefit of its people.\nA peaceful resolution of the Cyprus problem, which\nhas seemed to be elusive, continues to be our great desire.\nGuyana remains hopeful that the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the goodwill of the parties involved will lead\nto a satisfactory solution.\nI am convinced that this Organisation can and will\nachieve greater success for a better world. I would\ntherefore urge serious consideration of the \u201cNew Global\nHumanitarian Order\u201d, which is aimed at fusing various\naspects of past and future undertakings by this Assembly.\nThis new order will effectively bridge the gap between\nrhetoric and implementation, and will succeed in dealing\ndirectly with the common problems which face us all.\nAs we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, I appeal to those present here today to reflect on\nthe spirit of solidarity which inspired the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. Let us therefore work together to enhance\nthe role of this august body. Let us also, through mutual\nrespect and tolerance, work to promote better relations\nbetween all nations and peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin my\naddress by offering my congratulations to Mr. Amara\nEssy on the assumption of his new office. I should also\nlike to express my respect for the excellent diplomatic\nskills demonstrated by his predecessor, Ambassador\nInsanally, during a period of momentous change. I am\nalso pleased to convey my sincere congratulations to the\nRepublic of South Africa, which, having renounced\napartheid, was reinstated as a full Member of the United\nNations at the previous session of the General Assembly.\nThe United Nations is now expected to play a\ngreater role than ever before. Recalling the blessings\nbestowed upon Japan by the international community at\nthe time of its admission into this Organization, I intend\nto conduct a proactive foreign policy that will enable\nJapan to contribute, on a level commensurate with its\npolitical and economic status, to the future well-being of\nhumankind.\nAt the outset, I should like to discuss Japan\u2019s basic\nphilosophy regarding its international contributions. Japan\nis engaged in economic assistance and various other\nefforts in order to eradicate poverty and achieve economic\ndevelopment, as well as to prevent conflicts and remove\ndestabilizing factors.\nReflecting with remorse upon the Second World\nWar, Japan has never wavered from its commitment to\ncontribute to world peace and prosperity. Japan does not,\nnor will it, resort to the use of force, prohibited by its\nConstitution. Japan will remain resolutely a nation of\npeace. Neither possessing nuclear arms nor exporting\nweapons, Japan continues to be actively engaged in\ndisarmament and non-proliferation efforts. In accordance\nwith what I have just stated, Japan has dispatched\nmembers of its Self-Defence Forces, as well as civilian\npersonnel, to several countries, including Cambodia and\nMozambique, in response to requests by the United\nNations. Japan intends to continue to cooperate actively\nin such United Nations peace-keeping operations.\n12\n\n\nAt the same time, Japan is determined to enhance its\ncontributions to efforts on global issues in economic and\nsocial areas. These issues, whose importance is now\nwidely recognized, include development, the environment,\nhuman rights, refugees, population, AIDS and narcotics.\nToday, the first area on which the United Nations\nshould focus its efforts is the maintenance of international\npeace and security; the second is the resolution of economic\nand social problems. And if it is to carry out these two\nvery important tasks effectively, it must undertake a third:\nthe promotion of United Nations reform. I should like on\nthis occasion to outline my views as to the kind of\ncontributions Japan wishes to make in these areas.\nIn the maintenance of international peace and security,\nwhich is the first area of concern to the United Nations,\nJapan places great emphasis on disarmament and\nnon-proliferation, diplomatic efforts for the resolution of\nconflicts, and peace-keeping operations.\nAs the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack,\nand adhering firmly to its three non-nuclear principles,\nJapan strives to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating all\nnuclear weapons. Toward this end, it urges all\nnuclear-weapon States to redouble their efforts to reduce\ntheir nuclear arsenals. Further, Japan supports the\nindefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty,\nand calls on all States that have not yet acceded to the\nTreaty to do so at the earliest opportunity.\nAt the same time, I would urge, in particular, all\nnuclear-weapon States to engage more actively in the\nnegotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty and to\nstrive to bring them to an early and successful conclusion.\nI wish to propose that, once the negotiations on the treaty\nare concluded, a ceremony for its signing by Heads of State\nor Government be held in Japan, for example in the city of\nHiroshima, and that it be made a new starting-point for the\nelimination of nuclear weapons once and for all.\nIn this connection, Japan strongly calls upon North\nKorea to engage seriously in efforts to resolve the issue of\nits development of nuclear weapons through international\ndialogue, including its talks with the United States.\nThe unfettered transfer and excessive accumulation of\nconventional weapons is another destabilizing factor in\nmany regions of the world today. In the civil wars we have\nwitnessed in certain regions of Africa and elsewhere, for\nexample, it has resulted in the escalation of combat and in\nenormous loss of life. It is my belief that the international\ncommunity must seriously consider concrete measures to\nsolve this problem.\nIn this regard, the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms, designed to improve the transparency\nof arms transfers, has grown increasingly important as an\neffective measure for building confidence at the global\nlevel. More than 80 countries participate in the Register\nat present, and we strongly hope that many more will\njoin. Japan will work together with other Member States\nto amplify and strengthen the Register by, for example,\nalso including arms stockpiles in it.\nThe prevention and settlement of regional conflicts\nrequires a comprehensive approach which combines\ndiplomatic efforts, United Nations peace-keeping\noperations, humanitarian aid, assistance for building social\ninstitutions, and aid for peace-building, such as\nrehabilitation and reconstruction assistance.\nConvinced of the importance of taking measures\nbefore conflicts become intractable, I am a strong\nadvocate of the vigorous promotion of preventive\ndiplomacy. From this viewpoint, I believe we should, in\ncooperation with the countries concerned, actively\nconsider extending assistance for the stabilization of\nsocial and political conditions in regions or countries\nwhere there are elements of instability.\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations have\nproved successful in Cambodia and many other regions,\nand they are expected to play an increasingly important\nrole. Further improvement of the effectiveness of\npeace-keeping operations will require closer examination\nof, inter alia, their mandates, duration, scale of activities\nand cost, as well as full consideration of the safety of\npersonnel. Strengthening the financial base of United\nNations peace-keeping operations is an urgent task. It is\nnecessary, in particular, that Member States that are in\narrears pay their assessed contributions. It is also\nimperative that ways be sought to put peace-keeping\noperations on a sounder financial basis.\nJapan, for its part, will enhance its support for\ndemocratization with a view to helping peace take root\nafter the fighting has ceased. It places particular\nimportance on assisting efforts to hold free and fair\nelections.\nResponding to the unspeakably tragic situation of the\nRwandan refugees, Japan has provided both financial\nassistance and material support through the United\n13\n\n\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United\nNations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. The Government\nof Japan has decided to dispatch more than 400 members\nof its self-defence forces to the region to provide assistance\nin such areas as medical treatment, water supply and air\ntransport. Some of these activities have already\ncommenced. Working together with the international\ncommunity - particularly with the countries of Africa -\nJapan is determined to continue its efforts toward a solution\nof the Rwandan issue.\nWith regard to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,\nJapan continues to support the efforts of the international\ncommunity to restore peace. It calls upon all the disputing\nparties concerned to accept the peace plan for Bosnia and\nHerzegovina devised by the Contact Group and to cooperate\nwith the activities of the United Nations there.\nThe second task of the United Nations is the solution\nof problems in economic and social areas, including those\nregarding development, the environment and human rights.\nWith the changing international circumstances, the\nissue of development is now re-emerging as a global\nconcern; a new strategy for development is thus called for.\nIt is from this viewpoint that Japan has been advocating a\ndevelopment strategy that entails a comprehensive\napproach, combining assistance, trade, investment, and the\ntransfer of technology, as well as a differentiated approach,\ntailored to the needs of developing countries according to\ntheir respective stages of development.\nThe International Conference on African Development,\nheld in Tokyo last year, proved to be a worthwhile forum\nfor the discussion of how such a development strategy\nmight be realized. In an effort to build upon the results of\nthat Conference, an Asia-Africa seminar will be convened\nin Indonesia this December.\nIn today\u2019s world, South-South cooperation, where\nmore advanced developing countries share their experience\nand technology with other developing countries, is of\nincreasing significance. Japan intends to suggest concrete\nplans for the promotion of South-South cooperation around\nthe globe.\nMoreover, as the world\u2019s largest donor country, Japan\ncontinues its efforts to expand its official development\nassistance. In extending such assistance, it gives full\nconsideration to such factors as trends in the recipient\ncountry\u2019s military expenditures and in its development and\nproduction of weapons of mass destruction, as well as its\nefforts to promote democracy and to introduce a\nmarket-oriented economy.\nIt is my hope that meaningful discussions of an\nAgenda for Development will take place at the current\nsession of the General Assembly and that the points I\nhave just mentioned will be taken into account.\nAt this time of increasing global interdependence, all\nhumankind is confronted with new challenges, such as\nenvironmental and population problems, which can be\novercome only through close cooperative efforts between\nindustrialized and developing countries.\nJapan, for its part, is actively engaged in\nenvironmental- protection efforts. For example, it is\nworking to strengthen the international framework for\nsuch efforts, to transfer relevant technologies to\ndeveloping countries, and to expand and strengthen its\nofficial development assistance in environmental areas.\nWith regard to population and AIDS, in February of this\nyear Japan launched its Global Issues Initiative, under\nwhich it is greatly expanding assistance to developing\ncountries to address these problems. At the International\nConference on Population and Development, recently\nconvened in Cairo, I stressed the importance of finding a\nsolution to issues relating to population.\nJapan is profoundly aware that human-resources\ndevelopment and the further advancement of the status of\nwomen, achieved through international cooperation, have\nimportant implications for social stability. We therefore\neagerly anticipate the successful outcome of the World\nSummit for Social Development and the Fourth World\nConference on Women, which will be convened next\nyear. By the same token, Japan actively participates in\nthe Women-in-Development programmes and other social-\ndevelopment activities administered by the various United\nNations agencies.\nEconomic development and human rights may be\nlikened to the front and rear wheels of a vehicle: they\nmust work in tandem to advance the development of\ndemocratic societies. In order to encourage respect for\nhuman rights as universal values and to improve\neffectively the human rights situation in every country, it\nis important to make continuous efforts to establish legal\nsystems and to raise awareness of human rights, in\naddition to promoting political, economic and social\nstability. Toward this end, Japan will cooperate in every\nway possible to assist the work of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\n14\n\n\nIf it is to carry out effectively its two major tasks -\nmaintaining international peace and security and resolving\neconomic and social problems - the United Nations must\nmake a serious effort to adapt to the new era by\nundertaking structural reform as well as administrative and\nbudgetary reform.\nAs the United Nations seeks to strengthen its activities\nthrough reform, the restructuring of the Security Council is\nof particular importance. Today the activities of the\nSecurity Council span a wide range of issues relating to\nworld peace and stability. While the membership of the\nUnited Nations has grown from 51 countries in 1945 to 184\ncountries at the present time, the composition of the\nCouncil, which was intended to reflect the world situation\nas it existed when the United Nations was established, has\nremained virtually unchanged. In the interim, we have\nwitnessed the emergence of countries that are capable of\nshouldering greater international responsibilities. It is\ntherefore necessary to restructure and strengthen the\nSecurity Council, while ensuring its efficiency, so that it\nmay reflect world realities.\nIn keeping with Japan\u2019s basic philosophy regarding\ninternational contributions, which I outlined earlier, I wish\nto state that Japan is prepared, with the endorsement of\nmany countries, to discharge its responsibilities as a\npermanent member of the Security Council. It is my hope\nthat United Nations Member States will accelerate the\ndeliberations on this subject during the current session and\nthat an agreement will be reached on a reform plan in time\nfor the commemorative fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly next year.\nThe Security Council is not the only organ requiring\nreform. The General Assembly, in which 184 States\nparticipate, also needs to be reinvigorated, and it must\ncoordinate its activities more closely with those of other\nUnited Nations agencies. Recently, efforts have begun to\nfine-tune United Nations activities in economic and social\nfields, such as development, the environment and human\nrights, and to establish clear priorities among them. In\naddressing these issues, which have profound implications\nfor the future of humankind, it is necessary to continue to\nwork towards the functional and organizational\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council. The\nTrusteeship Council, by contrast, has completed its historic\nmission, and it is my view that it would be appropriate, in\nthe context of the reform of the United Nations as a whole,\nto consider its abolishment. Building on the creation of the\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services at the last session of\nthe General Assembly, we must redouble our efforts to\npromote administrative and budgetary reform.\nThe passage of a half century since the signing of\nthe United Nations Charter has rendered the so-called\n\\\"former enemy clauses\\\" meaningless. Japan continues to\nseek their deletion from the text of the Charter.\nI have focused my remarks today on the three\nchallenges facing the United Nations: the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, the resolution of\neconomic and social issues and the need for the reform of\nthe Organization. If the United Nations pursues reform\nto meet the changing needs of the times and supports and\nexpands cooperation among its Member States, I have\nevery confidence that it will enhance its legitimacy as a\nuniversal organization and develop a capacity to respond\nto new challenges even more effectively.\nIn closing, I would like to call upon all Member\nStates to cooperate to ensure that this will be remembered\nas the historic session of the General Assembly that\nushered in a new era for the United Nations.\n"

We wish to assure\nyou that the Rwandese delegation will spare no effort to\nmake its modest contribution to the success of your task.\nWe also wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity\nto pay a heartfelt tribute to your predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for his\ncompetence, wisdom and diligence in guiding the work of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nIn addition, we would like to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for\nhis tireless efforts to strengthen the role of the United\nNations as an instrument for the promotion of peace and\nsolidarity among peoples.\nFinally, we warmly welcome the Republic of South\nAfrica as a new Member of the vast family of the United\nNations. That country has honoured democratic ideals by\nabolishing the odious system of apartheid. To be sure,\nthe arrival of a united, democratic and non-racial South\nAfrica by means of free and democratic elections deserves\nto be hailed from the rostrum of this Assembly.\nThis forum of nations gives us a timely opportunity\nto expound on the problem of Rwanda, which has been in\nthe news day in and day out.\nOne cannot talk about the Rwanda problem without\nmentioning the role the United Nations has played and\ncontinues to play in the history of our country. The\nhistory of our links is well known. It will be recalled that\njust after the beginning of this century Rwanda was\nplaced under the mandate system and, later, under the\ntrusteeship system, which then led to its independence.\nThis history, as has been witnessed by the\ninternational community, is riddled with unfortunate\nevents, the most recent of which is the genocide Rwanda\nhas just experienced. This genocide, which rivals the\nNazi holocaust of the 1940s, is somewhat paradoxical\nbecause since the end of the Second World War the\ninternational community has tried to build a civilization\non the foundations of respect for the fundamental rights\nof human beings.\nWhile the international community was pooling its\nefforts to put an end to racism and racial discrimination,\nparticularly apartheid in South Africa - whose\nparticipation in the forty-ninth session is a felicitous turn\nof events - at the same time an ideology akin to apartheid\nwas evolving in our country. That ideology, which was\npublicly professed by the public authorities - more\n3\n\n\nprecisely, by the National Revolutionary Movement for\nDevelopment (MRND) and the Coalition for the Defence of\nthe Republic (CDR) parties of the late President\nHabyarimana - cleared the way for genocide. Plans for\nextermination were being openly prepared for a long time,\nwith no trepidation whatsoever, since the power structure\nhad long before institutionalized the violation of\nfundamental human rights. This is why armed opposition,\nin the form of the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF),\nconfronted the regime beginning in 1990. Some opposition\nparties also emerged in 1991, thanks to the pressure exerted\nby the RPF.\nUnder the aegis of the Organization of African Unity,\nthe countries of the subregion initiated a peace process,\nwhich the United Nations, together with a number of\nWestern countries, later joined. We take this opportunity\nto thank all for their tireless efforts to ensure that the\nArusha negotiations would succeed.\nFor more than a year the Rwandese negotiated the\nArusha Peace Agreement, the principal conclusions of\nwhich addressed the establishment of a State of law in\nRwanda, respect for human rights, power-sharing, the\nestablishment without discrimination of a national army, the\nconstruction of a society based on respect for democratic\nprinciples and on national reconciliation, and the return of\nrefugees banished from their country for more than 35\nyears.\nThe international community witnessed the\nintransigence of the MRND-CDR regime, which, describing\nthe Agreement as a mere scrap of paper, hatched a plan for\nextermination, now recognized by the whole world as\ngenocide. The international cameras trained on this\nbarbaric crime revealed moments of rare cruelty. The\nmilitia, trained by the MRND and the CDR and supported\nby the presidential guard and by other sectors of the army,\nslit the throats of women, elderly people, men and children.\nThe Rwandese countryside was strewn with corpses. Our\nrivers swept thousands of dead bodies downstream.\nChurches and schools became veritable slaughterhouses,\nand even now they smell of human flesh, the flesh of\nthousands of innocent people who had hoped to find refuge\nthere. Piled into common graves, the victims of April\u2019s\nmadness number thousands upon thousands.\nThe killing in our country was intended to disintegrate\nthe Rwandese people, and it succeeded. Now we must\nmake a fresh start in rebuilding the Rwandese nation. We\nmust ensure that the various sectors of the population can\ncoexist. We must give them a common hope and a\ncommon destiny, which, after all that has happened, has\nbecome a difficult yet indispensable task.\nWe have already requested the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees to help our\nGovernment in the effort to teach the Rwandese new\nvalues based on respect for fundamental human rights.\nThere would have been no genocide if the MRND-\nCDR system had abided by the spirit of Arusha. But they\ncould not embrace the spirit of Arusha because those\nRwandese Nazis were proponents of the final solution:\nextermination. They flouted morality, common sense, the\nvalues everyone in this Assembly believes in and, above\nall, the prescriptions of Arusha. Yet some who are\ninsensitive to our suffering have asked that those Nazi\nparties still be allowed to hold power.\nNever in history has such a scandalous privilege\nbeen sought for the organized perpetrators of similar cases\nof genocide. Such requests make light of our dignity as\nhuman beings. We cannot agree to these requests, which\nfly in the face of the spirit and the letter of the principles\nunderlying this institution - that is, fundamental human\nrights.\nBy discouraging impulses towards revenge and in\nanticipation of justice that will be clear to everyone and\nthat is supported by the international community, our\nGovernment has been able to contain a situation marked -\nunderstandably after such tragedy - by tensions and\nrancour. Contrary to disparaging allegations that are\ncompletely unfounded, our Government is not showing\nweakness; it is not just sitting on its hands whenever there\nis an infraction of the law.\nOur Government continues to cooperate closely with\nthe United Nations Force, and to facilitate its work. With\nscanty means, our Government has undertaken to rebuild\na country that has been socially splintered and morally\nand physically ravaged. The humanitarian task of the\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda\n(UNAMIR) continues to be an indispensable asset in our\nefforts at rehabilitation.\nThis unspeakable barbarism, this genocide was\ncarried out before the very eyes of the international\ncommunity. We are grateful to those countries that\ngenerously put their troops at the disposal of UNAMIR,\nas well as to the African contingents of the Group of\nneutral military observers. We would express our sincere\nthanks to them for the spirit in which they made their\n4\n\n\ncontribution. Rather than presiding over peace and\nharmony among the Rwandese, the troops, misled by the\nauthors of the apocalypse - the Rwandese authorities at the\ntime - were, alas, forced to serve as witnesses to the\ncarnage. We regret that their mandate prevented them from\nacting effectively at the moment of the tragedy. Based on\nthis experience, we encourage the United Nations to furnish\nthe international tribunal to be created in Rwanda with the\nmeans to function as it should, in order to spare us further\ndisappointments and tragedies.\nIn accordance with Rwanda\u2019s request, and following\nMr. Degnisegui\u2019s report, as well as that of the Commission\nof Experts established by Security Council resolution 935\n(1994), of 1 July 1994, it is absolutely urgent that this\ninternational tribunal be established. It will enable us to\nprosecute in a completely open setting those responsible for\nthe genocide. Since most of the criminals have found\nrefuge in various corners of the world, what we seek is a\ntool of justice that knows no borders. Moreover, the very\nnature of the events - considered to be crimes against\nhumanity - warrants the international community\u2019s joining\nforces to prevent their reoccurrence.\nThat is why we continue to urge the adoption of a\nSecurity Council resolution that would facilitate the arrest\nand trial of those responsible for the genocide who are now\nin refugee camps outside our borders. We would remind\nthe Assembly that most of these camps are primarily\nmilitary camps where troops and militia, still in possession\nof heavy and light weapons, hold hundreds of thousands of\npersons hostage. This resolution should be based on\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter and should\ninclude a request to, an authorization for, States Members\nof the United Nations to detain individuals on their territory\nwho are suspected, on solid grounds, of having participated\nin acts of genocide, and authorization for them to do so.\nThe construction of a new society based on social\njustice and respect for fundamental human rights will be\npossible only if those responsible for the Rwandese tragedy\nare prosecuted. It is now six months since the first crimes\nwere committed, and action must be initiated. The delay in\nstarting trials causes understandable frustration on the part\nof victims who are already losing hope that there can be a\njust society and who tend to view the relative impunity of\nthe criminals as indicating approval of their crimes.\nAnother thorny problem which faces our country and\nupon which we would like to shed some light is that of\nrefugees.\nThe Rwandese refugees can be classified into two\ncategories: the former refugees to whom the dictatorial\npower had refused to grant the right to return to their\nhomeland, and the more recent ones who fled Rwanda\nfollowing the events to which I have already referred. It\nis our Government\u2019s policy to encourage all refugees,\nwithout distinction, to return to their country.\nIn this respect, we are addressing countless appeals\nto our citizens outside our borders to rejoin us and help\nus build a new Rwanda. Thousands of them have already\nreturned to their homeland, but many others remain\nabroad. We are also calling upon the soldiers to come\nback and, if they still desire to do so - to continue their\ncareers in the Rwandese army. For Rwanda is their\ncountry; it belongs equally, and unquestionably, to all of\nits daughters and all its sons, with its limitations and its\nhistory, including this most recent tragedy which we must\nall bear.\nOur Government has made the choice to act with\ntransparency. The unrestricted deployment of UNAMIR\nas well as other human rights observers should reassure\nthe world, and especially the refugees, of our\nGovernment\u2019s determination to respect the state of law.\nWe urge the United Nations to contribute to\neliminating all the obstacles to the return of refugees, and\nespecially to stop the violence in the camps against, in\nparticular, those who wish to return home, and to break\nthe stranglehold exercised by the former army\u2019s militia\nand other perpetrators of genocide on the rest of the\npeople. This is why we beseech the international\ncommunity to assist us in surmounting all the challenges\nentailed by the return of the refugees.\nConcrete steps have been taken, but much remains\nto be done if the world is to be completely rid of these\nweapons which in the past caused serious tensions in\nvarious parts of the world that degenerated into armed\nconflicts.\nEven though the relaxation of East-West tensions has\ncontributed greatly to the resolution of certain conflicts,\nparticularly in Indo-China, Latin America and the Middle\nEast, elsewhere - in the former Yugoslavia and some\nAfrican countries - the fires regrettably continue to burn.\nRwanda fully supports the international community\u2019s\nefforts to ensure compliance with commitments related to\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes and the non-\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of\n5\n\n\nmass destruction. Our country is a party to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and we reiterate\nour full dedication to the international community\u2019s goals\nwith regard to disarmament and arms control.\nThe attainment of these goals - eliminating the risk of\nwar, limiting destruction in case of war, stopping war at an\nearly stage, strengthening international security in order to\nensure economic prosperity, channelling the funds freed as\na result of disarmament towards the developing countries -\nwill allow all nations to thrive.\nAlthough genuine progress has been made in the area\nof disarmament, the new world order remains compromised\nby the constantly growing gap between the poorer and\nricher countries.\nIn the light of the two United Nations publications on\nthe world economic and social situation for the years 1993\nand 1994, current economic trends in the world point to\ngloomy forecasts in the short and medium term, particularly\nfor many third-world countries.\nThe Rwandese delegation hopes that this forty-ninth\nsession will reaffirm the importance and the still current\nvalidity of the Declaration on International Economic\nCooperation, in particular the Revitalization of Economic\nGrowth and of Development of the Developing Countries.\nWe solemnly invite the forty-ninth session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly to address the\nfundamental right to development, as stated in the Vienna\nDeclaration and adopted by the World Conference on\nHuman Rights, as well as the link between peace and\ndevelopment. Respect for human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms and development are interdependent and mutually\nreinforcing. Rwanda and Africa as a whole look to the\npromise of the establishment of the United Nations agenda\nfor development and of the speedy implementation of the\namendments proposed to the plan of action - amendments\nwhich will undoubtedly enable us to restore the economies\nof our countries.\nIt is imperative for the United Nations - whose main\nobjective remains the promotion of peace, security and\ndevelopment - to devote itself to activities in keeping with\nthe attainment of peace, security and development.\nIn the fifty years since the signing of the San\nFrancisco Charter, the world has undergone many changes.\nNew Powers have arisen, the geopolitical map has shifted,\nAfrica and other third-world countries have emancipated\nthemselves, the cold war has ended - hence we must\nreassess our Organization to ensure that it can meet the\nnew challenges.\nIt is in this context that Rwanda is concerned with\nthe demands of the new world geopolitical situation, as\nwell as with the new role assigned to the United Nations\nto contribute to the advent of the new world order.\nIn this connection, particular attention must be paid\nto the current restructuring of the United Nations system,\nparticularly of the Security Council.\nWith regard to this very important organ of the\nUnited Nations system, the Rwandese delegation\nconsiders that membership, both permanent and non-\npermanent, should be expanded, with scrupulous attention\nto equitable geographic representation and bearing in\nmind the desire to maintain efficiency.\nSimilarly, the current restructuring of the United\nNations system should allow small States to enjoy greater\nsecurity and to be able to occupy a seat on the Security\nCouncil without difficulty.\nOne hopes that the new configuration of the Security\nCouncil will reflect the principle of equality among all\nMember States, and that this reform will respect the rules\nof democracy and transparency.\n(spoke in English)\nMay I conclude by stating before the community of\nnations that members represent that the task we have set\nourselves is enormous, but the will and determination of\nthe Rwandese people to build a new society is\nunflinching.\nTo all those Rwandese who became victims of the\nmachine of genocide and recent massacres, we share your\ndeep wounds and reiterate our determination to bring the\nculprits to justice. To those Rwandese who were blindly\nmanipulated to join the bankrupt politics of division and\nsuppression, we call upon you to come back to your\nsenses and join us in building a new society based on\ntolerance and reconciliation.\nTo the international community, I pledge our resolve\nto ensure that never again shall Rwanda be a terrain on\nwhich is sown politics of denial of basic human rights to\nany of its citizens. Its role in helping us to pick up the\npieces of the completely shattered fabric of our society\n6\n\n\nneed not be emphasized. We share this moral duty, it\nbeing understood that the major part of the burden by far\nrests on the Rwandese people themselves.\n"
